CBS PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS TO PROMOTE ITS MINISERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To publicize ``Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' a miniseries about a
fictional band's rise in the early days of rock 'n' roll, CBS is
beginning a promotional effort worthy of a worldwide arena tour.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part, four-hour movie, which will be shown at 9 p.m. on
Sunday and Wednesday, features stars like B.B. King, Blink 182 and
Terrence Trent D'Arby as performers from that era. Also in the cast
are James Coburn, Kathy Baker, Dana Delaney and Gerald McRaney.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional campaign, CBS's largest ever, coincides with the
important November sweeps, which began Thursday. CBS has involved
practically its entire television family as well as the resources
of its numerous radio stations for extensive promotions.
</P>
<P>
   And in hopes of further generating awareness, CBS has forged
alliances with other marketers to sponsor events like a sweepstakes
and to sell a soundtrack tied to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the campaign underscores the intensifying
concern among marketers that as consumer interest wanes in
traditional media like television and print, they must constantly
devise new ways to deliver their messages. As a result, movie
tie-ins and other promotions have become marketing staples for such
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to get the most people we can to watch our
programming,'' said George Schweitzer, executive vice president for
marketing at CBS Television in New York. CBS is hoping the show
generates blockbuster ratings and maybe even brings in millions of
younger viewers, which the network has had trouble reaching
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for the campaign, which was created in-house, was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from typical television commercials and print and outdoor
ads spotlighting ``Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' the stars of CBS
programs and the disc jockeys of CBS-owned oldies radio stations
like WCBS-FM in New York have been deployed to help promote the
miniseries. Earlier this week, the TV stars began appearing in
promotional spots reflecting on rock 'n' roll and how it has
influenced their lives. In one spot, Kevin James, the star of the
CBS show ``King of Queens,'' talks about how he was influenced by
Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Another spot features Brad Garrett, from ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' selecting Little Richard as his favorite rock star. An
announcer at the end of the spots refers to the miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest components of the campaign is playing off the
music connection by marketing a compact disc tied to the movie. The
concept of a music-oriented miniseries accompanied by a CD has
become a favored marketing tool of networks, especially since last
season, when NBC, which is owned by General Electric, scored big in
both ratings and record sales with two music-oriented miniseries,
``The Temptations'' and ``The '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just tailor-made for this kind of tie-in,'' Schweitzer
said. The CD sales have become secondary profit centers for the
networks. In fact, NBC has other music-oriented miniseries in
development, including a follow-up to ``The '60s,'' naturally
called ``The '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   To introduce the CD, CBS teamed with Seagram's MCA Records to
create the movie soundtrack featuring songs from artists including
Dicky Barrett, B.B. King and the Platters. The CD will be sold at
retailers nationwide and advertised on the CBS network and
CBS-owned radio stations when the miniseries begins. Commercials
will be broadcast after each night of the show, and a Web site has
been set up to help generate sales.
</P>
<P>
   Anne O'Grady, senior vice president for marketing and events at
CBS, who was instrumental in creating the promotions, said, ``We
have this wonderful property that kind of screams out to all these
different areas because of the music connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the music factor will be viewing parties for the
movie premiere at Hard Rock Cafes in 12 cities including Atlanta,
Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York. The parties will be held
by local disc jockeys from CBS radio stations, which will
distribute tickets in each market through trivia contests.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung, which is the official sponsor of the miniseries, will
provide high-definition television sets for each party in addition
to offering sneak previews of the miniseries shown on its
televisions at participating dealers before its broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Three other promotions include a dance contest held Friday on
``The Early Show'' on CBS, the awarding of a trip to Hard Rock Live
in Orlando, Fla., on ``The Howard Stern Show'' and a sweepstakes
contest to select the ultimate rock band. Voters can cast their
ballots at the Hard Rock restaurants and the Web site within
CBS.com that was set up for the mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   As the premiere date nears, the advertising and promotions will
also intensify. ``You really pour it on,'' Schweitzer said, because
``many people are making their viewing decisions much closer to the
time of broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, efforts are being stepped up to promote the
miniseries online. The show will be highlighted in a banner ad on
America Online's main screen in addition to the television,
entertainment and news screens throughout the promotion. Also over
the weekend, VH-1, part of the MTV Networks unit of Viacom, which
has acquired the off-network rights to ``Shake, Rattle and Roll,''
will broadcast features and promotional vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Sunday night is going to be one of the busiest
nights of television,'' Schweitzer said. For the first weekend of
the November sweeps, the networks are introducing programming
extravaganzas on Sunday, from miniseries on CBS and NBC, which is
introducing ``Leprechauns,'' to the return of the hit game show
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC to the season premiere of
``The X-Files'' on Fox. The sweep months are important for the
television stations because they set the advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can buy a TV Guide ad; anyone can buy a radio spot,''
Schweitzer said. ``But to be in some of these exclusive venues like
the Hard Rock and America Online gives us an competitive
advantage.''

PFIZER IN $82.4 BILLION HOSTILE BID TO BREAK UP MERGER OF DRUG

 By DAVID J. MORROW and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hours after executives of American Home Products Corp. and
Warner-Lambert Co. announced a $70 billion merger agreement
Thursday, Pfizer Inc. tried to break the deal up with an $82.4
billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts who follow the pharmaceutical industry said
Thursday night that a still-higher offer could emerge for
Warner-Lambert, either from American Home or Pfizer, or even from
another drug company. Warner-Lambert's board met Thursday night and
reaffirmed its commitment to American Home, saying that the terms
of Pfizer's offer, which call for the elimination of a $2 billion
payment agreed to by Warner-Lambert and American Home if one
company backed out of their deal, made the bid difficult to
evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert is considered a prize within the industry because
of its blockbuster products, including the cholesterol-fighting
drug Lipitor marketed jointly with Pfizer, and its many other
treatments under development.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has become intense among the world's largest drug
makers to ensure a pipeline of lucrative breakthrough drugs _
compounds that are billion-dollar sellers and control a commanding
share of the market. Companies also need to replace drugs losing
patent protection, which become vulnerable to cheaper generic
products, and want to amass bigger research budgets in the hope of
generating highly successful drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's bid for Warner-Lambert shatters all such records in the
industry. The $82.4 billion offer is, in fact, the biggest hostile
bid ever made for any company, and the deal, if completed, would be
one of the largest of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   If Pfizer were to acquire Warner-Lambert, it would be by far the
biggest drug company. Astra Zeneca, now the world's largest, had
$10.68 billion in worldwide prescription drug sales last year and
4.2 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would have $15.9 billion in sales and
a 6.3 percent share. Drug-stock analysts said that because Pfizer
would have a relatively small share of a splintered market, and
because the companies had little overlap, antitrust issues were not
expected to be a factor in completing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, Warner-Lambert were to complete its
friendly merger with American Home Products, the combined
AmericanWarner would still be the biggest drug company, but with
sales of $13.8 billion and 5.5 percent of the total market.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Warner-Lambert's 43,000 employees, 3,000 of
whom work in New Jersey, would fare in a Pfizer acquisition. Some
analysts said Pfizer would probably close Warner-Lambert's
headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., and cut other jobs from the
company's confectionary or manufacturing divisions. Pfizer, which
is based in New York City, has 46,400 employees spread worldwide.
The company said Thursday that it expected $1.2 billion in cost
savings once the acquisition was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some jobs at Warner-Lambert's headquarters would
almost certainly be eliminated if it merged with American Home. At
their news conference, the companies' executives announced that
AmericanWarner would be based in American Home Products' corporate
center in Madison, N.J.. But they declined to specify how many jobs
might be lost. They estimated cost savings of $1.2 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's bid leaves American Home Products in a potentially
vulnerable position. When announcing the deal with Warner-Lambert,
American Home's chief executive said his third attempt at a merger
would be a charm. Previous agreements between American Home and
SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto fell apart over conflicts on who
would have executive control. Though that matter had apparently
been worked out with Warner-Lambert, the issue may not be so easily
resolved now.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the uncertain fortunes for American Home, its
stock price fell Thursday, even though the company had become an
acquisition target, something that would normally push up a
company's stock price. Investors seemed to wonder whether it could
fetch a premium over its current price.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said Thursday that it could be months before any
merger deal is finalized for any of the companies involved. Several
European companies _ including Glaxo Wellcome and Novartis _ have
long been seen as possible acquirers in the industry, especially if
they can increase their prescription drug sales in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to figuring out which company may make an
acquisition, you can play chessboard here to your heart's
content,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a
biopharmacological research firm in New York. ``It's hard to
identify specific large companies that would not feel compelled to
go in this round.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pfizer's executives expressed confidence Thursday
that their bid would be successful, questions remained. American
Home Products and Warner-Lambert agreed that ending their merger
would cost $2 billion to the party backing out, and they included a
clause in the contract making an exchange of shares difficult for
another company.
</P>
<P>
   Upon making its offer, Pfizer immediately filed a lawsuit in
Delaware, where most big companies are incorporated, contesting the
$2 billion break-up fee. William Steere, Pfizer's chairman, said
Thursday in an interview that Pfizer's offer was contingent on both
roadblocks being removed. He called the break-up fee ``egregious
and unheard of'' for a deal of that size.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   While mergers in the pharmaceutical industry are relatively
common, the current triangle between Pfizer, American Home Products
and Warner-Lambert has more intrigue than most. John Stafford,
American Home Products' chairman, had been chastised for his two
failed merger attempts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware that Pfizer was preparing a hostile bid, Stafford and
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, the chairman of Warner-Lambert, began
explaining the details of their merger to reporters at the Plaza
Hotel at 11:30 a.m. Thursday. When asked about his past two
failures, Stafford smiled and said that ``this deal, the one with
Warner-Lambert, is going to be a charm.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was ominous. Before 1 p.m., news reports appeared
that Pfizer was preparing a competing offer for Warner-Lambert.
Steere, who has been regarded as one of the drug industry's more
genteel chief executives, then made public a letter that he had
sent to de Vink detailing Pfizer's offer. While Steere addressed
the letter, ``Dear Lodewijk,'' he noted that he had tried to
discuss the issue several times with de Vink, only to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter contained pretty strong language for Pfizer,'' said
Mehta, the stock analyst. ``It was clear that Warner had stalled
them. But what's really interesting is that Pfizer detailed all
these benefits of the arrangement, and the last one on the list was
growth opportunities for management and key employees.''
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the negotiations, Steere and de
Vink had talked seriously about a possible merger recently. The
weekend before Halloween, Pfizer executives had heard rumors that
de Vink was having merger discussions with another company, said a
person close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer had entered into an agreement with Warner-Lambert on
March 4, 1996, that said it could not make an offer for the company
unless a rival did so first. So on Oct. 25, Steere sent de Vink a
letter suggesting that if Warner-Lambert was considering a merger,
he should talk to Pfizer. The two executives agreed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink went to Steere's office on 42nd Street in New York two
days later to discuss the strategic benefits of a combination.
``Mr. de Vink had one question,'' said the executive close to the
companies. ``Where am I in this merger?'' Steere said he had not
considered de Vink's role in a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   An investment banker who asked not to be identified said de Vink
wanted to avoid his company's being taken over entirely by another.
And Pfizer, along with SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome, was
one of the few threats. So on Oct. 29, said the executive close to
the company, de Vink called Steere and told him he would be
interested in a merger only with a company of similar size.
Further, de Vink said his company was not ``going to do anything
now, but do something in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3, there were press reports of the talks between
American Home and Warner-Lambert, and Steere sent de Vink a letter
saying he was surprised and disappointed to learn of the proposed
merger and urged a meeting as soon as possible. The second letter,
dated Nov. 4, provided details of Pfizer's formal offer to buy
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which company succeeds with its offer,
Warner-Lambert's shareholders are almost sure to gain.
</P>
<P>
   In deals with a hostile bidder, the highest price does not
always carry the day. Warner-Lambert's board could decide that its
long-term prospects are better with American Home and ask that
company to pay a premium. American Home, however, has fewer
financial resources than Pfizer and may have some liabilities still
to come from its problems with the fen-phen diet drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Warner-Lambert shareholder, I'm sure that I'll win,''
said Brian Stansky, a vice president at T. Rowe Price, which owns
shares in all three companies. ``If you're an American Home
Products shareholder, you'll win because if the company doesn't get
this deal, then it will soon get another.''
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting Thursday at the Plaza, Stafford and de Vink
emphasized that their combined company would be the largest in
over-the-counter brands and prescription drugs and could realize
cost savings by merging certain operations. If Warner-Lambert were
to be acquired by Pfizer, the combined company could have similar
savings, given it would tower over its next competitor in
prescription drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what has driven Pfizer's offer, in part, is the company's
promotional arrangement with Warner-Lambert to sell Lipitor. The
drug is expected to be one of the biggest sellers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the arrangement, Warner-Lambert got two drugs from
Pfizer's pipeline, a combination of Lipitor and Norvasc, a
cardiovascular drug, and Relpax, a migraine treatment. Pfizer
executives see a chance to expand what has been a very profitable
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is perhaps best known for its Viagra impotency drug and
Zoloft antidepressant, but also makes Plax dental rinse and
Barbasol shaving cream. Its rival for Warner's affection, American
Home, makes Advil painkiller along with Premarin, the world's most
popular hormone replacement, and Effexor, an antidepressant, and is
said to be looking for a buyer for its agricultural division.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is offering 2.5 of its shares for each Warner-Lambert
share. Based on the stock's close on Wednesday, that amounts to
$96.40 a share, or $82.4 billion. The combined company would have a
market value of $220 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Warner-Lambert's merge agreement with American Home
Products, each company would retain 50 percent of the new company
and new shares would be issued. The deal was valued at $70 billion,
based on the stocks' prices as of Tuesday. The combined company
would have a market value of $148 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pfizer closed Thursday at $37.25, down 3.4 percent, or
$1.3125. American Home's stock fell $1, or 1.7 percent, to $55.
Warner-Lambert's stock jumped 7.4 percent, or $6.1875, to $90.
</P>
<P>
   As Warner-Lambert's executives pondered Pfizer's bid Thursday,
analysts were already speculating that Steere would raise his bid
to end any further negotiations. Stock analysts said Warner-Lambert
could be worth as much as $110 a share.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the prospect of a higher offer, Steere refused
to comment on speculation. ``We think the offer that we have out
there now is a fabulous offer,'' he said.

NASDAQ IS PLANNING TO COMPETE IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stock market, the largest electronic exchange in the
United States, plans to open an Internet-based exchange that will
list shares of companies based in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, which Nasdaq planned to announce in London on
Friday, is part of its effort to build a global stock exchange that
offers nonstop trading in securities in all parts of the world.
Nasdaq, which is operated by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, recently announced a plan to set up a virtual stock
exchange in Japan as well. Nasdaq officials said they hoped to
begin operations in Europe and Japan simultaneously in the final
three months of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more ambitious than anything we have talked about
before,'' said John Hilley, chairman of Nasdaq International.
``This is the third leg of our global platform _ a center for stock
trading running 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Nasdaq-Europe will face intense competition from
European stock exchanges, many of which have already geared up for
Continent-wide stock trading in the era of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Eight national stock exchanges in the region have formed an
alliance to offer cross-listings of securities, for example. A new
for-profit exchange called Tradepoint Financial Networks plans to
provide an electronic, Europe-wide securities trading service. A
third exchange, called Easdaq, now offers a European market for
growth company stocks that closely resembles the Nasdaq market in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Three partners joined Nasdaq to finance the new European
exchange. Softbank Corp., of Japan, a partner in Nasdaq's Japan
exchange, will also take an equity stake in the European operation.
Venture capital arms of News Corp. and Vivendi of France are the
other joint venture partners. Nasdaq officials declined to comment
on the size of any partner's investment.
</P>
<P>
   The new Nasdaq exchange will be based in London. If it obtains
exchange status in Britain, it can then make use of European
agreements allowing exchanges to list or trade shares across the
Continent, Nasdaq officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new exchange would not need to obtain the permission of
European companies to list or trade their shares. But it seems
unlikely to succeed unless it can convince brokerage houses and
traders that it provides a better forum for trading securities than
its European rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq plans to concentrate on initial listings of
growth-oriented companies in the region. Nasdaq grew to surpass the
New York Stock Exchange in total trading volume in recent years
largely because it recruited new, technology-oriented companies _
including Microsoft and Intel _ that have become some of the
world's most popular stocks. It would have an advantage over some
European exchanges because it could easily offer trading in U.S.
stocks to European investors.
</P>
<P>
   To increase its chances of becoming a liquid European exchange,
Nasdaq plans to recruit many of the top international banks and
brokerage houses to become equity partners in Nasdaq-Europe. Some
securities firms have already announced partnerships with other
pan-European exchanges, however. Nasdaq officials said they hoped
to announce new partners in coming months.

SENATE PASSES LANDMARK OVERHAUL BILL FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES
INDUSTRY 
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress closed in on approving late Thursday night
a landmark overhaul of the financial services industry, paving the
way for banks, insurance and securities firms to merge more freely
and sell each other's products.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill by an overwhelming margin of 90-8 and
the House on Thursday night also was expected to approve the
measure. President Clinton is expected to sign it into law within a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation said it would allow consumers to
purchase banking, investment and insurance services from one
company, and that the consolidation would lead to more competition
and save consumers about $15 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said it would create huge monopolies that could
lead to price gouging and weaken customers' financial privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the chief sponsor of the
huge deregulation measure, hailed it as the ``most important
banking bill passed in 60 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that it would take some time to determine
whether the bill proves beneficial to American consumers by
providing better and cheaper financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe . . . that Americans will find that they will
benefit from deregulation,'' Gramm said after the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic change in policy. It is a dramatic change
in the financial structure of the country, and I believe it's a
change in the right direction,'' Gramm stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., a co-sponsor of the legislation, also
praised the bill, saying that it would provide ``a comprehensive
statutory framework'' for changes that have been taking place in
the financial services industry on ``ad-hoc basis'' for many years.
</P>
<P>
   He said overall the legislation should provide protections for
consumers that do not currently exist, especially in the area of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement that the bill ``will help the
American financial services system play a leading role in
propelling our economy into the 21st century . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long fight for the bill's passage, Gramm referred
to it as a measure that would bring ``one-stop shopping'' to the
financial arena, giving consumers a diversity of products from one
source at more competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   With deregulation, banks, for example, will be able to offer not
only banking and loan services, but insurance and expanded
investment opportunities as well. Likewise, insurance companies and
securities firms will be able to offer financial services outside
their own areas of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But handful of opponents of the measure led by Sens. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., sought to derail the
measure because of concerns that the legislation would give the
financial industry too much freedom to exchange consumer
information.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said the measure it would give banks ``the ability to
sell and exploit'' personal information without consent just to
make a profit. And he warned that approval of the bill could also
amount to ``aiding and abetting'' possible criminal activity that
trades on private information about individuals pilfered from
credit card and other financial records.
</P>
<P>
   ``One stop shopping is not worth giving up your financial
privacy,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone also contended that the bill would result in
``price-gouging'' and would do nothing more than consolidate ``more
and more power in the hands of fewer and fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumer and legal groups opposed to the measure
also sought to kill it by calling attention to the massive
deregulation of the cable and communications industry enacted by
Congress two years ago. That bill was supposed to produce savings
for consumers as well, but ended up increasing costs in many parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters of the bill argued that while it does allow
affiliated financial companies to share personal data on customers
without their consent, they will still have the right _ but only in
the form of a written request _ to stop companies from sharing or
selling information about them to outside organizations, such as
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions would also be required to abide by state
privacy laws, many of which provide consumers with greater
protections than are outlined in the Gramm bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, and other supporters also argued
that the bill would reinforce and protect the Community
Reinvestment Act, by requiring banks wanting to expand into
insurance and other financial activities to ``have and maintain'' a
``satisfactory CRA rating from the federal government on making
loans to minority and low-income areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee also expressed support for the bill,
based on CRA protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a perfect bill, but it is a bill we should
(support),'' said Jackson Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such arguments were not enough to sway opponents who
insisted that the bill, as Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., put it, is
little more than ``consumer fraud masquerading as financial
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is consumers are going to be faced with a new
mega-merged world . . . run by only a few companies,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the financial industry has never had any incentive
in the first place to offer consumers better services, and that
they will have ``even fewer'' now under the Gramm bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would mark the repeal of the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall regulations that has long-hampered the merger and
consolidation of different financial industries.
</P>
<P>
   The act came in response to the devastating stock market crash
of 1929 that triggered the Great Depression and was designed to
build barriers separating the financial services industry.

2 PHONE COMPANIES SET UP SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bell Atlantic announced its $53 billion agreement to
acquire GTE in July 1998, the companies did just about everything
but offer free phone calls to convince the world that their deal
represented a true merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   The two local telephone giants appeared to back that up
Thursday, announcing a tentative senior executive team that, at
least numerically, is drawn equally from Bell Atlantic and GTE.
Executives from Bell Atlantic appeared to win the top operational
and financial jobs while senior GTE executives will largely control
staff functions that have less impact on the combined company's
quarter-to-quarter financial results.
</P>
<P>
   The companies expect to complete their merger, which requires
myriad regulatory and antitrust approvals, in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the companies announced that Charles R. Lee, GTE's
chairman, and Ivan G. Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman, would
split the job of chief executive at the combined company with Lee,
59, getting the chairman's job. Seidenberg, 52, is set to become
the sole chief executive in 2002 and chairman in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the companies announced the next layer of management.
</P>
<P>
   From Bell Atlantic, Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., 54, currently
president and chief operating officer, will become president and
vice chairman overseeing local and long-distance phone operations
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic V. Salerno, 56, senior executive vice president and
chief financial officer, will become vice chairman and chief
financial officer of the new company. Dennis F. Strigl, 53,
chairman of Bell Atlantic's wireless unit, will become executive
vice president overseeing the domestic wireless operation.
</P>
<P>
   From GTE, Michael T. Masin, 54, currently GTE's vice chairman
and president of GTE's international unit, will become vice
chairman and president and run overseas operations. William P.
Barr, 49, the former attorney general who is executive vice
president and general counsel of GTE, will retain those titles. J.
Randall MacDonald, 51, GTE's executive vice president for human
resources, will retain that role in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who will not join the combined company's top tier
include James R. Young, Bell Atlantic's general counsel, Daniel P.
O'Brien, GTE's chief financial officer, Donald J. Sacco, Bell
Atlantic's executive vice president for human resources and Kent B.
Foster, GTE's president.
</P>
<P>
   The companies announced Thursday that Sacco, 58, and Foster, 56,
along with Morrison DeS. Webb, 51, Bell Atlantic's executive vice
president for external affairs and corporate communications, would
depart.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise, was that James G. Cullen, who, like
Babbio, is president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic,
also announced plans to depart. Cullen, 57, and Babbio have long
been seen as rivals. They even joined New Jersey Bell on the same
day in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Cullen, with his deep telecommunications
experience, will end up becoming a chief executive at another
company, if he so chooses. Cullen said Thursday that he had become
close friends with Babbio and that his departure was motivated by
personal concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the two of us, it's beyond the professional relationship
and it's certainly beyond anything I know was a rivalry,'' Cullen
said. ``I've committed to my wife and three kids that we're going
to spend more time and this is the moment.''

$500 MILLION TELIGENT STAKE SEEN FOR MICROSOFT-LED GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Giving a vote of confidence to the concept of delivering
advanced data communications services using wireless links, a group
including Microsoft and Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, the investment
firm, is close to a deal to invest $500 million in Teligent Inc.,
people close to the negotiations said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the talks could still fail, an agreement could be
announced as soon as Friday, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent, which is based in Vienna, Va., and run by Alex J.
Mandl, a former chief operating officer of AT&AMP;T, uses advanced
wireless technology to provide business customers with voice, video
and data communications services, including Internet access. Unlike
cellular phone technology, the systems used by Teligent connect
only fixed antennas.
</P>
<P>
   For years, fiber optic systems have provided the dominant way to
deliver torrents of digital information. Many competitive local
communications providers spend millions of dollars tearing up
streets to create new fiber optic networks. Teligent and its
investors are betting that wireless technology can provide
comparable capacity.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the talks, Microsoft and Hicks,
Muse were close to agreeing Thursday night to invest $200 million
each in Teligent. The final $100 million would be provided by a
consortium that includes Chase Capital Partners; DB Capital
Partners, which is affiliated with Deutsche Bank, and Olympus
Partners, an investment firm based in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million would be invested in Teligent preferred stock
that would pay 7.75 percent interest and would be convertible into
common shares at a price of $57.50 each, people close to the deal
said. That is about 17 percent higher than Teligent's closing price
Thursday, $49.1875, but considerably lower than the stock's 52-week
high, $75.625, which was reached in July.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in new local communications carriers are routinely
volatile, and Teligent shares gained $2.9375 on Thursday in Nasdaq
trading. If all the preferred shares were converted to common
stock, the new investors would own 8 percent to 10 percent of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent declined to comment. The company was advised by Chase
Securities, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The investment would be a boost for Teligent, and it could
burnish the image of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the world's
largest phone company. Two years ago, NTT invested $100 million in
Teligent for 12.5 percent of the company.

FOR WORKERS AT THE PROSPECTIVE PARTNERS, HEALTHY DOSES OF
UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. _ It was a day like any other Thursday
outside the world headquarters of Warner-Lambert Co. Some employees
hurried to lunch, others jogged and limousine drivers waited
outside the yellow brick, glass lined buildings to whisk executives
away to out-of-town assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But the normal appearance belied an ongoing boardroom drama that
would affect the fate of Warner-Lambert's 3,000 employees at this
suburban corporate campus.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials announced during a midday press conference
that they would be merging with the American Home Products company,
which is just 10 miles away, bringing some uncertainty to the fate
of the work force. But at almost the same time, they learned that
yet another company, Pfizer Inc., which is based in New York City,
was bidding for Warner-Lambert as well.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a day, most workers at the company that makes the
anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor, Bubblicious gum and Listerine,
thought they would be merging with American Home Products, which
has its headquarters in Madison, a city that is in Morris County,
as is Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products makes the Sonata sleeping pill, Advil and
Chapstick. The company has 3,700 employees in New Jersey, with 700
of them at its Madison location and another 700 in nearby
Parsippany.
</P>
<P>
   A merger between the two pharmaceutical companies, some
Warner-Lambert employees said, seemed like a good idea, even though
no one knows what it will mean for the size of the work force at
either place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could not ask for a better marriage,'' said Jay Zella,
director of data architecture at Warner-Lambert, as he walked
outside one of the buildings. ``They're strong on the consumer
side, and we're strong on the pharmaceutical side. It's a good
move.''
</P>
<P>
   While everyone said it was too soon to tell what it would mean
for particular jobs, the new company might be good for
stockholders, which includes many employees with stock options.
Indeed, Wednesday, when word of the proposed merger began making
its way through Wall Street, the stock of both companies went up.
Shares of American Home Products jumped 11 percent, to $56, while
Warner-Lambert stock rose 7 percent, to $83.8125. On Thursday
shares of American Home fell $1, to $55, while Warner-Lambert
soared $6.1875, to $90, on news of the hostile Pfizer offer. Shares
of Pfizer fell $1.3125, to $37.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I think it will be a good thing for employees
because of the opportunities it will present to us,'' said Steve
Balumbo, director of finance, who was hurrying back from lunch for
a meeting. ``As for layoffs or other things like that, there might
be something there, but its hard to know right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A limousine driver, William Allison, said the merger was the
talk among his passengers for the last two days. Allison, whose
company, Empire International, holds contracts with both
Warner-Lambert and American Home, said, he drove two people from
Hoffman-La Roche, a competing pharmaceutical company based in
Nutley, and they also were talking about the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying that the companies will probably have to
relocate some people or let others go,'' Allison said. ``Everyone
is talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as they spoke, there was news that Pfizer, another
pharmaceutical company, had made a hostile takeover bid for
Warner-Lambert, so the fate of Warner-Lambert is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   At American Home's Madison operation, employees were also
uncertain about what the Pfizer action would mean for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees are focused and used to some ups and downs,''
said America Home's Lowell Weiner, who is assistant vice president
for public relations. ``Life goes on here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pfizer also has some offices in Morris County, which is home to
54 Fortune 500 companies. Christopher Marra, executive director of
the Morris Area Development Group, a private-public partnership for
economic development, said Morris County has the second highest
inventory of office and industrial space in the state, with 23
million square feet, after Bergen County.
</P>
<P>
   The hills of Morris County, which are now ablaze with colorful
autumn leaves, have long been a magnet for industrialists, Marra
said, beginning at the turn of the century, when many executives
from New York City had summer homes here. Now the county has become
a center for research and development companies in the
telecommunications, software and pharmaceutical industries, and
also financial services. Most of the county's industrial and office
space has been built since 1982, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the merger of two of these companies, Warner-Lambert and
American Home, Marra said that in the long run it would be good for
the county's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, you have to be concerned that one of those
facilities won't be kept,'' he said. ``Obviously, they're going to
try to find economies of scale, and maybe initially they will want
less space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But over the long term, you might have one of the largest
pharmaceutical companies in the world based in your county,'' he
said. ``In time, somehow companies always need more space, they
always hire more people and they always contract for more services.
That has to be beneficial to us.''

NEW YORK CITY LOSES IN COURT OVER FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN STREET
NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was the fury against apartheid that turned East
44th Street and Second Avenue into Nelson and Winnie Mandela Corner
and the support for Israeli sovereignty that turned a portion of
East 70th Street into United Jerusalem Place. And lighter occasions
have produced street signs honoring Barbie dolls and Broadway
shows, stand-up comic Jackie Mason and cellist Yo Yo Ma.
</P>
<P>
   Second Avenue between East 42nd and East 43nd streets officially
became Yitzhak Rabin Street in honor of the slain prime minister,
but city officials denied a request from the National Council on
Islamic Affairs to briefly rename the next block over as Yasser
Arafat Way.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge cited these and other examples in ruling on
Wednesday that the city's Department of Transportation violated the
Constitution, and deemed arbitrary the department's methods of
dealing with requests to temporarily rename city streets. The
decision handed the Giuliani administration yet another defeat in a
First Amendment lawsuit, just two days after it lost a First
Amendment case involving the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The decision sets the stage for the judge, Robert W. Sweet of
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, to consider awarding monetary
damages and creates a precedent that will require the city to
consider street renaming requests more equitably, to protect what
he ruled was a First Amendment right to the signs.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Sweet found that the city violated the rights
of a group that wanted to rename a portion of East 68th Street in
Manhattan in support of independence for East Timor, the island
nation that recently ended 14 years of Indonesian rule. The city
had twice denied the group's request.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department routinely allows private
organizations and businesses to provisionally rename city streets.
Department rules require the street renaming to promote public,
not-for-profit and cultural events or to commemorate historically
important events or people or to honor individuals or community
groups. The sponsoring group must pay for the new signs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a group called the East Timor Action Network asked to
install street signs reading 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre at the
northwest corner of East 68th Street and Madison Avenue and at the
southeast corner of East 68th Street and Fifth Avenue, near the
Indonesian Consulate. The signs were to commemorate a 1991 incident
in which 270 people were killed in Dili, the East Timor capital.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adamenko, director of the Transportation Department's
special events office, denied the request, citing rules that
prohibit streets from being renamed to promote products, commercial
entities, political parties or political candidates. He cited the
same rules in denying a request made in March to rename the corners
Free East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Sweet cited numerous cases in which the city,
both during the Giuliani administration and in previous
administrations, made apparently arbitrary decisions. The judge
wrote that the city's rules had been construed ``to permit the
denial of approval to any sign based on the belief that the message
expressed in the sign will generate controversy.'' The judge said
that ``the `political controversy' standard is wholly subjective
and indeed encourages impermissible viewpoint discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   He found the temporary street signs constituted a ``limited
public forum'' in which constitutional rights and access to free
speech are protected by law. The judge said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recognized ``that temporary street signs are a forum for expressive
activities,'' because in 1996 the mayor himself had requested the
renaming of a corner near the Cuban Mission to the United Nations,
as Esquina Hermanos al Rescate/Brothers to the Rescue Corner in
honor of the Miami-based Cuban exile group that lobbies for the
overthrow of Fidel Castro. The signs were the subject of numerous
protests and demonstrations.

DISNEY POSTS 71 PERCENT DECLINE IN 4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Walt Disney said Thursday that profits for its
fourth quarter and full year fell sharply, hurt by slumping sales
of home videos and Disney merchandise and by a reorganization
charge caused by cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, said Thursday that he was
shifting the company's emphasis away from adding new businesses and
properties, something he has done aggressively since taking over 15
years ago, and toward improving profits from existing businesses.
``I intend to tip the balance toward optimizing the assets we
already own,'' Eisner said in a conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company predicted its home video and consumer product
problems would continue for the next few quarters, so that earnings
next year will be roughly the same as those for the year that just
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fast turnaround,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said that net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30
fell 71 percent, to $85 million, or 4 cents a diluted share,
compared with $296 million, or 14 cents a share, in the quarter a
year earlier. Revenue fell 6 percent, to $5.8 billion from $6.15
billion. Excluding a reorganization charge and the effects from the
company's investment in Infoseek, an Internet company, income fell
37 percent, to $212 million, or 10 cents a share, which was in line
with Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, earnings fell 30 percent, to $1.30 billion,
or 62 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.85 billion, or 89
cents a share, in the previous year. Excluding the reorganization
charge and Infoseek investment, earnings were down 27 percent, to
$1.4 billion, or 66 cents a share. Revenue increased 2 percent, to
$23.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter, Disney took a charge of $132 million, or 4 cents
a share, to reflect staff cutbacks and cost-cutting measures like
the shutdown of the Club Disney family entertainment centers.
Eisner said there would be more such charges in future quarters as
Disney aims to cut $500 million from its annual costs by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock is down about a third from its 1998 high of just
more than $42, and Eisner is clearly trying to get back into Wall
Street's good graces. A live conference call to discuss quarterly
earnings is unusual for Disney, and Eisner said it would become a
regular practice. The company also provided for the first time more
details about its operations, separating, for instance, the results
of the movie business from that of consumer products, which had
once been lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Disney climbed 62.5 cents, to $27.50, on trading
volume more than twice as heavy as normal, probably in anticipation
that the company would announce bold measures in the conference
call. The financial results were announced after the close of
trading, and some analysts think the stock might drop on Friday
because of the company's prediction about flat results in the year
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's movie studio operations lost $94 million in the quarter
on a 18 percent decline in revenue, to $1.6 billion. While Disney
is a box office leader and had a hit movie with ``The Sixth
Sense,'' its home video sales shriveled as it released fewer of its
classic animated films into the market.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer products category, which includes the licensing of
characters and sales in Disney's stores, experienced an operating
income decline of 38 percent and a sales decline of 8 percent.
Disney said it was cutting back on licensees and reducing the
number of items stocked in its stores by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   Problems at ABC continue to weigh on Disney's results, with the
network experiencing higher programming costs and lower prime-time
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney's cable operations, led by the ESPN sports channel,
performed strongly, with other channels such as A&AMP;E and Lifetime
registering gains in subscribers. The company also said its
earnings and revenues grew in its theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has been trying to streamline its operations for the last
year or so. It sold its magazine operations for an estimated $650
million and combined its Disney and ABC television production under
one roof. It cut back on the number of movies it made and is known
to be looking to sell its sports teams, the Mighty Ducks of the
National Hockey League and the baseball Angels, both based in
Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisner said that Disney eventually hoped to return to
earnings growth of 20 percent a year, as it experienced in the
past. ``I think it's coming but it's not coming tomorrow,'' he
said.

An F.A.A. STUDY SHOWS FEW GAINS IN IMPROVING SECURITY AT AIRPORTS 
 (rk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN with JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island in July
1996, initial fears that the jumbo jet had been brought down by a
terrorist bomb prompted the Clinton administration and Congress to
demand that security at the nation's airports be improved.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation was adopted. A down payment of $400 million was
appropriated for bomb detection machines. The Federal Aviation
Administration was given several months to produce a report on how
to redesign the country's air travel security system. A commission
headed by Vice President Al Gore urged airlines to pay their
security personnel better wages to upgrade the quality of
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But more than three years later, as investigators are again
asking whether a plane fell from the sky because of a mechanical
failure or an act of sabotage, critics of the FAA and the airline
industry, within and outside of government, say the safety
improvements achieved at airports across the country have been
modest at best.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, for example, took two years, not three months, to
produce its report on how the industry and its regulators could
better ensure security; the $1 million state-of-the-art detection
devices used to examine baggage at 80 airports are being badly
underused, according to a 1999 government audit; that same audit
also found that efforts to limit access to airplanes on the ground
by unauthorized people was no better than it had been three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about progress since 1996, I don't think much
has been done,'' said a former member of the Gore Commission who
worked for months on pushing reforms and who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course officials now believe that TWA Flight 800 was not
brought down by a bomb, and there is no evidence that EgyptAir 990,
the Boeing 767 that tumbled out of the sky last Sunday morning
shortly after taking off from Kennedy International Airport, was
the victim of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence, either, that a mechanical failure
caused the EgyptAir crash. And so as the search for an answer goes
on, investigators are interviewing security personnel at JFK and at
Los Angeles International Airport, the 767's initial takeoff site,
examining passenger lists and, in their own urgent way, taking
stock of whether things at the airports are any better than they
were in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the FAA and airline officials point out that no
airplane departing from the United States has ever been destroyed
by a bomb. And they add that they have, in fact, made progress in
improving security _ though some delays were unavoidable _ and that
they are using the high-tech baggage checkers as frequently as is
practically possible.
</P>
<P>
   And there are legislators who support the claims of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, who is the ranking Democrat on
the House Transportation Committee, said the FAA was doing ``a very
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence shows that the problems the agency has faced in
beefing up security are similar to those that have plagued it
before, most famously in its long-delayed efforts to modernize the
nation's air traffic control system. The agency, according to its
critics and even some of its supporters, is often immobilized by
its attempts to seek consensus among the various public and private
interests it is supposed to be regulating.
</P>
<P>
   One priority established after the crash of TWA Flight 800 was
the greater use of high-technology explosive-detection devices. In
the fall of 1996, Congress appropriated $144 million for the FAA to
buy the machines.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 136 of a total of 400 explosive-detection devices, each
costing about $1 million, have been deployed at 80 airports. In
addition, about 600 machines that are used to detect traces of
explosives in carry-on luggage are also in use.
</P>
<P>
   But an audit by the Department of Transportation's inspector
general published earlier this year found that the machines were
vastly underused by airlines, which are responsible for screening
baggage. The report _ which assessed a variety of security issues
at a number of unnamed airports _ estimated that each machine was
capable of screening 750 bags per day, or 5,350 per week, but that
in the last quarter of 1998 they were screening only an average of
223 bags per day, or 1,559 per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is they have to get this expensive equipment that
does a good job used more,'' said Alexis M. Stefani, the assistant
inspector general for auditing.
</P>
<P>
   In defense, airline representatives say that using the machines
more frequently would be impractical and add hours to boarding
times. They also say that general use is not recommended even by
the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not what the security directive from the U.S.
government says,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air
Transport Association, the airline trade group. ``They are not
saying screen all bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Cathal Flynn, retired, the associate administrator for
civil aviation security at the FAA, said that the agency had
managed to increase the use of the machines since the audit was
done last year. The FAA is now encouraging airlines to pool the use
of individual machines. He said that each machine was now scanning
an average of 2,000 bags each week.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation department's inspector general also found
that the effectiveness of the new machines was compromised by their
operators. In many cases, the report found, passengers who were
identified as potential threats by a special computer profiling
program did not have their bags scanned by the machines because
security workers simply did not bother.
</P>
<P>
   One recommendation of the Gore Commission was for airlines to
raise the standards of airport security personnel. They have long
been seen as a weak link in the chain because security companies,
under contract with the airlines, routinely pay low wages and
suffer high turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more sophisticated the machinery the higher-quality people
you need to operate them,'' said Robert W. Overman, vice president
of human resources at Guardsmark, a security company based in
Memphis, Tenn. Guardsmark used to receive contracts from airlines
to screen passengers but stopped about 10 years ago, he said,
because the airlines would always take the lowest bid.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress ordered the FAA to begin certifying security
companies, a step intended to raise their accountability. More than
three years later, the agency still has not completed the job.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA decided that before it could certify security companies
it needed to devise an objective standard to judge their
performance. The solution was a computer program called Threat
Image Projection, or TIP, which tests the alertness of operators by
projecting one of 1,600 fictitious images of bags containing bombs
on the screens of explosive-detection machines.
</P>
<P>
   After the FAA spent months refining the system, TIP was finally
deployed during the summer. But an audit by the inspector general
made public on Wednesday found that the FAA had failed to instruct
airlines how to use the program. In addition, the report said that
operators at two airports were given passwords that enabled them to
alter or disable the software. The report openly doubted whether
TIP could be legitimately used to measure the performance of
screening companies.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn of the FAA said it was ``premature'' for him to comment on
the report, and he would say only that the aviation agency planned
to issue the final rule requiring certification of screening
companies sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's study also found problems with general
airport security. Earlier this year, agents of the inspector
general without proper identification easily entered secure areas
at five major airports and boarded a large number of passenger and
cargo aircraft without being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the March report, Flynn sent a letter to airlines
and airport executives around the country threatening to require
them to post armed guards around each airplane if the situation did
not improve. He also announced that the FAA would mount a
comprehensive test of airport security in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said that between March and May, it conducted 3000 tests
at 79 airports. The rate of compliance was 96 percent. But it would
not release the names of the airports it studied.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kelly, the director of aviation for the Port Authority,
which runs J.F.K., said that the airport had fared well on the FAA
security tests. But one law enforcement official involved in the
inquiry into the EgyptAir crash said the investigation had already
come across security lapses that mirrored those found in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the agency's overall performance since the TWA
crash, Flynn said: ``We still have years of work to do. But
remarkable progress has been made.''

INTERNET GROUP APPROVES DOMAIN REGISTRATION RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Internet's governing board Thursday approved
terms for opening the network's address registration businesses to
full-scale competition, ending the six-year monopoly that enriched
Network Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the landmark document marks a victory for the
oversight group, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or ICANN, whose first year has been rocked by dissension
and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN unanimously approved the agreement, which spells out the
terms under which Network Solutions will open its business to the
more than 80 companies around the world already approved to compete
in the registration of Internet addresses, or domains, that end in
the popular .com, .net and .org suffixes.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking Network Solutions' monopoly was the key charge from the
Clinton administration when it appointed the nonprofit group last
year to take over administration of the Internet's domain name
system.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of companies have already begun competing with Network
Solutions as part of a pilot. But final approval of the hard-fought
agreement to bring the company under ICANN's oversight finally
paves the way for full-scale international competition in the
business, which has earned Networks Solutions hundreds of millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a tremendous boost to ICANN's stability,''
said Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department adviser who has
overseen the contentious process of moving Internet administration
from U.S. government contractors to the international Internet
community.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also gives the cash-strapped ICANN, which does not
yet have a means of support, an immediate infusion of $1.25 million
from Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burr predicted that the agreement would give consumers and
businesses around the world lower prices, better service and host
of new options in registering Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Having Network Solutions finally agree to recognize ICANN's
authority was crucial because Network Solutions not only has
registered the bulk of the more than 6 million Internet addresses
already assigned; it has also developed the network infrastructure
and databases that translate addresses like www.nytimes.com into
the long strings of numbers known as Internet Protocol addresses,
by which computers find each other.
</P>
<P>
   During a public hearing on Wednesday, a group of the companies
wanting to compete with Network Solutions lined up at the
microphones to complain that the agreement gave the Herndon, Va.,
company too many competitive advantages and would essentially
guarantee its continued monopoly in the registration of .com, .net
and .org domains. They asked for seven changes or the defeat the
contracts, which had taken Network Solutions, ICANN and the
Commerce Department nearly a year to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Though some feared that any changes would send the contentious
process back to the drawing board or, even worse, would result in
drawn out litigation that could threaten the stability of the
Internet, the differing sides worked all night to reach compromises
on the areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN, currently run by 10 directors appointed by a small group
of Internet insiders, has been repeatedly criticized for ignoring
the public in favor of well-financed special interest groups and
large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope now we can stop fighting and start cooperating,'' said
Hans Kraaijenbrink, a board member from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Roberts, ICANN's interim president, said that public and
private interests were well balanced in the final document.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge in front of us now is to admit that we made
mistakes and look to the future,'' he said. ``We need to continue
to balance the public and private interests, and this open process
that we have observed here is the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of the new registrars said they were still not
pleased with aspects of the contract, they expressed satisfaction
that ICANN had listened to them and had properly addressed their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ICANN rite of passage,'' said Richard Forman,
president of Register.com, a New York company that was the first
test participant to begin competing with the Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is good that they took our issues seriously and
came back with solutions to some of them. The devil is in the
details, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The competitors complained that the agreement gave Network
Solutions extra power to influence and challenge ICANN
policy-making, particularly in setting the fees the companies will
have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the agreement requires prepayment for domain name
registrations as a way of cracking down on cybersquatting, the term
for speculating in Internet addresses by buying popular domain
names with the hopes of selling them later for a profit. Many
cybersquatters secured names through Network Solutions on credit in
hopes of selling them before the bill came due, then let unsold
names expire for nonpayment.

 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Roberto Madrazo Pintado, who is running an
unexpectedly strong race in the governing party's presidential
primary, delights in playing the bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Roberto Madrazo takes government money to spend on
his own people. Well, it's true!'' reads the opener to one of his
newspaper ads, a sassy reference to the accusations that he has
used public funds to further his career.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ad shows Madrazo with ``his own people,'' a crowd of
grinning truck farmers who benefited from one of the programs he
created as governor of the state of Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
   Forged in the back-slapping politics of his gulf coast state,
Madrazo relishes his reputation as a politician who is not afraid
to flout the rules to get things done. He has mounted an effective
campaign for the Mexican presidential nomination by styling himself
as a renegade with the wile and guts to make government bureaucrats
pay attention to the little people they have long ignored.
</P>
<P>
   If Madrazo has populist flair, he is also a master of hardball
machine politics who has shown he will use whatever resources he
has _ including public funds _ to advance his career. And he has a
streak of old-time demagoguery, easily bending facts to fit his
political message.
</P>
<P>
   The primary in which Madrazo is running is the first one ever
held by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has won every
presidential election in Mexico for seven decades. His main
opponent, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is a silver-haired veteran of
37 years in government posts who personifies the candidate of
caution. That has helped Madrazo cast himself as an
anti-establishment insurgent who pledges to give the grass-roots
and the provinces new power over the elite in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the primary campaign, party leaders were stunned when
polls showed Madrazo ahead of Labastida. A highly effective series
of television ads, and a catchy slogan, hit a nerve with Mexicans
whose standard of living was devastated by a recession in the
mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after months of intensive campaigning, Labastida has
taken the lead in the polls. But since this is the party's first
primary and many of Madrazo's supporters are reluctant to express
their views openly, the reliability of the surveys is uncertain.
Whoever wins the vote, which is scheduled for Sunday, has a strong
chance to become the next president of Mexico because the
opposition is divided.
</P>
<P>
   In four and a half years as governor of Tabasco, a state rich in
oil and poor in practically everything else, Madrazo proved that he
is a deft politician with a popular touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in my family adores that man,'' said Juana Perez
Sarracino, the 43-year-old owner of a street-corner grocery in
Villahermosa, the state capital. ``No politician ever did more for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo started a program to supply free textbooks to secondary
school students. He built highways and bridges, badgered the
national oil company into spending more money on local development
and attracted some big-name commercial operations, like Sam's Club,
to open stores in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Among party stalwarts he gains favor by being the son of Carlos
Alberto Madrazo, a politician who spearheaded a movement to bring
democracy to the governing party, which is known as the PRI, by
holding internal elections for party leaders. When Carlos Madrazo
was killed in an airplane accident in 1969, his reforms died with
him. Roberto Madrazo's mother was also killed in the crash, leaving
him an orphan at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his appeal comes from his tenacity in pursuit of his
ambitions and readiness to stand up to the powers-that-be. In fact,
the incident that his critics regard as most damning to his
reputation is one that inspires his followers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 election in which he became governor was challenged by
opponents who accused him of campaign spending violations and
vote-buying. He denied any wrongdoing, but a review by federal
election officials, ordered by President Ernesto Zedillo, revealed
ample evidence of fraud. Zedillo tried to get Madrazo to resign,
but he refused. His supporters in Tabasco staged an uprising,
paralyzing the state capital. Finally Zedillo backed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been willing to take things to the ultimate
consequences in order to break with vested interests,'' Madrazo
said of his philosophy in an interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo does not look the part of the Kingfish. He is slight of
frame, and getting slighter with the rigors of the campaign. At 47,
he still looks youthful, with few patches of gray in his neatly
clipped hair. In conversation he is attentive and soft-spoken. But
when he takes to the stump, his resonant voice rises to make
soaring speeches.
</P>
<P>
   But his rhetoric, though crowd-thrilling, often strays from the
facts. Madrazo was accustomed to doing politics in Tabasco, where
the PRI still has hammerlock control.
</P>
<P>
   One of Madrazo's most frequently repeated campaign promises to
PRI followers is that he will finish what his father started by
bringing democracy to the party. But PRI leaders in Tabasco said
that as governor he ruled the party there with iron top-down
control.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the state PRI in Tabasco elected its party president
for the first time. But Madrazo's candidate was defeated and Hector
Arguello, a federal senator and longtime leader of farmers' groups,
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage didn't last six months,'' Arguello said in an
interview. Faced with what he described as a relentless war of
attrition with Madrazo, he resigned as state party president, and
in September he left the party.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo dismissed Arguello's resignation as ``a personal
decision.'' He insisted that the Tabasco PRI was a model for what
he would like to achieve nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ojeda, who as a PRI federal deputy also locked horns with
Madrazo over party politics, said: ``He ran Tabasco as though it
were a cattle ranch. There was no room for those of us who spoke up
to challenge him.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Madrazo has made much of his success at
attracting investment, both Mexican and foreign, to Tabasco. But
the man Madrazo appointed to lead his drive to woo investors to
Tabasco said the governor had repeatedly sabotaged his efforts, and
after eighteen months on the job he, too, resigned in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Priego Tapia, 34, who ran a family air-conditioning
company and who holds a master's degree in public administration
from New York University, was approved by Madrazo to head the
Tabasco Foundation, a new economic development board.
</P>
<P>
   Priego said Madrazo and officials in his government had used
information from talks with potential investors to force up the
price of their property purchases and had asked for payments to the
government that struck investors as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   When Priego voiced his complaints, Madrazo's government harassed
his family. In mid-1998 Priego quit the foundation and also closed
his business in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concluded that he didn't want powerful private investors
from outside the state because he didn't like to lose political
control,'' Priego said. ``He didn't want to share the stage with
anyone that didn't depend on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said Priego's incompetence had scared away the
investors.
</P>
<P>
   When his presidential campaign began, Madrazo caught Mexicans'
attention with the series of expertly produced television
advertisements touting his work as governor. ``Who says it can't be
done?'' went the upbeat slogan that voters everywhere began
repeating.
</P>
<P>
   But the ads illustrated Madrazo's penchant for pushing the law
to the limit, and sometimes beyond, to further his goals. His
rivals complained that he had used funds from the Tabasco state
treasury to promote himself, and they tried unsuccessfully to get
the party authorities to block him from using the slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to these charges, Madrazo gave a detailed account in
an interview of how the ads were put together.
</P>
<P>
   He said he spent about $8.5 million a year over three years from
two lines in the Tabasco budget that were earmarked for promoting
the successes of state programs. He said Carlos Alazraki, the
advertising executive who made the ads, was hired by the Tabasco
government in 1996 to promote its achievements, long before Madrazo
had decided to run for the presidential nomination. And he added
that the funds had been approved by all parties in the Tabasco
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the state budget for the last two years, which were
provided by Madrazo's allies in the Legislature, show that they did
include funds for promotion of state projects, but they amounted to
about half the sum Madrazo mentioned. The money was not authorized
in two budget lines, but in more than a dozen line items buried in
outlays for agencies across the government. It remains unclear
where the rest of the money for the ads came from.
</P>
<P>
   Alazraki, even though he is one of Madrazo's closest supporters,
said that he had begun his work for the Tabasco government in
August 1998, not two years earlier, and that Madrazo ``must have
his dates mixed up.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carlos Alberto Valenzuela, who represents a major opposition
party in the state Legislature, said he never intended to approve
funds for Madrazo's ads when he voted in favor of the overall state
budgets. ``It offends me that he has the nerve to say that,''
Valenzuela said.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's past in Tabasco may yet come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   So far he has eluded prosecution on charges that he took illegal
donations and exceeded campaign spending laws in the 1994
governor's election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the federal attorney general determined, based on
financial documents provided by the opposition, that Madrazo had
spent at least $38.6 million in his race for governor of Tabasco, a
state of about 1.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   That amount was roughly 10 times the legal limit in Tabasco and
similar to the eye-popping war chest that Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas has amassed for a national campaign in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But since the vote was governed by state laws, the attorney
general had to turn the investigation over to officials in Tabasco,
who were appointed by Madrazo. They quickly shelved it.
</P>
<P>
   If Madrazo becomes the presidential candidate, opposition
leaders have said they will renew efforts to bring him to account.

<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. _ Sachiko Brown and her mother, Alscess
Lewis-Brown, speak to each other every day, sometimes more than
once, spanning the distance between Seton Hall University and the
island of St. Croix any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, 20, calls home using her mother's credit card or an
800 number set up for that purpose. She talks from her dormitory
room while snuggled in bed or on a cellular phone as she strides
across campus.
</P>
<P>
   When she can't find her mother at her office, she pages her or
resorts to multiple voice mail messages, on the home, work and
mobile phones. And there's always e-mail, for middle-of-the-night
musings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chase her around until I find her if I want to say hi,''
said Ms. Brown, a junior studying to be a physical therapist.
</P>
<P>
   This level of contact was unheard of in the days when
dormitories had a single pay phone on each floor, calls were made
on Sunday night after the rates went down and long distance was
otherwise reserved for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed with stunning speed, as the
telecommunications revolution swept the nation, instant access
became the norm and products and services like the ones used by the
Brown family were aggressively marketed on campus. With cell phones
tweeting even during classes, it seems inconceivable that a decade
ago few students had telephones in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the revolution in technology, if a child went away,
they went away,'' said Peter Crabb, an associate professor of
psychology at Pennsylvania State University and an expert on
technology and social behavior. ``Now the norm is to communicate at
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and their parents, for the most part, see the change as
positive: proof that intergenerational harmony has replaced the
adversarial relationships of the 1960s and '70s, when young and old
battled about everything from foreign policy to loud music and long
hair.
</P>
<P>
   But experts on child development are alarmed. Crabb, for one,
said the new technology ``promotes immaturity and dependence''
during the years when adolescents are supposed to be building
independent adult lives.
</P>
<P>
   His views are echoed by dozens in his field, including Richard
Wessler, chairman of the psychology department at Pace University
in Pleasantville, N.Y., who said that there is a ``broad pattern of
dependence'' among today's young people from well-to-do families
and a tendency to ``micromanagement'' among their parents.
</P>
<P>
   On America's campuses, administrators see the opportunity for
unlimited communication as one more challenge. In her popular
handbook, ``Letting Go: A Parents' Guide to Understanding the
College Years,'' Karen Levin Coburn, the assistant vice chancellor
for students at Washington University in St. Louis, urges families
to discuss the desired amount of communication before a son or
daughter leaves for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention to the content, quality and urgency rather than
the frequency,'' Ms. Coburn said in an interview. ``If a child
can't make a move without talking to a parent, that's a concern.
But it's important to remember that all this means something
different to them, who have always had it at their fingertips, than
it does to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis-Brown, a single mother who is the director of labor
relations for the Virgin Islands Department of Education, said she
has no qualms about talking to her daughter every day. ``The real
test is whether they stand on their own two feet and make
decisions,'' she said. ``Satch never asks me what to do. She tells
me what she's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular contact between Ms. Brown and her mother is not
exceptional, said many students at Seton Hall and several other
colleges. They said they spoke to their parents several times a
week, at a minimum, or e-mailed them daily.
</P>
<P>
   A recent New York Times/CBS News poll of young people from 13 to
17 years old underscored the ubiquity of the new technologies.
Sixty-three percent of high school students had computers at home,
42 percent used e-mail, 18 percent owned beepers, and 10 percent
cell phones. Even larger shares of the teenagers who were 16 to 17
years old owned beepers, 26 percent, and cell phones, 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall, which is midway through a five-year, $15 million
technology initiative, has invested heavily in this sort of
anywhere-anytime communications. The campus is ranked the 16th most
wired in the nation, and the first among Catholic colleges, by the
magazine Yahoo! Internet Life.
</P>
<P>
   Every student is given an I.B.M. ThinkPad. They can use them
everywhere: in dorms, the classrooms and the library, and also in
the Pirate's Cove Cafe and at outdoor park benches, all equipped
with power outlets and network ports.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is a wireless campus, and to that end Seton Hall has
begun a pilot project with AT&AMP;T to put a low-cost cell phone in
every student's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Many telecommunications companies are catering to the college
market. Products include a multipurpose card that is a student ID
and a telephone credit card, among other things, and prepaid
cellular plans that can be replenished.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, particularly young men, prefer e-mail to
conversation. One Stanford University student said: ``It keeps my
parents from calling as often as they might. And it significantly
lowers my annoyance level, which in turn leads to better
conversation when you do talk.'' This young man, who asked for
anonymity so as not to insult his parents, added that ``we are not
living down the hall from our parents anymore, and it shouldn't
feel like we are.''
</P>
<P>
   His desire to avoid what he called ``the electronic leash''
seems the exception, not the rule. Amy Van Buren, an associate
professor of psychology at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield,
Conn., took an informal survey of several of nearly 100 of her
students, and said a vast majority were in ``excessive'' telephone
contact with their parents. Several of the young women, Ms. Van
Buren said, ``bragged that their mom was their best friend and they
talked to her three times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, at Washington University, where Ms. Coburn said most of
the calls were initiated by the students and there was ``very
little complaining about parents being intrusive.'
</P>
<P>
   The constant chitchat is overwhelmingly the province of mothers
and daughters, educators and students said. Sons prefer e-mail.
Fathers tend to be terse on the phone. Meghan Werth's father is
typical: ``Are you OK? Do you need money? Here's Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Werth, 18, a freshman at Seton Hall, and her mother in
nearby West New York, N.J., dissect the day _ on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Students who crave privacy know how to get it. They use caller
ID as a screening device. They turn off cell phones, pagers and the
ringer on dorm phones and let voice mail take messages. They ignore
certain e-mail. They adopt two screen names for instant messages
and give parents only one.
</P>
<P>
   Crabb at Penn State said that easy access causes a loss of
self-control in young people. Faced with frustration, anger or
disappointment, students mindlessly reach for the phone to ``seek
succor,'' he said. ``The call makes them feel better. But they are
not learning to control their emotional states, which is part of
becoming an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the president of Seton Hall, quarreled
with the notion that students could not be taught to use
telecommunications wisely. The monsignor compared it to the vending
machines on campus that tempt with fat, salt and sugar at every
turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't make the right choices about what to consume, it
will make us flabby or sick,'' he said. ``We need to learn what it
takes to say no. Just because we have it doesn't mean we have to
use it.''

INFANT FOUND IN TRASH CAN IS BURIED WITH POLICE POMP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Detectives who decided that no life, however brief,
should go unrecognized arranged an elaborate funeral at St.
Patrick's Cathedral Thursday for a newborn baby whose body was
found last month in a street-corner trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who saw the color guard, the motorcade and the
funeral procession line up along Fifth Avenue assumed the funeral
was for someone of wealth and stature, not a little girl who had
lived for less than 12 hours and was left, likely by her mother, in
a garbage can on the Lower West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the baby of a personality,'' said Christian
Brotcorne, a Belgian tourist who watched the ceremony from the rear
of the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers were also surprised to learn that the coordinators of
the service were New York City detectives, who are so often
portrayed as hard-boiled cynics who hide their emotions and make
wisecracks at crime scenes. In reality, many of the two dozen
officers who attended have small children of their own, and were
personally troubled by the incident, their supervisors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty tough bunch of guys,'' said Lt. James Martin
of the Midtown South precinct, which is investigating the death,
``but it got to all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The detectives named the baby Christine Hope, the first name
chosen because she was found on Oct. 11th, the day when New York
honors Christopher Columbus. The second name was chosen because an
organization known as the Children of Hope Foundation assisted in
arranging the funeral. The organization has buried 10 other
abandoned children since April, and each of them has been given the
surname Hope, said Timothy Jaccard, the group's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While a soloist in the cathedral's choir loft sang ``Ave
Maria,'' plainclothes officers milled about the back of the church,
hoping the baby's mother might show up. She did not, or if she did,
she went unnoticed by the detectives, who do not have much to go on
in making an identification.
</P>
<P>
   The child's body was discovered by a maintenance worker cleaning
out a trash can at Broadway and 32nd Street, one of the city's
busiest corners.
</P>
<P>
   The body had been wrapped in a multicolored quilt and a pink
blanket with the word ``Baby'' embroidered in white stitching, and
then placed in a black plastic shopping bag. Police officials do
not believe the body was in the can very long, because the worker
had emptied the can only 90 minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Although an autopsy has been completed, the Medical Examiner's
Office has yet to rule on how or when the baby died, pending
further tests. But detectives said they believed the baby had died
before it was left in the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   One of the difficulties in tracking the mother is the fact that
2.5 million people pass through the area covered by the Midtown
South precinct every day, said Detective Ken Cardona. The only real
lead, investigators said, is that the plastic bag came from Dr.
Jays Ladies, a store on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, but that lead,
they said, is a slim one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bag's been given out by that store for four or five
years,'' Cardona said. ``There are millions of bags out there.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, the baby's white casket, only slightly
larger than a shoe box, seemed lost inside the cavernous,
2,300-seat church with its soaring Gothic arches.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, Monsignor Anthony Dalla Villa, the rector of St.
Patrick's, noted the baby's tiny size and credited the event's
organizers for recognizing, as the American Indians had, that every
tree, every animal, every tiny, forgotten baby was sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has had a magnificent tribute and it would not have been
possible were it not for you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Cardona and Detective Anthony Nardi carried
the casket down the church steps to a hearse from the Charles J.
O'Shea Funeral Home while the Blue Knights of New York, a
motorcycle club for law enforcement professionals, lined up their
bikes behind the hearse for the ride to Holy Rood Cemetery in
Westbury.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation, a group
that assists the police with financial support, had donated $2,500
to ensure that the child was not buried in potter's field, the city
cemetery for the indigent. Instead, she was placed in a grave with
a marker that featured a police badge and the name the police gave
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided,'' said Martin, ``that she was going to leave this
world with a little more dignity than the way she came in.''

CONGRESS SENDS BILL OVERHAULING FINANCIAL SERVICES TO CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress approved on Thursday a landmark overhaul
of the financial services industry, paving the way for banks,
insurance and securities firms to merge more freely and sell each
other's products.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill by an overwhelming margin of 90-8,
and the House followed suit late Thursday night by a vote 362-57.
President Clinton is expected to sign it into law within a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation said it would allow consumers to
purchase banking, investment and insurance services from one
company, and that the consolidation would lead to more competition
and save consumers about $15 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said it would create large monopolies that could
lead to price gouging and weaken customers' financial privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the chief sponsor of the
deregulation measure, hailed it as the ``most important banking
bill passed in 60 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that it would take some time to determine
whether the bill proves beneficial to U.S. consumers by providing
better and cheaper financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe . . . that Americans will find that they will
benefit from deregulation,'' Gramm said after the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic change in policy. It is a dramatic change
in the financial structure of the country, and I believe it's a
change in the right direction,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., a co-sponsor of the legislation, said
the bill would provide ``a comprehensive statutory framework'' for
changes that have been taking place in the financial services
industry on ``ad-hoc basis'' for many years.
</P>
<P>
   He said that overall the legislation should provide protections
for consumers that do not exist, especially in the area of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Clinton said the bill ``will help the American
financial services system play a leading role in propelling our
economy into the 21st century . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long fight for the measure's passage, Gramm
referred to it as a measure that would bring ``one-stop shopping''
to the financial arena, giving consumers a diversity of products
from one source at more competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   With deregulation, banks, for example, will be able to offer not
only banking and loan services, but insurance and expanded
investment opportunities as well. Likewise, insurance companies and
securities firms will be able to offer financial services outside
their areas of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But handful of opponents of the measure led by Sens. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., sought to derail the
measure because of concerns that the legislation would give the
financial industry too much freedom to exchange consumer
information.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said the measure it would give banks ``the ability to
sell and exploit'' personal information without consent just to
make a profit. And he warned that approval of the bill could also
amount to ``aiding and abetting'' possible criminal activity that
trades on private information about individuals pilfered from
credit card and other financial records.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-stop shopping is not worth giving up your financial
privacy,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone also contended that the bill would result in
``price-gouging'' and would do nothing more than consolidate ``more
and more power in the hands of fewer and fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumer and legal groups opposed to the measure
also sought to kill it by calling attention to the massive
deregulation of the cable and communications industry enacted by
Congress two years ago. That bill was supposed to produce savings
for consumers as well, but ended up increasing costs in many parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters of the bill argued that while it does allow
affiliated financial companies to share personal data on customers
without their consent, they will still have the right _ but only in
the form of a written request _ to stop companies from sharing or
selling information about them to outside organizations, such as
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions would also be required to abide by state
privacy laws, many of which provide consumers with greater
protections than are outlined in the Gramm bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, and other supporters also argued
that the bill would reinforce and protect the Community
Reinvestment Act, by requiring banks wanting to expand into
insurance and other financial activities to ``have and maintain'' a
``satisfactory CRA rating from the federal government on making
loans to minority and low-income areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee also expressed support for the bill,
based on CRA protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a perfect bill, but it is a bill we should
(support),'' said Jackson Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such arguments were not enough to sway opponents who
insisted that the bill, as Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., put it, is
little more than ``consumer fraud masquerading as financial
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is consumers are going to be faced with a new
mega-merged world . . . run by only a few companies,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the financial industry has never had any incentive
in the first place to offer consumers better services and that they
will have ``even fewer'' now under the Gramm bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would marks the repeal of the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall regulation that has long-hampered the merger and
consolidation of different financial industries.
</P>
<P>
   The act came in response to the devastating stock market crash
of 1929 that triggered the Great Depression and was designed to
build barriers separating the financial services industry.

measure because of concerns that the legislation would give the
financial industry too much freedom to exchange consumer
information.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said the measure it would give banks ``the ability to
sell and exploit'' personal information without consent just to
make a profit. And he warned that approval of the bill could also
amount to ``aiding and abetting'' possible criminal activity that
trades on private information about individuals pilfered from
credit card and other financial records.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-stop shopping is not worth giving up your financial
privacy,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone also contended that the bill would result in
``price-gouging'' and would do nothing more than consolidate ``more
and more power in the hands of fewer and fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumer and legal groups opposed to the measure
also sought to kill it by calling attention to the massive
deregulation of the cable and communications industry enacted by
Congress two years ago. That bill was supposed to produce savings
for consumers as well, but ended up increasing costs in many parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters of the bill argued that while it does allow
affiliated financial companies to share personal data on customers
without their consent, they will still have the right _ but only in
the form of a written request _ to stop companies from sharing or
selling information about them to outside organizations, such as
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions would also be required to abide by state
privacy laws, many of which provide consumers with greater
protections than are outlined in the Gramm bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, and other supporters also argued
that the bill would reinforce and protect the Community
Reinvestment Act, by requiring banks wanting to expand into
insurance and other financial activities to ``have and maintain'' a
``satisfactory CRA rating from the federal government on making
loans to minority and low-income areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee also expressed support for the bill,
based on CRA protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a perfect bill, but it is a bill we should
(support),'' said Jackson Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such arguments were not enough to sway opponents who
insisted that the bill, as Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., put it, is
little more than ``consumer fraud masquerading as financial
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is consumers are going to be faced with a new
mega-merged world . . . run by only a few companies,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the financial industry has never had any incentive
in the first place to offer consumers better services and that they
will have ``even fewer'' now under the Gramm bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would marks the repeal of the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall regulation that has long-hampered the merger and
consolidation of different financial industries.
</P>
<P>
   The act came in response to the devastating stock market crash
of 1929 that triggered the Great Depression and was designed to
build barriers separating the financial services industry.

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest that the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Even with electrical power out, the pilots could have continued
flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables rather than
a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system failed, the
hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the engines were
running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
If Ken Griffey Jr. gets his wish, he will be wearing a new uniform
next season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How new remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Astros unveiled new uniforms for their inaugural
season at Enron Field, the hot topic was what _ if any _ plans the
club has in making a run at the 10-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just hopeful thinking,'' Astros owner Drayton
McLane Jr. said Thursday following the ceremony to unveil the
team's new colors and logo. ``It would be a real giant step for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, with one year left on his contract with the Seattle
Mariners, rejected an eight-year deal worth a reported $140 million
Tuesday and asked to be traded closer to his Orlando, Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who has veto power over any deal, has indicated he
would approve a trade to the Astros, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Cleveland
or the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, a one-hour flight from Orlando, is considered the
front-runner to land Griffey, who at 29 was the youngest member of
baseball's All-Century Team and is considered the biggest threat to
eclipse Hank Aaron's career home-run record of 755.
</P>
<P>
   General managers convene for their annual meetings Sunday in
Laguna Niguel, Calif., with Griffey certain to be the No. 1 topic.
Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker is co-chairing the weeklong event.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, a few people will be monitoring trade rumors
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure if Junior is coming here, I'd say (Billy) Wagner, I
and probably (Craig Biggio) are going to Seattle,'' Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``So enjoy Junior and the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Atlanta is the front-runner in his sweepstakes.
It makes sense to be in Atlanta. They train in Orlando, and they
are probably the only team that can afford somebody like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The asking price won't be cheap. Now that Seattle has said it
will try to accommodate Griffey, teams must find out whether they
can satisfy the Mariners' personnel needs and Griffey's financial
desires.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners probably would want a center fielder to replace
Griffey, plus pitching and top young players. Griffey is to make
$8.5 million in the final year of his current deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight million (dollars) would be a huge step for us,'' McLane
said. ``We'd probably have to double it to keep him. For our
market, that's a hard deal to do. And Seattle will probably drive a
hard bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros operated in 1999 with a $54 million payroll. Bagwell
was the highest-paid Houston player at $6.5 million. The Astros are
trying to work out contract extensions with Biggio, center fielder
Carl Everett and pitcher Mike Hampton, which would make a deal for
Griffey even less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell would like to see the Astros remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new field is going to do a lot for our revenue, and the
fan support will be great,'' he said. ``If you have those things,
maybe we can keep this team together. I want to be a Houston Astro
for the rest of my career. Hopefully, that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane, who expects negotiations with Biggio and his
representative to begin soon, said the club desperately wants to
keep the Bagwell-Biggio tandem intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been the heartbeat of the Houston Astros for the last
seven or eight years,'' McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker has only one concern if Griffey goes to
another National League club _ keeping him out of the Central
Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal to the Braves wouldn't pose that much of a threat,''
Dierker said. ``If he were to go to the Reds, that might make us a
little anxious.''

ZVI GRILICHES, 69, AUTHORITY ON ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Israel)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zvi Griliches, who spent part of his youth hiding from the Nazis
in his native Lithuania, survived Dachau, taught himself English in
seven months at a British internment camp and went on to become one
of the world's leading authorities on the statistical analysis of
economic data, died Thursday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was
69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from pancreatic cancer, his wife,
Diane Asseo Griliches, said.
</P>
<P>
   Griliches (pronounced GRILL-i-kus), who was the Paul M. Warburg
Professor of Economics at Harvard University, solved knotty
statistical problems with profound policy implications. Professor
Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard colleague and collaborator, said
Griliches' work in the late 1950s showed that publicly financed
research and development could produce large benefits for the
economy, extending well beyond the individual company or industry
that came up with an innovative product or production technique.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of hybrid corn, Griliches estimated, national income
rose by perhaps 40 cents a year for every dollar invested in its
research and development. His research developed methods for
analyzing the impact of economic factors on the speed with which
new technologies spread across the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists, building on Griliches' techniques, showed that
research and development in manufacturing also generated huge
economic benefits. In a recent review of Griliches' work on the
impact of research on productivity, Professor James Heckman of the
University of Chicago wrote that the analysis ``has stood up to the
test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Griliches helped improve the government's measure of inflation.
Consider, as did Griliches, the case of automobiles. One reason
that prices of new cars rise is inflation _ the rise in price over
time of cars with identical features. But car prices also rise
because new cars offer better features.
</P>
<P>
   To isolate the impact of inflation, Griliches and colleagues
pioneered the use of the technique, called hedonics, for measuring
the value to consumers of specific features, like style, size and
speed. That way, he could compare the value of new and old cars by
comparing the value of their separate features, isolating how much
of the rise in price was attributable to inflation alone.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Griliches influenced the way the government measures prices of
products whose quality changes over time, like pharmaceutical
drugs, computers and housing. His work therefore influenced the
government's measure of inflation, which affects the calculation of
tax brackets, Social Security benefits and many other federal
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Griliches served on the Boskin Commission, which was appointed
by Congress to review possible biases in measures of inflation and
reported in 1996 that the government's index overstated inflation
by 1.1 percentage points a year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Griliches' research also refuted prevailing arguments about the
impact of education on lifetime earnings. Economists observed that
students who attended school for more years earned higher income _
about 7 percent more for each additional year of schooling. The
question was why.
</P>
<P>
   The straightforward reason was that students who stayed in
school longer acquired skills that employers were willing to pay
for. But economists also thought that cause-and-effect ran in the
opposite direction: Students with more skills chose to stay in
school longer because they could most effectively take advantage of
further schooling. If this was true, encouraging less-skilled
students to stay in school longer might not do much to lift their
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Griliches' work powerfully put this anxiety to rest. By
designing careful measures of skills, he was able to show that more
schooling would raise wage offers even for less-skilled students
who would ordinarily not choose to stay in school longer. His
findings buttressed arguments of those who called for government
programs to help high school graduates attend college.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Griliches also helped develop techniques of statistical
estimation, including methods for analyzing ``panel'' data that
trace the behavior of many individuals or companies over time.
Social scientists could tackle these large data sets only after the
1960s, when powerful computers became widely available.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread through Griliches' work was the pursuit of
accurate measurement. He helped devise techniques for measuring
productivity _ output per hour of work _ and the benefits of
research and development that spill over from one sector to
another. Before Griliches, economists had trouble identifying the
reasons behind the historical increases in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   By devising better measures of the quality of educated and
uneducated workers and of the quality of different types of
equipment, Griliches and Jorgenson, writing together, provided
explanations for some of the previously unexplained trends in
productivity. Griliches wrote that his work showed ``that
education, investment in research and economies of scale were the
important sources of productivity growth in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Professor Alan Krueger of Princeton said Griliches was
influential because ``he got his hands dirty with actual data.'' In
a recent interview, Griliches said he did not pursue theory for its
own sake. ``I always started with an important problem and
developed whatever statistical tools were needed to provide
concrete answers.'' Those concrete answers, said Professor Ernst
Berndt of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ``make Zvi
Griliches among the pre-eminent empirical economists of the last
half century.''
</P>
<P>
   Griliches was an unlikely candidate to become one of the world's
premier economists. Born in Lithuania in 1930, he, his sister and
parents were moved to a Jewish ghetto by the Nazis in August 1941.
In June 1944, the Nazis sent him and his parents to concentration
camps in Germany. His parents died at the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated by Patton's 3rd Army in May 1945, Griliches took off
for Palestine, where he was captured by the British and sent for
seven months to an internment camp on Cyprus, where he taught
himself to read English. Because he was an orphan, Griliches was
quickly permitted to enter Palestine, which he did in 1947 at age
17. Two months later the war of independence broke out. He worked
on a kibbutz for a year before joining the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his almost complete lack of formal schooling, he learned
enough, with the help of correspondence courses and tutors, to pass
the entrance exams to Hebrew University, which he entered in 1950.
One year later, he transferred to the agriculture economics program
at the University of California at Berkeley, a course of study that
Israel encouraged because it was deemed essential to the fledgling
country.
</P>
<P>
   Griliches graduated from Berkeley and entered the graduate
program in economics at the University of Chicago in 1954. He
joined the faculty there in 1956 and completed his Ph.D. in 1957.
He moved to Harvard in 1969. Throughout his career, Griliches
maintained close ties with Israel and Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he was awarded the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal,
given every two years by the American Economic Association to the
best economist under the age of 40. He was elected to the National
Academy of Sciences in 1975 and served as the president of the
American Economic Association in 1993. He also published articles
on numismatics, driven by an interest in relatives of the same
family name who were well-known designers of coins and medals in
pre-Communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Griliches is survived by his wife; a daughter, Eve, of
Charlestown, Mass., and a son, Mark, of Brookline, Mass.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When asked how he could concentrate on the abstract world of
mathematical statistics after both his parents were murdered and
after suffering himself in Nazi work camps, Griliches said: ``After
we came out of the Holocaust, we did not look back. We had too much
trouble re-establishing some kind of life and getting going.
Besides, there was no point in dwelling. People like me were a dime
a dozen. Lots of people, everyone had a story. No one out there was
interested in our stories.''

   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Congress agreed Thursday night
to cut a deal on a foreign-aid bill, adding $799 million more than
Republicans wanted to spend, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said that relatively minor policy disagreements
remained but that the bottom-line figure was set.
</P>
<P>
   But in the battle, Republican leaders see a golden opportunity
to paint Democrats as more concerned about helping foreigners than
protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, the foreign aid bill was held up _ and with it,
the battle over the budget, in which five of 13 spending bills
remain unsigned _ as both sides argued over the desire of the White
House to spend $370 million to ease the debts of 41 impoverished
nations, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says the aid will ``enable the world's poorest and most
heavily indebted countries to finance health, education and
opportunity programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, calls it an
effort to ``rob the Social Security surplus to underwrite the
national debt of Nepal.''
</P>
<P>
   And aides to Speaker Dennis Hastert and DeLay say Democrats want
to spend money on foreign aid that would come from the Social
Security surplus, which both parties have sworn to protect. The
aides said the Republican leaders believe that argument could be
instrumental in helping Republicans keep control of Congress in the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   One aide said it boiled down to this: ``Ghana vs. Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   The aides say the Republicans will paint the Democrats as
willing to put foreign potentates before aging Americans. ``All
they want,'' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said on the House floor
Thursday, ``is to give the taxpayers' money away to foreign
countries and be damned what happens at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' tactics became clear during tense talks between
Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Republican Congress contained $12.7
billion, 14 percent less than Clinton's request. On Oct. 18, he
vetoed it, calling it ``another sign of the new isolationism that
would have America bury its head in the sand at the height of our
power and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators went into closed-door conference in Hastert's
office Wednesday night thinking they might make a deal. They did
not. A serious sticking point developed: debt relief for foreign
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wanted $370 million, about $1.20 per American, to help
the 41 nations identified by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund as ``heavily indebted'' lighten the burden of their
poverty. Thirty-three of those nations, including Ghana, are in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans held the line on debt relief at $123
million. This quarter-billion dollar difference was the biggest
barrier to completing the bill. Thursday night, a senior Republican
aide said they had won that argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they agreed to a White House proposal to add $799
million to their $12.7 billion bill. The major increases were $170
million in economic support funds, $150 million for international
development assistance, $104 million for nuclear-security programs
in the former Soviet Union, and $75 million for peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo. They earlier agreed to spend $1.8 billion
over three years to underwrite Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Now the White House and Congress will move on to negotiations
over four more bills, financing the Departments of Commerce,
Justice, State, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development and
federal money for the District of Columbia. They set a new deadline
Thursday night: Wednesday, Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders, including Hastert, voiced unhappiness at
having had to add nearly $2.6 billion to the foreign aid bill,
which will now have to pass the House and Senate. Republicans said
the argument over foreign aid versus Social Security would be a
main campaign theme in 2000, and political advertisements on the
issue may be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rebuttals. For example, it could be said that the
Republican-written spending bills dip by more than $17 million into
Social Security, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Since money comes from the same pot, any program can be identified
as the one that used Social Security money. Opponents of more
military spending, for example, point out that Congress increased
Pentagon spending by $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's view of debt relief _ he calls it ``American taxpayer
dollars sent overseas to subsidize the corruption and mismanagement
of foreign countries'' _ resonates with many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But not all: Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition and a former Republican presidential candidate, supports
debt relief. So do Pope John Paul II, the World Bank and most of
the world's aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt-relief initiative sends our tax dollars to make sure
children are educated and vaccinated, and there are roads to get
farmers' goods to markets,'' said Seth Amgott, spokesman for Oxfam,
a worldwide anti-poverty agency. ``An American contribution to that
effort is entirely worthy and eminently affordable.''

MAN WHO PUSHED WOMAN ONTO TRACKS NEEDED SUPERVISION, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MICHAEL WINERIP

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new state investigation into Andrew Goldstein's
psychiatric history concludes that the mental health system spent
nearly $100,000 a year to treat him through repeated short-term
hospital stays, when he really needed a far less costly combination
of supervised housing and daily visits from a case manager to
ensure that he took his medication.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years before Jan. 3, 1998, when Goldstein pushed
Kendra Webdale in front of a subway train, he was treated 14 times
at New York City hospitals, typically for a few weeks per stay, for
a total of 199 days. He was discharged to live on his own. The cost
to taxpayers for this psychiatric care in 1998 alone was $95,075,
primarily in Medicaid payments to hospitals, according to the study
by New York state's Commission on Quality of Care, an agency that
serves in a watchdog role, overseeing New York's mental health
system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Goldstein ``nor the public were well served by this
fragmented and costly approach,'' says the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that for $25,310 a year, Goldstein could have
lived in supervised, state-financed housing ``with day services,
clinic visits and an intensive case manager.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, directors of housing agencies, hospital
administrators and advocates for the mentally ill have criticized
the state for failing to provide adequate financing for these kinds
of comprehensive community services. At present, in New York City,
the wait for intensive case managers and housing with 24-hour
supervision can range from several months to more than a year,
these administrators and advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-page report, obtained by The New York Times from an
advocate who supports increased spending for mental health care, is
marked ``confidential draft'' and has not yet been made public.
</P>
<P>
   The state's response to the report, also not yet made public,
but faxed to The Times by the state Office of Mental Health,
indicates that the governor will be budgeting additional financing
for mental health services. ``Governor Pataki will be proposing a
comprehensive package of new and innovative mental health
initiatives, including increased case management services and
supported housing,'' the response says.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to the governor said Thursday night that there would be
a significant commitment of new money for the mentally ill proposed
in the governor's budget in January, but the aide would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, his hospital social workers and his mother, Barbara,
a secretary in Queens, frequently tried to get him supervised
services, according to the report, but they were informed that
there were no vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, 30, who is schizophrenic and has a 10-year
psychiatric record that goes on for 3,500 pages, ``consistently
failed to take prescribed medication after discharge unless he was
in a supervised setting,'' says the report, which documents more
than a dozen attacks by Goldstein on strangers in 1997 and 1998.
His revolving-door care ended with a discharge from North General
Hospital on Dec. 15, 1998; 18 days later he killed Ms. Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Goldstein's criminal case ended in a
mistrial, after jurors deadlocked over whether he met the legal
definition of insanity when he killed Ms. Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   The state commission's report says that Goldstein's stay in
24-hour supervised residences during the mid-1990s ``represented
the last period of stability in his life, prior to the January 1999
tragedy.'' During those years, the report says, he ``required no
hospitalizations'' and ``received on-site services, including
critical medication monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   During his final hospitalization before the Webdale killing, a
social worker at North General made an application for an intensive
case manager, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not easy getting one. Peter Campanelli, director of
the Institute for Community Living, one of the largest housing
providers for the mentally ill in New York, says it typically takes
five to six months. ``There just aren't enough out there,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spencer Eth, director of psychiatry at St. Vincent's
Hospital in Manhattan, says his staff is constantly forced to
discharge patients before there is a case manager or supervised
housing available. ``The resources just aren't there,'' Eth said.
``What happens is you have a tacit collusion between the hospital
and the patient. The hospital and patient know it's not realistic
to wait for a case manager or housing, the patient is getting
restless, and so the person is discharged improved, but likely to
relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   That, the state report says, is precisely what happened to
Goldstein. Beginning in 1997, when the repeated hospitalizations
began, Goldstein would, upon discharge, typically be referred for
monthly appointments at an outpatient clinc, which ``he would
either not attend or attend only sporadically,'' the report says.
``He was simply too sick for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the commission find the Goldstein case an isolated
situation. ``It has been the commission's experience, the report
says, that the problematic issues reflected in the'' Goldstein case
``are not uncommon.''

EDITORIAL: DISCRIMINATORY SEARCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 5:
</P>
<P>
   When law enforcement officials resort to tactics that
discriminate against law-abiding citizens, it is the job of the
courts to demand firm adherence to the Constitution. Sadly, a
federal appeals court in Manhattan failed in that duty last week in
a case growing out of a notorious 1992 incident in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was triggered when an elderly woman was robbed in
her home near the State University campus in Oneonta. She said her
assailant was a young black man who may have cut his hand or arm
with a knife used in the robbery. In a belief that the culprit had
fled to the campus, officers got college officials to violate the
privacy of students' personnel records to produce a list of all
male African-American students.
</P>
<P>
   These students were then interrogated _ sometimes belligerently
_ and checked by officers for wounds. When that campus-wide
operation failed to yield any suspects, the police cast a still
wider net. They stopped for questioning and physical examination
every African-American they could find in and around the city. This
search, too, was unsuccessful. Everyone stopped turned out to be
innocent. The assailant was never found.
</P>
<P>
   The state's governor, Mario Cuomo, and university officials
later apologized for this offensive race-based dragnet. But,
remarkably, a three-judge panel from the 2nd Circuit Court of
Appeals has now given its approval for the tactic. In upholding a
similarly myopic lower court ruling, the panel found that the broad
sweep of blacks violated neither the 14th Amendment's equal
protection clause or the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision acknowledged the ``sense of frustration''
felt by those caught up in the sweep, and the potentially
detrimental impact such practices have on community relations. But
it reasoned that the dragnet, carried out over several days, did
not constitute discriminatory racial profiling. The flimsy
rationale was that the officers were not targeting people for
interrogation based solely on their race.
</P>
<P>
   While such stops ``may well have a disparate impact on small
minority groups in towns such as Oneonta,'' the panel said, the
impact was not unconstitutional because there was no discriminatory
intent. The panel was apparently untroubled by the fact that this
technique would never be used against whites. It goes on to suggest
that it can be useful for police to stop every black person for
interrogation in towns with few blacks because of the
administrative convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Under the panel's approach _ and in light of its failure to
announce any principles for narrowing the use of race-based stops _
police are free to treat every black person they see on the streets
as a potential suspect, so long as there is a pending complaint
that a black person committed a crime. That open invitation to
abuse cries out for reversal by the full 2nd Circuit.  &QL;

MCCAIN _ Sen. John McCain's temper has been quietly discussed among
political insiders in Arizona since he first ran for Congress in
1982. But with the recent national focuson his campaign for the
White House, more people are going public with their accounts of
McCain's fury. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MCCAIN-TV _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Thursday that he gets
angry at people ``when I see injustice done,'' but that his
``passionate'' nature doesn't make him unsuitable for the
presidency. During an interview on ABC, McCain also suggested that
evidence exists that The Arizona Republic, which editorialized last
Sunday about his ``volcanic'' temper, was waging a vendetta against
him. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

CONGRESS APPROVES SWEEPING NEW BANKING LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (This story is now the lede of the paper) 
(TOPS with 4 grafs with House approval; ADDS graf after optional
trim with breakdown of House vote; changes headline)  (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress approved landmark legislation on Thursday
that opens the door for a new era on Wall Street in which
commercial banks, securities houses and insurers will find it
easier and cheaper to enter one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, considered by many the most important banking
legislation in 66 years, was approved in the Senate by a vote of
90-8 and in the House Thursday night by 362-57. The bill will now
be sent to the president, who is expected to sign it, aides said.
It would become one of the most significant achievements this year
by the White House and the Republicans leading the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed
financial services since the Great Depression and replace them with
a system for the 21st century,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said. ``This historic legislation will better enable
American companies to compete in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 provoked
dire warnings from a handful of dissenters that the deregulation of
Wall Street would someday wreak havoc on the nation's financial
system. The original idea behind Glass-Steagall was that separation
between bankers and brokers would reduce the potential conflicts of
interest that were thought to have contributed to the speculative
stock frenzy before the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a rich congressional debate on Thursday about the
history of finance in America in this century, the causes of the
banking crisis of the 1930s, the globalization of banking and the
future of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and many Republicans and Democrats said
the measure would save consumers billions of dollars and was
necessary to keep up with trends in both domestic and international
banking. Some institutions, like Citigroup, already have banking,
insurance and securities arms but could have been forced to divest
their insurance underwriting under existing law. Foreign banks in
many industrial countries already enjoy the ability to enter the
securities and insurance industries without the same restrictions
imposed on American institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world changes, and we have to change with it,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, who wrote the law that will bear his name
along with the two other main Republican sponsors, Rep. James Leach
of Iowa and Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr. of Virginia. ``We have a new
century coming, and we have an opportunity to dominate that century
the same way we dominated this century. Glass-Steagall, in the
midst of the Great Depression, came at a time when the thinking was
that the government was the answer. In this era of economic
prosperity, we have decided that freedom is the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and civil rights advocates criticized the
legislation for being a sop to the nation's biggest financial
institutions. They say that it fails to protect the privacy
interests of consumers and community lending standards for the
disadvantaged and that it will create more problems than it solves.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the measure gloomily predicted that by
unshackling banks and enabling them to move more freely into new
kinds of financial activities, the new law could lead to an
economic crisis down the road when the marketplace is no longer
growing briskly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will look back in 10 years' time and say we should
not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the
past, and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010,''
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``I wasn't around during the 1930s
or the debate over Glass-Steagall. But I was here in the early
1980s when it was decided to allow the expansion of savings and
loans. We have now decided in the name of modernization to forget
the lessons of the past, of safety and of soundness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said that Congress had ``seemed
determined to unlearn the lessons from our past mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scores of banks failed in the Great Depression as a result of
unsound banking practices, and their failure only deepened the
crisis,'' Wellstone said. ``Glass-Steagall was intended to protect
our financial system by insulating commercial banking from other
forms of risk. It was one of several stabilizers designed to keep a
similar tragedy from recurring. Now Congress is about to repeal
that economic stabalizer without putting any comparable safeguard
in its place.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation rejected those arguments. They
responded that historians and economists have concluded that the
Glass-Steagall Act was not the correct response to the banking
crisis because it was the failure of the Federal Reserve in
carrying out monetary policy, not speculation in the stock market,
that caused the collapse of 11,000 banks during the depths of the
Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the supporters said, the new law will give
financial companies the ability to diversify and therefore reduce
their risks. The new law, they said, will also give regulators new
tools to supervise shaky institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns that we will have a meltdown like 1929 are
dramatically overblown,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the legislation was essential for the future
leadership of the American banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't pass this bill, we could find London or Frankfurt
or years down the road Shanghai becoming the financial capital of
the world,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``There are many
reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that
U.S. financial firms remain competitive. Like their international
competitors now, U.S. firms will be able to offer financial
services to complement their business models.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many experts predict that, even though the legislation has been
trailing market trends that have begun to see the cross-ownership
of banks, securities firms and insurers, the new law is certain to
lead to a wave of large financial mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has estimated the legislation could
wind up saving consumers as much as $18 billion a year as new
financial conglomerates gain economies of scale and wring out
excessive costs.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts have disputed those estimates as overly
optimistic, and that the bulk of any profits seen from the
deregulation of financial services would be returned not to the
customers of banks, but to their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the key provisions of the legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _Banks will be able to affiliate with insurance companies and
securities concerns with far fewer restrictions than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _The legislation preserves the regulatory structure in
Washington and gives the Federal Reserve and the Office of
Comptroller of the Currency roles in regulating new financial
conglomerates. The Securities and Exchange Commission will oversee
securities operations at any bank, and the states will continue to
regulate insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _It will be more difficult for industrial companies to control a
bank. The measure closes a loophole that had permitted a number of
commercial enterprises to open savings associations known as
unitary thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican senator, Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted against
the legislation. He was joined by seven Democrats: Barbara Boxer of
California, Richard Bryan of Nevada, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin,
Tom Harkin of Iowa, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Dorgan and
Wellstone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the House, 155 Democrats and 207 Republicans voted for the
measure, while 51 Democrats, five Republicans and one independent
opposed it. Fifteen members did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in the legislation is a provision that some experts
on Thursday warned could cost insurance policyholders as much as
$50 billion. The provision would allow mutual insurance companies
to move to other states to avoid compensating policyholders as they
reorganize their corporate structure. Present law in many states
does not allow such relocations without the consent of the
insurer's domicile state. But the legislation before Congress would
pre-empt the states.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and the Prudential Life
Insurance Co. are in the midst of reorganizing into stock-based
corporations that are requiring them to pay billions of dollars to
policyholders from years of accumulated surplus. In exchange, the
policyholders give up their ownership in the mutual insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would permit any mutual insurance company to
avoid making surplus payments to policyholders by simply moving to
states with more permissive laws and setting up a hybrid corporate
structure known as a mutual holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was inserted by Bliley at the urging of a trade
association. It was supported by other insurance groups, and
attracted little opposition because it was attached to a provision
that forbids insurers from discriminating against women who are
victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Congress this week, Summers said that the
provision ``could allow insurance companies to avoid state law
protecting policyholders, enriching insiders at the expense of
consumers.''

PFIZER IN $82.4 BILLION HOSTILE BID TO BREAK UP MERGER OF DRUG
COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert `over three years' in 9th graf, re cost savings.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hours after executives of American Home Products Corp. and
Warner-Lambert Co. announced a $70 billion merger agreement
Thursday, Pfizer Inc. tried to break the deal up with an $82.4
billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts who follow the pharmaceutical industry said
Thursday night that a still-higher offer could emerge for
Warner-Lambert, either from American Home or Pfizer, or even from
another drug company. Warner-Lambert's board met Thursday night and
reaffirmed its commitment to American Home, saying that the terms
of Pfizer's offer, which call for the elimination of a $2 billion
payment agreed to by Warner-Lambert and American Home if one
company backed out of their deal, made the bid difficult to
evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert is considered a prize within the industry because
of its blockbuster products, including the cholesterol-fighting
drug Lipitor marketed jointly with Pfizer, and its many other
treatments under development.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has become intense among the world's largest drug
makers to ensure a pipeline of lucrative breakthrough drugs _
compounds that are billion-dollar sellers and control a commanding
share of the market. Companies also need to replace drugs losing
patent protection, which become vulnerable to cheaper generic
products, and want to amass bigger research budgets in the hope of
generating highly successful drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's bid for Warner-Lambert shatters all such records in the
industry. The $82.4 billion offer is, in fact, the biggest hostile
bid ever made for any company, and the deal, if completed, would be
one of the largest of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   If Pfizer were to acquire Warner-Lambert, it would be by far the
biggest drug company. Astra Zeneca, now the world's largest, had
$10.68 billion in worldwide prescription drug sales last year and
4.2 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would have $15.9 billion in sales and
a 6.3 percent share. Drug-stock analysts said that because Pfizer
would have a relatively small share of a splintered market, and
because the companies had little overlap, antitrust issues were not
expected to be a factor in completing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, Warner-Lambert were to complete its
friendly merger with American Home Products, the combined
AmericanWarner would still be the biggest drug company, but with
sales of $13.8 billion and 5.5 percent of the total market.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Warner-Lambert's 43,000 employees, 3,000 of
whom work in New Jersey, would fare in a Pfizer acquisition. Some
analysts said Pfizer would probably close Warner-Lambert's
headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., and cut other jobs from the
company's confectionary or manufacturing divisions. Pfizer, which
is based in New York City, has 46,400 employees spread worldwide.
The company said Thursday that it expected $1.2 billion in cost
savings over three years once the acquisition was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some jobs at Warner-Lambert's headquarters would
almost certainly be eliminated if it merged with American Home. At
their news conference, the companies' executives announced that
AmericanWarner would be based in American Home Products' corporate
center in Madison, N.J.. But they declined to specify how many jobs
might be lost. They estimated cost savings of $1.2 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's bid leaves American Home Products in a potentially
vulnerable position. When announcing the deal with Warner-Lambert,
American Home's chief executive said his third attempt at a merger
would be a charm. Previous agreements between American Home and
SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto fell apart over conflicts on who
would have executive control. Though that matter had apparently
been worked out with Warner-Lambert, the issue may not be so easily
resolved now.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the uncertain fortunes for American Home, its
stock price fell Thursday, even though the company had become an
acquisition target, something that would normally push up a
company's stock price. Investors seemed to wonder whether it could
fetch a premium over its current price.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said Thursday that it could be months before any
merger deal is finalized for any of the companies involved. Several
European companies _ including Glaxo Wellcome and Novartis _ have
long been seen as possible acquirers in the industry, especially if
they can increase their prescription drug sales in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to figuring out which company may make an
acquisition, you can play chessboard here to your heart's
content,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a
biopharmacological research firm in New York. ``It's hard to
identify specific large companies that would not feel compelled to
go in this round.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pfizer's executives expressed confidence Thursday
that their bid would be successful, questions remained. American
Home Products and Warner-Lambert agreed that ending their merger
would cost $2 billion to the party backing out, and they included a
clause in the contract making an exchange of shares difficult for
another company.
</P>
<P>
   Upon making its offer, Pfizer immediately filed a lawsuit in
Delaware, where most big companies are incorporated, contesting the
$2 billion break-up fee. William Steere, Pfizer's chairman, said
Thursday in an interview that Pfizer's offer was contingent on both
roadblocks being removed. He called the break-up fee ``egregious
and unheard of'' for a deal of that size.

</P>
<P>
   While mergers in the pharmaceutical industry are relatively
common, the current triangle between Pfizer, American Home Products
and Warner-Lambert has more intrigue than most. John Stafford,
American Home Products' chairman, had been chastised for his two
failed merger attempts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware that Pfizer was preparing a hostile bid, Stafford and
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, the chairman of Warner-Lambert, began
explaining the details of their merger to reporters at the Plaza
Hotel at 11:30 a.m. Thursday. When asked about his past two
failures, Stafford smiled and said that ``this deal, the one with
Warner-Lambert, is going to be a charm.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was ominous. Before 1 p.m., news reports appeared
that Pfizer was preparing a competing offer for Warner-Lambert.
Steere, who has been regarded as one of the drug industry's more
genteel chief executives, then made public a letter that he had
sent to de Vink detailing Pfizer's offer. While Steere addressed
the letter, ``Dear Lodewijk,'' he noted that he had tried to
discuss the issue several times with de Vink, only to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter contained pretty strong language for Pfizer,'' said
Mehta, the stock analyst. ``It was clear that Warner had stalled
them. But what's really interesting is that Pfizer detailed all
these benefits of the arrangement, and the last one on the list was
growth opportunities for management and key employees.''
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the negotiations, Steere and de
Vink had talked seriously about a possible merger recently. The
weekend before Halloween, Pfizer executives had heard rumors that
de Vink was having merger discussions with another company, said a
person close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer had entered into an agreement with Warner-Lambert on
March 4, 1996, that said it could not make an offer for the company
unless a rival did so first. So on Oct. 25, Steere sent de Vink a
letter suggesting that if Warner-Lambert was considering a merger,
he should talk to Pfizer. The two executives agreed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink went to Steere's office on 42nd Street in New York two
days later to discuss the strategic benefits of a combination.
``Mr. de Vink had one question,'' said the executive close to the
companies. ``Where am I in this merger?'' Steere said he had not
considered de Vink's role in a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   An investment banker who asked not to be identified said de Vink
wanted to avoid his company's being taken over entirely by another.
And Pfizer, along with SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome, was
one of the few threats. So on Oct. 29, said the executive close to
the company, de Vink called Steere and told him he would be
interested in a merger only with a company of similar size.
Further, de Vink said his company was not ``going to do anything
now, but do something in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3, there were press reports of the talks between
American Home and Warner-Lambert, and Steere sent de Vink a letter
saying he was surprised and disappointed to learn of the proposed
merger and urged a meeting as soon as possible. The second letter,
dated Nov. 4, provided details of Pfizer's formal offer to buy
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which company succeeds with its offer,
Warner-Lambert's shareholders are almost sure to gain.
</P>
<P>
   In deals with a hostile bidder, the highest price does not
always carry the day. Warner-Lambert's board could decide that its
long-term prospects are better with American Home and ask that
company to pay a premium. American Home, however, has fewer
financial resources than Pfizer and may have some liabilities still
to come from its problems with the fen-phen diet drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Warner-Lambert shareholder, I'm sure that I'll win,''
said Brian Stansky, a vice president at T. Rowe Price, which owns
shares in all three companies. ``If you're an American Home
Products shareholder, you'll win because if the company doesn't get
this deal, then it will soon get another.''
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting Thursday at the Plaza, Stafford and de Vink
emphasized that their combined company would be the largest in
over-the-counter brands and prescription drugs and could realize
cost savings by merging certain operations. If Warner-Lambert were
to be acquired by Pfizer, the combined company could have similar
savings, given it would tower over its next competitor in
prescription drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what has driven Pfizer's offer, in part, is the company's
promotional arrangement with Warner-Lambert to sell Lipitor. The
drug is expected to be one of the biggest sellers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the arrangement, Warner-Lambert got two drugs from
Pfizer's pipeline, a combination of Lipitor and Norvasc, a
cardiovascular drug, and Relpax, a migraine treatment. Pfizer
executives see a chance to expand what has been a very profitable
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is perhaps best known for its Viagra impotency drug and
Zoloft antidepressant, but also makes Plax dental rinse and
Barbasol shaving cream. Its rival for Warner's affection, American
Home, makes Advil painkiller along with Premarin, the world's most
popular hormone replacement, and Effexor, an antidepressant, and is
said to be looking for a buyer for its agricultural division.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is offering 2.5 of its shares for each Warner-Lambert
share. Based on the stock's close on Wednesday, that amounts to
$96.40 a share, or $82.4 billion. The combined company would have a
market value of $220 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Warner-Lambert's merge agreement with American Home
Products, each company would retain 50 percent of the new company
and new shares would be issued. The deal was valued at $70 billion,
based on the stocks' prices as of Tuesday. The combined company
would have a market value of $148 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pfizer closed Thursday at $37.25, down 3.4 percent, or
$1.3125. American Home's stock fell $1, or 1.7 percent, to $55.
Warner-Lambert's stock jumped 7.4 percent, or $6.1875, to $90.
</P>
<P>
   As Warner-Lambert's executives pondered Pfizer's bid Thursday,
analysts were already speculating that Steere would raise his bid
to end any further negotiations. Stock analysts said Warner-Lambert
could be worth as much as $110 a share.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the prospect of a higher offer, Steere refused
to comment on speculation. ``We think the offer that we have out
there now is a fabulous offer,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: THWARTING PATIENTS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 5:
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert suffered an embarrassing defeat
last month when 68 Republicans defied his leadership and voted with
the Democrats to approve a strong patients' rights bill. Now he is
trying to undo that vote through parliamentary maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan patients' rights bill, sponsored by Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga., and John Dingell, D-Mich., seeks to set national
standards for managed care companies and to give patients the right
to sue health plans for damages caused by a denial of benefits.
Republican leaders in the House have been fighting the liability
provision and other strong patient protections for years, but this
time around Hastert could not persuade enough members of his own
party to vote no. It was the most striking rebuff to the leadership
since the Republicans took control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to bow to what the public clearly wants, the speaker
is now trying to sneak around the House vote through his power to
appoint members to the conference committee that will reconcile the
strong House measure with the vastly weaker Senate bill.
Traditionally, House leaders appoint conferees from among a bill's
supporters, but this time Hastert has appointed House members who
voted overwhelmingly against the Norwood-Dingell bill. This gives
the leadership the opportunity to kill off provisions, like the
right to sue, in conference, and produce a feeble version of the
bill that will either be rejected by a majority of the House or
vetoed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Of 13 Republican conferees appointed by the leadership, only
Michael Bilirakis voted for the bill, and he did so only after
voting for much weaker alternatives that failed. Neither Norwood,
the bill's chief author, nor other Republican proponents like Greg
Ganske were allowed on the conference committee. The freeze-out is
so transparently against House sentiment that the Democrats offered
to appoint Norwood to one of their seats on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   In making his appointments, Hastert has come up with a
parliamentarian's rationale for ignoring House rules that require
that a majority of the conferees support the House position on the
legislation. When the Norwood-Dingell bill passed, it was attached
as an amendment to another bill, a wasteful package of
health-related tax breaks that the Democrats oppose. Hastert argues
that his conferees supported the tax-break bill, of which
Norwood-Dingell is now a part, so their appointment technically
complies with House rules.
</P>
<P>
   This ploy may be a clever way around the rules. But it will only
strengthen the public's perception that the Republican Party is
opposed to popular concerns about health care and remains a captive
of the insurance lobby. As Norwood says, ``Our party has no
credibility on HMO reform.'' The Democrats in next year's elections
are sure to bash the Republicans for selling out on patients'
rights. They will have every reason to do so now that Hastert has
given them the hammer.

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest that the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Even with electrical power out, the pilots could have continued
flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables rather than
a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system failed, the
hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the engines were
running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

LAKERS SUBS PROVE TO BE SUB-THING ELSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice have combined for
96 points in two games, and that much was predictable despite
Rice's slow warmup to the triangle offense. What the Los Angeles
Lakers couldn't know was what would happen when those two took a
breather.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Lakers' solid starting five the roster is a jumble of
rookies, veteran reclamation projects and a couple of former
starters, some of them still learning each other's names. There
isn't a well-defined sixth man in the bunch. Coach Phil Jackson
doesn't even have a substitution pattern _ he has a boxed set of
12.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the disparate pieces are starting to form a cohesive
second unit.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday, the Lakers' bench
accounted for 41 points, 20 rebounds, eight assists and six steals
in a 103-88 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox, a former starter, had 15 points. Ten-year veteran
Brian Shaw, the last man to sign a contract, scored 10. Second-year
guard Tyronn Lue, presumed too short, at 6-foot, to play for
Jackson, played 17 minutes, contributing four points and frenetic
energy. John Salley, unretired after three years in a TV studio,
got five rebounds and two points in 10 minutes. Rookie Devean
George added six points and three rebounds in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the subs' play ``really critical'' to the win.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the second unit's best minutes lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a whole, when you have a little bit of success, it
builds some confidence,'' he said. `` You find yourself recognizing
things a lot quicker. You don't second-guess any opportunities. You
basically attack. I think we've become more of an attacking unit
now that we've kind of settled into a little more of an
understanding of what it is we do in our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the preseason games we were rather passive. I know
I personally was,'' Fox said. ``We tried to find our way through
the system and where the opportunities would be. The regular season
is here and there's not a whole lot of time to try to figure things
out. You just have to go on the fly and not be afraid to make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the second unit is aiming to be a defensive team that
scores primarily off the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we're going to have to be sparkplugs and provide
a lot of energy,'' he said. ``We want to develop our own identity
and style and if we can help it, not even get into the triangle
offense at all. That way we don't have to worry about being
confused at all. Just play good defense, get it out and go....
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain nights the starters are going to be flat, and we're
going to have to come in and provide that punch. (Tuesday) night,
the starters played all the minutes (at Utah), and carried us
through that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant had the cast removed from his broken
right hand Thursday, and team doctors replaced it with a protective
splint. He still is not expected to be cleared to play for a
minimum of three weeks, the team said.

<P>
   Bryant broke his hand Oct. 22 in an exhibition game.
</P>

AIKMAN'S HEADACHES CONTINUE, BUT HE EXPECTS TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There's more on Troy Aikman's mind this week
than just a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Concussion-like symptoms have persisted for nearly five days
after the Dallas Cowboys quarterback took a helmet-to-helmet hit in
the loss Sunday to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern, there's no question,'' Aikman said Thursday on
the heels of a favorable result from a magnetic resonance imaging
exam taken Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I don't know how much an MRI shows,'' Aikman
admitted. ``Mine came back showing no spots on the brain. If there
are spots, you're probably two years too late anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the severity and the length of the headaches have
subsided since earlier in the week, Aikman said, the headaches
still ``come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Before attending meetings and practicing with the team at Valley
Ranch, Aikman said that he expects to play Monday night at
Minnesota. But he cautioned that he will grow even more concerned
than he is now if the headaches persist into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the headaches to stop by the time we roll
around to the game. If they don't (subside), then obviously there's
some real concern there,'' said Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't experienced dizziness or vision problems. And with the
exception of Sunday night, he hasn't had any difficulty sleeping or
eating.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't make the concerns of post-concussion syndrome
go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that it's not a concern would be naive and would be
untrue,'' Aikman said of playing with concussion-like symptoms, as
he did Sunday. ``But once I decide to play, I can't concern myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the case Monday night. If I'm playing, I'm not
going to worry about getting hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman already plans to look into visiting a head-trauma
specialist after the season. Two possibilities for Aikman to visit
are specialists at Stanford and Harvard, both of whom come
recommended by his agent, Leigh Steinberg, who has done
considerable study on head traumas over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg continues to research the subject because of a
personal case involving his 11-year-old son, as well as that of San
Francisco quarterback Steve Young, a Steinberg client who has
missed most of the season with post-concussion syndrome that may
end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman clarified Thursday that he hasn't had any of the vomiting
and dizziness that Young has experienced _ only the headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions on concussions have been ongoing between Aikman and
Steinberg, but Aikman admitted, ``Obviously, it's come to the
forefront based on what happened to me last weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who turns 33 this month, has had six concussions,
including college. A concussion has never forced him to miss the
next game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are not calling this head injury a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was advised by the team medical staff on the sideline
Sunday to sit out one series after an unimpeded corner blitz by the
Colts' Jeff Burris in the third quarter. Aikman returned one series
later to finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey saw a ``normal'' Aikman take his usual number
of repetitions in practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked great,'' said Gailey, adding that Cowboys trainer
Jim Maurer had told him that the quarterback's headaches were
``fewer and farther between, which is a normal and a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was unaware of Aikman's concerns beyond that. Although
when informed of those concerns, Gailey did talk to his quarterback
after practice for about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey had no comment on the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy may have had some headaches,'' Maurer said, ``but it was
nothing that interfered with his practice. Afterward, he wasn't in
the training room, so that can be taken to mean there were no
further problems.'' nn

LANDRY FAMILY HOPEFUL ABOUT COACH'S HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legendary Cowboys coach Tom Landry remained Thursday in a Dallas
hospital, where doctors continue to express hope that his leukemia
can be placed in remission.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source who spoke with the family, Baylor
University Medical Center physicians are treating Landry with
chemotherapy in an effort to fight chronic myelogenous leukemia, a
disease that impairs the production of red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   A report Thursday in ``USA Today'' fanned rumors that Landry was
gravely ill. Landry's longtime quarterback, Roger Staubach, was
quoted in the story, but said Thursday that the report was
misleading and that he, too, is optimistic that the coach's
condition can improve.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star-Telegram'' reported one week ago that Landry had
returned to Baylor Medical Center for further treatment. Landry was
unable to attend a gala held in his and Staubach's honor to aid the
Bobby Bragan Youth Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's wife of 50 years, Alicia, represented him at the
banquet and said at that time, ``The doctors are still cautiously
optimistic. And he and I are very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry coached the Cowboys to five Super Bowls and 270 victories
in the club's first 29 seasons. His Cowboys teams won Super Bowls
VI and XII.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the ``USA Today'' report, the Landry family issued
a statement Thursday which said, ``While he has not yet gone into
remission, the family remains optimistic that the treatment will be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry was hospitalized, the statement explained, ``because
patients at this stage are susceptible to infection.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the coach's leukemia first surfaced May 8. He underwent
a first round of chemotherapy treatments at that time. nn

SECONDARY WOES NOTHING LIKE IN '98 VIKINGS GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Sure, Dallas Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders is
nursing a sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   And free safety George Teague, out the past two games with a
herniated disk, and third cornerback Kevin Mathis, out last week
with a strained hamstring, might be rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, those are not the ideal conditions you'd like to be
in when facing the Minnesota Vikings and their multi-talented
receiver corps of Randy Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed.
</P>
<P>
   However, you won't see Cowboys coach Chan Gailey complaining. To
him, the Cowboys' secondary couldn't be better.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly could be a lot worse _ like in last year's
Thanksgiving Day 46-36 blowout by the Vikings, when Moss and
company exploited a Cowboys' secondary that featured Charlie
Williams, practice-squad callup Terry Billups and safety Kenny
Wheaton as cornerbacks .
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and Mathis didn't even suit up because of injuries, and
starting cornerback Kevin Smith was sidelined halfway through the
game. Moss caught touchdown passes of 51, 56 and 56 yards. Carter,
who caught seven passes for 135 yards on the day, burned the
Cowboys for a 54-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is not promising any shutdown of those receivers but
admits he feels a little better about the secondary group that will
trot out against the Vikings on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was absent from practice Thursday attending personal
business, Gailey said. Sanders, who is listed as probable for the
Vikings game, is expected to practice on a limited basis Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Teague and Mathis practiced Thursday and are expected to be
ready for the game.
HELMET REVIEWS ARE IN
</P>
<P>
   The new, lighter helmets got mixed reviews in practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys equipment manager Mike McCord said quarterback Troy
Aikman and tackle Erik Williams declined to wear the helmets
because they didn't like the way they looked.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson, fullback Robert Thomas, defensive end
Kavika Pittman and defensive tackle Chad Hennings wore the helmets
in practice and gave them positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it,'' Woodson said. ``It felt good. It's light and
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson liked it so much that he is pressing McCord to let him
wear it Monday against the Vikings. McCord said he will likely take
Woodson's new and the old helmet to the game. The other players
probably won't use their new helmets until Nov. 14 against the
Green Bay Packers, McCord said.
</P>
<P>
   Bike makes the new helmet, which is 1.5 pounds lighter than the
standard helmet. The helmet might potentially reduce the risk of
head and neck injuries because the lighter weight is expected to
cut down on neck fatigue late in games, thus aiding players in
keeping their heads up when making tackles.

LAKERS SUBS PROVE TO BE SUB-THING ELSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice have combined for
96 points in two games, and that much was predictable despite
Rice's slow warmup to the triangle offense. What the Los Angeles
Lakers couldn't know was what would happen when those two took a
breather.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Lakers' solid starting five the roster is a jumble of
rookies, veteran reclamation projects and a couple of former
starters, some of them still learning each other's names. There
isn't a well-defined sixth man in the bunch. Coach Phil Jackson
doesn't even have a substitution pattern _ he has a boxed set of
12.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the disparate pieces are starting to form a cohesive
second unit.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday, the Lakers' bench
accounted for 41 points, 20 rebounds, eight assists and six steals
in a 103-88 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox, a former starter, had 15 points. Ten-year veteran
Brian Shaw, the last man to sign a contract, scored 10. Second-year
guard Tyronn Lue, presumed too short, at 6-foot, to play for
Jackson, played 17 minutes, contributing four points and frenetic
energy. John Salley, unretired after three years in a TV studio,
got five rebounds and two points in 10 minutes. Rookie Devean
George added six points and three rebounds in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the subs' play ``really critical'' to the win.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the second unit's best minutes lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a whole, when you have a little bit of success, it
builds some confidence,'' he said. `` You find yourself recognizing
things a lot quicker. You don't second-guess any opportunities. You
basically attack. I think we've become more of an attacking unit
now that we've kind of settled into a little more of an
understanding of what it is we do in our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the preseason games we were rather passive. I know
I personally was,'' Fox said. ``We tried to find our way through
the system and where the opportunities would be. The regular season
is here and there's not a whole lot of time to try to figure things
out. You just have to go on the fly and not be afraid to make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the second unit is aiming to be a defensive team that
scores primarily off the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we're going to have to be sparkplugs and provide
a lot of energy,'' he said. ``We want to develop our own identity
and style and if we can help it, not even get into the triangle
offense at all. That way we don't have to worry about being
confused at all. Just play good defense, get it out and go....
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain nights the starters are going to be flat, and we're
going to have to come in and provide that punch. (Tuesday) night,
the starters played all the minutes (at Utah), and carried us
through that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant had the cast removed from his broken
right hand Thursday, and team doctors replaced it with a protective
splint. He still is not expected to be cleared to play for a
minimum of three weeks, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant broke his hand Oct. 22 in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Respite: Jackson gave the players the day off Thursday, their
first total break from basketball (no practice, no film session, no
meetings) since Oct. 17.

FED OVERREACTION COULD PUT ECONOMY IN TAILSPIN FOR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Federal Reserve policy-makers raise interest rates again
based on the economy's strong third-quarter performance, they might
be overreacting to an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   When the initial estimate of gross domestic product growth
during the July-September period indicated a strong resurgence from
a slow second quarter, it raised fears the Fed might respond by
raising interest rates at its next monetary policy confab later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety is bound to heighten if today's October employment
report is as dynamic as most analysts forecast. After a rare job
drop in September, the consensus anticipates payroll employment
growth of 300,000-plus for October and a slight decline in the
jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
   The latest GDP number, however, might be sending a false signal
by implying better growth than is actually the case. If so, the
culprit will be corporate hoarding in anticipation of Y2K problems.
The more such stockpiling occurs, the more inventory expansion will
add to GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consultancy, has combed
inventory data based on National Association of Purchasing
Management surveys and come up with some startling numbers. Since
purchasing managers are covering themselves against possible
shortages related to Y2K computer system glitches, Macroeconomic
Advisers expects a huge pop from inventory buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Their best guess is that extraordinary inventory accumulation
added 1.75 percentage points to the third-quarter growth numbers
and will add as much as 3.5 percentage points to fourth-quarter
results.
</P>
<P>
   If Fed policy-makers don't fully appreciate the dynamics at
play, they may think a big dose of monetary tightening is needed to
slow down the economy and thus head off the inflationary potential
of such explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating things is that any such tightening might
choke off growth just as the economy is in danger of heading into a
recession. Edward Yardeni, chief economist and global investment
strategist for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, says there is a 70
percent chance of a significant economic downturn next year because
of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, who probably has done more research than any other
leading Wall Street economist on Y2K's potential for problems, sees
a recession, ``which should be quite severe during the first six
months of 2000.'' His forecast anticipates GDP declines at an
annual rate of 7 percent in the first quarter, 4 percent in the
second and 2 percent in the third, with a slight upturn in the
final three months.
</P>
<P>
   His worst-case scenario, to which he assigns a probability of
only 5 percent, calls for a ``depression lasting 2-5 years.
Blackouts. Social and political upheaval. Stock market ... you
don't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if the economy is vulnerable to recession as a result of
Y2K problems, a Fed monetary clampdown would exacerbate an already
dangerous situation. In fact, it recalls the events leading to the
Great Depression of the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Fed critics claim the central bank transformed a garden-variety
recession into a cataclysmic depression by being too stingy with
money and credit just when the economy was in crucial need of
monetary stimulus.
</P>
<P>
   Could history be about to repeat itself?

ST. LOUIS COMPANY PURCHASES RITZ-CARLTON, KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Ritz-Carlton, Kansas City, has been sold
to a St. Louis company that owns several luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz, Wolff &AMP; Co. on Thursday announced the purchase of the
366-room hotel from Starwood Hotels and Resorts Inc. for an
undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate experts estimated that the sale price was between
$55 million and $64 million, or $150,000 to $175,000 per room.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner is a private investment fund that has offices in
St. Louis and Los Angeles and owns 15 hotels worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz Wolff said it planned to spend $10 million to renovate
the hotel near the Country Club Plaza. The remodeling is expected
to begin during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the location and the reputation, and we think that it
is today the best hotel in Kansas City,'' said Philip Maritz,
president of Maritz Wolff. ``And we think we can further cement
that with renovations and service enhancements.''
</P>
<P>
   Maritz said he was negotiating with the Ritz-Carlton over
whether the company will continue to manage the property. The
Ritz-Carlton contract expires at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz Wolff owns Fairmont Hotels in San Francisco, Dallas, New
Orleans and San Jose, Calif. The company also owns Four Seasons
hotels in Austin, Texas; Santa Barbara, Calif; Toronto; and Nevis,
West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz Wolff recently renovated the Ritz-Carlton in St. Louis,
which it acquired in 1994. The added features, such as a cigar bar
and a sushi lounge, were designed to appeal to local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that made the hotel a destination in the local
community,'' Maritz said. ``We think there's an opportunity to
serve the local community in Kansas City in a more dynamic way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton, Kansas City, formerly known as the Alameda
Plaza Hotel, was built in 1972. The hotel fell into financial
trouble in the early 1990s when its owners, a group that included
J.C. Nichols, failed to make payments on a $70 million mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, the lender,
bought the hotel at a foreclosure sale on the courthouse steps for
$30 million, accepting a $40 million loss.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Teachers sold the hotel to Starwood as part of
an eight-hotel package for $309 million. With 3,141 rooms in the
portfolio, the price was an average of $98,376 a room.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, the Ritz-Carlton, Kansas City, which had 373
rooms at that time, would have been worth $36.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   This month's sale of the hotel by Starwood is not a surprise.
The White Plains, N.Y.-based company announced earlier this year
that it planned to sell as much as $500 million worth of
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sale is consistent with our previously stated goal of
selling noncore assets,'' said Starwood spokesman Jim Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said the company was selling hotels in cities where it
already has a presence, or hotels that aren't as profitable as
executives would like.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Starwood runs the Westin Crown Center hotel and
the Sheraton Suites in the Country Club Plaza.

 MCCAIN SAYS HIS ANGER IS IG NITED BY INJUS TICE  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
 BY CREDIT Republic Washington Bureau 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Thursday, Nov. 4th,
that he gets angry at people ``when I see injustice done,'' but
that his ``passionate'' nature doesn't make him unsuitable for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I qualified to be presi dent?'' McCain asked on ABC-TV's
Good Morning America in response to a question about whether he has
a temper. ``Absolutely. That's really what your question is, and
there is absolutely no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ABC interview, Mc Cain also suggested that evidence
exists that The Arizona Republic, which editorialized last Sunday,
Oct. 31st, about his ``volcanic'' temper, is waging a vendetta
against him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cited the observations of a former Republic correspondent
who ``wrote a statement saying that when he worked at The Arizona
Republic, there was a personal vendetta against me,'' the senator
said.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted Thursday, Nov. 4th, Keith Rosenblum qualified the
statement McCain attributed to him. Rosenblum said he had told the
McCain campaign that he had been too ``detached'' from the Phoenix
newsroom to be the best source on the subject of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum also said he had recommended to the campaign that they
locate former Republic em ployees or others who could offer better
perspectives on the newspa per.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the campaign) said, `Well, how was it when you were at
The Republic?' And I said, `I'm really not the ideal source on this
because I wasn't in Phoenix, and I didn't cover McCain as a beat
reporter would have, and I consid ered myself to be detached from
what the goings-on in the newsroom are,' '' Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I didn't perceive a vendetta, no'' at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rosenblum said there was ``an extra onus on you to
produce something controversial'' about McCain and to find ``an
angle, preferably a personal angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Johnson, senior vice presi dent for news and executive
editor of The Republic, said Thursday, Nov. 4th, ``I'm glad to see
Keith is setting the record straight. He was not active in
political coverage at The Republic. In fact, our newspa per library
shows that as a corre spondent, Keith wrote one story in which
McCain was quoted briefly,'' Johnson said. ``And he contributed to
team reporting on three other stories in which McCain was men
tioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these stories centered on McCain, and none contained
controversies surrounding the sena tor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum's relationship with the newspaper ended in 1993. He is
now a spokesman for Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who has endorsed
McCain. In a recent letter to the New York Times, Kolbe wrote that
McCain's ``intemperance _ if you can call it that _ is reserved for
those who treat him in a conde scending or demeaning manner and
recoils when he treats them in kind.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made similar statements on the ABC program, saying, ``I
have a gotten angry at people, and I will continue, probably, to
get angry when I see injustice done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I feel strongly about issues,'' McCain said. `'I have a
passionate view of right and wrong. I wouldn't be in the business
that I'm in if I didn't feel very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was interviewed from New Hampshire, a key early pri mary
state where he has been rapidly gaining in the polls against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked by host Charles Gibson about The Republic
editorial, which questioned whether McCain has ``the temperament
and the political approach and skills'' to be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had a poor relationship with the newspaper, which
had its roots partly in an ``incredibly cruel'' editorial cartoon
published in 1994 about his wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wouldn't return the calls of Republic reporters for more
than a year after the paper published the cartoon by Steve Benson,
which depicted Cindy McCain shaking an emaciated child to get
prescription drugs. She had admitted earlier that year to an
addiction to painkillers and said she stole some pills from her
charitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the genesis of a lot of this (controversy),'' McCain
said of the cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of McCain's problem with his temper were first noted in
a Jan. 23, 1986, column in The Phoenix Gazette by the late
political columnist John Kolbe. Until he died last year, Kolbe had
been one of McCain's most ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline, ``Golden boy McCain has unsettling flaw _
his temper,'' Kolbe wrote, ``(It) is because McCain's temper
occasion ally flares up so unpredictably, often over
inconsequential trivia, that his friends fear it could jump up and
bite him at an inopportune time. . . .'' The cartoon that offended
McCain also came under attack on a televi sion news show this week
by a McCain supporter, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's Crossfire, Thompson called the cartoon ``about the most
vicious thing I've ever seen about a candidate's wife, grossly
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNBC's Hardball, former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said, ``I
smell a rat'' when asked about The Republic's motives for publish
ing last Sunday's editorial. He suggested that the newspaper might
be trying to gain publicity, or aid Bush's presidential campaign,
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the newspaper had no hidden agenda in writing the
editorial about the senator's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain is known in Arizona for temper flare-ups from
time to time. Such flare-ups are not just leveled at political
insiders or opponents. Even citizens have expe rienced or witnessed
them,'' John son said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current controversy is about the character of someone
running for president of the United States. It is not about the
news stories or commentary the last two weeks in various
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, McCain's communi cations director, said the campaign
was hoping to move on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign has done nothing to encourage public discussion
of this topic. We have responded to direct inquiries, but we think
that talking about saving Social Security and cutting taxes is a
lot more important,'' Schnur said.

 SPRINT, MCI WorldCom executives make case for merger before Senate
panel  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief executives of Sprint Corp. and MCI
WorldCom Inc. made their case for a merger Thursday in testimony
before the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose members expressed
mixed feelings about the proposed $129 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators, including Republican John Ashcroft of Missouri,
took sides on the merger Thursday, even before hearing testimony
from William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of
Sprint, and Bernard J. Ebbers, president and CEO of MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that at this point I am strongly inclined to
support the proposed merger,'' Ashcroft said. ``It promises to be a
win-win situation for Missouri ... and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said Ebbers assured him that any loss in the 18,000
Sprint jobs in Missouri and Kansas would be short term and that the
merged company ``expects to deliver a substantial number of new
jobs to Kansas City over the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Kit Bond of Missouri and Sam Brownback of Kansas, both
Republicans, have not taken a position on the merger. Sen. Pat
Roberts, a Kansas Republican, leans in favor of it, a spokeswoman
said Thursday. None of the three is on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For some senators on the committee, the issue was competition,
not jobs. Sprint and MCI WorldCom now compete as the third- and
second-largest long-distance providers in the country, behind
leader AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not convinced that any of the smaller long-distance
providers currently have the name recognition or reach to compete
strongly with the major players,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, an Ohio
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, said that Esrey and Ebbers
had made their companies into American success stories but that
combining them could spell trouble because almost 80 percent of
long-distance service would be controlled by two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such mergers raise the dangerous possibilities of collusion,
price coordination, cartel pricing and reduction in quality of
service,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said the merger would fill in one company's weaknesses
with the other's strengths. For instance, he said, Sprint provides
local service in mostly rural areas scattered across 18 states,
while WorldCom covers more than 100 urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new WorldCom will be able to provide the full range of
products that consumers demand, including local, long-distance,
international, Internet access and mobile services,'' Esrey said.
``By supplying the missing pieces in each other's portfolio, the
merger better positions our companies to compete in the
bundled-service marketplaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers agreed that the merger would combine the best of both
companies, and he said the result would be a better, more
price-competitive alternative to AT&AMP;T. Over the first five years,
the company would save $9.7 billion in operating costs and $5.2
billion in capital expenditures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cost savings not only allow the new company to compete
aggressively in both the business and consumer markets, but also
will enable us to aggressively invest in new technologies such as
broadband and next-generation wireless,'' Ebbers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers said concern that less competition would raise
long-distance calling costs to consumers was unfounded. He said
mergers of recent years, such as the MCI merger with WorldCom, had
led to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   But a representative of Consumers Union, which publishes
Consumer Reports magazine, contended that long-distance calling
costs had risen, not fallen, for many customers. Bargain fees of 5
cents a minute, for example, come with high monthly charges that
offset savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nickel is good for some people, but there are a lot of
people who are not getting the benefit of long-distance competition
today,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman said ``merger mania'' must stop. ``We justify today's
merger by yesterday's merger, and we set the stage for tomorrow's
merger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI WorldCom control about 36 percent of the
long-distance market, and AT&AMP;T has about 43 percent. But more than
600 companies are providing the rest of the service, Esrey said,
and some could emerge as major players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of competition out there,'' Esrey said.
``WorldCom itself was a rather small company several years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying against the merger was James F. Rill, a
Washington lawyer who worked on antitrust law in the Justice
Department under President George Bush. Rill said the merger would
create even more antitrust issues than last year's MCI deal with
WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Rill acknowledged that his firm's clients
included GTE, which provides local service in 29 states and is
merging with Bell Atlantic, one of the regional Bell operating
companies that will compete with the new WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   A big problem with the merger, Rill said, is the dominance that
Sprint and MCI WorldCom have as the first- and second-largest
providers of Internet backbone services, the network infrastructure
that connects service providers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When MCI merged with WorldCom, it was required to first sell off
its Internet backbone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth noting that Sprint was among the most vocal
opponents of MCI's and WorldCom's attempt to consolidate their
Internet backbone operations,'' Rill said.
</P>
<P>
   Many telecommunications analysts expect that Sprint or MCI
WorldCom will have to spin off its Internet backbone. Esrey has
previously said as much when addressing possible scenarios for his
company before the merger was announced, but he was noncommittal
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at the record, and we'll work with the regulators
and the Department of Justice,'' Esrey said after the hearing.

WESTERN RESOURCES ACCEPTS KANSAS CONDITIONS FOR KCP&AMP;L MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ None of the conditions imposed by Kansas
regulators will make the merger of Western Resources Inc. and
Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. financially unsound, Western
Resources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Western had in the past left open the possibility that it would
walk away from the deal because of the conditions. But the utility
said that wouldn't be the case shortly after the Kansas Corporation
Commission released an order late Thursday that essentially
reaffirmed the conditions it included with its approval of the
merger in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move forward,'' said Michel' Philipp, a
spokeswoman for Western.
</P>
<P>
   Western had asked for a clarification of the commission's
September order over the accounting for $179 million in cost
savings that the merged company could keep over 35 years. Western
said one interpretation of the order would increase that to more
than $700 million by adding carrying charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas regulators said the $179 million figure would not be
increased.
</P>
<P>
   David Wittig, Western's chief executive, said in a statement
that keeping all savings in the first four years, which regulators
will allow, and the additional $179 million over 35 years would
allow the merged company to be financially sound.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have
already approved the merger. The remaining hurdle is the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, but its approval is likely with the
recent settlement certification by an administrative judge.
</P>
<P>
   A potential larger obstacle is Western's stock price, which
closed Thursday just above $22 a share. If the price is below
$29.79, then either company can stop the merger shortly before it
is to close.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L shareholders will get less than originally expected in the
deal if Western's stock is under $29.79. A KCP&AMP;L spokeswoman said
Thursday that the company had not decided what it would do.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas regulators essentially stood behind the conditions they
set out in September when they approved the merger. Their order
also rebuffed some requests by other intervenors who had been
critical of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers had been concerned that regulators would concede
more and said they thought the commission had retained the balance
of the original order approving the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sigh of relief that the commission had held the
line,'' said Walker Hendrix, counsel for the Citizens' Utility
Ratepayer Board.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they would take time to study Thursday's action
before deciding whether to appeal. Ed Peterson, an attorney for
several Johnson County cities, said that he had questions about
whether the merged company should keep all of the $179 million but
that it was a victory that the utility would not be permitted to
add carrying charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's better to walk off with half a loaf,'' he said.

 STORIES SURFACE ON SENATOR'S DEMEANOR  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - It was election night 1986, and John McCain had just
been elected to the U.S. Senate for the first time. Even so, he was
not in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was yelling at the top of his lungs and poking the chest
of a young Republican volunteer who had set up a lectern that was
too tall for the 5-foot-9 politician to be seen to advantage,
according to a witness to the outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here this poor guy is thinking he has done a good job, and he
gets a new butt ripped because McCain didn't look good on
television,'' Jon Hinz told a reporter Thursday, Nov. 4th. At the
time, Hinz was executive director of the Arizona Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's temper has been quietly discussed among political
insiders in Arizona since he first ran for Congress in 1982. But
with the recent national focus on his temper ament, more people are
going public with their McCain experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Hinz said McCain's treatment of the young campaign worker in
1986 troubled him for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were an awful lot of people in the room,'' Hinz
recalled. `You'd have to stick cotton in your ears not to hear it.
He (McCain) was screaming at him, and he was red in the face.
</P>
<P>
   `It wasn't right, and I was very upset at him.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain, Dan Schnur, said Thursday, Nov. 4th,
that the senator doesn't deny he ``gets angry'' but that most of
his ``pas sion'' is expended on public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur suggested the stories sur facing recently about McCain
smack of revenge against a rising candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said, ``When George Bush was young and irresponsible,
John McCain was young and irasci ble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like there is a flour ishing ax-grinding market in
Ari zona in political circles,'' Schnur added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arizonans of McCain's own political party describe
senatorial outbursts that had nothing to do with public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Kunasek, now a member of the Arizona Corporation Commis
sion, was blasted by McCain in 1985, when Kunasek refused to
endorse McCain during his first run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The incident ``included him (Mc Cain) standing on his feet and
leaning over and telling me what would happen to me,'' Kunasek said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kunasek declined to say what McCain threatened, but added that
the threat, political in nature, was never acted on.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, Kunasek said, ``was not pleasant, and I was
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in light of subsequent actions,'' he added, ``I think it
is easier to understand. So many other people have joined the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's anger club includes a number of members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Washingtonian magazine, which dubbed him Senator Hothead in a
1997 article, detailed how he shouted down some members of Congress
and once exchanged heated words and then engaged in a ``scuffle''
with Sen. Strom Thur mond, R-S.C., on the floor of the Senate. At
the time, Thurmond was 92 years old.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Johnson, the legislative director of the Na
tional Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion lobbying group, Mc
Cain is reputed to be ``the biggest bully in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and McCain are known to be enemies. Johnson was one of
the most vocal critics of McCain's campaign-finance reform bill,
which died last month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McCain vented during a meeting attended by McCain, John
son and Bill Pierce, president of the National Committee for
Adoption. Johnson and Pierce had come to voice their concerns about
a bill McCain was then sponsoring.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Johnson, ``Mc Cain didn't want to hear any of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All he wanted to do is berate this man,'' Johnson said,
referring to Pierce. ``He stood there and told him he was
completely wrong headed, and the only thing he could imagine was
that (Pierce) wanted things to be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Schnur, Johnson's claims should be taken in light
of his organization's opposition to Mc Cain's campaign-finance
reform proposals, which would ban soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime GOP activist in Arizona said McCain's temper is a
non-issue that will prove fleeting in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's eventually going to turn out to be a non-event,''
said Mike Hellon, who worked closely with McCain as Arizona GOP
chairman and never saw McCain unduly angry.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have felt McCain's temper aren't quite so
accepting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone disagrees with him, he immediately attacks their
motives,'' Douglas Johnson said. ``(He thinks) anyone who disagrees
with him is driven by selfish motives and perhaps even stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Smith, R-Phoe nix, who years ago witnessed Mc
Cain's temper flare at a GOP event, said politicians and activists
who have seen McCain's outbursts keep them to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happens is you're caught between a rock and a
hard place,'' Smith said. ``John McCain is a well-known person in
Arizona. He's running for president. You hate to cast aspersions .
. . and you don't know how he's going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said he had no response because Smith gave so few
details.
</P>
<P>
   One who is willing to describe McCain's choler is former Phoenix
City Councilwoman Kathy Dubs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Dubs, a Republican, was singed by McCain during a
presen tation about a proposed regional airport that was to be
located between Phoenix and Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix wasn't happy about an airport that would compete with
Sky Harbor International, recalled Dubs, then on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a newcomer in politics, and maybe not having as much
finesse as the old-timers had, I said, `You know, the question that
comes to my mind, that my constituents would ask me, is, `How much
property do your relatives own in Casa Grande?' '' Dubs said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when McCain grew angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slammed his fist to the table and stood up and said this
meeting is over,'' she said. ``Then he pointed his finger at me and
started calling me names. His staff was pulling him back, trying to
get him to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's outburst, Dubs said she left.
</P>
<P>
   McCain later said he didn't recall the incident.
</P>
<P>
   One Arizona political activist who has twice seen McCain explode
nevertheless said asperity should not be a disqualifying factor in
his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Hoff Hay, now an aide to GOP presidential candidate Alan
Keyes, said McCain yelled at her during an early 1990s meeting of
local activists at McCain's home.
</P>
<P>
   The activists, who were pushing conservative reforms McCain
didn't fully support, complained to Mc Cain that his aides had
failed to notify them of the meeting until late the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just almost leaped out of his chair,'' Hoff Hay said. ``He
was like, `How dare you say that?' He basically said I was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoff Hay recalled that McCain later asked her forgiveness, even
offering to ``get down on his knees if he could.'' He sent her
flowers to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Hoff Hay said all politicians have flaws, but McCain can't say
his temper isn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to say he never gets angry, and that he doesn't fly
off the handle _ I mean, come on. You know (he does it) all the
time. He's got a short fuse sometimes, and he fires it off.''

WILDLIFE CENTER IN KANSAS ACQUIRES TAXIDERMY COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (undated) The Rolling Hills Wildlife Refuge Conservation Center
near Salina, Kan., announced Thursday that it would expand its
animal collection by more than 1,000 specimens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, these animals won't be quite as lively as the 40-some
species on display at the refuge's multimillion-dollar zoo, which
opened last week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The refuge has acquired an extensive taxidermy collection of
full-mounted animals that had been on exhibit at the World Wildlife
Museum of Natural History in Stockton, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing this will do is allow us to exhibit a lot of animals
we could never do as live animals,'' Rolling Hills director Bob
Brown said. ``For example, polar bears, hippos, elephants, great
white sharks, killer whales. You just can't do that in the middle
of the Plains.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stockton museum recently lost its lease and closed, Brown
said. Jack Perry, owner of the collection, agreed to donate it in
exchange for Rolling Hills' agreeing to pay outstanding expenses
incurred by the museum. Refuge officials say the collection has a
tax appraisal value of $55 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perry could not be reached for comment Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Workers are preparing a site for a 64,000-square-foot building
to display and house the collection. The building is scheduled to
open to the public in January 2002. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put in naturalistic dioramas, so people can see
what a yak looks like when it's being attacked by wolves, what a
polar bear looks like when it's attacking seals,'' Brown said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the refuge's education goal, the dioramas will
have signs describing the animals in each area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Hills also intends to continue developing more space for
the display of live animals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The taxidermy collection is now being moved from Stockton to
Salina. Brown said it would take 30 to 50 semi-trailer trucks to do
the job. The refuge will store the collection in downtown Salina
warehouse space while the building is being completed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown learned of Perry's collection two years ago while
searching for a stuffed elephant. He said he began talking with
Perry about acquiring the collection six weeks ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perry received other offers but accepted Rolling Hills' offer
because the refuge intends to keep the entire collection, Brown
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a collection of 1,000 (full-mounted) specimens is
truly impressive,'' said Leonard Krishtalka, director of the
University of Kansas Natural History Museum. ``It's not the largest
in the world, but it's truly impressive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krishtalka said the KU museum has a collection of similar size,
although it doesn't count specimens. &QL;

   The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago has 600 to 700
mammals, 1,100 to 1,200 birds, 300 to 400 insects and many snakes
and fish, said media relations manager Nancy O'Shea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Shea said, it is impressive to have a collection of
such size in a city the size of Salina. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Choate, director of Fort Hays State University's Sternberg
Museum of Natural History, agreed. ``It's awesome is what it is,''
he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg has about 50 full-mounted animals. Choate said he knew
of the Stockton collection but had never seen it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Most museums don't maintain collections of full-body mounts,''
Choate said. ``If they do have them, they use them for special
purposes, like exhibitions. Consequently, a place that specializes
in full-body mounts is quite unusual.'' &QL;

 STORIES SURFACE ON SENATOR'S DEMEANOR  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - It was election night 1986, and John McCain had just
been elected to the U.S. Senate for the first time. Even so, he was
not in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was yelling at the top of his lungs and poking the chest
of a young Republican volunteer who had set up a lectern that was
too tall for the 5-foot-9 politician to be seen to advantage,
according to a witness to the outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here this poor guy is thinking he has done a good job, and he
gets a new butt ripped because McCain didn't look good on
television,'' Jon Hinz told a reporter Thursday, Nov. 4th. At the
time, Hinz was executive director of the Arizona Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's temper has been quietly discussed among political
insiders in Arizona since he first ran for Congress in 1982. But
with the recent national focus on his temper ament, more people are
going public with their McCain experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Hinz said McCain's treatment of the young campaign worker in
1986 troubled him for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were an awful lot of people in the room,'' Hinz
recalled. `You'd have to stick cotton in your ears not to hear it.
He (McCain) was screaming at him, and he was red in the face.
</P>
<P>
   `It wasn't right, and I was very upset at him.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain, Dan Schnur, said Thursday, Nov. 4th,
that the senator doesn't deny he ``gets angry'' but that most of
his ``pas sion'' is expended on public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur suggested the stories sur facing recently about McCain
smack of revenge against a rising candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said, ``When George Bush was young and irresponsible,
John McCain was young and irasci ble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like there is a flour ishing ax-grinding market in
Ari zona in political circles,'' Schnur added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arizonans of McCain's own political party describe
senatorial outbursts that had nothing to do with public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Kunasek, now a member of the Arizona Corporation Commis
sion, was blasted by McCain in 1985, when Kunasek refused to
endorse McCain during his first run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The incident ``included him (Mc Cain) standing on his feet and
leaning over and telling me what would happen to me,'' Kunasek said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kunasek declined to say what McCain threatened, but added that
the threat, political in nature, was never acted on.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, Kunasek said, ``was not pleasant, and I was
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in light of subsequent actions,'' he added, ``I think it
is easier to understand. So many other people have joined the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's anger club includes a number of members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Washingtonian magazine, which dubbed him Senator Hothead in a
1997 article, detailed how he shouted down some members of Congress
and once exchanged heated words and then engaged in a ``scuffle''
with Sen. Strom Thur mond, R-S.C., on the floor of the Senate. At
the time, Thurmond was 92 years old.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Johnson, the legislative director of the Na
tional Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion lobbying group, Mc
Cain is reputed to be ``the biggest bully in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and McCain are known to be enemies. Johnson was one of
the most vocal critics of McCain's campaign-finance reform bill,
which died last month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McCain vented during a meeting attended by McCain, John
son and Bill Pierce, president of the National Committee for
Adoption. Johnson and Pierce had come to voice their concerns about
a bill McCain was then sponsoring.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Johnson, ``Mc Cain didn't want to hear any of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All he wanted to do is berate this man,'' Johnson said,
referring to Pierce. ``He stood there and told him he was
completely wrong headed, and the only thing he could imagine was
that (Pierce) wanted things to be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Schnur, Johnson's claims should be taken in light
of his organization's opposition to Mc Cain's campaign-finance
reform proposals, which would ban soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime GOP activist in Arizona said McCain's temper is a
non-issue that will prove fleeting in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's eventually going to turn out to be a non-event,''
said Mike Hellon, who worked closely with McCain as Arizona GOP
chairman and never saw McCain unduly angry.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have felt McCain's temper aren't quite so
accepting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone disagrees with him, he immediately attacks their
motives,'' Douglas Johnson said. ``(He thinks) anyone who disagrees
with him is driven by selfish motives and perhaps even stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Smith, R-Phoe nix, who years ago witnessed Mc
Cain's temper flare at a GOP event, said politicians and activists
who have seen McCain's outbursts keep them to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happens is you're caught between a rock and a
hard place,'' Smith said. ``John McCain is a well-known person in
Arizona. He's running for president. You hate to cast aspersions .
. . and you don't know how he's going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said he had no response because Smith gave so few
details.
</P>
<P>
   One who is willing to describe McCain's choler is former Phoenix
City Councilwoman Kathy Dubs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Dubs, a Republican, was singed by McCain during a
presen tation about a proposed regional airport that was to be
located between Phoenix and Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix wasn't happy about an airport that would compete with
Sky Harbor International, recalled Dubs, then on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a newcomer in politics, and maybe not having as much
finesse as the old-timers had, I said, `You know, the question that
comes to my mind, that my constituents would ask me, is, `How much
property do your relatives own in Casa Grande?' '' Dubs said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when McCain grew angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slammed his fist to the table and stood up and said this
meeting is over,'' she said. ``Then he pointed his finger at me and
started calling me names. His staff was pulling him back, trying to
get him to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's outburst, Dubs said she left.
</P>
<P>
   McCain later said he didn't recall the incident.
</P>
<P>
   One Arizona political activist who has twice seen McCain explode
nevertheless said asperity should not be a disqualifying factor in
his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Hoff Hay, now an aide to GOP presidential candidate Alan
Keyes, said McCain yelled at her during an early 1990s meeting of
local activists at McCain's home.
</P>
<P>
   The activists, who were pushing conservative reforms McCain
didn't fully support, complained to Mc Cain that his aides had
failed to notify them of the meeting until late the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just almost leaped out of his chair,'' Hoff Hay said. ``He
was like, `How dare you say that?' He basically said I was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoff Hay recalled that McCain later asked her forgiveness, even
offering to ``get down on his knees if he could.'' He sent her
flowers to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Hoff Hay said all politicians have flaws, but McCain can't say
his temper isn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to say he never gets angry, and that he doesn't fly
off the handle _ I mean, come on. You know (he does it) all the
time. He's got a short fuse sometimes, and he fires it off.''

 MCCAIN SAYS HIS ANGER IS IGNITED BY INJUSTICE  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
 BY CREDIT Republic Washington Bureau 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Thursday, Nov. 4th,
that he gets angry at people ``when I see injustice done,'' but
that his ``passionate'' nature doesn't make him unsuitable for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I qualified to be presi dent?'' McCain asked on ABC-TV's
Good Morning America in response to a question about whether he has
a temper. ``Absolutely. That's really what your question is, and
there is absolutely no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ABC interview, Mc Cain also suggested that evidence
exists that The Arizona Republic, which editorialized last Sunday,
Oct. 31st, about his ``volcanic'' temper, is waging a vendetta
against him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cited the observations of a former Republic correspondent
who ``wrote a statement saying that when he worked at The Arizona
Republic, there was a personal vendetta against me,'' the senator
said.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted Thursday, Nov. 4th, Keith Rosenblum qualified the
statement McCain attributed to him. Rosenblum said he had told the
McCain campaign that he had been too ``detached'' from the Phoenix
newsroom to be the best source on the subject of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum also said he had recommended to the campaign that they
locate former Republic em ployees or others who could offer better
perspectives on the newspa per.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the campaign) said, `Well, how was it when you were at
The Republic?' And I said, `I'm really not the ideal source on this
because I wasn't in Phoenix, and I didn't cover McCain as a beat
reporter would have, and I consid ered myself to be detached from
what the goings-on in the newsroom are,' '' Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I didn't perceive a vendetta, no'' at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rosenblum said there was ``an extra onus on you to
produce something controversial'' about McCain and to find ``an
angle, preferably a personal angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Johnson, senior vice presi dent for news and executive
editor of The Republic, said Thursday, Nov. 4th, ``I'm glad to see
Keith is setting the record straight. He was not active in
political coverage at The Republic. In fact, our newspa per library
shows that as a corre spondent, Keith wrote one story in which
McCain was quoted briefly,'' Johnson said. ``And he contributed to
team reporting on three other stories in which McCain was men
tioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these stories centered on McCain, and none contained
controversies surrounding the sena tor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum's relationship with the newspaper ended in 1993. He is
now a spokesman for Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who has endorsed
McCain. In a recent letter to the New York Times, Kolbe wrote that
McCain's ``intemperance _ if you can call it that _ is reserved for
those who treat him in a conde scending or demeaning manner and
recoils when he treats them in kind.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made similar statements on the ABC program, saying, ``I
have a gotten angry at people, and I will continue, probably, to
get angry when I see injustice done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I feel strongly about issues,'' McCain said. `'I have a
passionate view of right and wrong. I wouldn't be in the business
that I'm in if I didn't feel very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was interviewed from New Hampshire, a key early pri mary
state where he has been rapidly gaining in the polls against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked by host Charles Gibson about The Republic
editorial, which questioned whether McCain has ``the temperament
and the political approach and skills'' to be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had a poor relationship with the newspaper, which
had its roots partly in an ``incredibly cruel'' editorial cartoon
published in 1994 about his wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wouldn't return the calls of Republic reporters for more
than a year after the paper published the cartoon by Steve Benson,
which depicted Cindy McCain shaking an emaciated child to get
prescription drugs. She had admitted earlier that year to an
addiction to painkillers and said she stole some pills from her
charitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the genesis of a lot of this (controversy),'' McCain
said of the cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of McCain's problem with his temper were first noted in
a Jan. 23, 1986, column in The Phoenix Gazette by the late
political columnist John Kolbe. Until he died last year, Kolbe had
been one of McCain's most ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline, ``Golden boy McCain has unsettling flaw _
his temper,'' Kolbe wrote, ``(It) is because McCain's temper
occasion ally flares up so unpredictably, often over
inconsequential trivia, that his friends fear it could jump up and
bite him at an inopportune time. . . .'' The cartoon that offended
McCain also came under attack on a televi sion news show this week
by a McCain supporter, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's Crossfire, Thompson called the cartoon ``about the most
vicious thing I've ever seen about a candidate's wife, grossly
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNBC's Hardball, former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said, ``I
smell a rat'' when asked about The Republic's motives for publish
ing last Sunday's editorial. He suggested that the newspaper might
be trying to gain publicity, or aid Bush's presidential campaign,
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the newspaper had no hidden agenda in writing the
editorial about the senator's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain is known in Arizona for temper flare-ups from
time to time. Such flare-ups are not just leveled at political
insiders or opponents. Even citizens have expe rienced or witnessed
them,'' John son said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current controversy is about the character of someone
running for president of the United States. It is not about the
news stories or commentary the last two weeks in various
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, McCain's communi cations director, said the campaign
was hoping to move on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign has done nothing to encourage public discussion
of this topic. We have responded to direct inquiries, but we think
that talking about saving Social Security and cutting taxes is a
lot more important,'' Schnur said.

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Thursday, Nov. 4th,
that he gets angry at people ``when I see injustice done,'' but
that his ``passionate'' nature doesn't make him unsuitable for the

who ``wrote a statement saying that when he worked at The Arizona
Republic, there was a personal vendetta against me,'' the senator
said.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted Thursday, Nov. 4th, Keith Rosenblum qualified the
statement McCain attributed to him. Rosenblum said he had told the
McCain campaign that he had been too ``detached'' from the Phoenix
newsroom to be the best source on the subject of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum also said he had recommended to the campaign that they
locate former Republic em ployees or others who could offer better
perspectives on the newspa per.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the campaign) said, `Well, how was it when you were at
The Republic?' And I said, `I'm really not the ideal source on this
because I wasn't in Phoenix, and I didn't cover McCain as a beat
reporter would have, and I consid ered myself to be detached from
what the goings-on in the newsroom are,' '' Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I didn't perceive a vendetta, no'' at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rosenblum said there was ``an extra onus on you to
produce something controversial'' about McCain and to find ``an
angle, preferably a personal angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Johnson, senior vice presi dent for news and executive
editor of The Republic, said Thursday, Nov. 4th, ``I'm glad to see
Keith is setting the record straight. He was not active in
political coverage at The Republic. In fact, our newspa per library
shows that as a corre spondent, Keith wrote one story in which
McCain was quoted briefly,'' Johnson said. ``And he contributed to
team reporting on three other stories in which McCain was men
tioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these stories centered on McCain, and none contained
controversies surrounding the sena tor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum's relationship with the newspaper ended in 1993. He is
now a spokesman for Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who has endorsed
McCain. In a recent letter to the New York Times, Kolbe wrote that
McCain's ``intemperance _ if you can call it that _ is reserved for
those who treat him in a conde scending or demeaning manner and
recoils when he treats them in kind.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made similar statements on the ABC program, saying, ``I
have a gotten angry at people, and I will continue, probably, to
get angry when I see injustice done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I feel strongly about issues,'' McCain said. `'I have a
passionate view of right and wrong. I wouldn't be in the business
that I'm in if I didn't feel very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was interviewed from New Hampshire, a key early pri mary
state where he has been rapidly gaining in the polls against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked by host Charles Gibson about The Republic
editorial, which questioned whether McCain has ``the temperament
and the political approach and skills'' to be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had a poor relationship with the newspaper, which
had its roots partly in an ``incredibly cruel'' editorial cartoon
published in 1994 about his wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wouldn't return the calls of Republic reporters for more
than a year after the paper published the cartoon by Steve Benson,
which depicted Cindy McCain shaking an emaciated child to get
prescription drugs. She had admitted earlier that year to an
addiction to painkillers and said she stole some pills from her
charitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the genesis of a lot of this (controversy),'' McCain
said of the cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of McCain's problem with his temper were first noted in
a Jan. 23, 1986, column in The Phoenix Gazette by the late
political columnist John Kolbe. Until he died last year, Kolbe had
been one of McCain's most ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline, ``Golden boy McCain has unsettling flaw _
his temper,'' Kolbe wrote, ``(It) is because McCain's temper
occasion ally flares up so unpredictably, often over
inconsequential trivia, that his friends fear it could jump up and
bite him at an inopportune time. . . .'' The cartoon that offended
McCain also came under attack on a televi sion news show this week
by a McCain supporter, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's Crossfire, Thompson called the cartoon ``about the most
vicious thing I've ever seen about a candidate's wife, grossly
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNBC's Hardball, former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said, ``I
smell a rat'' when asked about The Republic's motives for publish
ing last Sunday's editorial. He suggested that the newspaper might
be trying to gain publicity, or aid Bush's presidential campaign,
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the newspaper had no hidden agenda in writing the
editorial about the senator's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain is known in Arizona for temper flare-ups from
time to time. Such flare-ups are not just leveled at political
insiders or opponents. Even citizens have expe rienced or witnessed
them,'' John son said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current controversy is about the character of someone
running for president of the United States. It is not about the
news stories or commentary the last two weeks in various
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, McCain's communi cations director, said the campaign
was hoping to move on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign has done nothing to encourage public discussion
of this topic. We have responded to direct inquiries, but we think
that talking about saving Social Security and cutting taxes is a
lot more important,'' Schnur said.

DESPITE REPEATED CALLS, CASEWORKERS APPARENTLY NEVER SAW ABUSED
BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY 
and MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Despite hot-line reports that Gary and Larry
Bass were in danger, there is no evidence in the Missouri Division
of Family Services file that a caseworker ever saw the boys, the
division director said Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not confident that they were ever seen,'' Denise Cross
said Thursday by telephone from Jefferson City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers, who were part of a set of triplets, died last
month at age 8 in what a Kansas City police captain described as
the worst case of child neglect he had ever seen. Both boys
suffered severe malnourishment and burns on their feet. The third
triplet survives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Repeated hot-line calls date at least to 1995, according to
several of the boys' former teachers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to determine where the system broke down,'' Cross
said. ``It appears clues were missed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cross has ordered an internal investigation into the division's
involvement with the Bass family. The findings are expected next
week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It may lead to disciplinary action,'' Cross said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Jackson County medical examiner ruled the
death of Larry Bass a homicide. The cause of death was listed as
complications from starvation and infected burns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bass, the boys' mother, has been charged with 10 counts of
various types of child abuse. Her boyfriend, Tony Dixon, 36, faces
six counts of various types of child abuse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bass, a third-grader, weighed 30 pounds when he died Oct.
20. Gary died two days later. The medical examiner has not yet
ruled on Gary's death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have told /{The Kansas City Star/} that the boys were
sometimes bruised and often so hungry that they ate without
utensils. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They would ``eat so fast and so much at once they would throw up
in the bathroom,'' said Allyson Moyer, who was the boys' Head Start
teacher in the mid-1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said she reported the suspected abuse 10 to 15 times to
the Family Services hot line in 1995, but no one called her back or
came to visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More recently, school officials at Whittier Elementary, which
the boys attended two years ago, suspected that the boys were being
neglected, and they alerted state officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of confidentiality laws, Cross declined Thursday to be
specific about the Bass case but confirmed that hot-line calls had
been made about the boys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case could lead to a policy change on home visits, she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cross said that caseworkers had visited Mary Bass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go into homes, folks aren't always glad to see us,''
Cross said. ``Sometimes they try to deceive us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for visits to the Bass home, Cross said: ``It appears to me
that statements were made (to the caseworkers) that were not
accurate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cross called the boys' deaths a heart-wrenching experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When this happens, when a child dies _ in this case, two _ it
hits us very hard,'' Cross said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Mary Bass, 31, told authorities that
she had locked Larry and Gary in a room for up to two weeks and had
given them only bread and water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also told authorities that she had punished the boys by
lowering their legs and feet into scalding bath water, causing
severe burns. She did not seek professional medical attention
because she feared that she would be arrested, the records show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bass' three other children _ the other triplet, a 12-year-old
daughter and a 10-year-old son _ have been placed in protective
custody. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said the boys were extremely skinny. One boy often
appeared hungry, dirty and with his pants soiled. The teachers
would clean the boys and brush their teeth, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have underwear, no socks in the winter time,''
Moyer said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bass would not let Moyer in for home visits, which were
designed to give a parent a progress report on a child's
development. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moyer would slide her report into the mail slot and Bass would
sign it and slide it back out to Moyer through the mail slot, Moyer
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Janet Fuller, who was teaching at Primitivo Garcia Elementary
School, had Larry and Gary Bass in a preschool special education
class when they were 3 or 4 years old. She also taught the third
triplet, Jerry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bruised a lot,'' Fuller said. ``They often came in
very hungry and very tired. Gary came in once with bruises on his
back. His story was he was hit with a belt.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Fuller said, the boys came to school for about a
week very tired and lethargic, especially Larry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bass was told to take the boys to a hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I found her very defensive _ `Where do they get off telling me
to take my kids to a hospital?' '' Fuller said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later, they seemed to be doing better, Fuller said. Then in June
1995, they came in with long sleeves, she said. Their arms were
``bruised, cut and lacerated,'' and the boys didn't want to go
home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially Larry,'' she said. ``He clung to me, crying. He
wanted to go home with me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said Bob Wilcox, vice principal at the time, called the
hot line. She said she was in Wilcox's office when the call was
made. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox told /{The Star/} that he did not recall making the
call. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated when I heard about their deaths,'' Fuller
said. ``The system failed these kids, you bet it did. Family
preservation is the goal, but I think there are so many chances you
give people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years of getting beaten up is pretty bad.'' &QL;

MISSOURI HELD UP AS EXAMPLE OF NATIONWIDE NURSING HOME PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal investigation into how well Washington
follows through on state nursing home inspections used Missouri to
show that the system nationwide has problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one case, according to the report by the General Accounting
Office, federal inspectors found 24 deficiencies that they said the
state should have uncovered when it reviewed a Missouri nursing
home. The federal inspectors checked the home six weeks after the
state inspection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report said federal inspectors found that the state had
failed to note that one resident's weight had dropped 19 percent in
a five-month period. The state also failed to note that the home
had been treating the resident for pressure sores with a medication
that stated it was not for pressure sores, but for skin
irritation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri said Thursday that he will ask the GAO
to look into how the state monitors nursing homes. His request
comes as Missouri State Auditor Claire McCaskill is completing a
similar investigation. She said her report would probably be made
public in January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Routh, director of the Missouri Division of Aging, said
she had not seen the GAO report. But she said ``look-behind''
inspections by the federal government may not always be fair to the
state. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The time difference can vary quite a lot,'' she said. ``There
was one this year when they came in 60 days after we were there. A
lot can change in nursing homes in 60 days.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Routh said her agency, which oversees nursing home
inspections, is seeing more problems and hearing more complaints. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report analyzed how the federal Health Care Financing
Administration, the agency that oversees the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, ensures the effectiveness of each state's nursing home
inspection system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agency is required by law to annually survey at least 5
percent of the nation's 17,000 nursing homes that receive Medicare
or Medicaid dollars. It does this through 10 regional offices
around the country, including one in Kansas City, which covers
Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has about 500 nursing homes containing about 50,000
beds; Kansas has about 320 nursing homes with about 23,000 beds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that while the financing administration is
making some progress in its watchdog role, ``it's uneven and
inconsistent,'' said Kathryn G. Allen, associate director of health
care issues for the GAO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators said that while federal and state inspectors
follow the same standards for monitoring nursing homes, the federal
regional office in Kansas City did a better job identifying
deficiencies missed by states than other regional offices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And while the Missouri references were a small part of the
report, Allen said they ``suggest...that the HCFA (financing
administration) regional offices are able to find more deficiencies
than the state. It does raise some questions about some of the
state survey agencies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report became public at a hearing before the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, chaired by Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of
Iowa, who has been looking into nursing homes and the federal
agency's role. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious question at this point is whether we've been
successful,'' Grassley said. ``Can we assure nursing home residents
of better conditions? Can we ease the anxiety of those who must
place their family members in nursing homes? When it comes down to
it, not really, not yet.'' &QL;

BRUINS TOP DEVILS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Claude Lemieux, who was playing for the Colorado
Avalanche until traded to New Jersey on Wednesday, took his pregame
nap on the plane from Denver to Boston on Thursday afternoon. When
he arrived at the airport here for Thursday night's game against
the Bruins, he was rubbing his eyes after finding that the man who
sent him packing from the Devils four years ago was waiting for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager, does
this sort of thing for someone he thinks is invaluable to his team
in the playoffs, where the Devils have failed miserably the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   But Lemieux's value in the regular season was never anything to
rave about. He demonstrated that again on Thursday night in his
first game back with the Devils, who reacquired him in a trade for
Brian Rolston. Lemieux was just another face in the crowd as Boston
sent the Devils to a 3-1 loss, the fifth victory in a row for the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltending of Martin Brodeur and a goal by Scott Gomez were
the only bright spots for the Devils. Lemieux played right wing on
a line with Bobby Holik as his center and Sergei Brylin the left
wing. He was not pleased with himself or the performance of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best I've felt in a while,'' Lemieux said. ``Two
games in two nights; it was a tough third period for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive loss on the road for the Devils
(7-5-1), who set a league mark last season for victories on the
road. They allowed two goals to the Bruins in the third period
tonight, when they showed some signs of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello and the Devils are counting on Lemieux for the
playoffs. Lamoriello wants to erase all doubts that he is still
bitter about the battle with Lemieux following the Devils' Stanley
Cup triumph in 1995. Lemieux was named the most valuable player in
the series that year, but Lamoriello refused to renegotiate his
contract and traded him before the new season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils failed to make the playoffs the year after winning
the Stanley Cup, while Lemieux helped Colorado capture the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone, it's all in the past, there is no issue,''
Lamoriello said on Thursday night about his feud with Lemieux four
years ago. ``He wouldn't be here if there was an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux said he was tickled to see his boss at the airport. ``It
was good to see all the guys who have been around since 1995,'' he
added. ``I think we counted about nine of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone from the current Devils was glad to see
Lemieux, who has been on three different Stanley Cup champions
(Montreal in 1986) and was back in his familiar No. 22 jersey with
the Devils' logo on the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a proven winner with three Stanley Cup rings,'' said Lyle
Odelein, who joined the Devils a season after Lemieux left, but
played with Lemieux in Montreal. ``He's a guy who gets under
everyone's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are more familiar with Lemieux's agitation tactics
than most teams. This was Lemieux's 61st game against Boston,
mostly from his days with Montreal and the Devils. Cam Neely, the
powerful Boton wing who retired three years ago, has been the
player perhaps most troubled by Lemieux's pestiness. Neely was so
agitated with Lemieux's tactics in one game in 1995 that he called
him ``a gutless puke.''

MAVERICKS FALL SHORT IN FIRST ROAD GAME

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Dallas Mavericks are no longer tied for first
place in the Midwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle SuperSonics took care of that, as they beat the
Mavericks, 106-96, Thursday night at Key Arena. The Mavericks are
1-1 on the season, while the Sonics improved to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had 22 offensive rebounds in gaining a 58-41 margin
on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third period, the Sonics were threatening to
run the Mavericks out of the building. With Ruben Patterson darting
all over the floor and Gary Payton finally getting his engine
revved, Seattle built a 73-58 lead with 4:52 left in the third
period after a hammer dunk by Vin Baker, who finished with 22
points to tie Vernon Maxwell for the team high.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mavericks stormed back to within 75-69, after
Robert Pack fed Shawn Bradley for a basket inside the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was able to take an 81-74 lead into the final period,
thanks to seven points in the third quarter by Payton, who went
scoreless in the first half on 0-of-7 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Through three quarters, Cedric Ceballos had 26 points on
11-of-17 shooting for the Mavericks and he finished with 34 to lead
all scorers. His inside game was working, and so was his perimeter
game. He was supported by 15 points from Dirk Nowitzki and 14 from
Michael Finley.
</P>
<P>
   But, through three quarters, Baker's 20 points and 11 rebounds,
17 points from Patterson, and 12 points and nine rebounds from
Horace Grant kept the Mavericks at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve guard Maxwell scored 15 of his 17 points in the second
period for Seattle as the Sonics assumed a 56-46 lead at
intermission. Maxwell converted 5-of-9 field goals in scoring all
but two of the Sonics' points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks stayed close to the Sonics in the early going.
Finley scored 11 of his points in the first quarter on 5-of-8
shooting, as Dallas only trailed, 26-25, when the period ended.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley, who has a bruised heel, was limping noticeably
through parts of the game. Beforehand, he said he has a high
tolerance for pain, and that he wouldn't decrease his playing time
unless it was absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   There were eight lead changes and seven ties in the first
period, as the Mavericks looked as crisp as they did during
Tuesday's 108-96 season-opening win over the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Rick Hughes, who signed a contract earlier yestersday,
got in the game. Hughes replaced forward Kebu Stewart, who was
waived yesterday after he inexplicably decided to leave Dallas and
go home to Bakersfield, Calif., prior to the game against the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks play the Warriors in Oakland tomorrow night,
before winding up this three-game road trip with a Sunday night
contest in Los Angeles against the Lakers. Dallas returns home to
play host to the Lakers on Tuesday. nn

WITHOUT IRVIN, COWBOYS DIALING WRONG NUMBER

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Based on the aerial bombardment that the Dallas
Cowboys rained upon the Indianapolis Colts last Sunday, I'm sure
that air raid sirens must be sounding in Minneapolis at this very
hour.
</P>
<P>
   I'm teasing, of course. As Cowboys fans know, when quarterback
Troy Aikman stands in the pocket lately to pass, he is (choose
one):
</P>
<P>
   A. searching for Rocket Ismail
</P>
<P>
   B. mulling the guest list for his upcoming wedding
</P>
<P>
   C. wishing Norv Turner were still here

   D. dialing 1-800-GET-OPEN.
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to suggest choice D. Somebody has to get open. With
Michael Irvin out of the lineup, Cowboys receivers suddenly are
being shadowed closer than federal witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Or that's the story coming out of Valley Ranch, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Hired here to breathe fresh life into an aging and uncertain
offense, Chan Gailey has a 14-10 record as head coach. Against
teams not named the Washington Redskins, the offense has sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail's jackrabbit start has earned him stifling attention. His
partner, Irvin, went down in the season's fourth game and, except
for a few hallucinatory moments, the other receivers have been
largely invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have one of those new, double-wide TV screens and
could see this last Sunday, but take it from an eyewitness _ nobody
was getting open.
</P>
<P>
   As Gailey sought to explain after the game, ``They kept a safety
very deep and had a guy back there in the middle of the field all
day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey shrugged, as if he had been nabbed by the NFL's fine
print. Whoever invented this ``safety deep'' defense, we assume, is
on his way to the Nobel Prize for Rocket Science.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, however, there is a ringing irony to what's been
happening to Gailey and his offense. The irony is that Gailey's
passing attack dearly misses Michael Irvin, the same Michael Irvin
that Gailey once tried to (A) chase off or (B) paint out of the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   We'll probably never know how Michael somehow got sideways from
the head coach. Irvin himself tried to defuse the story, though
unconvincingly. A proud man, Irvin might have said something to
Gailey. Maybe he simply asked the coach, ``Do you know who I am?''
</P>
<P>
   But that was spring. By autumn, Irvin was back catching balls,
rough-housing with defensive backs and, in general, doing the grunt
work for Aikman and Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything else, when you have a great player out, you miss
him,'' Gailey said after the 34-24 loss in Indianapolis. ``How you
put that into a percentage, I don't know. But obviously, he's
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   He is missed more than Gailey ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   In Irvin's absence, stand-in Wane McGarity caught only three
passes before separating a shoulder. First-year receiver Jason
Tucker of TCU has four catches. Second-year pro Jeff Ogden has
caught seven.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Ernie Mills has caught 21 passes in seven games, but he
is averaging less than 10 yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers are sparse because they can't seem to get open.
And Gailey has no magic wand for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain degree, you can help them with more routes,'' the
coach said. ``But to a certain degree, it comes down to the speed
and quickness you have to have to be in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker has some quickness, but not the kind, like Ismail's, that
raises the neck hairs of a defense. There are stretches where Mills
and Ogden seem to have trouble getting off the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can work on timing things,'' Gailey continued, offering a
possible solution. ``You try to run timing things, so the
quarterback has confidence to get it in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey is speaking from a viewpoint that is, frankly, about
five concussions short. What matters is what Aikman sees, and last
Sunday he saw nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it's out of the question to ask the $8-million
cornerback, Count Do-Rag, to play a little wide receiver, right?
Hmm. I thought so.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, lest Cowboys fans forget, the passing game seemed
to sour when Mills got hurt on the Sunday before Thanksgiving.
Aikman only threw three touchdown passes in the final 22 quarters
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was open then. Nobody seems open now.
</P>
<P>
   Your move, coach. nn

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN 
  c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ The forecast had been foreboding. Somehow that
doesn't help when the storm hits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets knew what was coming. Coach Rudy Tomjanovich warned
his charges from their first day together about handling such
adversity. Charles Barkley had declared, ``We are not a very smart
team,'' and no NBA team punishes ignorance with more straight-faced
mercilessness than the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz more than defeated the Rockets 98-82 on Thursday night,
like the tornado that tore through the Delta Center in August. Utah
demonstrated the rebuilding still necessary for the Rockets to be
contenders again.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich had warned the process would be painful. But by
exploiting the Rockets' imprecision on both ends of the court, the
Jazz cruised through the second half to where it barely used a
backcourt that had dominated as completely as had the Bucks' Sam
Cassell on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you. I told you two weeks ago,'' Barkley said of the
explanation for Thursday's rout that he had offered in advance.
``It's still hard to take. It's very hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   From this, the Rockets (0-2) had to rush home merely to face the
defending NBA champion Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   While Tomjanovich pleaded in vain for the Rockets to execute the
defensive game plan he had put in place, the Jazz worked through
their picks to open shots and layups. After a horrible offensive
first half, the Jazz made 24 of 37 second-half shots, even with
John Stockton spending the majority of the half watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just saw what a veteran team can do,'' Rockets center
Kelvin Cato said. ``We practiced and practiced and practiced. But
it's not the same as a team that's run it for 11 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 25 minutes, Stockton made all eight of his shots, scored
18 points and had seven assists. Jeff Hornacek played only 29
minutes but made eight of 11 shots for 17 points. Karl Malone had
21 points on 8-of-12 shooting as the Jazz took its 10th consecutive
regular-season win over the Rockets since November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some positives,'' said Rockets guard Cuttino
Mobley, himself a positive with a team-high 17 points. ``We just
have to look for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But there really is only one place to look. If the Rockets
wanted a lesson in the power of precision, the Jazz provided it.
Other than Bryon Russell's horrible 2-of-15 shooting, the Jazz made
39 of 62 shots to turn a three-point game with five minutes left in
the third quarter to a 22-point lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give guys layups,'' Tomjanovich said of the Rockets'
mistakes against the Jazz half-court offensive. ``There were layups
after layups. That got them off the schneid, and they started
shooting outside, and it was like the dam broke. You've got to run
the game plan, especially defensively. We didn't give ourselves a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They also wasted their most encouraging offensive stretch since
the preseason's first quarter in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton began the half by putting the Jazz up by nine, but the
Rockets immediately went back to posting Barkley and Hakeem
Olajuwon inside and finally ran their offense expertly _ for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets scored the next seven points to pull within two. But
more important, they found something they could run consistently.
They made 11 of 17 shots in the quarter. They found open shots and
made them as they had not Tuesday or in the first half Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should stick with that,'' Olajuwon said of the successful
half-court offense built around him and Barkley posting up inside.
``We can't depend on individual decisions, so we should use the
system that everyone makes the right decisions together.''
</P>
<P>
   But having begun to solve one problem, they found another. They
could score but could not come close to stopping the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   With Stockton on the bench for six minutes of the quarter, the
Jazz still made 12 of 17 shots to hold off the Rockets and push
their lead to 68-59 by the end of the quarter. By the time Stockton
brought his perfect shooting night back onto the court, the Jazz
had blown out a 19-6 run to a 20-point lead and Tomjanovich would
moments later call time out to clear his bench with almost five
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very systematic,'' Olajuwon said. ``Any play they run,
they have a bunch of smart players executing very well. They
capitalize on mistakes. You can't blow your assignments. They play
very smart basketball. It's not just talent. It's
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Rockets' defense left them, the offensive execution of
the third quarter left as well.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly ignominious stretch of the fourth quarter:
Russell blocked a Barkley shot inside, Olajuwon was called for an
offensive foul, Olajuwon missed a four-footer, Barkley had a dunk
blocked by Greg Ostertag, Bryce Drew was called for an offensive
foul, the Rockets had a 24-second violation and Barkley tossed up a
3-pointer that fell as hard as the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' Olajuwon said. ``It's not just two games;
it's the preseason, too. We have to play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, that looks as unlikely as Barkley had predicted _
at least until the early-season storms pass.

HARGROVE HAS CHALLENGE IN ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The baseball world didn't know whether to
offer Mike Hargrove congratulations or condolences when he was
introduced as manager of the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, he was out of work less than three weeks after
being fired by the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, he was hired by Peter Angelos, an owner
who has fired four managers in the six years since he purchased the
franchise and has a reputation as the most meddlesome owner not
named George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Hargrove, who was at the Arlington Convention
Center Thursday night to receive an award from the Texas Baseball
Hall of Fame, was neither out of his mind, nor desperate for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if the right job was there, and I had a chance to get
back into it, I would be open to that,'' said Hargrove, who was
honored as the outstanding Texas-born manager in the 20th century.
``I felt that way about the Baltimore job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove knows the horror stories about Angelos. He knows the
Orioles owner has fired Johnny Oates, Phil Regan, Davey Johnson and
Ray Miller since buying the team in August 1993.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hargrove said the man who interviewed him for the job
was not the one he knew by reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to go into the interview process with an open mind,''
Hargrove said. ``I found him to be very engaging, straightforward,
honest and very interesting and intelligent. All the things that I
had read about him and heard about him, in the brief time I've
known him, I question their veracity. He struck me as a man that's
committed to winning. I don't know that there's much more you can
ask from an owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelos also gave him a three-year contract reportedly worth $1
million per season, but Hargrove said that's not the primary reason
he took the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're doing this job just for the money, you're not going
to have a good time doing it and you probably won't do it very
long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians won the American League Central the past five
seasons under Hargrove and went to the World Series in 1995 and
'97.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hargrove and general manager John Hart had an uneasy
relationship, and when the Indians lost to the Boston Red Sox in
the first round of the playoffs, Hargrove was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians owed Hargrove $600,000 for the final year on his
contract, and he was tempted to sit out a year. But the desire to
manage took over, even if it meant taking on the challenge of going
to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about competition that's addictive,'' he
said. nn

TEXAS TEEN RUNS WITH THE BALL TO STOP RUNNING FROM TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEYVILLE, Texas _ Byron Luster thinks about the recent path
his life has taken and he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   All the lengths he had to go to, all the distance he had to
travel, all the obstacles he had to clear, all he had to learn ...
all of it just so he could wind up back where he started high
school, playing football at Colleyville Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to come back,'' Luster said as he watched
his teammates file by after practice last week. ``I just had to
mature.''
</P>
<P>
   After running into trouble and running out of chances after his
freshman year at Colleyville Heritage, Luster spent two years at
Happy Hill Farm Academy/Home near Granbury before returning this
fall. At Happy Hill, a strict private school for troubled
youngsters, Luster broke the national high school scoring record.
More important, he broke away from what he used to be _ a
breakthrough performance that has earned him a new nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to call him `New B' around here because he really is a
new person,'' Colleyville Heritage offensive coordinator Kevin
Atkinson said. ``He has made a 180-degree change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see flashes of the old Byron sometimes, and I tell him,
`That looks like the old Byron. I don't like him. I like the new
Byron a lot more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much to like about the old Byron. He stayed out too
late. He smoked marijuana. He lived with his grandmother, but he
rarely obeyed her. He didn't do his schoolwork. He started fights.
When he needed a new toothbrush, he stole one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hanging around with the wrong people,'' Luster
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems carried over to football. During the summer before
his sophomore year, Luster told coaches he should be on varsity,
even though he regularly skipped two-a-day practices. The talent
was there _ Luster's cousins, Tellis Redmon and Jack Brewer, had
been all-state performers at Grapevine _ but plenty of baggage came
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Panthers' coaching staff had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember us saying, `Byron, you're done,' '' said Atkinson,
who had worked with Luster in a study skills class as a freshman.
``That's when I thought to myself, `This kid doesn't have anything
to work for now.' Not only was he not going to make it in high
school, he was not going to make it in life. That's when I started
getting concerned and started calling around.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson grew up in Granbury, so he knew about Happy Hill. He
called the school about Luster. The school agreed to take him, and
Luster reluctantly agreed to go.
</P>
<P>
   To say Happy Hill was an adjustment for Luster doesn't do it
justice. Cutting outside on a running play up the middle, that's an
adjustment. This was an entirely different world.
</P>
<P>
   At Happy Hill, the children live with ``house parents'' on site
at the 500-acre farm/campus. Students are required to take a Bible
course and attend church every Sunday. There is a mandatory study
hour. There are chores to be done, just like any other farm. At 10
p.m., it's lights out _ no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   For Luster, whose mother died when he was in ninth grade and
whose father rarely came around, the transition was as bumpy as the
back roads that lead to the farm. He fought with other students. He
moved from house to house. The principal had to take him to every
class to make sure he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably gave him 10 extra chances that we don't normally
give kids just because we knew how important it was for him to be
there,'' said Gary Rickard, Luster's coach at Happy Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The transition in football was easier. Much, much easier. They
played six-man football at Happy Hill. The 5-foot-9, 175-pound
Luster, with his 4.4-second speed in the 40-yard dash, turned the
80-yard field into his personal playground.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pioneers' running back and kicker, Luster finished last
season with 50 touchdowns and 456 points in 11 games, a national
single-season record. Happy Hill's pass-oriented offense was
designed to make short gains. Luster turned those into long gains,
and he was always open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wild,'' said Luster, who once scored 61 points in a
game. ``It was mostly like a track meet. I just kept running and
running and running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that ESPN saying: `You can't stop him, you can only
hope to contain him,''' said current Happy Hill coach Brad Clanton,
who was Rickard's assistant in 1998. ``There just weren't enough
players on the field to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Luster also made strides off the field. His reading and math
skills jumped up several grade levels, he became more disciplined
and mature and he started to open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a smile that can warm your heart,'' Clanton said.
``Once he got past that stubbornness, you started seeing that smile
a lot more often.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Luster was to leave Happy Hill and return to
Colleyville Heritage for his senior year. Atkinson and Luster's
grandmother, Kathryn Tarrant, tried to talk him out of it, but
Luster said he was ready. So far, he has been right. He made A's
and B's on his first report card, and he has stayed out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On the football field, Luster isn't racking up points as he did
in his six-man days, but he is still making an impact as a
cornerback and kick returner and backup running back. He had 293
yards rushing in three games when starter Ced Burns was
academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``His contributions don't always show up in the stats,'' said
Colleyville Heritage coach Chris Cunningham, whose Panthers take a
3-6 record into Friday's game against Fossil Ridge. ``You don't see
how often kickers try to kick away from him and kick short, and we
get the ball at the 35- or 40-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   After this year, Luster wants to play football in college. He
would love to go to TCU, a school that showed interest in him at
Happy Hill. Mostly, he is excited about his future, a future that
looked bleak two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've surprised a lot of people,'' Luster said. ``It used to be
that people were scared to talk to me. Now people come up to me and
ask me about problems that I don't know the answer to. But I'll
still talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Byron wouldn't have done that. But the old Byron doesn't
come around much anymore. No one seems to miss him.
</P>
<P>
   Said Atkinson: ``I think the old Byron is gone forever.''

PACIFIC FIGHTS: STARS DIVISION FULL OF GRUMPY NEIGHBORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Travel plans bring Dallas Stars players back to
the old neighborhood this weekend, the rich, steep suburb that the
NHL's Pacific Division has become.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the old neighborhood has changed some. Where there were once
half-built franchises such as San Jose, a division leader has
sprouted. Where there were once decaying, struggling franchises
such as Los Angeles, a fashionable Stanley Cup pick has emerged.
Welcome to Pacific Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed. Some of the neighbors don't exactly
like the Stars, including Friday's opponent, the Phoenix Coyotes.
The past two times these teams faced off, a jaw was broken _ Stars
defenseman Derian Hatcher injuring Coyotes forward Jeremy Roenick
on April 14 _ and revenge was sought _ a drop-the-gloves,
hold-the-hockey affair that a seven-game suspension kept Hatcher
from attending on April 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how rivalries start,'' Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk clarified.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of enduring rivalries, scorching subplots and quality
of teams, Pacific Heights has become the premiere address in the
NHL. And the home of the celebrity death match also is likely to be
game of the week in the NHL this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those teams we are talking about in the Pacific
Division _ Phoenix, LA, San Jose, Anaheim and Dallas _ live next
door to each other, hate one another,'' ESPN hockey analyst Darren
Pang said. ``Now, finally, they are good, too. There is not a weak
link now amongst that group. There's five legit teams in that
division.''
</P>
<P>
   So legitimate that the defending Stanley Cup champion Stars are
slumming at the bottom of the heap. Yes, the Stars, once the envy
of the neighborhood for their fancy silverware, find themselves in
the cellar at 6-6-1.
</P>
<P>
   They are at .500 for the first time since Oct. 10, 1997. They
are on a three-game losing streak, their first since April 4, 1998.
Their offense is in shambles, 10 goals in the past eight games.
Their team is in constant flux, with four players being called up
from their International Hockey League affiliate Michigan and
inserted into Friday's lineup and nine players spending time on the
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team needs to get their heels dug in and stop the
direction they are going,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Is a tangle with the neighborhood bully just the type of gritty,
physical affair the Stars need to get the heels digging?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is trouble, that's great,'' Stars defenseman Jamie
Pushor said. ``Maybe, that will be something that will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble seems to be brewing, although both sides were
downplaying talk of revenge and retaliatory swipes.
</P>
<P>
   Talk got Hatcher in trouble last season; NHL disciplinarians
felt he had called his jaw-breaking hit on Roenick much like Babe
Ruth called his home run, and they punished him likewise.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the teams are willing to bury the hatchet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of bad blood,'' Phoenix forward Shane
Doan said. ``We never really liked each other before that happened.
It's out there, and it's on some guys minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Matvichuk: ``It would be the same thing for us. You never
get over things like that, but you just have to put it behind you.
It's one of those things where you can't dwell on it or it will
just go on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   The division is like a season of ``Melrose Place''.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars hate the Sharks because of Bryan Marchment. They hate
the Mighty Ducks because of Ruslan Salei. Mr. Salei has also led to
strained relations between the Ducks and the Coyotes. The Sharks
and the Mighty Ducks aren't exactly close ... and on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the fun things in hockey. You have to have those
subplots. You have to have those extra things,'' Stars winger Jamie
Langenbrunner said. ``Growing up, the old Chicago-Minnesota games
had that to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there is that little detail about the teams in the
division playing really good hockey. The Pacific is the only
division without a team below .500. If the season were to end
today, they'd have four teams make the playoffs. Only the Stars
would not. Pacific Heights also is home to high-scoring, marquee
players Roenick, Paul Kariya, Teemu Selanne, Luke Robitaille, Owen
Nolan, Mike Modano and Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``A look at the standings leads you to believe this is really
good hockey,'' Phoenix coach Bob Francis said. ``There are no
so-called dogs in the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock: ``I think it might be one of the
best divisions in sports.''

   He realizes his team has quite a climb to ascend the Pacific
Heights. Maybe, a Hatcher-Roenick celebrity death match atmosphere
is exactly what the Stars need to get motivated to get climbing.

   ``Rivalries are created by hatred. Well, I guess respect and
hatred, but mostly hatred,'' Pang said. ``And usually hatred gets
stirred by one incident, one isolated situation that creates
animosity which in this game creates excitement. ... Look we love
it, ESPN especially. We go and do games, and stuff like that is our
game of the week because it means something.''

HULL TRYING TO SHAKE HIS PASSING FANCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brett Hull knows what's wrong. He can shoot the
puck and he can score on nearly anyone. Right now, he just isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point, against Buffalo on Wednesday night, Hull and Joe
Nieuwendyk had a two-on-one from 15 feet and instead of shooting,
Hull forced a pass and the Dallas Stars didn't get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am right there, and it's probably an automatic goal,'' said
Hull, who has four goals in 13 games. ``I pass too much when I lose
confidence in my shooting. I don't think about it, but I know that
I am doing it. I don't think to shoot, I think to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull agrees that this is exactly what the Stars don't need, as
their scoring has dipped to a lifeless 1.85 goals per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting shots, but probably not enough five-on-five,''
Hull said. ``But, when I do get good shots I am passing too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He still leads the team in shots (48) and points (10).
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES
</P>
<P>
   At the same point last season, the Stars were 8-3-2, in first
place in the Pacific Division with 18 points and full of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in here you could tell we knew we were going to win the
game,'' defenseman Brad Lukowich said. ``You wanted it, and guys
were going right after it.''
</P>
<P>
   One year later, Dallas is 6-6-1 and in last place in the
division with 13 points. Oh yeah, one year later, the Stars are
carrying a little extra weight with a Stanley Cup on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a different air; that's part of the problem,
we have to realize that every team we play from top to bottom, it's
going to be their best game,'' Lukowich said. ``Look at Tampa Bay,
they went to the wall for us, and we didn't respond. They push us
around, and we sit back and take it and try and win the game by not
pushing back at them.''
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock thinks one reason for his team's lack of success
is a lack of effort in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   And, he isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can win, but the effort isn't the same,'' Brad
Lukowich said. ``In practice, guys are working hard, the passing is
crisp and we're scoring goals. When it comes to a game it's not
there. But, our third periods have been amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the third period, Lukowich said, the team is in a desperation
mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what he's talking about, but the teams are in a
protective mode,'' Hitchcock said. ``The desperation is there, but
we are easily taken out of the game early and we get frustrated and
we don't stay with the program. Little things take us away from
that, and we look like we can't do anything on the ice.'' COME TALK
TO ME
</P>
<P>
   Brian Skrudland walked off the StarCenter ice Thursday wondering
where was a good place to go for lunch. He joked that had to be the
topic that kept Stars coach Ken Hitchcock and Brett Hull on the ice
for an extra 20-plus minutes after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see how he's doing and how he's feeling about
things,'' Hitchock said. ``You don't want 50,000 different
opinions, and I'm more worried about he's looking like he's getting
discouraged too easily, so we talked about that. He's at his best
when he's working to get his shot away. Some guys see the game from
a grind sense, and he sees it from a skills sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hull: ``It's just a matter of what we're doing than if we
are working. It's working together as a group of five on the ice,
that's where we are screwed up.'' nn

GAINEY SHAKES UP SLUMPING STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Stars general manager Bob Gainey announced a roster
shake-up Thursday to try to jumpstart the team out of its recent
slump, and he said he wouldn't be afraid to make more changes if
these didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early, but not too early to say things have to change,''
Gainey said. ``Our goal is to get the team performing closer to the
potential of the players who are on the team and do that. If it's
changing players within the team, considering changing players from
outside the team, at this point this is the way we can look at
helping.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars recalled forwards Ryan Christie, Roman Lyashenko, Jon
Sim and Jamie Wright from their minor-league affiliate, the
Michigan K-Wings. To make room on the 23-man roster, they sent
forwards Pavel Patera, Warren Luhning and Aaron Gavey to Kalamazoo
and placed forward Juha Lind on injured reserve with a lower back
strain. He's listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   All of the players except for Lyashenko play left wing, allowing
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock to use them in their natural positions.
Hitchcock said the four new players would be in the lineup Friday
night, but he wasn't sure who he'd be taking out.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also made a point of telling his team ``the problems
aren't as big as we've made them out to be.'' He said the biggest
priority was the team regaining its confidence. nn

ARTAX OVERCOMES THAT MAN ON THE RACETRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla _ It had all the images of an Alfred Hitchcock
movie. A single character placed in the midst of chaos _ almost
humorous at first _ that builds and builds and builds until it's
clear that we're sitting and looking at a dangerous situation.
Could this be real?
</P>
<P>
   It was the day that a horse named Artax was running in one of
the races prior to the Preakness Stakes in May. Jockey Jorge Chavez
had him charging down the stretch in the middle of the pack,
running at more than 35 mph and moving his 1,000-pound body with
all the momentum of a full beer barrel rolling downhill, and this
guy steps out onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange world,'' Chavez says now, six months later,
preparing to ride Artax Saturday on Breeders' Cup championship day.
``Things happen. You never know what.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Chavez was able to steer clear of the man _ tests later
confirmed the obvious, that this person was heavily intoxicated _
Artax went by almost untouched though still running at a high
speed. He even missed the punch that this person loaded and threw
toward Artax.
</P>
<P>
   That alone would qualify for an interesting year. The man on the
track made it possible for the man on the street to remember one of
Artax's races. Horse racing rarely accomplishes such outside of the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But the thick, dark-haired Artax comes to Gulfstream Park for
the Breeders' Cup Sprint, and the horse racing community remembers
him for other races that come closer to ``Black Beauty'' than
``Psycho''.
</P>
<P>
   Artax's importance to the sport of horse racing is found by
digging deep, deep into the record books. He has broken two track
records in one year _ records held for more than a decade and at
one of America's oldest tracks. One of them was held by a horse
widely recognized as one of the greatest of the century _ Dr.
Fager.
</P>
<P>
   Any horse mentioned in the same breath with Dr. Fager _ on
paper, at least _ ought to go off as a heavy favorite in any race.
Yet Artax is the slightest of chalks on the morning line for the
Sprint, just ahead of a 3-year-old who has never raced against
older horses in a stakes race.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Albertrani, the trainer for one of racing's jocks-to-socks
horse owners in Ernie Paragallo, knows that his horse often gets
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won two Grade I (stakes races), a Grade II, and then
there's a crazed fan,'' Albertrani said. ``It's always something
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite his accomplishments, there will be reasons why
plenty in the crowd of about 50,000 that shows up here Saturday
will look elsewhere for a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Artax gets a lot of splash with his wins. Yes, he has set two
track records. But he has raced 24 times and won just six.
</P>
<P>
   He's even iffy at six furlongs, though his last race came at six
furlongs and he broke the Texas-bred Groovy's 12-year-old record at
Belmont Park. He has raced six times and won once at the distance.
</P>
<P>
   That's no Dr. Fager, who _ by the way _ set his seven-furlong
track record at New York's Aqueduct in 1968 while carrying 139
pounds. Artax carried 25 pounds less when he set his record.
</P>
<P>
   And it sounds like Artax's 14-race year is catching up with him.
No one else in the Sprint has raced as much in 1999. And Artax
keeps going, but now with glue-on shoes because the regular nail-on
type shoes may be getting to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Albertrani won't come up with excuses. His owner won't hear of
it from any trainer _ Artax got to Albertrani when Paragallo took
him from another trainer after being displeased with the horse's
performance. So that fellow who walked out onto the track,
Albertrani believes, didn't mess with Artax's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me that,'' Albertrani said. ``He didn't run
well those next couple of races, so you kind of think that maybe
what happened had some bad effect on him. But I don't think it
fazed him.''
JOCKEY STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens, president of the Jockey's Guild that serves as the
players union for jockeys, complained that little progress is being
made over a new contract between riders and member tracks of the
Thoroughbred Racing Association. The contract, which deals with the
money tracks pay into jockey's insurance programs, expires at the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read a quote from someone in the TRA that if this was
December, they would be worried,'' Stevens said. ``We'll, this
isn't December, but I am worried. We need to get some true
negotiations going because we don't want to have a walkout.''
</P>
<P>
   Live racing at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie, a TRA member
track, would not be affected since the quarter horse meet is
finished in December and thoroughbreds don't return till April. But
simulcasts could be affected if jockeys walk out at other tracks.
WIDE RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Dettori, the leading rider in Europe, was criticized in
his homeland _ and poked fun at the United States _ when he took
Swain extremely wide to the other horses' right in the stretch of
last year's Breeders' Cup Classic. He wanted to stay clear of
Silver Charm, but Awesome Again charged up along the rail to win
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have another big race to follow up after that,''
Dettori said Thursday at Gulfstream Park. ``So it took me six
months to get over it. The only person who was nice to me was
Sheikh Mohammed (owner of Swain) when he ringed me and told me not
to get down about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dettori could get revenge. He rides favored Daylami in the Turf
on Saturday.
LUKAS NO CLAIMER
</P>
<P>
   There are three horses running in the Classic that previously
have competed in claiming ranks (Budroyale, Catienus and River
Keen), and each has won anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million after
running in the claiming race. But D. Wayne Lukas, a trainer noted
for spending millions at yearling sales on horses who have never
raced before, said he's not changing his tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be claiming any horses,'' Lukas said. ``That
might be a little flash-in-the-pan situation right now. There's a
million stories of people claiming horses and turning them around.
People hit the lottery, too.''
SPOTLIGHT ON...
</P>
<P>
   BREEDERS' CUP LOOMS IN ST. JULIEN'S FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Martin Jr. rode at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie this
year and will ride Charlie's Beau in the Breeders' Cup on Saturday.
Heritage of Gold was horse of the meet at this year's thoroughbred
season, and she's in the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon St. Julien was the leading rider at Lone Star the first
two years at the track and he has moved onto Churchill Downs, but
he won't be riding in the Breeders' Cup. People might not be able
to say that next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that's the case,'' St. Julien said Thursday by
phone from Churchill. ``The people that I'm riding for, they all
get those kinds of horses.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien was leading rider at Kentucky Downs this summer. He
was third at Turfway Park, and he's finding himself on horses
trained by the likes of Dallas Stewart and Elliott Walden at
Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien, 27, had picked up the mount on Pineaff. But he has
been sold to owners who have taken him to Saudi Arabia. He rode
Golden Missile to a second-place finish in the Hawthorne Gold Cup,
but Kent Desormeaux has the ride on that horse in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners complimented my ride,'' St. Julien said, ``but they
didn't get back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien might not get back to Lone Star for a while. He's
planning on going to Fair Grounds and then back to Kentucky next
year while Lone Star races.
RUNNING AT GULFSTREAM
</P>
<P>
   This is the third running of the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream
Park in South Florida. Jockeys who ride regularly at Gulfstream,
such as Mike Smith, contend the main track and turf track usually
favor speed. But there has been only one wire-to-wire winner (Lure
in '92 on the grass in the Mile), and horses have come from as far
behind as 9 1/2 lengths (Dancing Spree in the '89 Sprint on the
dirt) and 9 1/4 lengths (Prized in the '89 Turf) to win.

NASAL STRIPS FOR HORSES A FLAIR FOR THE UNUSUAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Bobby Frankel wonders what's so bad about
taking those Breathe Right nasal strips that some athletes stick to
their nose and putting a bigger version across the snout of his
horses.
</P>
<P>
   CNS Inc. of Minneapolis has designed and recently began
distributing a four-by-sixinch-long breathing strip for horses.
Prior to one of the races last week at Santa Anita, Frankel, a Hall
of Fame trainer, put a strip on one of his horses and led her to
the paddock. When they arrived, the track stewards told Frankel to
remove the strip or they'd scratch his horse.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because those guys are stupid,'' Frankel said. ``The human
race is like that, scared of anything that's new.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the strips _ they're called ``flairs'' at the racetrack
_ are shocking the horse racing world.
</P>
<P>
   Flairs are being used in Kentucky and Oklahoma. The first day
they were used in Kentucky, two horses with odds in the double
digits ended up winning while wearing flairs.
</P>
<P>
   And it figures that they'll be used liberally Saturday during
the Breeders' Cup because they're allowed in Florida. Frankel has
four horses entered, so no one has to guess how many of them will
wear the flairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe all of them,'' Frankel said. ``I don't know anything
about them, other than what I read. They can't hurt, so I might as
well take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel has never won a Breeders' Cup race. But his move doesn't
appear to come out of desperation. He's being joined in the use of
flairs by the most successful trainer in Breeders' Cup history, D.
Wayne Lukas, who said this week that all seven of his horses will
sport flairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to lose _ they're harmless,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, not all states have approved them. As in
California, flairs are not allowed in Texas. They originally were
approved in New York, then racing officials there said that more
study was needed before they were allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, a former assistant basketball coach at Wisconsin, said
he's spoken to veterinarians _ and also some professional
basketball players _ about flairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all spoke positively,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears too early to tell how they might affect a horse's
performance. Dr. Mary Scollay-Ward, a track veterinarian on the
South Florida circuit, said she's keeping records on how all horses
perform with flairs. She said 18 horses have worn them during the
meet at Calder Racecourse. Favorites wearing them have been beaten
_ and won _ while wearing flairs, and some long shots have won _
and lost _ with them.
</P>
<P>
   Scollay-Ward said flairs are designed to keepa horse's upper
airway open during exertion. She said some of the area around the
horse's nostrils is not supported by a ring of cartilage as it is
with humans. Instead, an area of soft tissue collapses and opens
again when a horse breaths during exertion.
</P>
<P>
   The flair has a semi-rigid area between the adhesive fiber that
sticks to the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That semi-rigid material is designed to manipulate the soft
tissue and counteract what normally happens _ to keep that soft
tissue from collapsing,'' Scollay-Ward said. ``I don't think it's
going to be a magic wand for good horsemanship. It just depends on
a horse's airway and his own idiosyncrasies.''
</P>
<P>
   The main questions surrounding the use of flairs include whether
they are detrimental to a horse as well as performance-enhancing.
Because flairs are designed to keep open the horse's airway, does
material that's kicked up from the track during a race get inhaled
more easily? Does it increase or decrease the incidence of
exercise-induced bleeding in the horse's airway?
</P>
<P>
   Scollay-Ward has had a more noticeable question answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial concern was simply a matter of safety,'' she said.
``I wanted to make sure the patch didn't come partially loose and
start flapping in front of a horse's eyes during a race. But it
looks like these don't come off until a horse is bathed.''
</P>
<P>
   And since flairs are being used in the Breeders' Cup and other
races, should their use be announced to the public and printed in
the track program? Some equipment changes or medication changes _
such as the addition of blinkers or the first-time use of the
medication Lasix _ are printed in the program. But other changes,
such as a bit design for a horse's mouth or different shoes, are
not announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not announced when they put a tongue tie (on a horse to
keep him from swallowing his tongue), and a tongue tie is a more
important piece of equipment than a nasal strip would be at this
stage,'' Hall of Fame jockey Chris McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not the first time that horse trainers jumped onto a
new product.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, jockeys started wearing ``airform'' silks
made of stretchable Lycra material that clings snugly to the
rider's body. The thought was that there would be less wind
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first to start using those,'' Lukas said. ``We won
three races with them the first day. The next day everybody was
looking for a pair. Now you don't see many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure. If horses win while wearing flairs in the
Breeders' Cup, horses will wear the strips everywhere they're
allowed. nn

PATTERSON SAYS RANGERS MAY REGRET MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pitcher Danny Patterson seemed flattered to
be included in the Texas Rangers' nine-player trade with the
Detroit Tigers on Tuesday. Only one thing surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they had to throw Juan (Gonzalez) in the
deal,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did. It took Gonzalez, Patterson and reserve catcher
Gregg Zaun to get pitchers Justin Thompson, Francisco Cordero and
Alan Webb, catcher Bill Haselman, infielder Frank Catalanotto and
outfielder Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson cleaned out his locker at The Ballpark in Arlington on
Thursday and suggested the Rangers might regret trading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm strength feels good,'' said Patterson, who had surgery
at the end of the 1997 season and has been slow in recovering.
``I'm not sure this is good timing on the Rangers' part. I feel as
strong as I ever have been. I've worked on everything they've asked
me to work on. I've just made myself better for the next team.''
HARD THROWERS ONLY
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Cordero, who throws 98 mph, reliever Tim
Crabtree said the Rangers' bullpen may have a new motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put a sign out there that says, 94 miles per
hour or better needed to apply,'' Crabtree said. ``We've got people
out there who can flat overpower teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, Cordero, Jeff Zimmerman and John Wetteland can all
throw that hard and left-hander Mike Venafro is close. But the
Rangers may try one soft-tosser. The Rangers are trying to re-sign
Mike Munoz to be the second left-hander in their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   If not, the Rangers could turn their attention to Rich
Rodriguez, a left-handed free agent who pitched for the Giants last
season. GM MEETINGS
</P>
<P>
   With their blockbuster trade behind them, Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin and assistant Dan O'Brien will concentrate on
their own free agents while they're at the annual general managers
meetings in Laguna Niguel, Calif., next week.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings start Saturday and there are usually some trade
talks taking place. But O'Brien said the Rangers are probably out
of the trading business until they determine if they can re-sign
Mike Munoz, second baseman Mark McLemore, third baseman Todd Zeile
and pitcher Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're focusing on right now,'' O'Brien said.
THOMPSON GETS EXAMINATION
</P>
<P>
   Rangers orthopedist Dr. John Conway examined pitcher Justin
Thompson on Thursday and said he's progressing well from his Aug.
24 surgery to repair torn labrum cartilage in his left shoulder.
Conway said Thompson should start throwing again early in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers aren't sure if Thompson will be ready by Opening
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be healthy,'' Thompson said. ``I want to be 100
percent when I break (spring training) with the team. I want to
have an impact on this team and I don't want to go out there 75
percent. I tried to do that last year and it was tough.'' nn

NORTHRIDGE BASEBALL TO JOIN BIG WEST IN 2001
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years ago, the Cal State Northridge baseball
team was booted out of its conference. Two years ago, it was dumped
by its own school.
</P>
<P>
   But the Matadors' program survived _ barely. Now, the return of
CSUN to regional prominence is complete with the announcement
Thursday afternoon that it was accepted into the Big West
Conference as an associate member.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the conference's executive committee requires
further ratification by the Big West's Board of Directors. CSUN
would begin Big West play in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant step in the right direction,'' said head
coach Mike Batesole, who was given a four-year contract in August.
``It's a prestigious conference. You've got teams that have been in
the College World Series, teams that have won the College World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball-playing members of the Big West are: Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo, Cal State Fullerton (which has won three national
titles), Long Beach State, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Nevada and
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada is leaving the Big West for the Western Athletic
Conference, and UC Irvine revived its program last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole and Sam Jankovich, CSUN's interim athletic director
from December to July, lobbied for entrance into the Big West in
the spring. The baseball program was removed from the Western
Athletic Conference in '96, even after CSUN went 21-9 (52-18
overall) and won the WAC title.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have played as an independent the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Joining the Big West) changes the whole complexion of our
program,'' Batesole said. ``I hope we're going to be ready for it.
All our best players last year were the freshmen. The Big West is a
tremendous baseball conference. Eventually, we're going to be able
to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the second CSUN program to join the Big West in
three years; softball entered in '97. Big West Commissioner Dennis
Farrell said the conference is starting to explore schools that
could potentially become full members, and CSUN, a conditional
member of the Big Sky, seems to be on the short list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big West executive committee will meet over the next
couple of weeks to begin studying future possible full members,''
Farrell said in a prepared statement. ``The study of potential
institutions will include an assessment of financial, facility,
academic and geographic compatibility with the current conference
membership.''
</P>
<P>
   It is believed the Big West is interested in adding either Cal
State Northridge or UC-Riverside to fill the spot vacated by
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The Big West is expected to realign by 2001 with a membership
exclusively comprised of non-football playing schools in
California. If CSUN does join the conference, it will go Division
I-AA independent in football, like Cal Poly SLO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to pre-judge it at this point,'' CSUN Athletic
Director Dick Dull said. ``Obviously, we have conference membership
right now.... The Big West is a great conference. If our name is
being mentioned as a possible member, that's a compliment to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dull said the commitment from the Big West baseball coaches, who
voted unanimously to allow the Matadors into the conference, means
improvements must be made to the Matadors' home field, one of the
worst in Division I.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've maintained a dialogue with the university to make some
significant improvements to the field,'' Dull said. ``That is a
priority. In two years, you'll see a different baseball field.''

SMOLINSKI REJUVENATED WITH KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ L.A. is like an old pair of jeans to Bryan
Smolinski. Its climate goes with all the T-shirts in his closet,
and he is comfortable with the city's relaxed fit.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the hockey coach here, Andy Murray, who is tougher
than denim. Murray has been all over Smolinski, and we must say,
Smolinski never has looked better.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year veteran has 10 points in the past six games for
the Los Angeles Kings (9-3-3), who are tied for the best record in
the NHL precisely because they're getting passion and production
from their second-line center.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Luc Robitaille's, the only other lines that Kings fans
talked about were the ones to use the Forum restrooms. Those lines,
like the ones ex-coach Larry Robinson cobbled together, severely
tested the public's patience.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings won 32 games, and even though Smolinski was on the
other side of the country at the time, he could feel the Kings'
pain. The New York Islanders team he graced managed only 24
victories, which meant hockey was a pretty humbling exercise
roughly six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bland year, very boring,'' said Smolinski, a one-time
30-goal scorer who finished the 1998-99 season with 16 goals and 40
points.
</P>
<P>
   Losing is like any other habit. It's hard to shake. When
Smolinski was traded to the Kings as part of the blockbuster deal
that also brought proven scorer Ziggy Palffy to L.A., Smolinski
decided to make a clean break.
</P>
<P>
   In his first telephone conversation with Murray, who had just
replaced Robinson, Smolinski talked about the Kings' upcoming
training camp as though it were a 12-step recovery program, aimed
at helping him overcome his dependence on losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to really ride me hard in training camp,''
Smolinski told Murray, ``because I think I've forgotten how to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski might as well have been telling David Letterman to be
sarcastic or Dennis Rodman to be outrageous. Murray is a noted
taskmaster, and he didn't let Smolinski squirm free from his
self-imposed sentence.
</P>
<P>
   When the 27-year-old played sluggishly early in camp, ``I was
pretty tough on him,'' Murray said. ``We tried to indicate to him
what we felt hard work was all about. There were some rough spots
during training camp, but he took all the criticism and kept at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, Glen Murray and Donald Audette skated together
throughout training camp but didn't start to click until the
regular season was under way.
</P>
<P>
   They had no points in the first five games. Since then, they
have been a revelation. They have had all the harmony of the
Kingston Trio, outscoring the No. 1 line of Robitaille, Jozef
Stumpel and Palffy, 16 goals to 8 and 34 points to 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we found our synchronicity, it's been fantastic,'' said
Smolinski, who has gotten his goals every which way: He redirected
a puck in mid-air against Washington and got an empty netter
against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He has gotten his assists the old-fashioned way. He has earned
them by digging pucks out of corners and by getting physical, the
latter something he was criticized for failing to do when he was
with the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The league recognized Smolinski's efforts _ and impact _ the
other day by naming him NHL Player of the Week, the first time in
his career he has been so honored. In his college years at Michigan
State, Smolinski often was confused for a wide receiver on the
football team who had the same name. A few more weeks like this
last one and Brian Smolinski, wherever he is, might start getting
asked if he's ``the hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become for us a real catalyst,'' Andy Murray said of
Smolinski, who has four goals and 13 points in 15 games. ``The
bottom line is, we need that from him. I think he knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Smolinski knows is this: When you're winning, ``Food tastes
better. Wine tastes better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but does traffic on the 405 seem better? Smolinski laughed.
As a matter of fact, since he arrived in L.A. he has been laying
off his car horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a smile on your face, your whole attitude changes,''
he said. ``I'm happy-go-lucky right now.''

BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM SAID TO BE STILL A THREAT
</HEADLINE>
 B-CORONER-CONVENTION-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Harrison Sheppard  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- Improving technology is increasing the
possibility of biological terrorism against Los Angeles and other
U.S. cities, a military expert on biological warfare said at a
seminar on bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Theodore J. Cieslak, field operations chief at the U.S. Army
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick,
Md., said that only major world powers with huge research budgets
can develop biological weapons that can kill mass numbers of
people. But samples of viruses such as anthrax are relatively easy
to obtain, he said, and terrorists continue to get smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is there now to do it on a small scale,''
Cieslak said in an interview following his talk. ``To do it on a
larger scale is, fortunately for us, a lot more problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``the intelligence community feels within the
next 10 years the chance of a larger scale successful attack is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Cieslak was speaking at an annual three-day conference organized
by Los Angeles County coroner/chief medical examiner Lakshmanan
Sathyavagiswaran to provide professional education to his staff and
other medical examiners from throughout the country. It was held in
the Los Angeles community of North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Held at the Beverly Garland Hilton Hotel in North Hollywood, the
conference includes such gruesome topics as ``Use of Cadaver
Detection Dogs'' and ``Homicide Since the Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Cieslak tried to teach the doctors what to look for if they
suspect an anthrax attack but said it is difficult to diagnose at
first. Unfortunately, the disease's first symptoms are similar to a
common cold or flu, and by the time they become more serious, it is
too late for treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wait for the medical examiner to make the first
diagnosis, the horse is already out of the barn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the best hope doctors have is to then quickly try to
find other people who have come into contact with the virus and
administer the proper antibiotics along with a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have seen a steep rise in the number
of anthrax hoaxes in the past few years, he said, to the point
where they have become the '90s equivalent of the bomb threat or
the fire alarm pull.
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively easy to fraudulently obtain a culture of
anthrax, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is that in order to spread the virus
effectively through the air, it has to be reduced in size and kept
that way over time, a very difficult and expensive process that
only a few countries have mastered.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience reacted with a mix of shock and shrugs.
Some said they were personally more worried about realistic,
everyday threats like gunshots and automobile accidents, rather
than something that has only a slim possibility of occurring.
Others said just the possibility of a terrorist anthrax attack was
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary thought, isn't it?,'' said Dr. Lisa Scheinin, a
deputy medical examiner with the county Coroner's Office. ``The
scary thing is by the time you know what the problem is, there are
people who are already dead and are going to die no matter what you
do. It's kind of sobering how easy it is, if some nut with a little
bit of brains wants to do it.''

USC'S SOWARD HURTING, BUT WILL TRY TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC senior wide receiver R. Jay Soward's strained
left hamstring has not improved, but he will try to play against
Arizona State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the same (as last week),'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Paul Hackett said he was encouraged by Soward's
practice performance Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``R. Jay looked far better today, I think things are coming
together,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward was less enthusiastic but did agree with Hackett on one
thing: ``Put it this way, I'll be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward missed last week's game against California because of the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is the man: Hackett refused to officially divulge his
starting quarterback, but sources indicated Thursday that senior
John Fox will get the nod over Mike Van Raaphorst against Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll decide before the game,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has taken the majority of snaps in practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would feel great (to start),'' Fox said. ``To get the first
couple series would be nice. (Hackett) hasn't told us. He said
we'll both play. It's kind of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is trying to keep Arizona State off balance, but it's
debatable how effective that strategy works. Last year, USC
assistant Steve Morton was with Washington when the Trojans sprung
Carson Palmer as a last-minute starter on the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   But Morton said in the case of Fox and Mike Van Raaphorst, he
didn't think Arizona State would prepare any differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually more about yourself, and what you're trying to
do,'' Morton said. ``I'm sure they'll be ready for both.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey starts: Although he missed practice Thursday to rest
his sprained ankle, left tackle Brent McCaffrey will start. Backup
center Matt McShane had the flu and missed practice. Right tackle
Travis Claridge was held out earlier in the week with the flu but
has recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Grain hopeful: Right guard Jason Grain, who underwent knee
surgery last month, said he believes he might be ready next week,
and will definitely be available for the UCLA game Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Poll reaction: Hackett said he had not heard about a Daily
Trojan poll that asked readers if he should remain as head coach.
``Typical USC, if you're not winning,'' Hackett joked.
</P>
<P>
   But USC's players were aware of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of surprised about it,'' cornerback Kris Richard
said. ``I wouldn't figure our student-run paper would print
something in that manner. People have been on him all year, and
it's not his fault. He's not the one out there turning the ball
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Results of the poll will be published next week.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie improves: Although he has rarely touched the football
recently, tailback Malaefou MacKenzie had his best week of
practice, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finally starting to see the Malaefou I remember,'' Hackett
said. ``I think it takes two years when you have a knee injury to
come fully back. (Defensive lineman) Ennis Davis is having a good
year (following knee surgery), but next year will be himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said MacKenzie will play more against the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler endowment: A football scholarship was officially
endowed Thursday in the name of the late USC wide receiver Bob
Chandler. An endowed scholarship is worth $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu out: Linebacker Troy Polamalu (concussion) will sit
another week before being allowed to play.

CONGRESS APPROVES SWEEPING NEW BANKING LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts throughout) (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress approved landmark legislation on Thursday
that opens the door for a new era on Wall Street in which
commercial banks, securities houses and insurers will find it
easier and cheaper to enter one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, considered by many the most important banking
legislation in 66 years, was approved in the Senate by a vote of
90-8 and in the House on Thursday night by 362-57. The bill will
now be sent to the president, who is expected to sign it, aides
said. It would become one of the most significant achievements this
year by the White House and the Republicans leading the 106th
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed
financial services since the Great Depression and replace them with
a system for the 21st century,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.
Summers said. ``This historic legislation will better enable
American companies to compete in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 provoked
dire warnings from a handful of dissenters that the deregulation of
Wall Street would someday wreak havoc on the nation's financial
system. The original idea behind Glass-Steagall was that separation
between bankers and brokers would reduce the potential conflicts of
interest that were thought to have contributed to the speculative
stock frenzy before the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action followed a rich congressional debate about the
history of finance in America in this century, the causes of the
banking crisis of the 1930s, the globalization of banking and the
future of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and many Republicans and Democrats said
the measure would save consumers billions of dollars and was
necessary to keep up with trends in both domestic and international
banking. Some institutions, like Citigroup, already have banking,
insurance and securities arms but could have been forced to divest
their insurance underwriting under existing law. Many foreign banks
already enjoy the ability to enter the securities and insurance
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world changes, and we have to change with it,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, who wrote the law that will bear his name
along with the two other main Republican sponsors, Rep. Jim Leach
of Iowa and Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia. ``We have a new
century coming, and we have an opportunity to dominate that century
the same way we dominated this century. Glass-Steagall, in the
midst of the Great Depression, came at a time when the thinking was
that the government was the answer. In this era of economic
prosperity, we have decided that freedom is the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House debate, Leach said, ``This is a historic day. The
landscape for delivery of financial services will now surely
shift.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and civil rights advocates criticized the
legislation for being a sop to the nation's biggest financial
institutions. They say that it fails to protect the privacy
interests of consumers and community lending standards for the
disadvantaged and that it will create more problems than it solves.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the measure gloomily predicted that by
unshackling banks and enabling them to move more freely into new
kinds of financial activities, the new law could lead to an
economic crisis down the road when the marketplace is no longer
growing briskly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will look back in 10 years' time and say we should
not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the
past, and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010,''
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``I wasn't around during the 1930s
or the debate over Glass-Steagall. But I was here in the early
1980s when it was decided to allow the expansion of savings and
loans. We have now decided in the name of modernization to forget
the lessons of the past, of safety and of soundness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said that Congress had ``seemed
determined to unlearn the lessons from our past mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scores of banks failed in the Great Depression as a result of
unsound banking practices, and their failure only deepened the
crisis,'' Wellstone said. ``Glass-Steagall was intended to protect
our financial system by insulating commercial banking from other
forms of risk. It was one of several stabilizers designed to keep a
similar tragedy from recurring. Now Congress is about to repeal
that economic stabilizer without putting any comparable safeguard
in its place.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation rejected those arguments. They
responded that historians and economists have concluded that the
Glass-Steagall Act was not the correct response to the banking
crisis because it was the failure of the Federal Reserve in
carrying out monetary policy, not speculation in the stock market,
that caused the collapse of 11,000 banks. If anything, the
supporters said, the new law will give financial companies the
ability to diversify and therefore reduce their risks. The new law,
they said, will also give regulators new tools to supervise shaky
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns that we will have a meltdown like 1929 are
dramatically overblown,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the legislation was essential for the future
leadership of the American banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't pass this bill, we could find London or Frankfurt
or years down the road Shanghai becoming the financial capital of
the world,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``There are many
reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that
U.S. financial firms remain competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers criticized the provisions of the legislation
aimed at discouraging community groups from pressing banks to make
more loans to the disadvantaged. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said
during the House debate that the legislation was ``mean-spirited in
the way it had tried to undermine the Community Reinvestment Act.''
And Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said it was ironic that while the
legislation was deregulating financial services, it had begun a new
system of onerous regulation on community advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts predict that, even though the legislation has been
trailing market trends that have begun to see the cross-ownership
of banks, securities firms and insurers, the new law is certain to
lead to a wave of large financial mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has estimated the legislation could save
consumers as much as $18 billion a year as new financial
conglomerates gain economies of scale and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts have disputed those estimates as overly
optimistic, and said that the bulk of any profits seen from the
deregulation of financial services would be returned not to
customers but to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the key provisions of the legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Banks will be able to affiliate with insurance companies and
securities concerns with far fewer restrictions than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ The legislation preserves the regulatory structure in
Washington and gives the Federal Reserve and the Office of
Comptroller of the Currency roles in regulating new financial
conglomerates. The Securities and Exchange Commission will oversee
securities operations at any bank, and the states will continue to
regulate insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ It will be more difficult for industrial companies to control
a bank. The measure closes a loophole that had permitted a number
of commercial enterprises to open savings associations known as
unitary thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican senator, Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted against
the legislation. He was joined by seven Democrats: Barbara Boxer of
California, Richard Bryan of Nevada, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin,
Tom Harkin of Iowa, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Dorgan and
Wellstone.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, 155 Democrats and 207 Republicans voted for the
measure, while 51 Democrats, 5 Republicans and 1 independent
opposed it. Fifteen members did not vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tucked away in the legislation is a provision that some experts
on Thursday warned could cost insurance policyholders as much as
$50 billion. The provision would allow mutual insurance companies
to move to other states to avoid payments they would otherwise owe
policyholders as they reorganize their corporate structure. Many
states, including New York and New Jersey, do not allow such
relocations without the consent of the insurer's domicile state.
But the legislation before Congress would pre-empt the states.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and the Prudential Life
Insurance Co. are in the midst of reorganizing into stock-based
corporations that are requiring them to pay billions of dollars to
policyholders from years of accumulated surplus. In exchange, the
policyholders give up their ownership in the mutual insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would permit any mutual insurance company to
avoid making surplus payments to policyholders by simply moving to
states with more permissive laws and setting up a hybrid corporate
structure known as a mutual holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was inserted by Representative Bliley at the
urging of a trade association. It attracted little opposition
because it was attached to a provision that forbids insurers from
discriminating against domestic-violence victims.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Congress this week, Summers said that the
provision ``could allow insurance companies to avoid state law
protecting policyholders, enriching insiders at the expense of
consumers.'' &QL;

FOX HOPES TO HOOK SOME VIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Monday morning, the face of sports television
programming could be altered forever.
</P>
<P>
   And it could come up smelling like fish.
</P>
<P>
   Those in charge of interpreting the weekend ratings at each
network will pay particular attention to how many people left their
TV sets on after Fox's NFL coverage Sunday morning and actually
allowed a bass-fishing tournament to continue on their
entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   Because ratings are so vital to any program's life cycle, Fox's
coverage of the Ranger Millennium M1 bass fishing tournament from
Cypress Gardens, Fla., shown locally from 1:30 to 3 p.m., could
either be a catch-and-release proposition or they'll have the
ratings stuffed and mounted on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   It's another Fox network first _ those who get this event from
2:30 to 4 p.m. in the Eastern time zone will see an hour of the
90-minute telecast live.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that an average NASCAR event on the network gets
anywhere from a 3 to 4 rating, how will we know if fishing is the
next great show under the guise of sports to be shoved down our
gills?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the first number is a 1 (rating), everyone (at the other
networks) will say, `Congratulations, at least they tried,''' said
Fox Sports senior producer Bill Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the first number is a 2, there'll be some shoulder
shrugging, and `OK, they got a 2.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If the first number is a 3, some eyebrows will be raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if that first number is a 4 or over, there will be a staff
meeting at all four networks by the end of the business day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has tried to make this viewer-friendly by luring the generic
Joe Buck as the show's host with baseball analyst Bob Brenly as one
of the colormen. Terry Bradshaw was also supposed to contribute
taped features for the show, but he reinjured his back last week
and couldn't go through with it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the event came about when Fox Sports chief David
Hill was given an unusual present last year by his wife _ he got to
spend a week on an Alaskan fishing troller. He was so excited when
he came back to work that he convinced Fox Sports executive
producer Ed Goren to find a way to put a fishing show on their
network. By last May, Fox worked a deal with Intersport to carry
what will be the world's richest bass tournament _ the winner can
take $1 million by having the largest catch after Sunday's final
day.
</P>
<P>
   A new perch: High above the western sideline, Chick Hearn might
have had the worst seat in the Forum to watch Lakers basketball.
And he had to put up with it for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the new Staples Center, Hearn can probably lay claim to the
best seat in the house.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 rows up from the floor at midcourt on the opposite side
of the team benches, Hearn and company have been given a row of the
$150 seats to call the game. He couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised and very pleased at where we're sitting,'' Hearn
said after Wednesday's home opener. ``It's very advantageous _ it's
at least 25 feet closer to the floor than we were at the Forum,
which makes a tremendous difference. The angle is quite a bit
flatter, but it gives us a great perspective.'
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that maybe a courtside seat would be the most
desirable _ right next to Jack Nicholson, if you please. But not
for calling basketball. Although that's where Hearn and analyst Stu
Lantz are seated for each road game, Hearn would prefer the angle
he now has at the Staples Center every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good thing about sitting on the floor is the ability
to converse with the referees,'' said Hearn. ``Very often they make
a call that you might not understand and they can explain it to
you, and you can let the fans in on that. Otherwise, you get
blinded (sitting courtside because of the coaches and players
passing by).''
</P>
<P>
   Listen up ... or don't: Before you're tempted to plop down $50
for an impressively packaged book with two CDs called ``And The
Crowd Goes Wild: Relive the Most Celebrated Sports Events Ever
Broadcast'' (by Joe Garner, 180 pages, Sourcebooks, Inc.),
understand there's a warning label on the cover jacket that you
might otherwise overlook.
</P>
<P>
   That is: ``Narrated by Bob Costas.''
</P>
<P>
   Narration might not be the best way to describe what he actually
does. In his mind, he's a regular Uncle Remus.
</P>
<P>
   In that meticulously annoying way of speech, Costas drones on
with historical context, recreating every possible step leading up
to and including nuances and footnotes to the event you're about to
hear. By the time you've stopped salivating to hear this incredible
call captured on CD, you've either nodded off or you're tempted to
skip to the next track to see if that's any more concise. But it
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   This does, after all, come with !ital!a book!off!. If you're
really interested in all that stuff that happened before the call,
read it yourself. Why Costas must regurgitate before we finally
hear ``Havlicek stole the ball!'' is nothing less than a
frustrating waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad author and Westwood One exec Joe Garner, who
produced the bestselling ``We Interrupt This Broadcast,'' was duped
into thinking Costas would not only attract attention to the book
but give it some extra credibility.
</P>
<P>
   And a local aside: The audio on Kirk Gibson's World Series home
run from 1988 is from Jack Buck's radio broadcast, not Vin Scully's
TV call. At least it does have the Kings' Bob Miller making the
call on Wayne Gretzky's two greatest achievements, when he broke
the NHL scoring mark and later scored the 802nd goal of his career
to pass Gordie Howe. But the misleading photo of Gretzky on the
back of the cover is of him in an Edmonton uniform hoisting the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _You don't mess around with Phil Jackson's karma, especially if
you're with the media. ESPN's Mark Schwartz was made the season's
first example. He corralled Lakers guard Derrick Fisher for an
interview after the team's win in the opener at Utah, and the
always accommodating Fisher was OK with it until he realized he was
supposed to be in the locker room immediately after the game and
finally pulled away. After Jackson's session with the media ended
later, the coach singled out Schwartz in a loud voice, telling him:
``Don't you ever grab one of my players off the floor again. Unless
ESPN has exclusive rights (to game coverage) or you're with TNT,
forget it.'' &QL; 
_In The Sporting News list of the 100 greatest football players,
!arrow!John Elway, who couldn't crack ESPN's SportsCentury poll of
the 100 greatest athletes, is No.16. Dan Marino, who made ESPN's
poll, fits in the No. 27 slot of the TSN list. KCBS Channel 2 airs
a Jim Nantz-hosted special on this TSN team Saturday at 11 a.m. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   _ABC sorted out its college football announcer chain of command
by deciding there isn't a real No. 1 team for its No. 1 game. For
the Jan. 4 Sugar Bowl, which this season will decide the national
championship, the network announced it is using hypemeister Brent
Musburger on play-by-play with colorman Gary Danielson. So there's
no hard feelings, Brad Nessler and Bob Griese will work next
season's national-title game at the Orange Bowl. Keith Jackson and
new sidekick Dan Fouts will do the next couple of Rose Bowls, but
no decision has been made on the 2002 game, which will be in the
rotation as the national-title game. &QL; 
_ESPN airs the MLB Players Association Players Choice Awards
tonight at 5:30, with updates on any blockbuster trades as they
happen. &QL; 
_HBO has moved the first weekly showing of ``Inside the NFL'' from
11 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursdays. C'mon, doesn't anyone at HBO watch
``Friends'' any more?

   IRAN-U.S. (Tehran, Iran) _ Nov. 4, the 20th anniversary of the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy here, was to be a day of days, a
triumphal homecoming for the revolutionary class of '79. But
somehow, amid the strident speechmaking and the punching of the air
at Thursday's rally, there was something out of temper, something
registering unmistakably that even in Islamic Iran, the years have
marched on. For one thing, there can hardly have been more than
5,000 people at the gathering, in a city of 12 million. For
another, many in the crowd seemed to have trouble working up the

VOTERS DEAL MEYER, NHRA A STUNNING SETBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waiting for all precincts to report, Billy Meyer and wife
Deborah and their friends and staff worked over the last of the
pizza and the soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   They had spent most of the previous two hours in a room at the
Crescent Hotel in downtown Dallas. Via the Internet and from
comrades stationed at various polling places, they had been
monitoring the vote on Proposition 2 on the city of Grand Prairie
election ballot Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., the results were in and the people had spoken. A
quarter-cent sales tax increase to finance up to $50.5 million for
construction of a proposed $65 million Texas Motorplex had been
defeated, 54 percent to 46 percent. The actual margin was 676
voters who obviously never have whiffed the pungent smell of
nitromethane in the morning, or of John Force's fire suit up close.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need no stinking drag strip in Grand Prairie, is what
the voters said to Meyer, so take your act back to Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are my plans?'' Meyer said. He mentioned something about
playing golf this weekend, after huddling again with Grand Prairie
Mayor Charles England about alternative ways to perhaps finance his
grandiose public/private project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people thought I'd be more upset,'' said Meyer,
the former Funny Car driver who has operated the Motorplex in Ennis
since 1986. ``My goal is not to build a racetrack in Grand Prairie.
My goal is to grow the sport of NHRA Winston Drag Racing and
provide a better facility for the fans in Dallas and Tarrant
counties. I really do live by the theory that whatever you vividly
imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe in and enthusiastically
act upon, must inevitably come to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans who have visited the Motorplex might recognize those words.
They are inscribed on a plaque near the entrance to the track's
tower complex, and elsewhere on the grounds. They are the credo of
Success Motivation Institute International, the company founded by
Billy's father, Paul J. Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thoroughly believe that saying. And I usually add one thing
to that: `If it's God's will,' '' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this was the voters' will. And after two years of
lobbying and debate, the voters dealt Meyer a stunning setback in
his bid to bring big-time National Hot Rod Association drag racing
closer to Fort Worth/Dallas and take the Motorplex into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   When it was opened in 1986, the Motorplex was the
state-of-the-art drag-racing facility. Its stadium-style tower
complex complete with suites revolutionized the way sponsors, fans
and the media looked at drag racing. The Motorplex remains one of
the most user-friendly stops on the NHRA tour, but in recent
seasons it has been passed on the amenities list by the Route 66
Raceway in Joliet, Ill., and the revamped Bristol (Tenn.) Dragway.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, which played host to the inaugural Winston Showdown
in July, is owned by motorsports mogul Bruton Smith. The NHRA has
granted Smith a national event at his Las Vegas Motor Speedway for
next season, and another of his motorsports taj mahals is in the
process of being built there.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also has given Eddie Gossage, the executive vice president
and general manager of Texas Motor Speedway, the go-ahead to build
an NHRA-worthy facility on the grounds in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Gossage reiterated that the vote in Grand Prairie
would have no impact on the proposed drag strip at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said that all along,'' Gossage said. ``We're in the
process of trying to make a good, sound business decision on the
drag strip. We will do that when the time comes. I never had a
desire to add a drag strip in 2000. On the front burner now are two
major additions to our venue: a dirt track and a road course. We
have several new events to put on the schedule and get up to speed,
in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the timing of the drag-strip announcement at TMS
last summer never was intended to create doubts among Grand Prairie
voters about the viability of Meyer's project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to stay out of the picture and were successful in
doing that in the months leading up to that vote,'' Gossage said.
``I don't think Billy Meyer would tell you that it (TMS'
announcement) impacted his vote in the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it had passed. I was disappointed it lost. There were
votes taken across this country to build arenas and stadiums and
things like that, and it seems voters are fairly quick to support a
stadium or arena. But they have yet to support building a
racetrack, which records indicate has far more of an impact on the
economy than a stadium. So from that standpoint, it was
disappointing. The citizens of Grand Prairie probably turned their
backs on some real economic development for the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer knows. He got the message Tuesday night, about the time
the pizza and the soft drinks ran out.
</P>
<P>
   WALTRIP CALLS FOR PROTECTION OF SINGLE-CAR OWNERS
</P>
<P>
   Count three-time Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip among
those who would like to see NASCAR implement a franchise system of
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A former team owner/driver, Waltrip opted to sell his team to
Texan Tim Beverley last year rather than search for a primary
corporate sponsor. The same fate since has befallen Cup
owner/drivers Geoffrey Bodine and Ricky Rudd, the latter having
lost his Tide sponsorship to newcomer Cal Wells III in July.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd has opted to accept an offer to join Robert Yates' powerful
two-car operation beginning next year. Meanwhile, former Cup
champion Bill Elliott might have to follow suit once his deal with
McDonald's expires after next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about guys like myself who have been driven out by
all these multicar car owners,'' said Waltrip, who ran his own team
from 1991 through the fifth race of the 1998 season. Waltrip scored
five of his career 84 Cup victories, most during the sport's modern
era, while driving for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked 30 years for this, 30 years to end up with
nothing,'' said Waltrip, who has not won since 1992. ``I wanted to
be an owner, and it's not possible the way the sport is structured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this sport. I don't want to hurt the sport. I want it
to be fair and equal, and I don't think it is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, 52, drove for himself, seven-time Cup champion Dale
Earnhardt (in relief of the injured Steve Park) and Beverley during
a barnstorming 1998 tour that featured three different primary
sponsors. Waltrip was nearly out the door late last year when
co-owners Travis Carter and Carl Haas came to his rescue with a
start-up Ford Taurus team sponsored by Big Kmart and Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an advocate of some sort of franchising system, to
where these teams have market value,'' said Waltrip, who will
launch his farewell ``Victory Tour 2000'' at the Daytona 500 in
February. ``Ricky Rudd told me the other day, `I guess I've got to
have an auction (of his team's equipment).' That's a sorry state of
affairs. That team should have a value and if someone wanted to
come into this sport, they should have to come in on the front end
and not suck resources out of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could look at CART and Formula One; they scrutinize any new
owner coming into the sport. We haven't done that. But dadgum, we
may need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While most have pigeonholed the witty Waltrip for a post-driving
career as a racing commentator, he has not completely ruled out
owning another Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love TV, get a kick out of it,'' Waltrip said. ``But I don't
know if that's challenging enough for me or not. There's not
another cat that's been in this sport that has any more compassion
for what we do. I am a race fan, and I love racing. There may be a
role for me down the road that hasn't become available yet. I'm a
fighter. I like to see a level playing field for everybody.''

<P>
   QUICK HITS BRISTOL TO ADD DIRT
</P>
<P>
   Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway officials announced Wednesday
that they will put more than 8,000 cubic yards of dirt on the
high-banked half-mile track next year to hold events for the
Pennzoil World of Outlaws Sprint Car and the Hav-A-Tampa Dirt Late
Model series.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are for the dirt to be placed on the concrete surface
starting in mid-May in preparation for the Hav-A-Tampa race on June
2-3 and the Outlaws on June 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol is the the fourth Speedway Motorsports track scheduled
to play host to the Outlaws next season. World of Outlaws president
Ted Johnson said speeds for the lightweight, winged Sprint Cars
will exceed those of the Winston Cup cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Hav-A-Tampa series features stock-appearing, aluminum-bodied
cars with 750 horsepower engines. CART INVASION?
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mehl figures the Indy Racing League will have to budget for
extra stamps next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mehl, the IRL executive director, said he anticipates ``a number
of CART teams'' will compete in the 84th Indianapolis 500 on May
28. With few exceptions, members of the Championship Auto Racing
Teams series have boycotted the Indy 500 in a dispute with IRL
founder Tony George since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mehl said IRL officials sent out invitations to CART teams in
1996 and 1997 but received near-zero interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998 we decided to save the stamps,'' Mehl said. ``If they
give us an indication (next year), we'll invite them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivals have not reconciled, but there are no conflicts
between CART's 2000 schedule and the Indy 500 qualifying and race
weekends in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``My source of information is based on (IRL) engine builders
who've had inquiries to build engines and chassis prepared for the
2000 car,'' Mehl said. ``They've had a flurry of activity the last
few weeks. Until it happens, you don't know. But I think for sure
we'll have 10 or 12 (CART-owned) cars.'' SCHUMACHER SO CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   Second-generation drag racer Tony Schumacher is within four
passes of clinching his first NHRA Top Fuel championship.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher exited Houston Raceway Park in Baytown on Sunday with
a 109-point lead over Gary Scelzi, the two-time and reigning series
champion. Third-place Joe Amato, a five-time Top Fuel champion, is
120 points out. The top three are the only drivers mathematically
eligible for the title heading into the season-ending Automobile
Club of Southern California Winston Finals at Pomona (Calif.)
Raceway on Nov. 11-14.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher will clinch if he qualifies in the top 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important race,'' said Schumacher, 29. ``To be
sitting where I am is tremendous. Next week I hope to understand
it. But I've still got four runs to get down the racetrack.'' MUST
BE THE SHOES
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr. and Scott Pruett were recognized for their
achievements in CART during the driver's meeting at the California
Speedway on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Little Al is headed to the Indy Racing League, reportedly with
former Indy 500-winning team owner Rick Galles. And Pruett is
jumping to the NASCAR Winston Cup Series for new car owner Cal
Wells III.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Craig, CART's chairman and chief executive officer, asked
each driver for his driving shoes after the Marlboro 500. The shoes
will be bronzed and mounted on commemorative plaques. FINALE SET AT
KENNEDALE
</P>
<P>
   Kennedale Speedway Park ends its season with the inaugural
Tournament of Speed this weekend. The three-day event begins Friday
with time trials and heat races. Racing continues Saturday and
concludes with main events Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A $20,000 purse has been posted, with $1,500 going to the winner
of Sunday's International Motor Contest Association-type Modified
main event.
</P>
<P>
   Also competing are Street Stocks and Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Racing begins at 8 p.m. Friday, 7 p.m. Saturday, and 3 p.m.
Sunday. For more information, call (817) 561-0200. LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I get done crying, it makes me feel beautiful.
Greg, I'm going to miss you. Everybody knows he was one hell of a
race-car driver, and 10 times a human being.'' _ Jimmy Vasser, at
the funeral of CART driver Greg Moore

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest that the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Even with electrical power out, the pilots could have continued
flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables rather than
a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system failed, the
hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the engines were
running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

SAN BERNARDINO WATER POLO TEAM SCORES STATE-RECORD 58 GOALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO _ San Bernardino High is still king of Inland
Empire water polo, and the Cardinals delivered that statement in
record fashion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   SBHS won its 10th consecutive league championship, throttling
Colton 58-4 at Cardinal City.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most goals scored in one game in state history,
eclipsing the previous mark of 52 shared by, coincidentally, Colton
(against Palm Springs in 1979) and Corona del Mar (against
Saddleback in 1983).
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen players scored for the Cardinals in the San Andreas
League finale. San Bernardino finished 9-1 in the SAL, one game
better than Yucaipa, which beat the Cardinals 9-8 earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Westwood scored 11 goals and Kyle Clark added 10 for San
Bernardino, which scored 23 or more goals in six of its 10 league
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coach said the record was 56, so we decided to try and
beat it,'' said senior Trevor Agre, who scored nine goals. ``A
couple of their players said, `You guys are selfish' and that kind
of hurt. I think they thought we were trying to kill them or
something. After the game they didn't shake our hands like they
usually do, they just walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy about (winning the league title),'' San
Bernardino coach Troy Delmonico said. ``It's a testament to a lot
of hard work for a long time, and teaching the fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good about the game today even though we did get
the title. It's not very sportsmanlike.''
</P>
<P>
   San Bernardino led 12-0 after the first quarter, 26-2 at
halftime and 42-2 after three quarters. The Cardinals averaged 2.1
goals per minute in the 28-minute match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from the same district that has Bloomington (football),
what can I say?'' said Colton athletic director Kirk McVey, who
added that Colton was missing players because of poor grades.
``(Ex-Bloomington football coach) Don Markham tried to run up the
score. Do I condone it? No. Do I understand coaches who did it?
Yes. It's obviously going to leave a bitter feeling for those
(Colton) players. I feel for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Markham's teams regularly blew out opponents, and in 1994, the
Bruins set a national scoring record with 880 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Delmonico said it was nothing personal. He even apologized
to Colton coach Jim Vickers after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad about score, it's unsportsmanlike,'' said
Delmonico, whose 18-7 team heads into the CIF-Southern Section
DivisionV playoffs next week. ``But we have eight seniors, and it
was their last game in the league, and we're going into the
(playoffs). ... We could very well get matched up with a tough team
in the first round. The seniors needed to be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make any comments because what I would have to
say is not good,'' Vickers said.
</P>
<P>
   Added San Bernardino sophomore Roy Frech: ``We felt kind of
happy that we had won and that we set the record, but we didn't go
out there just to disgrace the other team.''

TAXI COMPANIES SETTLE SUIT WITH BLIND RIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jesse Hiestand  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Five Los Angeles taxi companies have agreed to
settle a lawsuit filed by blind customers who claimed they were
denied service by drivers who objected to carrying guide dogs in
their cabs, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   In settling the discrimination suit, the taxi companies agreed
to pay $34,500 in damages and pledged to improve drivers' training
on serving the disabled and to improve complaint procedures and
penalties for those who discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great victory,'' said Eve L. Hill, executive director
for the Western Law Center for Disability Rights, which filed the
federal civil rights suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with vision impairment really depend on their service
animals to give them freedom, and without the ability to use a
taxicab, that freedom is severely restricted,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit grew out of customer complaints that drivers did not
want to carry dogs because they considered them dirty or they
feared an allergic reaction or because it was against their
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The suit on behalf of five individuals alleged violation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act and California laws requiring that
guide dogs be allowed in public places, including taxicabs, Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said she hoped the settlement reached Thursday would put
other Southern California taxi companies on notice that
discrimination will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   William Rouse said his clients, L.A. Taxi Cooperative and Fiesta
Taxi Cooperative, teach new drivers to treat disabled people fairly
and intend to step up those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position throughout this lawsuit was that blind
individuals are a critical and valued part of our customer base,''
Rouse said. ``So, strictly from a customer-care point of view, we
wanted to make sure we were doing right by our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse said his clients had enough evidence to prove they did not
discriminate but decided it was more prudent to settle the case.
The three other defendants were United Independent Taxi Drivers,
L.A. Checker Cab Co. and Beverly Hills Cab.
</P>
<P>
   Trial was set to begin in U.S. District Court last week and
settlement negotiations had been under way for six weeks, Hills
said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Access Services Inc., which provides
transportation for the disabled, will establish a subcommittee to
study issues affecting customers who have guide dogs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs, Ken Metz of Torrance, said that on
several occasions he called for a cab and waited at curbside for
more than an hour. When he later called to ask why he was not
picked up, he was told the driver went to the appointed spot and
found no one there.
</P>
<P>
   Metz believes the taxi drivers actually saw him and decided not
to stop because his guide dog was with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the drivers told me he didn't want the dog. He said the
fur would end up in the cab,'' Metz said. ``I think a lot of it
comes from a lack of understanding; some of it could be cultural
differences. But my goal from the onset was education for the
drivers and the taxi companies.''

ZACARIAS TO RETIRE JAN. 15
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Superintendent Ruben Zacarias and the Los Angeles
school board reached an agreement Thursday night that would allow
him to serve as part of a transition team until Jan. 15, when he
will retire with full pay for another 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, approved unanimously by the board, climaxes three
weeks of crisis over leadership of Los Angeles Unified, the
nation's second-largest school district with 710,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this gives the Los Angeles Unified School District
a strong management team inthe immediate future and until the
appointment of a long-term superintendent,'' said board President
Genethia Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   A daylong series of negotiating sessions led the board to back
down on its insistence that Zacarias accept a buyout or be fired by
the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, Zacarias will remain
superintendent and be in charge of educational issues but operate
with the advice of Ramon Cortines, former superintendent of schools
in New York City, San Francisco and Pasadena, where he now lives.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines also will advise Howard Miller who will be in charge of
all the district's departments. Miller was appointed LAUSD's chief
executive officer, a title later changed to chief operating
officer. He will retain the title.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines will take over as interim superintendent when Zacarias
retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an expensive but happy new year,'' a board
member said as negotiations neared a conclusion. The board member
was referring to the cost of buying out Zacarias' contract and
paying the salaries of Miller and Cortines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Zacarias would be entitled to as much as
$277,000 in salary compensation for his contract, which extends to
June 30, 2001, plus $150,000 for accrued vacation. He remains
eligible for an annual pension of nearly $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Victoria Castro, an ardent supporter of Zacarias,
appeared from the private session around 6 p.m., saying the board
wanted to come to a unanimous decision on the matter. Divided 4-3
votes have marked every major decision by the board over the last
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines pulled together the basic outline for the agreement
during the last four days. He proposed the idea to the school board
during a 30-minute conference call Tuesday, but it only gained
momentum after a breakfast meeting with Miller on Thursday, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before going into the closed meeting Thursday afternoon, Hayes
predicted the management crisis would be resolved by the end of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see Mr. Cortines come to this district as
interim superintendent,'' Hayes said. ``Mr. Cortines has never
indicated to me that he is not interested in coming to this
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a plan placed before the board that involves Mr.
Cortines, the superintendent and Mr. Miller, I'm sure the board
will consider that.''
</P>
<P>
   The management crisis began when a majority of the school board
voted Oct. 12 to promote newly hired Miller from facilities czar to
chief executive officer, stripping Zacarias of all direct
authority.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, four board members _ Hayes, Caprice Young, Mike
Lansing and Valerie Fields had concluded that Zacarias had failed
to supervise the district's staff effectively and could not be
relied upon to guide the district through environmental scandals,
including construction of the Belmont Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's most expensive high school _ now estimated to cost
$282million to complete _ sits partially constructed atop an oil
field downtown. It remains unclear if the complex will be completed
because of explosive methane gas pervading the site and other
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   In his new post, Miller was given control over all the
departments, effectively making Zacarias a figurehead. The sudden
managerial shake-up, approved without public comment, was viewed as
a sign of disrespect toward the 33-year veteran educator and his
vocal supporters in the Latino community.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, with the superintendent vowing to fight Miller's
appointment, Hayes said she contacted Cortines. The board president
said she had been ``following his career as a superintendent and
educator for some time'' and met him two years earlier through the
Cross Cities Campaign for Urban Renewal, a national educational
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Hayes and Cortines huddled, the board voted 4-3 to
authorize its attorney to begin negotiations to buy out Zacarias'
contract. About 400 protesters rallied at district headquarters to
support Zacarias, breaking into chants of ``recall'' on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the vote of no confidence on Oct. 28, Zacarias
denied the board's action poisoned his relationship with the
district. He expressed hope that an agreement could be worked out
to allow him to continue to be the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, however, had already handed Cortines' resume out to her
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   From that point Cortines had the support of the board majority
to become interim superintendent and to assist in working out a
deal with Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan called for Cortines and Miller to take the
district through a reform period and create a new chain of command,
while the school board conducted a national search for a long-term
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines began developing the new proposal after meeting with
Zacarias over the weekend. The two men wanted to create a scenario
that would allow Zacarias to retire and calm the backlash against
the school board.

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest that the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Even with electrical power out, the pilots could have continued
flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables rather than
a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system failed, the
hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the engines were
running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

 BRADLEY BEATS GORE IN STATE DONATIONS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley has hit the mother
lode in California campaign contributions, raking in better than
double the campaign dollars of Vice President Al Gore in San
Francisco, and beating Gore's take in most of the state's major
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Bradley _ the former New York Knicks star known
as ``Dollar Bill'' _ has surprised even his campaign organizers in
California, a crucial state that Gore has visited 60 times since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic stronghold of San Francisco, the former New
Jersey senator has collected $1.35 million since the start of the
year, compared to  &LR; with Gore's $568,000, according to a new report
from the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington that is based
on the latest federal campaign records.
</P>
<P>
   In San Jose, Bradley's haul this year was $357,950, compared to
Gore's $206,515, and in Oakland, Bradley took in $207,000, compared
to $175,000 for Gore. Indeed, Bradley topped Gore in eight of nine
major Northern California metropolitan areas. Only in Sacramento
did the vice president rake in more money than his Democratic
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Bradley's strategies was to bring new people into the
process, and he has been highly successful in this area,''
Bradley's state campaign chairman John Roos said Thursday. ``We
tried to get people in different communities and constituencies
involved in helping us raise money, and it was unbelievable. ... He
really tapped into something.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who has championed the cause of campaign finance
reform in his presidential run, has also proved a master at tapping
traditional sources of fund raising, including big donors and
``bundlers'' who gather checks from one source, according to Larry
Makinson of the Center for Responsive Politics, the campaign
finance watchdog organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both he and (Republican U.S. Sen.) John McCain are carrying
swords, and they're double-edged,'' said Makinson. ``They're
running on campaign reform platforms, and they're both using all
the tricks in the book that traditional pols have used for years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the center's analysis of presidential candidates,
Bradley _ like GOP front-runner Gov. George W. Bush and Democratic
front-runner Gore _ has collected about three-quarters of his
campaign funds from people giving the maximum legal donation in a
primary campaign, $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, Gore and Bush ``like to say they're being supported by
thousands of Americans across the country,'' Makinson said. ``They
all know that in fact the big dollars are coming from people who
can write checks for $1,000. ... There's a world of difference
between (those donors) and someone writing a check for $100.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that Bradley _ who rejects contributions from political
action committees _ has been especially adept at raking in
contributions from ``bundlers'' _ organized contributors and
spouses tied to various firms, particularly in the Wall Street or
legal communities.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of Wall Street ``bundler'' donors was the
investment firm of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., whose executives and
families gave $209,500 to Bradley _ more than any other
presidential candidate, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Bradley received $35,250 in bundled contributions from
just 25 donors at Stanford University, where he worked on leave as
a professor; he also picked up $38,000 in contributions from 20
lawyers and family members connected with the Palo Alto law firm
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati.
</P>
<P>
   Such contributions are ``absolutely aboveboard, (but) there's no
difference at all'' between PACs and bundlers, Makinson said.
``It's a way around the limit and a traditional way of raising
money for presidential campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign insists that the checks have come from a
broad sector of professional groups and individuals, some giving
for the first time. ``It's not all fat cats. It's just the
opposite,'' said Roos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can say with certainty is that it's a lot
of contributors who have not given to the political process in past
elections,'' he said. &QL;

 BUSH TAPS CEOS, ECONOMISTS FOR STATE PANEL  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush has named his
steering committee for California _ a group of key business and
political leaders who will monitor Bush's strength and organization
in a state critical to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am honored to have the support of so many respected
California leaders,'' said the Texas governor in a statement
released Thursday. ``I know that to win the California primary, you
must have an outstanding grassroots network of supporters. This is
a critical early primary state, and I intend to work hard to earn
the support of Californians in both the primary and general
election.''
</P>
<P>
   California's early March 7 primary has given the state real
clout in the 2000 presidential elections, and both Democratic and
Republican candidates have indicated their intention to spend time
_ and money _ to get the attention of the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Thursday that he will ignore caucuses in Louisiana,
set for nine days before Iowa's January 24 precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've decided not to participate in any way in the Louisiana
caucus, and will honor the tradition of Iowa as first in the
nation, as well as the tradition of New Hampshire as the first
primary,'' the Republican presidential front-runner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Parsky, who heads Bush's state campaign, said Thursday
that the group named by Bush in California represents ``the most
well-organized grassroots team mobilized by any 2000 primary
campaign in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Northern Californians tapped by Bush for his steering
committee are three Hoover Institution fellows who have advised
him, economists Martin Anderson, Michael Boskin and John Cogan.
Former Stanford University provost Condoleezza Rice (CQ) &LR;   &LR; is one
of the co-chairs of the Bush California campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's group includes former Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary John
Robson; Robert Grady, managing director of BancBoston Robertson
Stevens Inc.; and John Tsu, a regent at John F. Kennedy University.
All are from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech sector are Floyd Kvamme, a leading Silicon
Valley venture capitalist at the Menlo Park firm of Kleiner Perkins
Caulfield and Byers; Erin Walsh, partnership manager at Cisco
Systems in San Jose; Gregory Slayton, president and chief executive
officer of Palo Alto-based ClickAction; and Judith Hamilton, chief
executive officer of Classroom Connect.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Guillermin-Gable of Portola Valley, who heads the
Guillermin Group, a Portola Valley-based firm, and Donna Lucas,
president and chief executive officer of Nelson Communications in
Sacramento, are also part of the Bush team.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP front-runner arrives in California next week for what
his campaign says is ``a major foreign policy speech'' to be
delivered at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley. But he also will
cram three fund-raisers into his short stay: a benefit for the
California Republican Party expected to raise $500,000 to $1
million, and two private fund-raisers for the Bush 2000 campaign.

LAWSUIT WINS REOPENING OF STATE FILES FROM RED- 
 BAITING ERA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ For the first time in nearly 30 years,
Californians can examine files documenting the state's role in
America's obsession in the 1940s and '50s with rooting out
communists and subversives.
<P>
   The files of two legislative committees that probed
``un-American activities'' have been sealed since 1971, but on
Wednesday, a Sacramento judge ordered that some of the material be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our request was a relatively modest one,'' said Terry Francke,
chief lawyer for the California First Amendment Coalition, which
went to court to make the files public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply sought the transcripts of open hearings of the
committees collectively known as the Un-American Activities
committees of the California Legislature from the early 1940s
through the early 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 11,000 pages of materials stored in 80 big
boxes in the state's archives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides transcripts of committee hearings, the boxes also
catalog the committees' meetings and investigations into the
political leanings and personal habits of about 20,000 ``suspect''
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Those investigations include allegations regarding sexual tastes
and couplings of various individuals, notes of recorded
conversations and piles of yellowed newspaper clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Results of those investigations stay sealed _ for now. Only the
transcripts of public hearings will be available.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts were sought by historians to shed light on
California's part in America's communist witch-hunts and
blacklisting, which began a half century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Relief Investigation Committee and the Senate Joint
Fact Finding Committee on Un-American Activities were created in
1939 and disbanded in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Committee investigators compiled note cards on subscribers to
the Daily Worker, members of the Ku Klux Klan, labor unions _ even
the Sons of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the committee mostly hunted Nazi
sympathizers. Committee hearings also led to the internment of
Californians of Japanese descent.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the committee turned its sights on communists in
Hollywood and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, it was anti-war demonstrators and civil rights
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco, refused to open any of the files of the committees
unless ordered to do so by a court.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the files were loaded with hearsay accusations that
would harm innocent people or their families.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's predecessor as the Senate's leader _ Bill Lockyer, now
attorney general _ had said he wanted to allow historians to look
at the records in a way that didn't violate individuals' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, Burton's oldest
political ally, could easily be subjects of the committees'
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Both were vocal opponents of the Vietnam War, staunch supporters
of civil rights and backers of the United Farm Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   Francke said the documents will be available through the state's
archives, which are controlled by the secretary of state's office.

GORE, LAWMAKERS CHALLENGE GOP ON GUN CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seizing upon this week's carnage in Honolulu and
Seattle to shame pro-gun Republicans, Vice President Al Gore and
other Democratic leaders challenged Congress Thursday to pass
modest gun control measures before it adjourns this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more bloody incidents will it take before Congress
acts?'' demanded Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. ``These incidents
will never stop until we do something to stop them. No longer can
we allow the National Rifle Association to dictate the legislative
agenda of this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats called on GOP leaders to revive a set of gun
control measures that passed the Senate in May but have not budged
from a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they have made a good-faith effort to balance
the demands of gun control advocates and gun owners. But with the
horror of the latest killings still fresh in the public mind,
Democrats let it be known Thursday that if they are rebuffed, as
expected, they intend to make the gun issue an important part of
the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the NRA that important to (Republicans) when we have
these horrific instances of gun violence practically every week?''
said Gore, who stood beside Feinstein and other Democratic leaders
just outside the Capitol. ``The time has come to hold them
accountable for not acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this Congress won't act,'' added Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass, ``The American people will elect a Congress that will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a series of modest gun control measures
immediately after the shootings &LR;  at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo. The most controversial measure called for
background checks on consumers at gun shows, similar to those
already required at gun shops. Other provisions included a ban on
imported clips and a requirement that all guns come equipped with
child-safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the measures by a large margin as part of a
comprehensive juvenile justice bill. The House passed a similar
bill for juveniles but did not include the gun provisions. The
House-Senate conference committee, charged with resolving the
differences, has met just once, and Democrats insist that
Republicans have made no effort to advance the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't hide behind the doors of a closed and locked conference
room,'' implored Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``You begin to wonder
why (the Republican leadership) doesn't bring these bills up. You
wonder what planet they're living on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who oppose the legislation _ including several dozen
pro-gun Democrats _ say the restrictions make it more difficult for
law-abiding gun enthusiasts to buy weapons. The solution, they
argue, is to better enforce existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration, as a policy, is putting gun-toting felons
on the streets in record numbers,'' actor Charlton Heston,
president of the National Rifle Association, testified before a
House panel on criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does the president ask for more federal gun laws if he's
not going to enforce the ones we have?'' Heston said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers insist that their Democratic counterparts,
smelling political blood, keep changing their demands with the hope
that nothing will be accomplished and they can exploit the matter
in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in a letter
delivered Thursday to the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, said he stands ``ready to discuss with any
member of either party'' a compromise plan put forward by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, each time that you and I come close to such a
bipartisan solution and you meet with your Democratic leadership,
you would come back to the table with new and novel demands,'' Hyde
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's compromise includes a one-day background check for buyers
at gun shows _ or three days if an initial check turns up any
incriminating evidence. Democrats insist on a full three-day
background check.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also have narrowed the definition of a ``gun show''
to include only events that involve five or more vendors. Democrats
have rejected the language, contending that many gun shows
featuring thousands of guns, but only a handful of vendors, would
be exempted. Already, each side is using the issue for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, mailed out fund-raising
letters last month warning that ``Clinton and the Anti-Gun Lobby
are using the tragedies at Columbine High School and Georgia to
stop you from exercising YOUR RIGHT TO OWN A GUN AND PROTECT YOUR
FAMILY.''
</P>
<P>
   The solicitation says that with a contribution, ``We will be
able to get our message out to thousands of voters in key districts
and states and elect pro-gun members to the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, portraying the legislative gridlock as a pattern in
the GOP Congress, say they have an issue that may help them regain
their majority in the House. They cite a litany of popular
legislative items _ gun control, campaign finance reform,
prescription drugs for seniors, a patients' bill of rights _ that
have failed to pass in the current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate in June to keep
gun legislation alive, plans to highlight the issue in his quest
for the presidency. George W. Bush, the Republican Party's
presidential front-runner, signed a law permitting Texans to carry
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a national issue,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entitled, as a free people, to have laws that protect
the safety of women, children, men and families,'' he added. ``How
many tragedies does it take before the members of the Republican
leadership bottling up this legislation get the message?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Democratic rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
accused Gore Thursday of not going far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been too timid,'' Bradley said while
campaigning in New Hampshire. Bradley has proposed a national
system of registration for all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can register automobiles, we ought to be able to
register handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno also spoke out in favor of gun
control Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get past the point of rhetoric...and come to the
reality -- guns kill,'' Reno told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that people are being killed ``because this nation
has, for too long, not taken a common--sense approach to guns.''

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest that the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Even with electrical power out, the pilots could have continued
flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables rather than
a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system failed, the
hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the engines were
running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

 &HT;    GUATEMALA'S 'LA ANTIGUA' AN INTRIGUING BLEND OF OLD WORLD, NEW

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ Diminutive Mayan women with faces that
could grace the cover of National Geographic mill around the
tree-shaded central park, balancing huge baskets filled with
hand-woven fabrics on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   A block away in a cyber cafe, German students hop on the
Internet and flash electronic messages across five time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Along a cobblestone street before the facade of a 400-year-old
church, vendors peddle ``comida tipica'' _ Guatemalan fare of
beans, tortillas and fried platanos _ while nearby a craftsman
spreads his wooden wares on the sidewalk and blows a tune on a
hand-carved flute.
</P>
<P>
   His notes drift toward a nearby bistro, where jazz hums from
hidden speakers as tourists banter in a half-dozen languages, some
smoking fat Cuban cigars and sipping espressos.
</P>
<P>
   Part charming colonial showcase, part slow-paced Guatemalan
mountain town, part hot spot for the international backpacker
crowd, Antigua offers a comfortable, intriguing introduction to the
Central American back country.
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour from the teeming capital of Guatemala City, Antigua
_ the formal name is ``La Antigua Guatemala'' or ``The Old
Guatemala'' _ is worlds away in terms of its architectural beauty,
the quaint feel of its narrow, cobblestone streets and its
easy-going pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   But far from a frontier outpost, you can still sleep in a
five-star hotel _ if you choose _ and find a nightlife of some
sophistication, with fine restaurants, a jazz club or two and
infinitely interesting conversation from the wide array of
travelers attracted to the place.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can go the backpacker's route: sign up for classes at one
of the 50 or more Spanish language schools and live with a
Guatemalan family, paying only $60 a week for room and meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I expected,'' said British barrister Richard
Gee, 30, who, taking a year off from his wig and gown, landed in
Antigua recently after six months of traipsing through Asia and
other far-flung parts. ``I expected a backwater, but it's really
quite convenient. I have friends in England who would never dream
of roughing it, and they'd be quite comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the local accommodations were good enough for the
White House: President Clinton spent a night in Antigua last spring
during a tour of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The town dates back to the 1540s, and is nestled amidst three
forested volcanic peaks at a cool 5,000 feet above sea level.
Spanish rulers once issued decrees from the stately Palacio de los
Capitanes (Palace of the Captains), which for more than 200 years
served as the provincial capital of a region encompassing
modern-day Nicaragua, Honduras Guatemala and the southern Mexican
state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   But Antigua's bane through history has been the occasional
violent earthquakes that have rumbled through the mountains and
destroyed parts of the city. After a particularly vicious quake in
1773, Spanish governors moved the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua lived on, thanks to its scenic beauty and the love of
its residents. In 1944, the national government declared the entire
city a national monument, leading to the preservation of its
architecture and strict limits on new building.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the United Nations declared Antigua a World Heritage
site.
</P>
<P>
   Some guidebooks list the city as one of the most beautiful in
all of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is now the main industry, and travelers from around the
globe can be spotted almost daily bartering with the Mayan vendors
in the central park or snapping photos of historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But along with sightseers, the town has become something of a
magnet for students of the Spanish language. The first schools were
set up more than 20 years ago, and have become extremely popular _
probably due to the gorgeous surroundings and the rock-bottom
prices.
</P>
<P>
   A week of one-to-one instruction, seven hours per day, costs
from $100 to $150, far cheaper than comparable schools in other
Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best reputation in all of Central America,''
said Jeanne Guthrie, an American who now lives in Costa Rica but
who came to Antigua to learn Spanish. ``I went to a school in Costa
Rica and the instruction here is 100 times better. All we did there
was play.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools tailor their instruction to the individual students'
level. Many people come for weeks or even months at a time,
spending their days laboring through classes, their nights
bar-hopping through the bistros and internet cafes and their
weekends traveling through the rest of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlife is far from wild, but agreeable. Fine restaurants
_ many run by foreigners _ offer everything from Italian to Thai
and French food, while several American-style pubs offer beer,
burgers and American sports on satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   A popular spot is the Cafe Condesa, just off the central park,
which is housed in a 400-year-old home. Legend has it that the
Spanish count who once lived there returned from a journey, found
his wife in an amorous repose with the butler, and promptly killed
the servant. The body was buried in one of the home's
two-foot-thick walls, the story goes _ and the bones were
supposedly uncovered by a 1976 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less historic bars offer entertainment in the form of
videos shown nightly in small rooms packed with overstuffed couches
and chairs. The movies are mostly in English with Spanish
subtitles, which helps students hone their Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, there is a colonial art museum, several
impressive churches and a convent that has been transformed into a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous, there is horseback riding, bicycling,
hiking in the surrounding mountains, golf and whitewater rafting.
Hiking is a bit risky, however, as bandits have been known to hold
up tourists venturing up the nearby volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will find plenty of Mayan handicrafts, jade, silver,
native artwork and other handicrafts. Barter with vendors on the
street, or step into gift shops that range from the kitschy to the
refined.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a Latin American veteran or a first-time
traveler, Antigua is simply too beautiful to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a film set, really,'' said Gee, the Brit on extended
holiday. ``It's an interior designer's dream. Around every corner
you've got these great colors, and you're surrounded by these
volcanoes in every direction. It's really quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   La Antigua, Guatemala or ``The Old Guatemala'' is aptly named,
as guidebooks say the quaint streets, well-preserved colonial
architecture and spectacular views of three surrounding volcanoes
make it one of the most beautiful cities in all of Latin America.
Known also for its Spanish-language schools, Antigua is the perfect
starting point for a Latin American vacation, or a pleasant,
inexpensive place to spend a few weeks or even months learning how
to speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Guatemala City, the nation's capital, is served
by American, Continental and Delta, along with TACA and several
other Latin American air carriers, with non-stops from several
major American cities including Miami, Atlanta and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DOCUMENTS: American residents need only a passport. No visa is
required for tourist stays of less than 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND:
</P>
<P>
   Rental cars _ If you plan to tour the entire country, a rental
car is probably the best way to go, although they are expensive,
from US$60 to US$90 per day. You must also be careful as cars are
targets for thieves _ best to stay only at hotels with secured
parking, and be sure to purchase collision/damage waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttles _ If you plan to limit your visit to Antigua, you can
take a shuttle from the Guatemala City airport to Antigua, a trip
of about one hour that should cost from US$15 to US$30. For
information, call the Guatemalan Tourist Commission at
502-331-1333. Once in Antigua, you don't really need a car, as the
historical part of the city is pleasant and small enough for
walking.
</P>
<P>
   Buses _ Taking a public bus on an excursion in Antigua can be an
adventure all on its own. The buses are incredibly cheap _ as
little as US$2 for a several-hour trip _ and are filled with
residents packing children, market produce, luggage and practically
anything else you can imagine. Ask locals where to find the buses _
most leave from a large open lot west of the market. Be prepared to
stand if the bus is crowded and don't take lots of luggage or
valuables _ tourists can be targets for pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE: Antigua is located at about 5,000 feet above sea
level. Rainy months are late summer to early fall. A sweater is
probably a good idea, but a must in winter as nighttime
temperatures can drop into the 40s. Days are generally pleasant
year-round, with highs rarely going above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ACCOMMODATIONS: You can stay cheap or expensive. Budget hotels
range from as little as US$5 a night for a shared bathroom to US$15
for rooms with private bathrooms. In the mid-price range, expect to
pay US$30 to US$50 a night, while luxury hotels go for US$75 to
US$125 per night. If you enroll in a language school, they can
arrange a stay with a family, with meals and room going for about
US$60 a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RESTAURANTS: The selection varies widely, from very
inexpensive local spots serving Guatemalan fare of beans, chicken
and rice for US$3 to US$4 to fine dining establishments with
American and European cuisine. Favorites with tourists include the
Rainbow Reading Room and Cafe, a bookstore offering vegetarian
dishes; Cafe Condesa with its opulent courtyard and 400-year-old
building; Cafe Flor for Thai food; Fridas Mexican Restaurant and
Bar and El Sereno, a fine-dining establishment offering
international dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SIGHTSEEING: Highlights include the Catedral de Santiago off
the central park, built in 1542 and only partially rebuilt after
devastating earthquakes in 1780 and 1820. Also facing the park is
the Palacio de los Capitanes, which housed the Spanish capital for
200 years when Antigua was the administrative center for a
territory that stretched from Southern Mexico to Nicaragua. On the
north side of the park is the Palacio del Ayuntamiento, the town
hall, which includes a museum of colonial artifacts. The city's
most striking church is La Merced, located three blocks from the
park, which was built in 1548 and rebuilt after numerous
earthquakes. It features a huge fountain said to be one of the
largest in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SPANISH SCHOOLS: Antigua boasts more than 50, which offer a
week of one-on-one instruction, up to seven hours per day, for $100
to $150. For a list of schools, call the Guatemalan Tourist
Commission 502-331-1333 or check a website at:
www.conexion.com/schools.htm
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EXCURSIONS: One-day tours to places like Lake Atitlan can be
arranged through travel agencies. Tours to Mayan ruins at Copan or
Tikal are also available, as are mountain-biking, whitewater
rafting trips and horseback riding. Among the tour companies are
Adventure Travel Center at 502-832-0162 in Antigua and Maya
Expeditions in Guatemala City at 502-363-4955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PRECAUTIONS: It's safest to drink only bottled water and not
to eat food prepared by street vendors. Avoid peeled, uncooked
fruit or vegetables. Be careful with rented cars, parking only in
secured areas, and walk at night only in groups. Bandits have been
known to rob tourists hiking on the volcanoes surrounding Antigua,
so it's probably best to enjoy the view from town.

   LONDON _ So you suspect your spouse may be having an affair.
These days, you can employ a world of high-tech devices to help you
catch an errant husband or wife: zoom cameras, auto-tracking
apparatus, even spray-on sperm detectors.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the ones doing the misbehaving. Where can this
often-discounted segment of the population seek their much-needed
support? At the Alibi Agency.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, the popular British agency will provide
credible cover stories for almost every adulterous moment. The fee:
a mere US$25-US$75, depending on the tailor-made fib.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to meet a lover for the weekend, but don't want
your mate to know. You could hire the Alibi Agency to mail you a
phony invitation to a seminar or sporting event, providing you with
a ``legitimate'' excuse for going away.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptions don't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will make purchases on your behalf so that the items
can't be traced back to you via one of those pesky receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It will even loan you a noiseless pager so that you can be
discreetly contacted without the little woman _ or man _ knowing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone agrees with this blatant assault on
marital fidelity. Encouraging one to cheat on one's spouse _ no
matter how sophisticated the deception, or noble the goal _ is not
going to get you past society's moral gatekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling remorse about making money out of helping
spouses cover their deceits, however, the brains behind this
business say they are proud to be ``helping keep couples
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually trying to preserve the family, to protect loved
ones from the stress that comes from suspecting your spouse is
cheating,'' said Ronnie Brock, who founded the company nearly 10
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the agency's advertisement on the Internet reads: ``Our aim
is total peace of mind for you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock also points out that about US$1.50 from each US$30 annual
membership goes to charities helping children from broken homes.
</P>
<P>
   Annual membership allows what Brock calls ``secure telephone
access to our operators.'' Beyond that, it costs US$25 a time for
the agency to call a spouse with a bogus business appointment and
US$40 for it to make up a phony invitation letter or card and mail
it to a client.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptions can cost more, of course, depending on how elaborate
you want them to be. Say you want to have a fling in Wales. While
you're away, one of the agency's receptionists will answer calls
from your spouse _ in a Welsh accent. They will answer in a
pre-arranged manner, i.e. trade fair, golf tournament, etc. They
will even allow your spouse to hear them as they pretend to try and
ring your room or page you.
</P>
<P>
   Brock operates the Alibi Agency from Blackpool _ a picturesque
resort town in Northern England's Lake District, about a four
hours' drive from London _ along with Joe and Dawn Taylor. Although
Brock's not married, the Taylors have been married 15 years. They
say neither is interested in having an affair. The idea for the
agency grew out of the trio's experiences on the road managing
British rock musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people would want to fool around a bit and we
would have to make excuses for them, so eventually we figured it
would be a great idea for a business,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been.
</P>
<P>
   In just over nine months of operation, the agency has received
more than 10,000 customer inquiries, a third of them from women.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brock plans to open franchises in Argentina and the United
States by the end of the year, and franchises in other countries _
including Australia, Denmark and Mexico _ by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the unique business has spawned at least one copycat in
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   John Watson, of Inverness, Scotland, started the Ace Alibi
Agency about four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has more than 1,200 members, 40 percent of whom are
women. Most members are from Europe, although 26 members live in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's mailed many of the American members invitations to
nonexistent conferences in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't believe a family should be destroyed over two
or three nights of madness,'' said Watson, who is married. ``If
someone uses this service, then that person obviously wants to
preserve their family.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is thrilled that businesses built on deceptions
are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders, for example, have spoken out against this type
of business, which they say condones lying for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Says an outraged Rev. Michael Manley of St. John's Church in
Blackpool: ``I can't believe this type of business is allowed to
exist. I didn't think it could be legal because obviously this
service is open to anybody so how do you know people are just
cheating on their wives, which is bad enough? They could be
cheating on their companies, anything in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brock and Watson reason that hanky-panky will happen in
today's society no matter what, and that their agencies are there
to help preserve the sanity of the poor, unknowing spouses waiting
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people these days who have a short-term
fling, or dalliance, and there's no sense in breaking up a
long-term relationship over it,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics vary on the number of people who have affairs, but a
survey conducted last year showed that British men and women are
the most adulterous in Europe _ although Americans topped the
overall list.
</P>
<P>
   The study of more than 10,000 sexually active adults in 14
countries found that 42 percent of Britons, compared to 22 percent
of Spaniards, 36 percent of French and 38 percent of Italians,
admitted to having more than one relationship at a time. But the
Global Sex Survey, conducted for Durex, the condom manufacturer,
said that half of the Americans questions said they had been
unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you get too depressed over the prevalence of
cheating, those who have been cheated on do have a new weapon of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a gel called Infidelity Detection Cream is selling
faster than sushi. Japanese women surreptitiously rub the gel into
their husbands' backs before they leave home in the morning. If the
men shower during the day _ a sure sign of a fling _ the chemical
reacts with water to form big blisters.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for revenge?

   WASHINGTON _ When the Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, it
pulled down with it the
</P>
<P>
   center of strategic gravity that had aligned the world's nations
and their people throughout half a century of Cold War.

   The collapse of the old Soviet Union has sparked dizzying change

humanitarian crises and weaving together alliances among former
foes.
</P>
<P>
   And the world, overall, is a very different place from the one
that was divided east and west along lines once symbolized by the
Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all of the gains, real or perceived, of the past
decade, the forging of a new world order to replace the old remains
very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   For if the end of the Cold War created new opportunities for the
United States, it also presented the country with four
interconnected imperatives, the resolution of which, now far from
complete, will largely determine the shape of the world well into
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those areas _ managing the collapse of the Soviet
Union; reckoning with China's rise as an important world power;
reducing the threat of nuclear war; and building a global
marketplace _ progress has been limited and even threatens to
stall.
</P>
<P>
   Largely missing amid the celebration, self-congratulation and
talk of boundless potential that has come to characterize the age,
the world has arrived at a potentially dangerous moment, and the
path forward from here is anything but clear.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to fault President Clinton, as indeed many have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his administration are great underachievers,'' said
Richard Haas, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. `` He has been president at a
time of unprecedented American primacy and we simply don't have
much to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that there are real limits to what the
United States can accomplish, despite its over-arching political,
economic and military dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this view that the indispensable nation can affect
outcomes at every place around the world. We can't,'' said Anthony
Blinken, director for European Affairs on the White House National
Security Council. ``All we can do is bring these unique resources
to bear in the smartest way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the crumbling of the Berlin Wall signaled the beginning of
the end for the Soviet Union, the finale followed just two years
later, when Moscow dissolved its far flung empire.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. challenge was to try to help cushion the collapse of
the Soviet empire, in hopes of preventing anarchy, chaos and the
potential for war, all of which have since been visited upon the
Russian motherland in its peril-fraught journey from a communist
state toward a free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rocky, messy, suspenseful, even dangerous
process,'' President Clinton's Russia point man, Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott, said several weeks ago in a speech at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Russia is that it remains, nominally at least,
under the control of its democratically elected president, Boris
Yeltsin. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December. And
next June, if all goes as planned, Russians will go to the polls to
pick Yeltsin's successor in the first democratic transfer of power
in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, though, possessor of more nuclear weapons than any other
nation on Earth, remains a deeply troubled state.
</P>
<P>
   It is listing through its fourth government in 18 months _
Yeltsin having sacked three others. Corruption, organized crime and
indebtedness have all but crippled Moscow's ability to provide the
services expected of a modern state. Soldiers and scientists alike
go unpaid, pensioners and entrepreneurs conspire to convert rubles
to deutsche marks, dollars or pounds, while tens of billions of
dollars in foreign aid and investment are believed to have been
siphoned off and spirited to banks and villas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Russia is engaged in a civil war with
seccessionists in the republic of Chechnya, a conflict that has
clouded and threatens to disrupt relations between Clinton and
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   While critics, indeed, blame Clinton for vesting excessive faith
in one man's vision of democratic reform _ Yeltsin's _ others plead
for patience and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, keep your fingers crossed, Russia remains on the
democratic track,'' said Georgetown University professor of
government Thane Gustafson, author of the new book, ``Capitalism
Russian-Style.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. policy can influence and support Russia's painful
economic, political and social transition, he said, ultimately the
outcome is beyond outsiders' control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is a drama in Russian,'' said
Gustafson. ``It's a Russian passion play on a Russian stage with
Russian actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. efforts to reduce the global nuclear threat bore
fruit early on, only to stumble badly over the past 18 months and
cause the global non-proliferation regime has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to persuade India and Pakistan from testing a
series of nuclear weapons in a tit-or-tat display of atomic
ambitions in 1998. He was unable to prevent the
Republican-controlled Senate from spiking the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, which would have prohibited such tests among 154
signatory states, last month. And he's been helpless against the
Russian Duma's refusal to ratify START II _ a treaty negotiated by
former President Bush and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996,
which calls for massive U.S. and Russian reductions in
nuclear-armed missiles.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen nations believed to have nuclear capability, a
dozen other rogue states or well-organized terrorist groups seeking
to acquire them, and up to 70 other countries with the nuclear
expertise and equipment to build such weapons on short notice, the
threat of a nuclear attack has been anything but diminished since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would characterize it as a decade of unraveling,'' said
Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a
nonpartisan research group that advocates nuclear non
proliferation. ``I don't know too many people who I work with in
this field who think that we're any safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it's hard to point to concrete progress in relations
between the United States and China, the most populous nation on
Earth. With one-fifth of the world's people under its charge, China
is poised to assume a growing role as a regional and global
economic and military power over the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited poor relations with Beijing, taking office
less than four years after the brutal killings near Tiananmen
Square soured China's ties with most of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the complexity and contradictions of China have made it
difficult for Clinton to find openings for meaningful detente.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
June, Sino-American ties plunged to their lowest level since the
Tiananmen killings in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country is more suspicious of the other today than it was
seven years ago,'' said Haas. As a result, he said, ``China has not
been effectively integrated into the world and there's growing
opposition in both countries, in the United States and China, to an
amicable relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to China's entry into the company of global powers is
its growing economic might. With a total stock market
capitalization of roughly $250 billion and exports this year
approaching $200 billion, China continues to sit on the sidelines
of the formal club of trading nations, the World Trade
Organization, or WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton balked at a deal last spring that would have accorded
China WTO membership in exchange for a host of concessions on
Beijing's part - tariff reductions, investment protections and the
like. Now, against long political odds in this country and in
China, Clinton is trying to patch together a deal that would allow
China entry in time for a new round of WTO talks set to begin in
Seattle late this month.
</P>
<P>
   China's absence from the WTO is but one shortcoming in a
longer-term plan Clinton had once hoped would result in a collapse
in global trade barriers mirroring the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Free-market economies have blossomed around the world, from
Latin America and Central Europe to Africa and Eastern Asia, since
the Cold War's end. Hundreds of millions of people have profited:
an estimated 1.5 billion now live in countries where a family of
four enjoys an average annual income of $20,000 a more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's pleas for a free trade zone taking in the
entire Western Hemisphere have been thwarted by his fellow
Democrats, in the face of opposition from organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some controlled integration of China into the world market
economy and its institutions is very important,'' said Robert
Hormats, of the New York investment firm Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard to have a stable and prosperous
system,'' said Hormats, ``if China is not brought into it over the
course of the next few years.''

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal
following, Major Jan Zeman is back on duty 10 years after the end
of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the country's economy faltering and the reform
government tainted by allegations of corruption, the opposition
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia enjoys the support of 20
percent of the population, according to recent polls. It marks a
high point in public support for the communists since the regime
fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vow that if they came to power they would shift
the Czech Republic from its current capitalist course back to
socialism and seek to annul the country's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, granted earlier this year along
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Zeman could hasten their return, by making
communism seem cool, say critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population today could be influenced by this series. Those
who see the problems of today's society may think it was a better
time when they view this propaganda,'' said Jaroslav Runt, 77, a
deputy chairman of the former political prisoners confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The country's best-known former political prisoner, President
Vaclav Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails,
dismissed the series as ``not the first nor the last idiocy aired
by Czech Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is as melodramatic and dated as an episode of Mannix.
Many viewers, it seems, are drawn to the show out of nostalgia for
their youth, not the politics of the time. Tuning in each week to
see Zeman's latest exploits is merely a walk down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Zeman is kind of like putting on an old pair of boots
you've dug out of the closet,'' said Vera Kamenicka, 58, of Prague.
``They are kind of comfortable, but out of fashion.''

NOT COMING BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On a recent afternoon, Lothar Weinberg celebrated with
a sip of champagne the conclusion of his philosophical journey from
Karl Marx to Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, 52, has a salesman's eye contact, smile and handshake
_ the markings of a man destined to win friends and influence
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with a few friends over hors d'oeuvres and drinks in a
sparsely furnished suburban office, Weinberg toasted the beginning
of a new and perhaps more perilous adventure _ running a business
in a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going at it full-bore, throwing himself into
capitalism's wildest and woolliest milieu: private consulting. He
and his partner hope their new business, Know How Inc., will make
them rich, an objective as distant as Mars just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall was famously breached 10 years ago Tuesday,
Weinberg was fastened securely in East Germany's Communist
structure. He was an electrical engineer facing a future with
little risk or reward.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the millennium, life for Weinberg _ as well as
his former East German countrymen _ is now full of both.
</P>
<P>
   For Weinberg, who felt the fires of ambition as a young man, the
changes that came in that momentous autumn of 1989 couldn't have
come soon enough. He regrets the years stifled in the old system.
``For me, the wall came down too late,'' he said during a break
from entertaining well-wishers. ``But my children. They will know
well what it means to have freedom and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Burkhard Rauschart sat on a wooden bench in an
open plaza sharing beer and cynicism with friends. Rauschart's eyes
were bloodshot and full of suspicion. He clinched an unlit
cigarette between his fingers as he listened to a stranger's
questions about life after The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall,'' he said ``I wish they would build it back _ and 10
meters higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The park bench chorus confirmed this sentiment with grumbling
obscenities. It's been a hard 10 years. Within a few months of the
dawn of freedom, he got a divorce and lost his job as a train
security inspector.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Rauschart, the benefits of freedom seem
abstract, while the tribulations of capitalism are real.
``Freedom?'' he said with a caustic laugh. ``Freedom. Who can
afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, people often say that tearing down the
brick-and-mortar Berlin Wall was easy compared to removing the
barriers that remain in the minds of Ossies and Wessies _
Easterners and Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ostalgia'' _ a sense of longing for the good old days _
expressed by Rauschart is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey indicated that some 13 percent of the population
would like to see the East and West divided again. The numbers were
nearly the same for both easterners and westerners surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent believed that Germans are now ``one
people,'' the poll said. Most _ 57 percent _ said another decade
would be needed to unite Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise is deeper among Ossies _ people from the former East
Germany. Easterners say that they are paid less than their Wessi
counterparts and are treated as second-class citizens. ``They think
we're lazy and stupid,'' said Manfred Schneider, a 70-year-old
former East German army officer who now earns about $4 an hour as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ossies express a gnawing anxiety over losing the
cradle-to-grave security that they enjoyed in the past even if they
lacked privacy and personal freedom. In a September survey, only 38
percent of east Germans said they were satisfied with democracy
compared to 60 percent in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent in the east favored continuing the free-market
economy. Most surprisingly, 51 percent of the Ossies said they were
happier in the communist German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschart, for one, said his life is far more difficult now. He
lives on $600 a month in government welfare. After paying the rent
on a subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the poor Hohenschoenhausen
district, Rauschart is left with about $250 for groceries and other
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough,'' he says bitterly. ``Lamb cutlets cost four
times more than they did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have found political resonance. The Communists _
reborn as the Party of Democratic Socialism, or PDS _ are now
Germany's No. 2 political party behind Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats. And in a potentially more worrisome
trend, the far-right German's Peoples Union won seats in two
eastern state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   The PDS positions itself as a hip alternative to the capitalists
of the West that stresses social justice issues and a respect for
the old ways of the East. The party is by far the biggest in
eastern Germany with nearly 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moderate East Germans express feelings of uneasiness
about unification, particularly the way their former identities
seem to have been lost in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they feel like a conquered colony. ``I wouldn't
describe it as a unification as much as I would call it a
swallowing,'' said Christoph Links, a former East German journalist
who is running a successful publishing house in East Berlin. ``We
had all the systems and structures of West Germany imposed on us
with all the problems that were already there. It's as if our whole
biographies are not accepted _ we spent our lives in a wrong system
so our lives before unification don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This nostalgia is puzzling to many, including former East German
politburo member Guenter Schabowski, the former communist official
who announced the end of travel restrictions on Nov. 8, 1989. In
his view, this decision brought an end to the wall's practical
relevance. ``At that moment, the wall became only a metaphor,''
Schabowski said during a discussion over plates of fancy Italian
food not far from the former location of Checkpoint Charlie, the
gate from East Berlin to the city's American Sector.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski, now 70, is awaiting sentencing for his role in the
shooting deaths of people trying to flee the East over the wall. He
denies that he had a direct part in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He has little patience for all this ``Ostalgia.'' ``They are
concerned about the loss of the socialist institutions and the high
rates of unemployment, and I don't reproach them for that,'' he
said. ``But it was an illusion. You see, the failure of the GDR was
this: These positive traits weren't positive because we had no way
to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And people are selective about what they remember, he said.
``They say things were cheaper then, but they seem to forget that
they couldn't find anything to buy,'' he said. ``What has happened
in 10 years is enormous. If you don't see that, then you have
something else in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ossies aren't alone in their concerns. In the West, there
are fears that the once economic powerhouse has squandered its
wealth trying to prop up the East, which was an economic ruin in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has spent more than $600 billion in the
former East Germany, which to the annoyance of many in the West is
benefiting tremendously from the new infrastructure. It is
generally accepted that the phone system in the East is now much
more advanced than the older one in the West.
</P>
<P>
   West Germans often grumble about paying the 7.5 percent levy
known as a ``Solidarity Tax'' on their incomes to help the East.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Ossies feel the Wessies haven't been given any
credit for what they contribute. ``I wouldn't say. 'We pay the
solidarity tax, too,''' said Tom Sello, a former opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sello expressed a common sentiment . . . ``I'm personally better
off now, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining, Berlin is for most people today a
better place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Brauer, a Wessie who owns a yachting school with an Ossie
partner, said only a fool would want to return Berlin to being
isolated island in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no going back, and there shouldn't be, `` Brauer
said. ``The two parts of the city have to grow together and in time
become just one city.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to trace the wall on the landscape these days. The
city center, which was left to atrophy during the Cold War, is now
booming, in part because of the return earlier this year of the
national government for the first time since Hitler was in power.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to push the city into the future sometimes has paid
little attention to its past. Construction workers last month
uncovered part of the bunker where Hitler spent his last hours
before committing suicide. City officials wasted no time in
deciding to continue with plans to build a new road over the
bunker, paving it back to its inglorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1989, Michael Roesler's city map showed West Berlin as an
undefined white blot. Today he and his wife Kristina live in an
apartment in the white blot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the wall came down, they were forced to leave their
apartment in the east after the owner reclaimed the building and
began to remodel it. Their new apartment is spacious by European
standards and has a view of a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, the Roeslers looked through the pages of
the scrapbook they've made to recount their new lives. Their
greatest satisfaction seems to come from having been able to see
much of the world for themselves _ a nearly unheard of joy in the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   At first, they traveled with a keen sense of urgency _ as if the
wall would suddenly close again. They learned _ to their quiet
satisfaction _ that the West isn't quite up to their old fantasies.
``We've seen Vienna and it was fine, but it is no better than
Budapest,'' said Kristina. ``We see that not everything is perfect
in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   As their retirement years approach, they worry about their
financial security _ an unheard of burden in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they have managed well in this strange new system. ``We're
really benefiting from these capitalistic means of making money,''
joked Michael Roesler, who has switched jobs twice sense
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't say that the old days were better, but they also
wouldn't argue that they had nothing to commend them either.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roeslers are optimistic about the future. They plan to
visit Toronto to see old friends _ once a bold dream that is now
just a pleasant expectation.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hurry because the wall is gone forever.

 &HT;    STUDENT PLAY BECOMES UNLIKELY BATTLEGROUND IN IRAN'S POWER
STRUGGLE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Nov. 6 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ College student Ali Abbas Nemati pleaded his
defense through his tears.
</P>
<P>
   Before him, as jury, judge and prosecutor, was Saeed Mortazavi,
known for closing newspapers and jailing editors. Behind Nemati was
a row of turbaned clerics.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of student supporters sat on metal chairs in the back of
the courtroom, a drab, closed-in space similar to a large
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time in my life that I wished I was dead was when I
heard about the charges against me,'' said the slender student, his
voice cracking, during his trial last month.
</P>
<P>
   He had not committed murder or treason. He was a playwright,
charged with insulting the 12th Imam, a messianic figure in Shiite
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   This week(Nov. 2), Mortazavi made his decision. He sentenced
Nemati and another student to three years in jail. The judge's
ruling is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case shows that Iran's religious establishment, bent on
maintaining its influence, will flex its muscle against artists
just as it has many times against rival editors and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Nemati's play had become the object of the battle between
Iranians who cling to strict fundamentalist Shiite rule and those
seeking a transition to a civil democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor guy was a victim of the big political struggle,''
said Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati.
</P>
<P>
   The play, ``Final Exam: Trying to Emerge,'' was controversial
for its treatment of the Imam Mohammad(CQ), called the ``Mahdi,''
or ``One lead by God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Imam vanished in the ninth century and Shiite Muslims
believe he will return someday, ushering in justice and true Islam.
They pray for his ``emergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever his name is mentioned in public, crowds are obligated
to shout praises to Allah. Nemati's trial was punctuated by such
chants at the frequent mention of the Imam's name.
</P>
<P>
   Nemati's play appears to satire those who call for the Imam with
insincerity. His central character, Abbas, prays for the Imam's
emergence. When the Imam arrives and tells Abbas to perform a task,
Abbas refuses, saying he has an important exam.
</P>
<P>
   The play was never performed and was only printed in a student
magazine circulated to 150 people. But, a conservative newspaper
highlighted it. Inflamed by Nemati's use of colloquial, rather than
formal language in discussing the Imam, religious leaders called
for his punishment. One police official said he would personally
execute Nemati, who is in his early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, however, said the play was
being used by those trying to undermine his attempts at reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as though a certain group wants to create a haze
across the country with particular ambitions,'' Khatami said, in
the veiled references typical of Iranian political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Though Khatami is not as powerful as conservative, religious
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, writers during his two years
in office have seen growing freedom. The writers' association has
been able to meet more freely and assert freedoms of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some even consider it a sign of progress that Nemati's play was
handled in court, rather than through street violence or
imprisonment without trial.
</P>
<P>
   There have been harsh setbacks and major victories. Four writers
have been killed in the last year and a half. But, when security
agents were linked to the killings, the scandal lead to the
resignation of the country's intelligence chief and replacement by
a Khatami ally.
</P>
<P>
   Simin Behbahani, a leading Iranian poet and a member of the
writers' association, has been a target of the conservatives. She
says that, despite the growing freedom, the rules for writers are
still hard to define.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of power in Iran is too vast and broad. You never
know who will approve and who will not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the play,'' she said after the sentencing last week.
``It was so simple and childish that I think the Imam himself would
regard it as a weak satire, a piece arisen from devotion and
seeking affection and love.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, religious topics are sensitive anywhere. Here, in the
Islamic Republic of Iran, any perceived challenge to Islam can also
be seen as a challenge to the revolutionary government that is
based on the religion.
</P>
<P>
   Mojtaba Kheyrollah, a 37-year-old Iranian leaving prayer
services on a recent Friday, said the play was an insult to the
sacrifices Iranians have made for their country and religion. ``If
it happened on a daily basis,'' he said. ``We could no longer call
this the Islamic Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemati unknowingly crossed the line. A member of a religious
family and graduate of a religious high school, he told Judge
Mortazavi that he meant to honor the 12th Imam.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth can I insult the 12th Imam when I deeply believe
in him?'' Nemati asked as his anxiety grew. ``My message was that
if you are really honest in calling him, then you will change your
way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortazavi, a stout man in a blazer and slacks, is jovial and
good-humored outside the court. But, with Nemati, he was on the
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have ridiculed the 12th Imam and those who have invested
their lives in the revolution,'' he said, referring to the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the court were women in black veils holding
pictures of sons who died in the Iran-Iraq war. The mothers were
the official plaintiffs in the case, claiming the play insulted the
ideals of their martyred sons.
</P>
<P>
   Masoud Riahi, lawyer for Nemati and three others charged in the
case, said the play was written out of devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is reading the play without pre-judgments,'' he
said, ``he would understand that the writer is trying to show the
thoughts of one who is not a true believer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in today's Iran, the question of who is a ``true believer''
is the subject of punishing debate.

 &HT;    GUATEMALA'S 'LA ANTIGUA' AN INTRIGUING BLEND OF OLD WORLD, NEW
AGE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: If-you-go box attached at end of story.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (t) Travel categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ Diminutive Mayan women with faces that
could grace the cover of National Geographic mill around the
tree-shaded central park, balancing huge baskets filled with
hand-woven fabrics on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   A block away in a cyber cafe, German students hop on the
Internet and flash electronic messages across five time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Along a cobblestone street before the facade of a 400-year-old
church, vendors peddle ``comida tipica'' _ Guatemalan fare of
beans, tortillas and fried platanos _ while nearby a craftsman
spreads his wooden wares on the sidewalk and blows a tune on a
hand-carved flute.
</P>
<P>
   His notes drift toward a nearby bistro, where jazz hums from
hidden speakers as tourists banter in a half-dozen languages, some
smoking fat Cuban cigars and sipping espressos.
</P>
<P>
   Part charming colonial showcase, part slow-paced Guatemalan
mountain town, part hot spot for the international backpacker
crowd, Antigua offers a comfortable, intriguing introduction to the
Central American back country.
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour from the teeming capital of Guatemala City, Antigua
_ the formal name is ``La Antigua Guatemala'' or ``The Old
Guatemala'' _ is worlds away in terms of its architectural beauty,
the quaint feel of its narrow, cobblestone streets and its
easy-going pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   But far from a frontier outpost, you can still sleep in a
five-star hotel _ if you choose _ and find a nightlife of some
sophistication, with fine restaurants, a jazz club or two and
infinitely interesting conversation from the wide array of
travelers attracted to the place.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can go the backpacker's route: sign up for classes at one
of the 50 or more Spanish language schools and live with a
Guatemalan family, paying only $60 a week for room and meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I expected,'' said British barrister Richard
Gee, 30, who, taking a year off from his wig and gown, landed in
Antigua recently after six months of traipsing through Asia and
other far-flung parts. ``I expected a backwater, but it's really
quite convenient. I have friends in England who would never dream
of roughing it, and they'd be quite comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the local accommodations were good enough for the
White House: President Clinton spent a night in Antigua last spring
during a tour of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The town dates back to the 1540s, and is nestled amidst three
forested volcanic peaks at a cool 5,000 feet above sea level.
Spanish rulers once issued decrees from the stately Palacio de los
Capitanes (Palace of the Captains), which for more than 200 years
served as the provincial capital of a region encompassing
modern-day Nicaragua, Honduras Guatemala and the southern Mexican
state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   But Antigua's bane through history has been the occasional
violent earthquakes that have rumbled through the mountains and
destroyed parts of the city. After a particularly vicious quake in
1773, Spanish governors moved the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua lived on, thanks to its scenic beauty and the love of
its residents. In 1944, the national government declared the entire
city a national monument, leading to the preservation of its
architecture and strict limits on new building.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the United Nations declared Antigua a World Heritage
site.
</P>
<P>
   Some guidebooks list the city as one of the most beautiful in
all of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is now the main industry, and travelers from around the
globe can be spotted almost daily bartering with the Mayan vendors
in the central park or snapping photos of historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But along with sightseers, the town has become something of a
magnet for students of the Spanish language. The first schools were
set up more than 20 years ago, and have become extremely popular _
probably due to the gorgeous surroundings and the rock-bottom
prices.
</P>
<P>
   A week of one-to-one instruction, seven hours per day, costs
from $100 to $150, far cheaper than comparable schools in other
Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best reputation in all of Central America,''
said Jeanne Guthrie, an American who now lives in Costa Rica but
who came to Antigua to learn Spanish. ``I went to a school in Costa
Rica and the instruction here is 100 times better. All we did there
was play.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools tailor their instruction to the individual students'
level. Many people come for weeks or even months at a time,
spending their days laboring through classes, their nights
bar-hopping through the bistros and internet cafes and their
weekends traveling through the rest of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlife is far from wild, but agreeable. Fine restaurants
_ many run by foreigners _ offer everything from Italian to Thai
and French food, while several American-style pubs offer beer,
burgers and American sports on satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   A popular spot is the Cafe Condesa, just off the central park,
which is housed in a 400-year-old home. Legend has it that the
Spanish count who once lived there returned from a journey, found
his wife in an amorous repose with the butler, and promptly killed
the servant. The body was buried in one of the home's
two-foot-thick walls, the story goes _ and the bones were
supposedly uncovered by a 1976 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less historic bars offer entertainment in the form of
videos shown nightly in small rooms packed with overstuffed couches
and chairs. The movies are mostly in English with Spanish
subtitles, which helps students hone their Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, there is a colonial art museum, several
impressive churches and a convent that has been transformed into a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous, there is horseback riding, bicycling,
hiking in the surrounding mountains, golf and whitewater rafting.
Hiking is a bit risky, however, as bandits have been known to hold
up tourists venturing up the nearby volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will find plenty of Mayan handicrafts, jade, silver,
native artwork and other handicrafts. Barter with vendors on the
street, or step into gift shops that range from the kitschy to the
refined.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a Latin American veteran or a first-time
traveler, Antigua is simply too beautiful to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a film set, really,'' said Gee, the Brit on extended
holiday. ``It's an interior designer's dream. Around every corner
you've got these great colors, and you're surrounded by these
volcanoes in every direction. It's really quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   La Antigua, Guatemala or ``The Old Guatemala'' is aptly named,
as guidebooks say the quaint streets, well-preserved colonial
architecture and spectacular views of three surrounding volcanoes
make it one of the most beautiful cities in all of Latin America.
Known also for its Spanish-language schools, Antigua is the perfect
starting point for a Latin American vacation, or a pleasant,
inexpensive place to spend a few weeks or even months learning how
to speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Guatemala City, the nation's capital, is served
by American, Continental and Delta, along with TACA and several
other Latin American air carriers, with non-stops from several
major American cities including Miami, Atlanta and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DOCUMENTS: American residents need only a passport. No visa is
required for tourist stays of less than 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND:
</P>
<P>
   Rental cars _ If you plan to tour the entire country, a rental
car is probably the best way to go, although they are expensive,
from US$60 to US$90 per day. You must also be careful as cars are
targets for thieves _ best to stay only at hotels with secured
parking, and be sure to purchase collision/damage waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttles _ If you plan to limit your visit to Antigua, you can
take a shuttle from the Guatemala City airport to Antigua, a trip
of about one hour that should cost from US$15 to US$30. For
information, call the Guatemalan Tourist Commission at
502-331-1333. Once in Antigua, you don't really need a car, as the
historical part of the city is pleasant and small enough for
walking.
</P>
<P>
   Buses _ Taking a public bus on an excursion in Antigua can be an
adventure all on its own. The buses are incredibly cheap _ as
little as US$2 for a several-hour trip _ and are filled with
residents packing children, market produce, luggage and practically
anything else you can imagine. Ask locals where to find the buses _
most leave from a large open lot west of the market. Be prepared to
stand if the bus is crowded and don't take lots of luggage or
valuables _ tourists can be targets for pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE: Antigua is located at about 5,000 feet above sea
level. Rainy months are late summer to early fall. A sweater is
probably a good idea, but a must in winter as nighttime
temperatures can drop into the 40s. Days are generally pleasant
year-round, with highs rarely going above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ACCOMMODATIONS: You can stay cheap or expensive. Budget hotels
range from as little as US$5 a night for a shared bathroom to US$15
for rooms with private bathrooms. In the mid-price range, expect to
pay US$30 to US$50 a night, while luxury hotels go for US$75 to
US$125 per night. If you enroll in a language school, they can
arrange a stay with a family, with meals and room going for about
US$60 a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RESTAURANTS: The selection varies widely, from very
inexpensive local spots serving Guatemalan fare of beans, chicken
and rice for US$3 to US$4 to fine dining establishments with
American and European cuisine. Favorites with tourists include the
Rainbow Reading Room and Cafe, a bookstore offering vegetarian
dishes; Cafe Condesa with its opulent courtyard and 400-year-old
building; Cafe Flor for Thai food; Fridas Mexican Restaurant and
Bar and El Sereno, a fine-dining establishment offering
international dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SIGHTSEEING: Highlights include the Catedral de Santiago off
the central park, built in 1542 and only partially rebuilt after
devastating earthquakes in 1780 and 1820. Also facing the park is
the Palacio de los Capitanes, which housed the Spanish capital for
200 years when Antigua was the administrative center for a
territory that stretched from Southern Mexico to Nicaragua. On the
north side of the park is the Palacio del Ayuntamiento, the town
hall, which includes a museum of colonial artifacts. The city's
most striking church is La Merced, located three blocks from the
park, which was built in 1548 and rebuilt after numerous
earthquakes. It features a huge fountain said to be one of the
largest in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SPANISH SCHOOLS: Antigua boasts more than 50, which offer a
week of one-on-one instruction, up to seven hours per day, for $100
to $150. For a list of schools, call the Guatemalan Tourist
Commission 502-331-1333 or check a website at:
www.conexion.com/schools.htm
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EXCURSIONS: One-day tours to places like Lake Atitlan can be
arranged through travel agencies. Tours to Mayan ruins at Copan or
Tikal are also available, as are mountain-biking, whitewater
rafting trips and horseback riding. Among the tour companies are
Adventure Travel Center at 502-832-0162 in Antigua and Maya
Expeditions in Guatemala City at 502-363-4955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PRECAUTIONS: It's safest to drink only bottled water and not
to eat food prepared by street vendors. Avoid peeled, uncooked
fruit or vegetables. Be careful with rented cars, parking only in
secured areas, and walk at night only in groups. Bandits have been
known to rob tourists hiking on the volcanoes surrounding Antigua,
so it's probably best to enjoy the view from town.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S PRIMARY ELECTION, BY THE NUMBERS
 &HT;    With MEXICO-PRIMARY-$ADV07.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 7 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO'S PRIMARY ELECTION AT-A-GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHEN: Sun., Nov. 7, polls open between 8 a.m. CDT and 6 p.m.
CDT (9 a.m. and 7 p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHY IT'S IMPORTANT: This is the first time Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held a primary election
to select the party's presidential candidate. The party has
controlled Mexico's presidency for 70 years. Mexico's president has
always selected who would be the party's nominee in previous
elections. The primary winner will run against at least two strong
opposition candidates on July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO IS RUNNING: The top two contenders in a tight race are
Francisco Labastida, former interior minister and agriculture
minister in President Ernesto Zedillo's administration, and Roberto
Madrazo, former governor of Tabasco state. The other two contenders
are Manuel Bartlett, former governor of Puebla state; and Humberto
Roque Villanueva, former PRI congressional leader.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO IS SUPERVISING: Because Mexico's electoral law doesn't
cover primaries yet, the PRI is supervising its own election. All
candidates are allowed to have representatives at precincts to
monitor the balloting and the counting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO CAN VOTE: Any Mexican with a voter credential is invited
to participate, not just PRI members. About 6.5 million voters
expected to turn out. There are 58.1 million Mexicans eligible to
vote. Out of that number 54.5 million Mexicans have active voter
credentials, which are frequently used in Mexico as an
identification card.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO WINS: Mexico has 300 electoral districts of varying sizes
nationwide. The winner of a majority of those districts not the
winner of the total number of direct votes will become the nominee.
Nov. 10 is when all returns should be counted. Nov. 18 is the final
deadline for announcing the winner. And on Nov. 20 the winner will
be sworn in as the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NUMBERS AT A GLANCE:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ballots mailed out to 300 districts: About 16 million
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Voting stations: 64,500
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bottles of indelible ink to mark voters' thumbs to ensure they
only vote once: 140,000
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Observers: 193,500 trained observers from the PRI's ranks will
supervise, along with up to 258,000 observers representing the
candidates. Each candidate is allowed one representative per voting
station.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ballots available at each voting station: An average of 220,
but bigger districts are supposed to have more.

   LONDON _ So you suspect your spouse may be having an affair.
These days, you can employ a world of high-tech devices to help you
catch an errant husband or wife: zoom cameras, auto-tracking
apparatus, even spray-on sperm detectors.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the ones doing the misbehaving. Where can this
often-discounted segment of the population seek their much-needed
support? At the Alibi Agency.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, the popular British agency will provide
credible cover stories for almost every adulterous moment. The fee:
a mere US$25-US$75, depending on the tailor-made fib.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to meet a lover for the weekend, but don't want
your mate to know. You could hire the Alibi Agency to mail you a
phony invitation to a seminar or sporting event, providing you with
a ``legitimate'' excuse for going away.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptions don't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will make purchases on your behalf so that the items
can't be traced back to you via one of those pesky receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It will even loan you a noiseless pager so that you can be
discreetly contacted without the little woman _ or man _ knowing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone agrees with this blatant assault on
marital fidelity. Encouraging one to cheat on one's spouse _ no
matter how sophisticated the deception, or noble the goal _ is not
going to get you past society's moral gatekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling remorse about making money out of helping
spouses cover their deceits, however, the brains behind this
business say they are proud to be ``helping keep couples
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually trying to preserve the family, to protect loved
ones from the stress that comes from suspecting your spouse is
cheating,'' said Ronnie Brock, who founded the company nearly 10
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the agency's advertisement on the Internet reads: ``Our aim
is total peace of mind for you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock also points out that about US$1.50 from each US$30 annual
membership goes to charities helping children from broken homes.
</P>
<P>
   Annual membership allows what Brock calls ``secure telephone
access to our operators.'' Beyond that, it costs US$25 a time for
the agency to call a spouse with a bogus business appointment and
US$40 for it to make up a phony invitation letter or card and mail
it to a client.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptions can cost more, of course, depending on how elaborate
you want them to be. Say you want to have a fling in Wales. While
you're away, one of the agency's receptionists will answer calls
from your spouse _ in a Welsh accent. They will answer in a
pre-arranged manner, i.e. trade fair, golf tournament, etc. They
will even allow your spouse to hear them as they pretend to try and
ring your room or page you.
</P>
<P>
   Brock operates the Alibi Agency from Blackpool _ a picturesque
resort town in Northern England's Lake District, about a four
hours' drive from London _ along with Joe and Dawn Taylor. Although
Brock's not married, the Taylors have been married 15 years. They
say neither is interested in having an affair. The idea for the
agency grew out of the trio's experiences on the road managing
British rock musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people would want to fool around a bit and we
would have to make excuses for them, so eventually we figured it
would be a great idea for a business,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been.
</P>
<P>
   In just over nine months of operation, the agency has received
more than 10,000 customer inquiries, a third of them from women.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brock plans to open franchises in Argentina and the United
States by the end of the year, and franchises in other countries _
including Australia, Denmark and Mexico _ by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the unique business has spawned at least one copycat in
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   John Watson, of Inverness, Scotland, started the Ace Alibi
Agency about four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has more than 1,200 members, 40 percent of whom are
women. Most members are from Europe, although 26 members live in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's mailed many of the American members invitations to
nonexistent conferences in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't believe a family should be destroyed over two
or three nights of madness,'' said Watson, who is married. ``If
someone uses this service, then that person obviously wants to
preserve their family.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is thrilled that businesses built on deceptions
are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders, for example, have spoken out against this type
of business, which they say condones lying for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Says an outraged Rev. Michael Manley of St. John's Church in
Blackpool: ``I can't believe this type of business is allowed to
exist. I didn't think it could be legal because obviously this
service is open to anybody so how do you know people are just
cheating on their wives, which is bad enough? They could be
cheating on their companies, anything in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brock and Watson reason that hanky-panky will happen in
today's society no matter what, and that their agencies are there
to help preserve the sanity of the poor, unknowing spouses waiting
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people these days who have a short-term
fling, or dalliance, and there's no sense in breaking up a
long-term relationship over it,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics vary on the number of people who have affairs, but a
survey conducted last year showed that British men and women are
the most adulterous in Europe _ although Americans topped the
overall list.
</P>
<P>
   The study of more than 10,000 sexually active adults in 14
countries found that 42 percent of Britons, compared to 22 percent
of Spaniards, 36 percent of French and 38 percent of Italians,
admitted to having more than one relationship at a time. But the
Global Sex Survey, conducted for Durex, the condom manufacturer,
said that half of the Americans questions said they had been
unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you get too depressed over the prevalence of
cheating, those who have been cheated on do have a new weapon of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a gel called Infidelity Detection Cream is selling
faster than sushi. Japanese women surreptitiously rub the gel into
their husbands' backs before they leave home in the morning. If the
men shower during the day _ a sure sign of a fling _ the chemical
reacts with water to form big blisters.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for revenge?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, it
pulled down with it the
</P>
<P>
   center of strategic gravity that had aligned the world's nations
and their people throughout half a century of Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the United States has emerged as the single
strongest nation in history, capable of bringing to bear enormous,
and often decisive, influence and power on a truly global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the old Soviet Union has sparked dizzying change
and spawned infinite possibilities for a whole generation of
American investors, interventionists and diplomats, who have spent
the past decade furiously tapping into new markets, confronting
humanitarian crises and weaving together alliances among former
foes.
</P>
<P>
   And the world, overall, is a very different place from the one
that was divided east and west along lines once symbolized by the
Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all of the gains, real or perceived, of the past
decade, the forging of a new world order to replace the old remains
very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   For if the end of the Cold War created new opportunities for the
United States, it also presented the country with four
interconnected imperatives, the resolution of which, now far from
complete, will largely determine the shape of the world well into
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those areas _ managing the collapse of the Soviet
Union; reckoning with China's rise as an important world power;
reducing the threat of nuclear war; and building a global
marketplace _ progress has been limited and even threatens to
stall.
</P>
<P>
   Largely missing amid the celebration, self-congratulation and
talk of boundless potential that has come to characterize the age,
the world has arrived at a potentially dangerous moment, and the
path forward from here is anything but clear.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to fault President Clinton, as indeed many have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his administration are great underachievers,'' said
Richard Haas, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. `` He has been president at a
time of unprecedented American primacy and we simply don't have
much to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that there are real limits to what the
United States can accomplish, despite its over-arching political,
economic and military dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this view that the indispensable nation can affect
outcomes at every place around the world. We can't,'' said Anthony
Blinken, director for European Affairs on the White House National
Security Council. ``All we can do is bring these unique resources
to bear in the smartest way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the crumbling of the Berlin Wall signaled the beginning of
the end for the Soviet Union, the finale followed just two years
later, when Moscow dissolved its far flung empire.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. challenge was to try to help cushion the collapse of
the Soviet empire, in hopes of preventing anarchy, chaos and the
potential for war, all of which have since been visited upon the
Russian motherland in its peril-fraught journey from a communist
state toward a free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rocky, messy, suspenseful, even dangerous
process,'' President Clinton's Russia point man, Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott, said several weeks ago in a speech at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Russia is that it remains, nominally at least,
under the control of its democratically elected president, Boris
Yeltsin. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December. And
next June, if all goes as planned, Russians will go to the polls to
pick Yeltsin's successor in the first democratic transfer of power
in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, though, possessor of more nuclear weapons than any other
nation on Earth, remains a deeply troubled state.
</P>
<P>
   It is listing through its fourth government in 18 months _
Yeltsin having sacked three others. Corruption, organized crime and
indebtedness have all but crippled Moscow's ability to provide the
services expected of a modern state. Soldiers and scientists alike
go unpaid, pensioners and entrepreneurs conspire to convert rubles
to deutsche marks, dollars or pounds, while tens of billions of
dollars in foreign aid and investment are believed to have been
siphoned off and spirited to banks and villas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Russia is engaged in a civil war with
seccessionists in the republic of Chechnya, a conflict that has
clouded and threatens to disrupt relations between Clinton and
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   While critics, indeed, blame Clinton for vesting excessive faith
in one man's vision of democratic reform _ Yeltsin's _ others plead
for patience and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, keep your fingers crossed, Russia remains on the
democratic track,'' said Georgetown University professor of
government Thane Gustafson, author of the new book, ``Capitalism
Russian-Style.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. policy can influence and support Russia's painful
economic, political and social transition, he said, ultimately the
outcome is beyond outsiders' control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is a drama in Russian,'' said
Gustafson. ``It's a Russian passion play on a Russian stage with
Russian actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. efforts to reduce the global nuclear threat bore
fruit early on, only to stumble badly over the past 18 months and
cause the global non-proliferation regime has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to persuade India and Pakistan from testing a
series of nuclear weapons in a tit-or-tat display of atomic
ambitions in 1998. He was unable to prevent the
Republican-controlled Senate from spiking the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, which would have prohibited such tests among 154
signatory states, last month. And he's been helpless against the
Russian Duma's refusal to ratify START II _ a treaty negotiated by
former President Bush and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996,
which calls for massive U.S. and Russian reductions in
nuclear-armed missiles.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen nations believed to have nuclear capability, a
dozen other rogue states or well-organized terrorist groups seeking
to acquire them, and up to 70 other countries with the nuclear
expertise and equipment to build such weapons on short notice, the
threat of a nuclear attack has been anything but diminished since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would characterize it as a decade of unraveling,'' said
Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a
nonpartisan research group that advocates nuclear non
proliferation. ``I don't know too many people who I work with in
this field who think that we're any safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it's hard to point to concrete progress in relations
between the United States and China, the most populous nation on
Earth. With one-fifth of the world's people under its charge, China
is poised to assume a growing role as a regional and global
economic and military power over the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited poor relations with Beijing, taking office
less than four years after the brutal killings near Tiananmen
Square soured China's ties with most of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the complexity and contradictions of China have made it
difficult for Clinton to find openings for meaningful detente.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
June, Sino-American ties plunged to their lowest level since the
Tiananmen killings in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country is more suspicious of the other today than it was
seven years ago,'' said Haas. As a result, he said, ``China has not
been effectively integrated into the world and there's growing
opposition in both countries, in the United States and China, to an
amicable relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to China's entry into the company of global powers is
its growing economic might. With a total stock market
capitalization of roughly $250 billion and exports this year
approaching $200 billion, China continues to sit on the sidelines
of the formal club of trading nations, the World Trade
Organization, or WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton balked at a deal last spring that would have accorded
China WTO membership in exchange for a host of concessions on
Beijing's part - tariff reductions, investment protections and the
like. Now, against long political odds in this country and in
China, Clinton is trying to patch together a deal that would allow
China entry in time for a new round of WTO talks set to begin in
Seattle late this month.
</P>
<P>
   China's absence from the WTO is but one shortcoming in a
longer-term plan Clinton had once hoped would result in a collapse
in global trade barriers mirroring the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Free-market economies have blossomed around the world, from
Latin America and Central Europe to Africa and Eastern Asia, since
the Cold War's end. Hundreds of millions of people have profited:
an estimated 1.5 billion now live in countries where a family of
four enjoys an average annual income of $20,000 a more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's pleas for a free trade zone taking in the
entire Western Hemisphere have been thwarted by his fellow
Democrats, in the face of opposition from organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some controlled integration of China into the world market
economy and its institutions is very important,'' said Robert
Hormats, of the New York investment firm Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard to have a stable and prosperous
system,'' said Hormats, ``if China is not brought into it over the
course of the next few years.''

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal
following, Major Jan Zeman is back on duty 10 years after the end
of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the country's economy faltering and the reform
government tainted by allegations of corruption, the opposition
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia enjoys the support of 20
percent of the population, according to recent polls. It marks a
high point in public support for the communists since the regime
fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vow that if they came to power they would shift
the Czech Republic from its current capitalist course back to
socialism and seek to annul the country's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, granted earlier this year along
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Zeman could hasten their return, by making
communism seem cool, say critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population today could be influenced by this series. Those
who see the problems of today's society may think it was a better
time when they view this propaganda,'' said Jaroslav Runt, 77, a
deputy chairman of the former political prisoners confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The country's best-known former political prisoner, President
Vaclav Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails,
dismissed the series as ``not the first nor the last idiocy aired
by Czech Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is as melodramatic and dated as an episode of Mannix.
Many viewers, it seems, are drawn to the show out of nostalgia for
their youth, not the politics of the time. Tuning in each week to
see Zeman's latest exploits is merely a walk down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Zeman is kind of like putting on an old pair of boots
you've dug out of the closet,'' said Vera Kamenicka, 58, of Prague.
``They are kind of comfortable, but out of fashion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On a recent afternoon, Lothar Weinberg celebrated with
a sip of champagne the conclusion of his philosophical journey from
Karl Marx to Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, 52, has a salesman's eye contact, smile and handshake
_ the markings of a man destined to win friends and influence
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with a few friends over hors d'oeuvres and drinks in a
sparsely furnished suburban office, Weinberg toasted the beginning
of a new and perhaps more perilous adventure _ running a business
in a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going at it full-bore, throwing himself into
capitalism's wildest and woolliest milieu: private consulting. He
and his partner hope their new business, Know How Inc., will make
them rich, an objective as distant as Mars just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall was famously breached 10 years ago Tuesday,
Weinberg was fastened securely in East Germany's Communist
structure. He was an electrical engineer facing a future with
little risk or reward.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the millennium, life for Weinberg _ as well as
his former East German countrymen _ is now full of both.
</P>
<P>
   For Weinberg, who felt the fires of ambition as a young man, the
changes that came in that momentous autumn of 1989 couldn't have
come soon enough. He regrets the years stifled in the old system.
``For me, the wall came down too late,'' he said during a break
from entertaining well-wishers. ``But my children. They will know
well what it means to have freedom and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Burkhard Rauschart sat on a wooden bench in an
open plaza sharing beer and cynicism with friends. Rauschart's eyes
were bloodshot and full of suspicion. He clinched an unlit
cigarette between his fingers as he listened to a stranger's
questions about life after The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall,'' he said ``I wish they would build it back _ and 10
meters higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The park bench chorus confirmed this sentiment with grumbling
obscenities. It's been a hard 10 years. Within a few months of the
dawn of freedom, he got a divorce and lost his job as a train
security inspector.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Rauschart, the benefits of freedom seem
abstract, while the tribulations of capitalism are real.
``Freedom?'' he said with a caustic laugh. ``Freedom. Who can
afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, people often say that tearing down the
brick-and-mortar Berlin Wall was easy compared to removing the
barriers that remain in the minds of Ossies and Wessies _
Easterners and Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ostalgia'' _ a sense of longing for the good old days _
expressed by Rauschart is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey indicated that some 13 percent of the population
would like to see the East and West divided again. The numbers were
nearly the same for both easterners and westerners surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent believed that Germans are now ``one
people,'' the poll said. Most _ 57 percent _ said another decade
would be needed to unite Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise is deeper among Ossies _ people from the former East
Germany. Easterners say that they are paid less than their Wessi
counterparts and are treated as second-class citizens. ``They think
we're lazy and stupid,'' said Manfred Schneider, a 70-year-old
former East German army officer who now earns about $4 an hour as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ossies express a gnawing anxiety over losing the
cradle-to-grave security that they enjoyed in the past even if they
lacked privacy and personal freedom. In a September survey, only 38
percent of east Germans said they were satisfied with democracy
compared to 60 percent in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent in the east favored continuing the free-market
economy. Most surprisingly, 51 percent of the Ossies said they were
happier in the communist German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschart, for one, said his life is far more difficult now. He
lives on $600 a month in government welfare. After paying the rent
on a subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the poor Hohenschoenhausen
district, Rauschart is left with about $250 for groceries and other
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough,'' he says bitterly. ``Lamb cutlets cost four
times more than they did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have found political resonance. The Communists _
reborn as the Party of Democratic Socialism, or PDS _ are now
Germany's No. 2 political party behind Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats. And in a potentially more worrisome
trend, the far-right German's Peoples Union won seats in two
eastern state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   The PDS positions itself as a hip alternative to the capitalists
of the West that stresses social justice issues and a respect for
the old ways of the East. The party is by far the biggest in
eastern Germany with nearly 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moderate East Germans express feelings of uneasiness
about unification, particularly the way their former identities
seem to have been lost in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they feel like a conquered colony. ``I wouldn't
describe it as a unification as much as I would call it a
swallowing,'' said Christoph Links, a former East German journalist
who is running a successful publishing house in East Berlin. ``We
had all the systems and structures of West Germany imposed on us
with all the problems that were already there. It's as if our whole
biographies are not accepted _ we spent our lives in a wrong system
so our lives before unification don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This nostalgia is puzzling to many, including former East German
politburo member Guenter Schabowski, the former communist official
who announced the end of travel restrictions on Nov. 8, 1989. In
his view, this decision brought an end to the wall's practical
relevance. ``At that moment, the wall became only a metaphor,''
Schabowski said during a discussion over plates of fancy Italian
food not far from the former location of Checkpoint Charlie, the
gate from East Berlin to the city's American Sector.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski, now 70, is awaiting sentencing for his role in the
shooting deaths of people trying to flee the East over the wall. He
denies that he had a direct part in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He has little patience for all this ``Ostalgia.'' ``They are
concerned about the loss of the socialist institutions and the high
rates of unemployment, and I don't reproach them for that,'' he
said. ``But it was an illusion. You see, the failure of the GDR was
this: These positive traits weren't positive because we had no way
to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And people are selective about what they remember, he said.
``They say things were cheaper then, but they seem to forget that
they couldn't find anything to buy,'' he said. ``What has happened
in 10 years is enormous. If you don't see that, then you have
something else in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ossies aren't alone in their concerns. In the West, there
are fears that the once economic powerhouse has squandered its
wealth trying to prop up the East, which was an economic ruin in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has spent more than $600 billion in the
former East Germany, which to the annoyance of many in the West is
benefiting tremendously from the new infrastructure. It is
generally accepted that the phone system in the East is now much
more advanced than the older one in the West.
</P>
<P>
   West Germans often grumble about paying the 7.5 percent levy
known as a ``Solidarity Tax'' on their incomes to help the East.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Ossies feel the Wessies haven't been given any
credit for what they contribute. ``I wouldn't say. 'We pay the
solidarity tax, too,''' said Tom Sello, a former opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sello expressed a common sentiment . . . ``I'm personally better
off now, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining, Berlin is for most people today a
better place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Brauer, a Wessie who owns a yachting school with an Ossie
partner, said only a fool would want to return Berlin to being
isolated island in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no going back, and there shouldn't be, `` Brauer
said. ``The two parts of the city have to grow together and in time
become just one city.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to trace the wall on the landscape these days. The
city center, which was left to atrophy during the Cold War, is now
booming, in part because of the return earlier this year of the
national government for the first time since Hitler was in power.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to push the city into the future sometimes has paid
little attention to its past. Construction workers last month
uncovered part of the bunker where Hitler spent his last hours
before committing suicide. City officials wasted no time in
deciding to continue with plans to build a new road over the
bunker, paving it back to its inglorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1989, Michael Roesler's city map showed West Berlin as an
undefined white blot. Today he and his wife Kristina live in an
apartment in the white blot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the wall came down, they were forced to leave their
apartment in the east after the owner reclaimed the building and
began to remodel it. Their new apartment is spacious by European
standards and has a view of a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, the Roeslers looked through the pages of
the scrapbook they've made to recount their new lives. Their
greatest satisfaction seems to come from having been able to see
much of the world for themselves _ a nearly unheard of joy in the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   At first, they traveled with a keen sense of urgency _ as if the
wall would suddenly close again. They learned _ to their quiet
satisfaction _ that the West isn't quite up to their old fantasies.
``We've seen Vienna and it was fine, but it is no better than
Budapest,'' said Kristina. ``We see that not everything is perfect
in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   As their retirement years approach, they worry about their
financial security _ an unheard of burden in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they have managed well in this strange new system. ``We're
really benefiting from these capitalistic means of making money,''
joked Michael Roesler, who has switched jobs twice sense
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't say that the old days were better, but they also
wouldn't argue that they had nothing to commend them either.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roeslers are optimistic about the future. They plan to
visit Toronto to see old friends _ once a bold dream that is now
just a pleasant expectation.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hurry because the wall is gone forever.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RIVALS: LIKELY LOSER OF PRIMARY HOLDS KEYS TO FUTURE OF
RULING PARTY
 &HT;    With MADRAZO-BOX-1106; LABASTIDA-BOX-1106.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The rivalry between aspirants Bill Bradley and Al
Gore pales by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The top two candidates dueling in this Sunday's historic primary
election in Mexico mutually accuse each other of one of the worst
wrongs you could commit here.
</P>
<P>
   Frontrunner Francisco Labastida and rival Roberto Madrazo both
aired television attack ads accusing each other of being dupes of
former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gotari. The former
chief-of-state, who lives in self-exile in Ireland, is one of
Mexico's most reviled former presidents. He is deeply resented for
alleged corruption and a devastating peso crash following his
1988-1994 presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My economic program is long-term. Within 40 years we'll all be
better off, right, chief?'' a gullible-looking Labastida puppet
asked Salinas, his master, in Madrazo's commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is whose boss?'' Labastida's commercial fired back,
showing Salinas and Madrazo looking chummy and claiming that
Madrazo owes Salinas for helping him win a governorship and
positions in Mexico's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which aired the final day of a three-month campaign
that closed Wednesday, represent the peak of a brutal competition
between Labastida and Madrazo _ the likes of which have not been
seen recently inside Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Both men want to win the first-ever-presidential primary held by
the PRI, which has controlled Mexico's presidency since 1929. Until
now the president of Mexico has always appointed the PRI's
presidential nominees, or, in effect his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Labastida, 57, a mild-mannered party insider who
was most recently Mexico's interior minister, has surged ahead in
the race with a 10-point lead or more. But the 47-year-old Madrazo,
a former governor of Tabasco state who has run an aggressive
campaign as a PRI rebel, led Labastida at the outset and is
expected to finish a strong second.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is defeated, analysts say, Madrazo wields enormous
power. He could help unite the party by endorsing Labastida, or he
could deeply wound the PRI, which is fighting to hold onto the
presidency in Mexico's general election next July.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the PRI has survived as the world's longest ruling
party by veering from socialist to free-market ideology and
otherwise reshaping itself to suit the times. It has long been
accused of one constant, however: the use of outright fraud _ less
so in recent years _ and paternalistic pre-election government
handouts to attract voters.
</P>
<P>
   If Madrazo and his followers charge that fraud tainted the PRI's
primary, Madrazo voters could desert the party and withhold their
votes or even support opposition candidates in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Labastida is going to win,'' said political
analyst Lorenzo Meyer of Mexico City's Colegio de Mexico, who views
the primary as yet another reincarnation of the PRI in an attempt
to retain power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Madrazo will probably stay in the party,'' Meyer
said. ``If he stays, he'll have to be treated with great care by
Labastida. That's different for the PRI _ not necessarily better,
but different.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo press spokesman Octavio Garcia said, ``I can almost
assure you that Roberto Madrazo will not leave the party.''
</P>
<P>
   If the election is viewed as clean, ``Madrazo will be the first
to offer his vote and confidence to the winner. But if there is
fraud, we won't participate in the winner's campaign and Madrazo
won't offer his support.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, Labastida and two other candidates who are trailing
distantly in polls are each allowed two representatives to watch
for fraud at the 64,500 voting stations the PRI is establishing for
its self-supervised balloting. Representatives will be allowed to
follow ballots through the final computerized count.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that instead of getting completely shunted aside
after the election _ often the case in past internal feuds within
the PRI _ a defeated Madrazo and his close advisers will probably
have enough leverage to command powerful jobs within the PRI and
influence over policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said Madrazo has violated a cardinal PRI rule, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI worships at the altar of the president,'' he said. But
in his campaign, Madrazo insulted many powerful PRI insiders by
attacking the current administration's free-market economic
policies and constantly calling for change.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Madrazo was accused of fraud when he was elected
Tabasco state governor in 1994. During this campaign he deflected
most of those charges, and accused Labastida's campaign of
vote-buying and abusing government programs and resources to
attract supporters. These are the same charges the PRI's rival
political parties have accused the PRI of committing for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who want the people to vote, but not to
really choose,'' Madrazo said at a closing rally this week.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's call for change is what attracted a group of women
from a small town in the northern state of Coahuila to travel to
Mexico City to attend a Madrazo gathering. They said their children
were forced to migrate to the United States because work has
declined dramatically in the traditional agriculture of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to our humble town to talk to us about our problems,''
said Alicia Esquivel, 54. ``We don't know Labastida. If he wants
our support later, he'll have to receive us.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Rodriguez, 29 and a Mexico City housewife, may be more
typical of a voter who tends to stick with the PRI in most
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced the PRI is trying to change its ways,'' she
said. ``At first, I was leaning toward Madrazo. Everything he did
was new. But after a while his insults and aggression toward
Labastida bothered me and I changed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, a former governor of Sinaloa state and an economist,
has been a government official for more than 30 years. He's worked
in the federal government managing oil revenues, highways and state
industries. Most recently he was President Ernesto Zedillo's
agriculture secretary and interior minister. Many Mexicans view him
as Zedillo's ``official'' candidate, although the president
declared he would remain publicly neutral until after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has campaigned on a ``power for the people'' slogan,
suggesting that he would improve women's rights and wages and pay
more attention to Mexico's struggling poor farmers. But mostly he
has cast himself as honest and even-keeled, telling voters he comes
to this election ``with my hands clean and my head held high.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't challenged Zedillo at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI's presidential candidates always seem at first just
like the presidents who they served,'' Meyer said. ``But once they
are the official candidate, they are allowed to metamorphose.
Labastida is not at the stage yet.''

AMMIANO CELEBRATES VICTORY; PREPARES FOR RUNOFF WITH MAYOR BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even before the latest election results were
read _ before write-in candidate Tom Ammiano's supporters began
whooping and before Ammiano gave his victory speech on the steps of
City Hall _ the last leg of San Francisco's most unusual mayoral
race had already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before election officials announced the numbers that put
the Board of Supervisors president into the Dec. 14 runoff election
against Mayor Willie Brown, Ammiano's top backers held a five-hour
strategy meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown aides were compiling documents on Ammiano's
record, part of their upcoming effort to paint the city's most
liberal elected official as a tax-and-spend politician.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of ballot counting and nail-biting suspense,
the second chapter of a mayor's race that will be known as one of
the most unusual in the city's history is now under way.
</P>
<P>
   It's a contest between two colorful and powerful politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, 58, a sometime stand-up comedian who has led the city's
school board and board of supervisors, secured second place in
Tuesday's election after an unprecedented three-week write-in
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 65, the city's first black mayor, has spent a lifetime in
politics, earning him fund-raising power, influence with state and
federal officials and a night in the Lincoln bedroom at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   News of the matchup, announced late Thursday afternoon at City
Hall, stunned the politicos and activists in San Francisco, where
no write-in candidate has ever won an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen this kind of celebration and solidarity since
George Moscone was elected (mayor) in 1975,'' said Rich DeLeon,
chairman of San Francisco State's political science department,
referring to one of the most liberal politicians San Francisco had
yet seen.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Ammiano supporters chanted, ``Win, Tom, win!'' as
Naomi Nishioka, acting director of the Department of Elections,
read the latest count, showing Ammiano with 25.4 percent of the
vote, firmly in second place and qualifying for the runoff against
Brown, the top vote-getter with 38.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano then made a well-timed appearance and was engulfed by a
sea of reporters and news cameras. He took over the election
department's press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite a victory against corporate campaigning,'' a
grinning Ammiano said to deafening applause. ``I think it's the
kind of participatory democracy that people in San Francisco have
hungered for for a long time. And I was happy to assuage their
appetite, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a violation of election law for electioneering inside a
government building, Ammiano was asked by the building manager to
lead everyone outside, where he held an impromptu press conference
on the steps of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's second-place finish awed even those who aren't backing
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether you agree with Tom, you've got to give
him credit for pulling off a miracle,'' said Supervisor Gavin
Newsom, a Brown appointee.
</P>
<P>
   With votes from San Francisco's 646 precincts tallied, former
Mayor Frank Jordan fell into third place with 17.1 percent and
ex-political consultant Clint Reilly took 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 18,000 absentee and provisional ballots remained to be
counted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead in the campaign for mayor is a difficult battle
between two liberals that creates a tough choice for San
Francisco's left-leaning voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is an unrelenting champion of gay rights, tenant causes,
business taxation and environmental protection with the strong
backing of many union members. Brown, who has been endorsed by all
the top labor groups, has strong support in the gay community as
well and is a favorite in many working-class neighborhoods. The
mayor won solid margins of victory Tuesday in neighborhoods with
many African American and Asian American residents.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's campaign is looking carefully at his strongholds in
traditionally progressive districts, which turned out in big
numbers for him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's camp is positioning the mayor as a centrist and will
work hard in more conservative neighborhoods _ particularly those
on San Francisco's west side that have supported Brown rivals such
as Jordan and former state Sen. Quentin Kopp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city easily given to division _ tenants vs.
landlords, labor vs. management, left vs. right,'' Brown campaign
spokesman P.J. Johnston said. ``Mayor Brown's unique strength is
his ability to speak to all those divergent groups.''

ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING IN LIVE ANIMALS GROWING ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A young man walked into the Peninsula Humane
Society in San Mateo, Calif., two weeks ago, holding a shoe box.
Inside was a tiny tree- dwelling monkey no bigger than his hand, a
South American pygmy marmoset.
</P>
<P>
   Just like buying a pair of shoes, the man's girlfriend had
purchased the baby primate as a novelty on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The marmoset, quiet and cold, had started to fail, and the man
was desperately trying to save its life.
</P>
<P>
   Humane Society officials warmed and fed the wild monkey, which
is illegal to possess in California, and this weekend will send it
to a Texas primate sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kari Pettit, the Peninsula Humane Society's staff
veterinarian, along with other animal protection experts, say the
young marmoset _ which has been named Chichica _ is just one more
example of the growing problem of illegal Internet trafficking in
live animals and parts of dead endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that people are able to get these animals,''
Pettit said. ``We see everything from water dragons to snakes to
chameleons to exotic birds.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 Internet sites _ some under the phrase ``animals
for sale'' _ offer to sell, give care advice or, covertly, provide
chat rooms where buyers and sellers can haggle over price,
according to Connecticut-based Friends of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week Pettit read a woman's chat room query for
marmoset breeders and potential sellers. ``It was horrendous,'' she
said. Monkeys, she added, make horrible pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be housebroken,'' she said. ``They're like a
2-year-old. They require 24-hour care. You just can't lock them in
a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Humane Society, the marmoset has grown to 3 ounces in
weight and 5 inches in length. Over the weekend, a volunteer will
take it to the Texas sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave her fluids, and she just devoured them,'' said Pettit,
who has worked in Uganda with African primates. ``Most people feed
them fruits and vegetables when they need more protein. In the
wild, they eat crickets and other insects as well as fruit. They
eat a lot of sap.''
</P>
<P>
   People don't understand that these monkeys need a great deal of
social stimulation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit said: ``Usually, babies stay with their mother for two
years. They're constantly clinging. They need to learn from their
moms and other animals in the group. Who knows what had happened to
her in her past. We don't know what she's been through.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, it is against the law to import any of a long
list of animals. The list includes both wild and domestic animals,
including primates, prairie dogs, hedgehogs and ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   Violating the law is a misdemeanor offense carrying a penalty of
up to $1,000 and one year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman who bought the marmoset won't be prosecuted. The
Humane Society is keeping her identity confidential out of concern
that releasing her name might discourage others from bringing in
animals that need help.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state animal protection agencies are grappling with
how to deal with animal trafficking on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything anyone can do about people buying animals
on the Internet,'' said Ron Jurick, a state Fish and Game
Department enforcement agent. ``You can advertise anything you
want. You can buy anything you want. ... The enforcement would come
at the border or once the animal's here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal to smuggle certain animals into California whether
the sale took place over the Internet or not. The state operates 16
checkpoints for cars, and airlines monitor for the illegal
importation of live animals. Some seaports also check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are lots of things that are smuggled across the
border,'' Jurick said. ``Every once in a while, there'll be an
accident, and something like a caiman will get out. It's a
reflection of what's going on all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for the laws, he said. The animals can spread
disease, threaten native species and end up suffering before they
die. Also, taking them depletes their native countries' wildlife
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, it's illegal to buy or sell an endangered
species in interstate commerce, whether it's over the Internet or
not, said Special Agent Bob Snow of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service office in Burlingame. In the last year, Snow's office
investigated sales of endangered species on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His agency also prohibits commerce in marine mammals and
migratory birds, including stuffed songbirds and raptors. The sale
of dead animals or parts is also prohibited, including walrus tusks
and whale baleen.
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws carry fines of up to $250,000 and five years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people buying animal parts over the Internet _ leopard
skins, rhinoceros horns, elephant ivory, sea turtles and turtle
products,'' Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   People list the items for auction on sites like eBay, which has
cooperated with the federal government by removing the illegal
offerings when it hears about them, said Snow.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Chichica, the marmoset, is going to the country's
oldest and largest primate sanctuary, Primarily Primates in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Its founder and director, Wallace Swett, believes that the
animal was trapped in the wild and smuggled into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become increasingly alarmed about the rise in sales of
exotics, especially facilitated by the Internet right now,'' said
Swett.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trade itself is alarming. But with the Internet
advertisements and sales right now, it makes it even less possible
to check on the credentials of the sellers or how they came in
possession of this type of wildlife.''

RUSSELL AMBIVALENT ABOUT BROADCAST DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Russell did his time on television. He provided color
commentary for ABC and CBS during the '70s and had mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is a series of sound bites,'' Russell said. ``That
is not a knock but it makes a difference on what you can say on
air. Networks have done a lot of research about their audiences and
learned that most have short attention spans. So they have to do
things in such a fashion as to not lose them. You have to be very
concise.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell's problem was he had too much to say. There were times
when he would tell his producer the keys to a particular team
winning a game. The conversation would take a minute or so, but the
producer would tell him to repeat it to the audience in 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd put you on the spot,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The television landscape has changed dramatically since
Russell's commentator days. Every NBA game is now on television,
and if viewers don't watch entire games, they certainly have access
to enough highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Russell doesn't think players are performing for the sole
purpose of making ESPN's ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some viewers have the arrogance to think that the fact that
they are watching somehow influenced what an athlete does on the
court,'' Russell said. ``I don't think so. Most of these guys would
do the same thing in an empty gym in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the knocks against Russell the commentator was that he
never criticized players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very good insights into the game of basketball,'' he
said. ``I didn't need to put the knock on players to make myself
look good. My concept was to always tell people why a team was
winning, not why a team was losing, in as concise a way as
possible.''

Report on DuBose shooting

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'' has good piece on
Demetrius DuBose airing on Nov. 16 at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondent Jim Lampley reports on the shooting by police of
the former Notre Dame captain and Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker.
On July 24, two San Diego officers responded to a burglary call
after DuBose was found sleeping in a neighbor's apartment. The
confrontation turned fatal when DuBose was shot 12 times. Although
a recent report from the local district attorney's office has
cleared the officers of any wrongdoing, the incident has prompted a
series of protests and accusations of racial bias against the San
Diego Police Department. DuBose was black and the officers are
white.

THEY'RE TURNING HEADS, NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins have changed. You are convinced of it. You
have a conversation with them. The dialogue immediately reminds you
of the exchanges in one of those dramatic hair color commercials.
</P>
<P>
   You: Hey, you look different. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   Bruins: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   You: Well, something's different. You working out? New clothes?
You in love? You look good. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   Bruins: Nothing, really.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the narrator is supposed to come in and pitch a
magical product, a product that will have all your friends
wondering why you appear so vibrant. There is no product with the
Bruins, according to narrator Pat Burns. But since the team has won
five straight after an 0-5-4 start, people are wondering about its
secret.
</P>
<P>
   You: Grecian Formula?
</P>
<P>
   Bruins: Nope.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins beat New Jersey, 3-1. Rookie John Grahame got a win
over Martin Brodeur. Rob DiMaio tangled with Claude Lemieux, the
NHL's traveling villain. The Bruins suddenly look good when they
didn't before. It is obvious something has changed. But the Bruins
simply say it's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not confident, you hope the puck goes in and
you're like, `Oh no, it hit his pads again,' '' Steve Heinze said.
``When you're confident you're like, `Yup, I beat him. I'm good
enough to do it and I'm going to do it again.' That's the kind of
mode the whole team is in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze talked about that less than an hour after he slipped a
snap shot by Brodeur three minutes into the third period to break a
1-all tie. Well, he didn't actually ``slip'' the puck by him. It
was much more intense than that. In one instant, Brodeur was
setting up between the pipes and in the next there was a black
object whirring over his right shoulder into the net. Brodeur
clearly wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed a snapshot moment.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will remember that the same things seemed to happen to the
Bruins just a few weeks ago. They were on their way to their first
win _ in Los Angeles _ when they gave up a goal in the final 74
seconds and wound up with a tie. Burns would tell his players that
they weren't doing anything particularly bad. But when you hear
those words and don't see any wins, the message can be kind of
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're thinking you have to do something more,'' Heinze said,
``when maybe you have to do something less. In those games we were
winless, it was just a half-inch one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   They are getting the inches now. That shouldn't be confused with
the sentiment that everything is going well, because that's not
true. Landon Wilson and Kyle McLaren were hurting during the game.
Jason Allison will be out for a few weeks with an ailing right
wrist. And No. 1 goalie Byron Dafoe still hasn't appeared in a game
this season. But Grahame has given up a goal in his past two games,
while Heinze dipped into his self-awareness package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a passer,'' he said after the win. ``You can check the
stats.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the eight-year veteran from Boston College is a quick
shooter. It helps when the goalie is ``handcuffed,'' as Ray Bourque
said. Even simpler: He wasn't looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Andreychuk is the king of that,'' Heinze said. ``You
know, he shoots when the goalie is not expecting him to shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   (For those who don't know, I am going through a phase where I
cannot write a hockey story without mentioning Andreychuk. Any
story, really. By now it is known that the Celtics' Antoine Walker
and Bill Russell had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. I think
Andreychuk should have joined them. Check back with me and I'll
have more information on the soon-to-be constructed Andreychuk Web
site.)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, something is different about these Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   You: What's different?
</P>
<P>
   Burns: Breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first five games, Heinze probably wouldn't have hit the
net,'' Burns said. ``That's the only difference. Now we're hitting
the net.''
</P>
<P>
   It was beginning to appear that the Bruins' different view of
the world was affecting the rest of the NHL. When Lemieux entered
the game in the first period, there wasn't much of a stir. We are
talking about a man who is hated in Montreal, Boston, Philadelphia,
Detroit and New York. He is a walking rage receptacle. He once made
fun of Cam Neely's role in ``Dumb and Dumber'' by asking the
forward, ``Which one are you? Dumb or Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   Had fans mellowed toward Lemieux?
</P>
<P>
   You: What's different about Lemieux?
</P>
<P>
   Bruins: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third period, DiMaio and Lemieux got into a brief
tussle. When it was over, the organ blared and fans accompanied the
music with ``Claude You Suck.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, Mikko Eloranta scored on an empty-netter and
people ran outside yelling. They were yelling because they were
happy. Only a few weeks ago, those yells were like the Bruins'
shots: move them over a few inches and you have something
completely different.
</P>
<P>
   You: What's different about you guys? It's something. What?
</P>
<P>
   Bruins: Wins. That's all. Just wins.

WITNESSING THE DAY GERMANY BECAME ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As daylight faded on Nov. 8, 1989, a lonely face looked down
from the fifth floor of East Germany's Communist Party
headquarters, a fortress of power just a few blocks from the free
world.
</P>
<P>
   The chill grew and a few bright television lights shone on
another of the spontaneous rallies around East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of East Germans, most of them young, had been fleeing
the country for weeks, reaching the West through Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. The government was under pressure to do something
from much of the rest of the world and _ like never before _ from
East Germans themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The party leadership had just quit, and those drawn to this
rally came from all sides: reformers and loyal Communists, some of
whom were clinging to the party but talking reform. Even with
worldwide pressure, it appeared that this government, in power for
44 years since World War II, could manage to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Party Leaders That Listen to the People,'' a reformist
banner stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a simple Communist Party member,'' said an onlooker.
``I'm for socialism. There's still time to reach a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Another demanded a real revolution. ``Halfway things,'' he said,
``are deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day in East Berlin _ a Thursday _ began with more
uncertainty. Reporters from around the world were drawn to the
story of thousands of refugees and a government uncertain what to
do about it. We interviewed dissidents and people on the street,
most of whom knew better than to be seen talking to us.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, the mood suddenly shifted. Forty-five
minutes into a daily East German government press briefing, one of
the hard-line officials announced, ``We know of the need of the
population to travel or leave the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Drowsy journalists stirred in the hot, crowded auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly pulling a piece of paper from his breast pocket, he began
to read: ``We are recommending today'' that the law regarding
emigration be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters, listening to crackly translations on old-fashioned
headsets, jumped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private travel can be applicated without any personal
reasons,'' the official continued, his words being translated,
``and travel police have orders to give permission immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Instantly there was a rumble as correspondents ran out of the
room to deliver the news. Foreign journalists scrambled to
interview Germans on the significance of the surprise announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the news had streamed through the streets. No
longer would East Germans have to apply months ahead of time to
leave _ and in most cases be turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall, erected in 1961, was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   East German officials probably had expected that residents would
begin lining up the morning after the historic announcement to use
their new freedom to go to West Berlin.
</P>

AMMIANO'S IMPROV NOT A JOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To the good people of Cleveland, Orlando,
Providence and other places far from the Bay: You may read that Tom
Ammiano, a professional stand-up comic who is president of the
Board of Supervisors, is in a surprising runoff election against
Mayor Willie L. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   You may think this is a another San Francisco joke.
</P>
<P>
   It is not. Ask Mayor Brown if it's a joke.
</P>
<P>
   He's fuming that he has to keep campaigning for another six
weeks, when by the divine right of kings, and the more divine piles
of campaign money, San Francisco should be his for four more years.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is gay. You may think this election has something to do
with gay issues. It does not. We're past that.
</P>
<P>
   One of Brown's billboards says, ``Re-elect the most pro-gay
mayor in America.'' Brown is not exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is just the way it ought to be in San Francisco, but
whoever wins the Dec. 14 runoff, we'll still have the most pro-gay
mayor in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hate Willie Brown,'' said Bryan Freedman, a software
engineer who is volunteering on Ammiano's grass-roots campaign.
``Willie Brown has been good to gays and good for gays. We just
don't think he's been a good mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   This race is about all the big and little things that drive
citizens and mayors crazy _ homelessness, public transit, high
rents, cozy deals with developers, decent jobs and clean streets.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sees a world-class city of grand style and parties, where
he's the master of ceremonies. Ammiano sees a San Francisco where
citizens suffer poor public transit, impoverished schools and jobs
that don't pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ammiano could make San Francisco a shining, affordable
city on a hill with social justice for all is another question.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman is one of hundreds of volunteers, most with zero
political experience, who just showed up to pass out leaflets,
watch polls and give out pens for Ammiano's stunning write-in
showing in this week's election.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano qualified for the runoff by getting about 25 percent of
the vote to Brown's 39 percent, with the expenditure of a few bucks
at Kinko's and a lot of shoe-leather over a mere three weeks of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Burke is another member of Ammiano's army, although the
word ``army'' doesn't fit a group of idealists who marched into the
runoff election on a kind of creative chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who hardly fit a radical image in her camel hair blazer,
said she just happened to be walking by Ammiano's headquarters last
weekend, and ``got drafted'' to hold an O in a line of people with
large letters spelling out Ammiano's last name. She will continue
working for Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   She said she saw the strangest sight Wednesday night, while
votes were still being counted and it was clear Ammiano was
upsetting Brown's gourmet apple cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking by Tom's closed headquarters, and people were
just staring into the darkened cafe,'' Burke said. ``I asked them
what they were doing, and they said, ``Can't we do something?' I
said, ``Not now.'''
</P>
<P>
   To the people of Birmingham, Hartford and Detroit: You may want
to know why citizens of the best place to live in America, as
declared by Money magazine, are dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Burke why so many San Franciscans don't respond
positively to the famous Reagan question: ``Are you better off now
than you were four years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask the people who aren't here anymore,'' she said. ``Ask the
people who can't afford to stay. Ask the people whose children
won't be able to live in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown once said that people who didn't make $50,000 a year
shouldn't be here. That was very hurtful to many of us. When my son
grows up, I want him to be able to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is a professor of creative writing at San Francisco State
University, and says she has students who live two to a bedroom and
work full-time at service jobs and still can't pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people come here? To be on the cutting edge. You can't
be on the cutting edge paying $3,000 a month for an apartment,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Ammiano insurgency is about declining expectations and
rising frustration in a city of exploding wealth. San Francisco is
a city where so many have gotten a second chance. Now there's no
chance for that, unless you have big money.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Lanza, Ammiano's long-time friend who lent him Josie's
Cabaret and Juice Joint as a campaign headquarters, came to San
Francisco 40 years ago and parked cars at the hungry i, where Woody
Allen and other comics got their start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, a kid could come here, find a place to live and
work his way up,'' said Lanza. ``Not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   To the people of Minneapolis, Dallas and Tuscaloosa: What do Tom
Ammiano, a left liberal former school teacher, and Jesse Ventura, a
libertarian former wrestler, have in common?
</P>
<P>
   They're both rebels who brought out voters sickened by big-money
politics as usual. They're both for gay rights, too.
</P>
<P>
   If your answer was a boa, you weren't paying attention. As I
said before, we're past that.

HEAVY-HANDED `INSIDER' A SMART, SMUG STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE INSIDER 
Directed by: Michael Mann 
Screenplay by: Eric Roth, Mann, based on Marie Brenner's Vanity
Fair article 
Starring: Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Diane
Venora, Philip Baker Hall, Lindsay Crouse, Debi Mazar, Stephen
Tobolowsky, Colm Feore, Bruce McGill, Gina Gershon, Michael Gambon,
Rip Torn, Lynne Thigpen 
Running time: 160 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is a big, dark juggernaut of a movie about a
big, dark juggernaut of a subject _ the man who blew the whistle on
the tobacco industry and the struggle to get his story on ``60
Minutes.'' It also shows how complicated muckraking has become
since ``All the President's Men.'' In fact, this second story
almost eclipses the first, and could have if its director, Michael
Mann, hadn't succumbed to some heavy-handedness. We know how after
stonewalling for decades, arrogant tobacco last year wound up
settling class action suits by attorneys general for $246 billion,
largely as a result of evidence revealed by a corporate insider,
researcher Jeffrey Wigand, played by Russel Crowe. Wigand's
testimony left tobacco with no real defense against his assertion
that tobacco companies knew they were in the addictive nicotine
delivery business.
</P>
<P>
   Although we feel the weight of big tobacco bearing down on
Wigand, depicted in sequences ranging from naked intimidation to
smear campaigns to sinister hints of dire fates, the real emotions
come boiling up when CBS corporate types lean on the hitherto
independent news gathering operation of ``60 Minutes,'' personified
by Al Pacino's producer, Lowell Bergman, the film's moral center.
The lawyers make ``60 Minutes'' compromise its tobacco expose by
yanking Wigand's interview on the grounds that CBS would be as
liable as Wigand if the company brought suit against him for
violating a confidentiality agreement. Berger, who prides himself
on never allowing a source to be hung out to dry, furiously and
righteously accuses the network of caving in to the bullying of the
Brown &AMP; Williamson tobacco company and ignoble fear that an
expensive lawsuit might drive the stock price down at a time when
CBS' owner was trying to sell the network to Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that news gathering operations are under attack.
Not being under attack probably means they're not doing their jobs
as well as they should be. But the question of how to deal with
attacks from within the walls is a provocative one that's still
being hashed out, and not just at CBS. It's far from settled. CBS
did not cover itself with glory by caving in and trimming Wigand's
damning interview. Predictably, other outlets ran what CBS would
not and Wigand's remarks were made public anyway. The film's
depiction of these events thus more or less ends triumphantly,
although the triumph is hollow and there are no clear-cut winners
and losers in the wake of Bergman's decision to Deep-Throat his own
organization to The New York Times on principle.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Michael Mann is not one to employ a stiletto when a
Louisville Slugger is at hand, and while his film is propulsive and
efficient, it's also a bit more aware of its own importance than
you want a film to seem. Mann's way of yanking the camera off the
face of this or that principal to photograph, say, the door of a
taxi from which Pacino exits, or a cup being placed in a saucer,
becomes a distracting mannerism. So does the cattle-prod music on
the soundtrack, which swells on cue with each dramatic moment. It
would have been daring in today's climate to rely on
understatement, but the events carry so much weight that you can't
help feeling that Mann didn't have to punch them up as much as he
does. The few instances of tobacco company thuggery, when they're
trying to unnerve Wigand, aren't nearly as scary as one brief scene
in his boss's office, where Michael Gambon never raises his voice,
but is scarily threatening with what he smoothly but communicates
between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, whose stature grows with every role, authoritatively
depicts a complicated man who's self-controlled most of the time,
but is just enough of a loose cannon to plausibly stiffen his
resistance when the bullying starts. Wisely, the screenplay makes
clear that he's flawed, and winningly honest enough to acknowledge
his flaws. He's convincing as a man in pain after his wife (Diane
Venora) cracks under the pressure and divorces him, taking their
two little girls. He's just as sympathetic in his anger at the
exploitative way in which he's turned into raw meat to feed a
high-powered news operation's need to break high-impact stories.
Doing the right thing cost Wigand heavily. Crowe's way of
internalizing Wigand's anguish makes us connect with him in ways
bypassed by the rest of the film's hammering style.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question of what obligations journalism incurs to its
subjects is slammed on the table in all its nettlesome complexity.
And if Crowe implodes compellingly, attaining stoic dignity in his
rueful realization that heroism can be costly, Pacino counters with
the wired decency and cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof intensity that he all
but reinvented on film over the last quarter-century. Christopher
Plummer is a huge plus, too, as a flamboyantly charismatic Mike
Wallace, well-intentioned but not impregnable to what he refers to
as realities, snatching what's left of his credibility from an
embarrassing pullback. Similarly, Philip Baker Hall contributes a
satisfyingly faceted performance as producer Don Hewitt, making us
feel a principled man's inner struggles. It's dramatically
convenient to tell the story from Bergman's point of view and have
Pacino's be the only voice raised indignantly against the dropping
of the interview. Wallace is known to have been angered by the
film's view that he didn't fight the excision.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the film does lay out in tabloid vividness is the glee
of the print media in castigating its traditional rival, TV.
Perhaps the most admirable thing about ``The Insider'' is that
despite its pile-driving style, it's never tempted into simplistic
absoutes. It not only gives us the conflicting forces at work on
the insider, but widens the scope of its inquiry from the morally
easy narking of the tobacco companies to the ethical pitfalls
nuzzling up against journalism's new bottom-line driven
imperatives. It's no accident that the film opens with Pacino being
driven blindfolded in Syria to an interview with a Hezbollah
kingpin. It's Mann's unsubtle way of making the point that even
though journalism can't always see where it's going, it sometimes
gets to the right places all the same. In ``The Insider,'' the good
guys aren't perfect. Neither is their institution. They're just
better than the bad guys. Perhaps, the powerful although ungainly
film says, that's about as good as we can expect in this
post-Watergate era.

NO MAGIC IN THESE LEPRECHAUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MAGICAL LEGEND OF THE LEPRECHAUNS 
Starring: Randy Quaid, Colm Meaney, Roger Daltry, Orla Brady,
Kieran Culkin, Caroline Carver, Whoopi Goldberg, Daniel Betts 
Executive produced by: Robert Halmi Sr. 
On: NBC 
Time: Part 1 airs Sunday at 9 p.m., part 2 airs Monday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Polish version is kielbasa, and the Portuguese have a spicy
invention called linguica. Bratwurst, Liverwurst, and Blutwurst all
hail from Germany, and Pepperoni is the dry Italian treat. But what
I would like to know is, is there a baloney that is solely
identified with Irish culture? Is there a very long, green
confection that is stuffed with too much fat and chunks of
leftovers from other sources? Because that would be the word I am
looking for to describe ``The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns,''
the two-part TV movie NBC has chosen to lead its November sweeps
brigade. What is the word for pungent, protracted, Irish baloney?
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me for not having a heart and for not getting teary-eyed
at the sight of the wee folk, with their Spock Jr. ears and their
little forest caps. In the two-part ``Magical Legend of the
Leprechauns,'' the supernatural tykes are actually a boring lot, a
collection of backward Irish stereotypes who appear to have taken
the express train from the Lucky Charms cereal factory to the local
pub. Colm Meaney's Seamus Muldoon, the head leprechaun, is the
movie's most inescapable cliche, a beer-chugging, blarney-talking
husband who bickers with the little woman when he's not up to
mischief with the boys. We've seen the likes of him and his quaint
cohorts far too many times before. If ``Leprechauns'' had tried to
reinvent the leprechaun world with pathos and originality, it might
have achieved the more beguiling modern fantasy found in other TV
epics from its producer, Robert Halmi Sr., most notably ``Merlin.''
</P>
<P>
   But cartoon cuteness and antics overwhelm ``The Magical Legend
of the Leprechauns,'' which airs Sunday at 9 and Monday at 8 on Ch.
7. Actually, the movie features two types of little people, the
earthy leprechauns and their enemies, the elitist fairies, who are
the royalty of all things diminutive and adorable. Faster than you
can say ``Romeo and Juliet,'' these two hostile civilizations erupt
into warfare when Muldoon's son, Mickey, falls in love with the
fairy princess, Jessica. Indeed, the writers of ``Leprechauns''
extend their Shakespeare parallel to embarrassing extremes, as the
star-crossed lovers swallow a potion that will make them appear
dead. Meanwhile, Muldoon has gathered up an army of leprechauns for
some ``Braveheart''-like battle and a few Riverdance pep rallies,
and the fairy king, played by a stiff Roger Daltrey, wanders
aimlessly through his castle as if aware that his character is
entirely expendable to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the special effects in ``Leprechauns'' are miraculous!
and spectacular! By now, we expect state-of-the-art visuals from
Halmi products, which also include ``Gulliver's Travels'' and
``Alice in Wonderland.'' ``Leprechauns'' has an elaborate plotline
involving human beings, and so it has many impressive effects
scenes in which the tiny folk are juxtaposed with the big people.
Plus, regardless of their irrelevance to the story, the movie
features a whirling twister and a tree that causes a lightning
shimmer when young lovers sleep by it. Oh, and Whoopi Goldberg is
onhand as for some morphing as the Grand Banshee, a wise,
all-seeing being who, like her Cheshire Cat in ``Alice in
Wonderland,'' likes to hover in the sky. Goldberg's attempt at an
Irish brogue, however, is less than spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The human story in ``Leprechauns'' is hackneyed, as well. Randy
Quaid plays an American businessman who has come to Ireland to
secretly buy up property for another Disneyland. But he falls in
love with the glorious green countryside and the fiesty girl
nextdoor, played by an Amanda Donohoe lookalike named Orla Brady.
He loves her, she loves him, she discovers his crass plan, they
fight. But then they must join forces to help their miniature
friends find peace and, well, I don't want to give the end away,
except to say that the writers stop borrowing from ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' and that, after making your way through four hours of
hokum and schlock, you won't find any gold in the bottom of this
crock.

HURRICANES AREN'T SWAYED BY SUITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The courtship of the University of Miami is over. The Hurricanes
were wined and dined by the Atlantic Coast Conference. Or at least
by certain members of that conference.
</P>
<P>
   They were told the future was brighter in the ACC than in the
Big East. They were told they would be more compatible with those
schools. They were told they could make more money.
</P>
<P>
   But what the ACC couldn't tell them was that it had a spot open
for them.
</P>
<P>
   And what the Big East has told them all through the summer and
right through the meeting of the conference presidents in
Philadelphia Tuesday was that Miami was an integral part of the Big
East. Without Miami, Big East football, conceived in 1991, would
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   So Miami did the right thing. It stayed with the league that
brought it out of the harsh and shrinking world of football as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes are not going anywhere. Big East football, with
what looks like a resurgence at Boston College and Pittsburgh, with
Virginia Tech on the cusp of a genuine run at the national
championship, and with everyone but hapless Rutgers showing signs
of life, will move into the next millennium as a solid eight-team
league.
</P>
<P>
   And if the people in the state of Connecticut move off the mark
and finally get some sort of stadium built in Hartford by the year
2003, UConn football will move into the ranks of Division 1A and
join the Big East as the ninth member.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Big East be the SEC? Of course not. The SEC has bigger
budgets, stadiums, and fan support.
</P>
<P>
   It won't even match the Big Ten in rivalries and tradition. But
with Miami headed back into the Top 10 neighborhood each year under
the guidance of Butch Davis, who has done a brilliant job of
resurrecting the Hurricanes; with Virginia Tech building its own
little dynasty in Blacksburg; and with teams such as Pitt and BC
becoming consistently competitive, the Big East does not have to
apologize for anything.
</P>
<P>
   All of this didn't just fall into place by accident. Big East
commissioner Mike Tranghese once again proved how good he is at
getting people at odds with one another back together.
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese worked through the spring and summer, talking to
school presidents and athletic directors, making sure Miami felt
wanted without feeling pressured.
</P>
<P>
   That's basically what this whole issue was about. Miami wanted
to be courted. For whatever reason, it seemed to feel
underappreciated, and when a faction of the ACC _ led by Florida
State and Georgia Tech _ made overtures, it listened.
</P>
<P>
   But moving to the ACC made no sense for Miami from a competitive
standpoint in either football or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes were and are better off contending with Virginia
Tech and Syracuse for the Big East's BCS bowl slot than they would
have been battling each year with Florida State for the ACC's spot.
</P>
<P>
   They were and are better off as part of a 13-team league in
basketball, contending for the title and NCAA slots with UConn, St.
John's, and Syracuse, than they would have been thrown into the ACC
with Duke and North Carolina dominating the scene as they have for
the past 30 years and will continue to do for the next 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East basketball league, with the addition of Virginia
Tech next season as a full member, will be a 14-team, two-division
league with a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
   It will send 12 of those teams to New York for the Big East
tournament and will, in any given year, place five, six, or even
seven of those teams in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was, is, and will be better off in the long run. The same
can be said for the Big East, and most of the credit for that
belongs to Tranghese, who has guided one conference, with two
separate agendas in basketball and football, back to not only
health but prosperity.

Shea to be shipped out?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   If Navy beats Rutgers Saturday the Knights are almost assured of
another winless season (they finish with Syracuse and Miami), the
second in Terry Shea's four years. And even though Rutgers athletic
director Bob Mulcahy has assured Shea of one more year, the
pressure to dump him will continue to increase. Giving Shea one
more year will serve no purpose, since it will be almost impossible
for him to recruit players and give them any assurances he will be
around past next year unless things turn around, and that is a
doubtful proposition at best. How bad are things at the State
University of New Jersey? When Temple quarterback Devin Scott was
voted co-Big East Player of the Week following his six-touchdown
effort in the Owls' 56-28 win over Rutgers last week, it marked the
fifth consecutive week a Rutgers opponent had been named Big East
Player of the Week . . . At Alabama, one Shaun is as good as
another. Or so it seems. With star running back Shaun Alexander
sidelined with an ankle injury, the Tide unveiled backup Shaun
Bahanon, who had 104 yards rushing and 2 TDs in the Tide's 35-14
win over Southern Miss . . . One of the reasons for Tennessee's
success the past two years has been its defense. Through seven
games this season, the Vols have yet to give up a rushing
touchdown. Compare that to the woeful defense in the Pac-10. The
conference has five teams that are 81st or lower (out of 114 teams)
in total defense, including Pac-10 co-leader Stanford, which is
114th this week.

   The Big Ten has had a team playing in the Rose Bowl every year
since 1946. But that streak could end this season. Unless Penn
State loses a game, the only shot at the Rose Bowl, which is part
of the BCS rotation, for a Big Ten team would be as an at-large
team. In order to do that, however, that team will need a minimum
of nine wins. Other than Penn State, only Wisconsin has seven wins,
with two to play. Unless Wisconsin beats Purdue Saturday or Penn
State loses, the Big Ten will have virtually no chance of sending a
team to Pasadena . . . Penn State's 9-0 start is the Lions' best
since 1994 . . . With six straight losses, LSU coach Gerry DiNardo
is on the endangered species list . . . One of the better coaching
jobs this season has been turned in by rookie coach Jack Bicknell
III, who has guided Louisiana Tech to a 6-2 record . . . Give
credit to Kansas State coach Bill Snyder. The Wildcats lost nearly
two dozen players from last year's team and are still 8-0 and vying
for the Big 12 title, if not the national championship. Snyder,
ever the perfectionist, is not satisfied. ``We just are not a real
consistent football team,'' he said. ``We are not consistent in our
play throughout the course of a 60-minute game.''

   BC's bowl bid

</P>
<P>
   With a week to rest before it hosts West Virginia next week, BC
can ponder its bowl possibilities. The bottom line seems to be that
the Eagles need at least one more win to assure themselves of a
postseason game. The intriguing possibility of the BC-Notre Dame
winner in two weeks getting a bid to the Insight.com Bowl in Tucson
is becoming more and more real . . . After an 0-2 start, Washington
has won five of its last six games and can go to the Rose Bowl if
it wins its last three games against Arizona, UCLA, and Washington
State. And that would be quite an accomplishment for first-year
coach Rick Neuheisel. One of the heroes for the Huskies in their
35-30 win over Stanford was quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo, who
piled up 509 yards in offense against the Cardinal. When Neuheisel
was at Colorado, he recruited Tuiasosopo _ as a safety.

OVERSTAFFED EGYPT AIR UNDER HEAVY SCRUTINY

 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ It is legendary for its vast bureaucracy, chronic
patronage, long delays, surly service, and bad white-bread
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   But don't insult EgyptAir to an Egyptian, even though many of
the elite prefer foreign carriers for their flights.
</P>
<P>
   Always intensely nationalistic, Egyptians are defensive these
days about a national carrier besieged by foreign news media
digging to find what caused Flight 990 to crash off Nantucket
Sunday, killing 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir vice president Mohammed Shahin seemed exasperated at a
news conference in Cairo Wednesday, saying, ``If it's not this you
ask, `What about this?' . . . Something did it. We all know
something did it. You are trying to push us to a corner. I wish we
knew. I wish we all knew.''
</P>
<P>
   While no cause for the crash has yet been determined, EgyptAir
is undergoing intense scrutiny as US investigators and journalists
interview airline staff and examine safety records.
</P>
<P>
   Digging deeper, investigators will find a national carrier with
a nearly impenetrable bureaucracy and a government with a penchant
for secrecy, two factors that could complicate their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir is one of the nation's largest employers with 18,000 on
staff _ for a carrier that has only 41 aircraft. That means there
are about 440 employees for every plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is spectacular overstaffing, one of the worst examples
of overstaffing in a public sector where overstaffing is the rule,
not the exception,'' said economist Max Goldenson, studying
transportation in Egypt as a government consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents in Cairo say the cost of EgyptAir's long-distance
flights, traditionally cheaper than large US and European carriers,
shot up in recent years. Its Oct. 31 list price for a Cairo-New
York round trip was $1,153 compared to TWA's $746. The price
increases have come without any upgrading of services and despite a
persistent reputation for long delays.
</P>
<P>
   An owner of a respected Cairo travel agency catering to
foreigners said that with EgyptAir, ``there are people who get paid
at the end of the month no matter how bad the service is, no matter
how long the delays are, how full the bookings are, or what the
maintenance record of the aircraft is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who've flown it pick up on that culture, and many vow
never to fly it again,'' said the owner, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Ennawawi, who has covered aviation for Al Ahram newspaper
for nearly 40 years, knows the carrier's history well _ the
resources the government put into it after the 1952 revolution
through ``the bad years'' in the 1970s, when poor management and an
aging fleet tarnished EgyptAir's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1981, when Mohammed Fahim Rayan became the airline's
chairman, the fleet has been modernized. A former chief engineer of
Egypt's air force, Rayan had a long association with President
Hosni Mubarak, highlighted by their joint efforts battling Israel
over the Suez Canal in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has largely succeeded in modernizing the fleet and taking
the company out of debt. It is at the point of turning a profit
now,'' Ennawawi said.
</P>
<P>
   On the privatization issue, Rayan has remained steadfast,
despite complaints by industry analysts that the airline's vast
government bureaucracy creates inefficiency and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ennawawi said Rayan needs to privatize the airline, a move
suggested by the World Bank. ``It would create competition and
force its pricing to come in line,'' Ennawawi said of
privatization. ``It would improve service, safety, efficiency, and
be good for the health of the carrier and the Egyptians who rely on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crash will hurt EgyptAir's reputation in the world, very
much. It is already having an immediate impact,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Early inquiries into EgyptAir have produced few surprises.
Maintenance records are solid, according to industry specialists.
Modifications to the Boeing 767-300 reverse thrusters, which were
pinpointed as the probable cause of a 1991 crash in Thailand, were
completed ahead of schedule, specialists note.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some signs are worrisome. The left engine reverse
thruster was deactivated on Oct. 28, just three days before the
Flight 990 crash because EgyptAir did not have the necessary spare
part to repair leakage of hydraulic fluid, according to EgyptAir
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Roshdy Zakaria, chief pilot for EgyptAir's 767 crews,
said he has turned down better paying jobs with airlines such as
Gulf Air _ mainly because of the pride of working for the national
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some problems, he said, but EgyptAir ``is a great
airline, and these attempts to question it in light of the crash
are unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the very few local journalists to offer muted criticism
of the airline after the crash has been Samir Ragab, a longtime
aviation writer who now edits the English-language Egyptian Gazette
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's editions, he wrote that the accident should prompt
the airline ``to carry out drastic changes and reshuffle. There are
high ranking officials in some sectors who have nothing new to give
and have kept the company from modern developments and
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this kind of criticism is a rarity in Egypt, a
country with news media that typically follow the government line
and very few watchdog groups looking over industry's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Tewfiq, 35, a member of the Cairene elite who has lived
abroad and regularly travels overseas, was asked how she felt about
EgyptAir's spotty reputation. She replied, ``May I offer you some
advice? Don't even ask Egyptians this question. They grow very
angry.''

A DECADE AFTER THE WALL, MISTRUST DIVIDES GERMANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ At dusk, Sebastian Pflugbeil sits in his study in the
gathering darkness. Turning the lights on is something of a luxury
for an academic who has been out of work for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Pflugbeil, a 52-year-old physicist, was one of the founders of
New Forum, a leader of the intelligentsia that inspired and gave
purpose to the popular uprising that brought down the Berlin Wall
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But today, sitting in his third-floor apartment in east Berlin,
he wonders whether the bloodless revolution he helped foster was
worth it. While it is true that those who lived in the former East
Germany now have the freedom to go anywhere and say anything they
want, without worrying about the Stasi, the dreaded secret police,
many feel like Pflugbeil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to travel anywhere, so the freedom to travel
means nothing, and no one in the government cares what I or anybody
else here say, so the freedom of speech means nothing,'' he says
ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   His disillusionment is shared by many in the former East Germany
a decade after the euphoria that greeted the literal collapse of
the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, and the figurative collapse of the
communist Soviet bloc throughout eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden collapse of the wall precipitated the breathtakingly
swift collapse of the Soviet bloc, ending almost overnight a nearly
half-century standoff between two superpowers with mutually hostile
political and economic ideologies, each armed with thousands of
nuclear weapons aimed at the other.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of that standoff was the Berlin Wall, a seemingly
immovable symbol of the confrontation between East and West. As
both the literal and figurative demarcation point between the Iron
Curtain and the free world, the wall was guarded by communist
sentries with orders to shoot to kill, invoked by democratic
leaders as a potent symbol, scaled by those desperate to get out,
used as fictional fodder by John LeCarre and many lesser espionage
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Spies were traded like currency across its expanse. More than
100 easterners died trying to breach it. And then, in the blink of
an eye, it was gone, its graffiti-stained chunks carted off as
souvenirs, the black-and-white world order it represented replaced
by a less predictable one. The West had won the Cold War, the
threat of nuclear war had receded, and former Soviet bloc countries
began the bumpy transition from one-party rule to democracy, from
communism to a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the process has been uneven: smoother in countries
like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, more difficult in
Bulgaria, Romania, and, especially, the Balkans, where wars have
raged for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's experience is unique. It was the only country divided
by the Iron Curtain. And it has shown that even in the country with
the most resources to facilitate change, the attitudes that are the
legacy of the Cold War are not unlike those from more conventional
wars. Vanquished and victors harbor resentment toward each other,
nurse grievances, and pine for the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the wall fell, there are still two Germanys.
Politically, financially, and culturally, there remains a yawning
gap between the 15.4 million who live in what used to be East
Germany and the 66 million who live in what was West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners, or Wessies, complain that the national debt has
tripled in 10 years, as the government has poured an average of
$100 billion a year into the east _ or well over $50,000 for each
person in the former East Germany. Many believe the $16 billion
austerity plan that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wants to push
through will hurt their standard of living, and mutter about
eastern laziness born of communist complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Easterners, or Ossies, say the new Germany is one in which they
hold second-class citizenship: 20 percent are unemployed, twice the
national average; they get paid 25 percent less than Wessies, and
some companies in the east, controlled by western interests, pay
Wessies twice as much to do the same job in the same factory; the
gap in pension benefits has narrowed, but Ossies still average
about 15 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   What really bothers many Ossies, however, is the condescending,
triumphalist attitude of Wessies: that they have saved the Ossies
from their terrible, brainwashed selves.
</P>
<P>
   Once guaranteed a job and an apartment, many of those who lived
in East Germany have found the uncertainties of a free market
economy unsettling. More than 1 million of them have left, most
moving west, where they figure they will get a better shake. A
recent survey found that only 29 percent of east Germans consider
democracy the best political system, while just over half said they
were happier living under the dictatorship of the German Democratic
Republic, or GDR.
</P>
<P>
   The cynicism of westerners may be more surprising. In July, four
universities published a joint survey of German teenagers and those
in their early 20s. Almost 20 percent of the young people surveyed
in West Berlin said they want the wall back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutual acceptance is clearly receding,'' the survey's authors
concluded. ``Prejudices on both sides are being reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of Berlin, Martin Brand, a 31-year-old
financial services manager, sits outside the Cafe Kranzler, shaking
his head. He is disillusioned, too, for different reasons. He
remembers when, as a college student, he danced jubilantly with
easterners as they poured through the wall 10 years ago. Looking
back, he underestimated their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``After university, I worked, briefly, in Dresden,'' he said,
referring to the capital of the eastern state of Saxony. ``There
was great resentment. I was defensive, saying we in the west were
sacrificing much for them. They did not want to hear it. They said
we were imposing everything on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints heard from Berlin to Leipzig, many
easterners acknowledge that life in general has improved. If some
find it hard to calculate gains in personal freedom, there are
tangible advances. In just a decade, life expectancy among
easterners has increased by two years, due largely to dramatic
drops in pollution and improvements in health care.

A CHEAP SPECTACLE BY THE SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 7, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred and eleven days after he denounced the Republican
Party as a roach-infested, unprincipled wreck with which he could
no longer be associated, US Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire came
crawling back on hands and knees, begging for the influential
committee chairmanship he coveted more than honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get out the fumigation equipment,'' Bob the
Exterminator Man had cried the day he bolted the GOP to pursue his
nutty presidential campaign in, first, the US Taxpayers Party, then
the Reform Party. Smith was trying more parties than a drunken
Dartmouth sophomore on Homecoming Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the GOP, the erratic-but-emphatic Granite State
solon dumped all over it: The platform is ``a fraud''; the party
stands for nothing; ``Maybe it's a party in the sense of wearing
hats and blowing whistles, but it's not a party that means
anything''; the party ``is more interested in winning elections
than in supporting the principles of the platform''; and ``We need
to clean out the pollsters and consultants and the spin doctors and
the bloated staffs who tell us what to say, how to say it, when to
say it, and how long to say it. The American people elected us.
Isn't it time we started thinking for ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking for himself was what sent the senator over the
rhetorical cliff that day. Thinking of himself was what brought him
crawling back. What happened in the interim?
</P>
<P>
   Several things. First, Smith's presidential ambitions _ never
more than a gleam in the eye of a high school teacher who'd lucked
out to get as far as he did _ crashed and burned on the rocks of
indifference and ridicule in his home state. His reelection
prospects two years hence are now problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the chairmanship of the influential Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee became unexpectedly vacant with the
death two weeks ago of Rhode Island's senior senator, John Chafee.
Under the Senate's seniority rules, Smith would have automatically
moved up to the chair, but his tirade on the Senate floor angered
many of his former GOP colleagues. They have had to put up with
many speeches from the long-winded New Hampshirite, many of them
blood-curdling lectures on abortion and the perfidy of women who
don't want a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Fond of charts, photos, a long schoolmaster's pointer, and his
own voice, Senator Smith has no causes dearer to him than opposing
abortion and gun control of any stripe. Unlike the gentlemanly
Chafee, a Yankee highly prized in the chamber for his courtly and
principled stands, Smith was opposed to many of the environmental
safeguards Chafee championed. Smith is a polluter-protector, when
it comes to determining who pays to clean up Superfund sites.
</P>
<P>
   On the scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters, Chafee
voted right 70 percent of the time, and Smith 36 percent. But the
alternative to Smith, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, was even worse,
with a pitiful 7 percent voting record in the eyes of the League.
Inhofe is considered so far in the tank to Big Oil that his stature
is measured with a dipstick.
</P>
<P>
   The choice left environmentalists glum. The committee plays a
huge role in cleaning up America's air and water. The Sierra Club's
Dan Weiss told The New York Times, ``It wouldn't be surprising to
see an environmental feeding frenzy launched by Mr. Smith, or
especially Mr. Inhofe.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chafee was an architect of environmental law, said Deb
Callahan of the League of Conservation voters, ``The next person is
going to use more of a wrecking ball approach.'' The wrecking ball
will be named Smith, after Trent Lott, the majority leader,
engineered the return of the prodigal to the fold.
</P>
<P>
   And ``fold'' is what Smith did. Do you still stand by your
criticisms, senator? ``Yes,'' replied the new chairman, all smiles,
totally obtuse when it came to acknowledging the hypocrisy of his
actions. One of the tenets of the US Senate, the Kra-Z-Glue that
holds it together, more or less, is that one senator does not
question the sincerity or motivation of a fellow, no matter how
lunk-headed you find him or her to be.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has bellowed mightily about his deep commitment to high
moral principle. But after this pathetic turnabout, one has to ask:
How deep? How high? When his supposedly principled departure from
the GOP ended with such an abrupt and undignified reversal?
Principle, my eye.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the week of Chafee's funeral that Smith came
weaseling back. Now, as a matter of custom, I normally cut a
wavering pol some slack. But it takes more slack than you can pack
onto a deep sea reel to allow Senator Smith to shake the hook on
this one. Let him rant about principle all he will, his
flipping-and-flopping, posturing-and-pretending, his honeyed words
about the demise of his dear departed colleague notwithstanding,
his crude and self-serving lunge for the gavel brands him as a
self-dealing pol of the lower orders.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of states would not tolerate such crass conduct. We'll
find out in 2002 if New Hampshire is among them. Honor is not rare
in politics, despite this cheap spectacle, and it is usually not
completely absent in even the most roguish pol. But where is the
redeeming thread of honor in this poltroonish example? You could
say this is New Hampshire's problem, but Smith's chairmanship puts
this principle-bender in charge of the very air we breathe, the
water we drink.
</P>
<P>
   Will Senator Smith be a stand-up guy when it comes to taming the
polluters? Or a willing co-conspirator? We've just seen that the
Big Bobber can turn on a dime when there's something for Bob in it.
Previously a back-bencher of little consequence, given to bloody
harangues about pregnant women and their bleak choices, he's now
thrust into a post of vast consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Senator, which principles will you be upholding this week? You
pretend to be an oak-hearted solon in the mold of Daniel Webster.
Let us hope, as well. But off your recent record, when push comes
to shove, yours is a heart of oaf.

DON'T FORGET RECIPE FOR THE TACK CLOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 7, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Well, I lost your recipe for a tack cloth, so I have to ask
for it again.
</P>
<P>
   ROY WALSH, New London, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. And the recipe, please: Take a cotton cloth (napkin, hanky or
heavy T-shirt). Dip the cloth in paint thinner, squeeze it almost
dry, and sprinkle on several drops of oil-based polyurethane
varnish, and knead until the varnish is evenly distributed. Store
it in an airtight container. It will pick up a lot of sanding dust.
When it gets dirty and untacky, rinse it out in paint thinner and
add more varnish. If after a period of storage it comes out stiff,
throw it away and make a new one. Or, for a dollar or so, buy one
in a hardware or paint store.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is 200 years old and has powder post beetles. What
can I do about them?
</P>
<P>
   JACK MURPHY, Marshfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can sit tight and see what happens; powder post beetles
and other wood-boring critters such as the old house borer tend to
come and go; sometimes they will attack furniture and other wood
members, then disappear. I must assume that you saw small holes in
the wood and possibly a fine powder coming out of the holes or
collecting on the floor or nearby. I also assume you contacted an
exterminator. In fact, that is your best bet. But to treat them
yourself, you can varnish or paint the wood (if possible or
practical), and/or apply an insecticide to the holes; an
insecticide such as a borax-based product, pyrethrin/silica arogel,
or synthetic pyrethroid. They are reasonably safe to use indoors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My varnished wood kitchen cabinets are still in great shape,
but are looking a little shabby. Actually, the frames are in good
shape, the doors and drawer fronts are what are shabby, but I don't
want to spend big bucks to fix them. How about painting just the
doors and door fronts? Or is that a silly idea?
</P>
<P>
   JOYCE COBB, Rockingham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. What you propose is a matter of personal taste, therefore no
one's darn business but your own. In fact, the handyman thinks it
is a great idea, in good taste, and who knows, you may be setting a
trend, although some furniture is a combination of the natural wood
look and a contrasting paint.
</P>
<P>
   First, choose a color. Some color ideas: white, bright red, or
black. If you opt for a high-gloss enamel, it will give a high-tech
look.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the doors and all hardware. Sand the doors and drawer
fronts by hand to reduce gloss and roughen the finish. Wash with a
strong solution of Spic and Span. Prime with a latex enamel
undercoater. Finish with two coats of a high-gloss, indoor-outdoor,
oil-based enamel or an eggshell-finish (neither flat nor shiny)
latex wall paint.
</P>
<P>
   As a final fix-up, consider replacing all the hinges and knobs
and handles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have strange gray discoloring of the vinyl floor around my
toilet, but no water. How can I clean it, and keep it from coming
back?
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM BENSON, Slidell, La.
</P>
<P>
   A. That grayish discoloring around the toilet is caused by
moisture, which is under the vinyl. Vinyl is notorious in
discoloring from moisture, and there is little you can do about it
because it is under the vinyl, except replace the vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   If the moisture under the vinyl is coming from a leak, the only
way to find out is to lift the toielt toilet (or have a plumber do
it) and replace the wax ring.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a leak in the toilet. Sometimes if you get a lot
of condensation of water vapor on the toilet bowl or anywhere else
on the toilet, this moisture drips down around the perimeter of the
toilet bowl, gets under the vinyl and causes the uncleanable
discoloration. If the water drips between vinyl and bowl, it might
get under the vinyl and not feel wet.
</P>
<P>
   To stop this condensation, keep the bathroom well ventilated.
Use the exhaust fan, if it is exhausting outdoors. If there is no
fan, install one so that it exhausts outdoors. Frequent use of such
a fan can keep the bathroom clearer of moisture. Or open the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My old soapstone sink is in bad shape, although it still
holds water and is good as a washing machine drain. How can I clean
it?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD GOGANIAN, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The only way to clean soapstone is to sand it. Well, you can
clean it with paint thinner to dissolve built-up soap and that sort
of guck. If it cleans up to your satisfaction, fine. But to really
clean it and restore it and get it looking as it did 100 years ago,
here is how to do it: When you sand, it will come out very light
gray or gray-green. Then apply a mix of one part boiled linseed oil
or mineral oil, and one part paint thinner. Apply lightly, wait 15
minutes, then rub thoroughly with your hands, and finally remove
excess oil with a dry cloth. It will come out black or dark green,
how it looked years ago. And you can apply the oil solution any
time you feel like it.

 BERLIN: ... health care.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irene Runge, a sociologist and founder of the Jewish Cultural
Center on Berlin's east side, said the complaints must be taken
with a grain of salt. She contends that chronic complaining is one
of the few things Ossies and Wessies have in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most things are better. The standard of living has improved,''
she said. ``But the moment it gets a little harder, people here
start crying, like they are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes too many westerners have been patronizing and
condescending, while too many easterners are oversensitive and
unnecessarily resentful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk different languages even though we speak the same
language,'' she said. ``We don't trust each other yet. Wessies
underestimate the knowledge and wisdom of Ossies. But it cuts both
ways. I was in a discussion recently when an older man said, `We
don't want Wessie professors coming to our university and telling
us what went wrong.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Runge believes disillusionment was born of unrealistic
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are most disappointed didn't expect the new Germany
to be corrupt and mean,'' she said. ``They thought Stasi would go
and be replaced with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that the Stasi has been replaced by a national
secret service that, while less brutal than the Stasi, is not
especially tolerant of dissent. The Stasi members themselves have
gone mostly unpunished, according to critics who say it is yet
another failing of the Wessies. Ossies were flabbergasted by the
inability of western judges and prosecutors to put no more than
eight former Stasi agents behind bars for the abuses committed
under the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ossies could almost accept the leniency shown former Stasi
agents if it was done in the spirit of reconciliation, but some,
like Falco Werkentin, deputy commissioner in charge of Stasi files
in Berlin, believe it was simply a case of ``Wessies know best''
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   While Werkentin and others argue that there can be no
reconciliation without justice, there are many who are now
expressing a nostalgia for the old East Germany, something dubbed
``Ostalgie.'' One example is a new coming-of-age film, ``The Eastie
Boys,'' which opened to enthusiastic audiences this month. Set in
1970s East Berlin, where its director, Leander Haussmann, grew up,
the film takes a lighthearted view of life behind the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not suffer every day,'' Haussmann says, defending his
film from critics who say it trivializes the suffering of
dissidents under the communist regime. ``The happiest years of my
life were spent in East Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more easterners seem willing to forgive the trespasses
of the former regime. While much has been made of the political
gains by neo-Nazis in the east, where the disaffected blame
foreigners for their woes, even more telling is the surging
popularity of the Party of Democratic Socialists, or PDS,
successors to the East German communist party.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed by westerners as the Roten Socken, or Red Sox, the PDS
was at first vilified also in the east as Soviet puppets, gaining
only 10 percent of the eastern vote in the first elections
following reunification. Now the PDS represents nearly 30 percent
of eastern voters, as a growing number of Ossies conclude that any
Ossie is better than someone from the two dominant western-based
parties, the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are perceived as the only authentic east German party,''
says Rainer Oschmann, a spokesman for the PDS.
</P>
<P>
   The PDS, billing itself as the only traditionally left-wing
party, has made gains at the expense of Schroeder's Social
Democrats, replacing them this year as the second-biggest political
party in the east, behind the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Angry, disillusioned easterners made history last year when they
provided the decisive change in voting patterns that chucked out
Helmut Kohl, ending the tenure of Germany's longest-serving
chancellor. Lingering frustration over reunification could make the
tenure of Kohl's successor the shortest.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin elections of October showed a dramatic east-west
divide. The PDS got 40 percent of the vote in the city's eastern
districts, but just 4 percent in the west of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The divide is seen not just in politics, but in attitudes and
behavior. A recent government survey found that while 72 percent of
west German women consider sexual harassment a problem in the
workplace, only 34 percent of east German women do.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, in a series of incidents that illustrated the
differing norms, Wessies complained that Ossie sunbathers were
being too indiscreet. In July, a group of elderly Wessies threw
sand at an 18-year-old east German girl sunbathing nude at a resort
in Prerow. In Bavaria, a Wessie was arrested for punching out an
Ossie who shed his clothes by a riverbank.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern city of Dresden, where the gray conformity of
communist apartment blocks has been replaced by pastel colors, some
say the changes have been just cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   But 23-year-old Birgit Albrecht, a student, is an optimist.
Sitting in a Dresden cafe, she said she believes the gap between
Ossie and Wessie, both financial and cultural, will narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides need to understand each other better, to actually
listen and hear what the other side is saying,'' she said, ``and
that will only come with time. The wall was up for 40 years. It
might take that long for it to really come down.''

COUPLE NEEDS TO IMPROVE MONEY-SAVING DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 7, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are both 44. We have four kids, aged nine,
six, and three-year-old twins. The older two are in private school,
and we are counting on all four going to college. The problem is
that we have no money-saving discipline; we spend whatever we have.
Because my husband was in graduate school for so long, we just
started saving for retirement in 1996. My husband's annual salary
is $160,000. He is in the biotech field and does have stock
options, but we cannot rely on them because of their low value.
Currently his 401(k) balance is $25,000 and he contributes the
maximum $10,000. His employer does not match any contributions, but
there is talk that they will next year. The 401(k) money is 40
percent in Fidelity Growth and Income, and 20 percent each in
Fidelity Contrafund, Equity-Income, and Value funds. I have about
$900 in a Galaxy Small-Cap fund account, $350 in Galaxy Corporate
Intermediate Bond, and $4,600 in Alliance Premier Growth funds, and
I add $2,000 a year to the final fund. Is our money in the right
places, and where should we put the money if we ever profit from my
husband's stock options? Because of the late start we had, how
bleak is our future with four college-bound kids?
</P>
<P>
   B.I., Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To start with your final question, the answer is that it's
fairly bleak. Putting the stock options aside, your husband's
401(k) would grow to $2,382,946 and your own savings plan to
$492,890 by the time you are both 65 years old, presuming 10
percent average annual growth. If inflation runs at a 3.5 average
over those 31 years, that $2,875,837 pool would have the buying
power of about $980,000 in today's dollars -- hardly a munificent
accumulation for people who are spending $148,000 a year now.
</P>
<P>
   The real answer isn't to focus on the stock options, which might
or might not eventually turn golden. Rather, it is to reverse that
lack of a money-saving discipline. I think I'd begin with a careful
analysis of how your money is being spent, and what changes might
be made to free up money for a supplemental savings plan. If you
can't establish a workable budget that you are comfortable with, it
would probably be worth the expense to go to a financial planner
who could help you establish one.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have established a budget, you could start a savings
plan which entails periodic automatic withdrawals from your
checking account -- nearly as painlessly as the contributions to
your husband's 401(k) that are being taken out. Most mutual fund
families offer these plans.
</P>
<P>
   Such vehicles would also be appropriate to begin saving for your
children's education. In your case, your income is sufficiently
high -- and likely to be higher still once your children are ready
for college, you would be best off building Uniform Gifts to Minors
Act and Educational IRA accounts, which will minimize the tax bite
on these growing accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As for your investments, like the great majority of people who
write to me, you have too much in domestic large-cap stocks. Within
your husbands 401(k), I suggest you scour the menu of options,
looking for small- and mid-cap funds as well as an international
offering and, if available, a health care sector fund. If you
divided 40 percent of the 401(k) savings among these categories,
you would have as much better portfolio balance.
</P>
<P>
   In your accounts, if you view these as retirement savings, I
suggest you lose the bond fund, diverting all of that money into
the small-cap fund account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I got a late start in saving for retirement. I am a
38-year-old single man and earn $70,000 a year. I have no debt
except a $110,000 mortgage with 23 years to go and a $10,000 auto
loan. I allot 17 percent of my salary to my 401(k) and my employer
matches 6 percent of it. I have a total of $38,600 in the account,
with $6,000 in Fidelity Diversified International fund, $15,700 in
Fidelity Magellan, and $17,200 in Fidelity Equity Index. The
distribution of contributions in 40 percent, 30 percent and 30
percent, respectively. I append a list of other investment options
within the plan. What do you think of my distribution elections?
What will be my financial status at age 65?
</P>
<P>
   P.M., Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Despite your late start, your substantial contributions to
your 401(k) and your company matches should put you in pretty good
shape at age 65 -- and especially if you continue to save the same
percentages of your income each time you get a raise. If
contributions remained at current levels for the next 27 years and
if you earned 10 percent average investment returns, you would
amass $2,545,395. If inflation ran at an average 3.5 percent during
that period, it would have the buying power of a whisker more than
$1 million in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not wild about your allocations, primarily because of
the similarities between the Equity Index and Magellan funds. Both
funds focus on a portfolio dominated by large-cap domestic stocks
that represent a blend of the growth and value ends of the
investment spectrum -- the first by charter, and the second because
its behemoth size substantially limits it from any other
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you divert about 20 percent of the total assets from
the Magellan account, and put that money, and 20 percent of ongoing
contributions, into Founders Growth, which focuses on large-cap
growth holdings. The options that represent the mid-cap and
small-cap sectors aren't particularly attractive to me -- neither
PBHG Growth nor Fidelity Small-Cap Selector funds has built an
impressive record. But I'd keep an eye on them, and if either seems
to show steady improvements, I'd be ready to build positions of
about 10 percent in either or both.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the only further change I would make is to switch
the balance of the Magellan account to Fidelity Growth and Income,
and also switching the remaining 10 percent of your contributions
there as well. Although the two funds have remarkably similar
records over five-year and 10-year periods, I'd make this change on
the basis that Growth and Income, with $43 bi8llion in assets, is
able to be a bit nimbler than the giant Magellan, which must find
investment vehicles for $122 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a professional, married, age 48 and sole provider of the
household income. I average earnings of $90,000 to $120,000. My
only debt is a mortgage with a $79,000 balance, on a house worth
$300,000. I have $50,000 in savings, but have no investments or
retirement plan except Social Security, which I estimate will be
around $1,200 a month at age 65. I am self-employed. What do you
recommend that I do so I can be able to retire at age 65?
</P>
<P>
   M.L., Phoenix
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In a few words, save like mad. The best vehicles for you to
use would probably be a Keogh plan or a SEP-IRA account, which
would allow you to save from 13 percent to 15 percent of your
earned income on a tax-deferred basis. But I wouldn't stop there.
If you set a target of saving at least $20,000 a year, more than 25
percent of it would have to go either into taxable accounts or
variable annuities. But if you began by putting half your savings
into retirement accounts and achieved average 10 percent portfolio
growth over 17 years, a $20,000-a-year investment schedule would
take you nearly to $1 million -- a total of $974,221, according to
the calculator.
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably want to consult a financial planner to determine
how to get the best tax advantages that are available to you. Once
you have determined the various kinds of saving accounts you will
use, I suggest an overall portfolio with 50 percent in domestic
large-cap stocks, probably dominated by a Standard and Poor's 500
Index fund, with the balance spread about evenly among mid-cap,
small-cap, international, and health care funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think you can reach the $20,000 target, I suggest
you go over your budget carefully and see what the level is which
you can save each month with confidence that you won't miss a
payment. Then, if things improve, increase it. The point is to
start with a reasonable number so you dont get into the habit of
skipping payments.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, take this very seriously -- you're starting quite late,
and it will take a lot of discipline to build a satisfactory
account.

EUROPEAN HORSES STRUGGLE AT GULFSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Mick Kinane, the Irish jockey, was in a
windbreaker. The Godolphin crowd was wearing sweaters, Godolphin
blue sweaters, of course. Journalists poking around the wire fence
surrounding the quarantine barns at the far end of the Gulfstream
Park backstretch were bundled up, too. British bookmakers, looking
for hot news, also were feeling chill breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee was in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Dettori, the Italian jockey, was still feeling the heat
from his ride aboard Swain last year in The Classic but Dettori,
the contract rider for Godolphin, also was dressed against the cool
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Dettori was just in from Australia, where Godolphin's Central
Park had finished a close second in the Melbourne Cup and where
Dettori had also been heavily criticized for a ride Down Under in
another stakes race (the trainer of Dettori's mount vociferously
complained that he had told his jockey to take the horse back in a
large field; Dettori had him on the lead).
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give me great pleasure to win a race here this
year,'' said Dettori, who finally admitted that he had blundered by
whipping Swain lefthanded so much in the stretch run of the $5
million race at Churchill Downs that his horse ended up on the
outside fence, finishing third by three-quarters of a length when
he should have have won. ``I was criticized last year and it took
me six months to get over it. But I accepted it and I'm a stronger
man for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, the seasons of most European
jockeys end in November when for the most part flat racing ends,
and Dettori had to listen and stew over the criticism of his ride
for months. ``The only person who had a kind word for me was
(Godolphin owner) Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum,'' said Dettori. ``He
called me the next day and said, `We'll get them next time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But in Florida? The Florida hotter than the criticism of
Dettori's ride aboard Swain?
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we have no excuse,'' said Kinane. ``We've brought
our weather along with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. But the air in South Florida has been cool (for
Florida) and dry _ that detestable Florida humidity gone _ _ and
the European contingent, always the key in so many Breeders' Cup
races, is confident it can break its embarrassing streak in
Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   European horses have been 0 for 28 in the two Breeders' Cups at
Gulfstream, and heat and humidity have been the quick-and-easy
culprits for the crowd from Ireland, England, and France. The
Europeans horses already have grown their winter coats in the cool
autumn air at Newmarket, Chantilly, or Ballydoyle, and, once off
the plane from Europe, they have been greeted by blasts from the
furnace of South Florida, air even hotter than they've felt in
summers in England, France, or Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Kinane, ``maybe the horses that we brought over to
Florida just weren't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, American racing fans can hearken back to the 1989 Cup
races, the first at Gulfstream, when Zilzal was sent off at
even-money in The Mile on the turf. But Zilzal stepped onto the
Gulfstream track looking like he he had just stepped out of a car
wash (``Zilzal was sweating profusely in warm weather,'' the Daily
Racing Form chart would note later, long after many millions of
dollars had wilted along with the horse) and faded to a miserable
sixth under aging English jockey legend, Walter Swinburn. Indeed,
Swinburn looked as wilted as his horse.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the Breeders' Cup returned to Miami and this
time it was Arazi who symbolized the futility of the entire
European effort. The wunderkind was sent off at 3-2 odds in The
Mile (again), the overwhelming favorite, but he, too, was within
easy striking distance at the top of the stretch when he wilted and
finished a dismal 11th, out of 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Susu) appears fine,'' Susu's trainer Michael Stoute said
yesteday; Stoute was the trainer of the overheated Zilzal back in
1989. ``This is much more pleasant. They are much more comfortable
when they're cool.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before the cooler weather arrived in Miami, Gulfstream
officials tried a new approach to cooling off the Europeans. First,
the US Department of Agriculture released the European horses from
the tight quarters of the quarantine barn in a day, rather than the
usual two. Next, Gulfstream installed fans and cooling mists in the
barns of the European horses and finally they all were given an
empty space between stalls and moved to the north side of the
barns, away from the afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   So the British booksmakers kept their eyes open Thursday, then
phoned the latest tidbits to London and back came the odds. ``Will
we or won't we?'' is the proposition from Rob Hartnett of Tote, one
of the bookmakers. ``Euro Glory is 4-to-6 odds, while Euro Gloom is
5-to-4 odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro Glory?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that a European horse will win at least one of the eight
Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Euro Gloom?
</P>
<P>
   Self-explanantory.
</P>
<P>
   David Hood of William Hill, another British bookmaker, quoted
odds of 4-to-5 that no European horse will win a race, 6-to-4 for
one winner, 5-to-1 for two winners, and 20-to-1 for three winners.
Coral, another bookmaking firm, had 11-8 odds for both no winners
and one winner, 3-to-1 for two winners, 14-to-1 for three winners,
25-to-1 for four winners, and 40-to-1 for the Empire to rise again
. . . er, five winners or more.
</P>
<P>
   But if the early morning temperatures in the 50s and humidity in
the tolerable 60-to-70 percent range are reason for hope, the
presence of Daylami and Aidan O'Brien is even more cause for
optimism. Daylami, the Godolphin superstar, will be the favorite in
The Turf and virtually all questions about his horrible performance
in the Arc de Triomphe at Longchamps a month ago _ when he finished
ninth, 23 lengths back _ have been wiped away by his near-brilliant
appearance during workouts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The going was like a bog,'' said Simon Crisford, the Godolphin
racing manager, of the extremely wet and deep conditions in Paris
for the Arc. ``The conditions were very much against us that day.
This horse is showing all the right signs. If he can reproduce the
kind of form he showed in the summer, he will be hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   All the European horses he's riding ``prefer firm ground,'' said
Dettori, and Gulfstream officials expect their water-logged turf
course to be ``good'' by Saturday's races. ``I think the gray horse
(Daylami) is probably my best chance, but it's the end of our
season and we're asking them for `just one more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The other major cause of optimism for the Europeans is O'Brien,
the 30-year-old Irish trainer who has taken the mantle from the
greatest Irish trainer of them all, Vincent O'Brien, and in a few
years developed into perhaps Europe's best trainer. ``One is a
legend,'' said Kinane of the two O'Briens, who are not related,
``and the other is working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are so many similarities between the two besides their
name. Vincent O'Brien was backed by the money of Robert Sangster,
whose untold millions bought many American-bred blue-blooded
yearlings. Each was meticulous for detail, worked incessantly and
success followed upon success. Aidan O'Brien, meanwhile, is backed
by the millions of the consortium of Michael Tabor, Mrs. John
Magnier, and the Coolmore racing operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, is that a setup there, it is,'' said Kinane of the
Ballydoyle ``yard'' (training facility). ``It's a piece of heaven
there in County Tip (Tipperary). The whole area there _ they call
it `The Golden Veil' _ is just perfect for racehorses. And it's
such a picturesque spot.''
</P>
<P>
   So much the same, the O'Briens. For it was at Ballydoyle that
Vincent O'Brien developed The Minstrel, one of the great grass
horses of the last generation, and so many more. And now it is at
Ballydoyle (the nearest cities faraway Cork or Limerick) that Aidan
O'Brien has made the transition from training steeplechase horses
to flat racing as Vincent O'Brien has phased himself out of racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vincent looked all over Ireland for his `yard' and Vincent is
the one who found Ballydoyle,'' said Kinane. ``Then John Magnier
took it over from Vincent and has developed it big-time in recent
years . . . added more land to it, added more gallops, added more
facilities. It's such a wonderful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Aidan O'Brien is already known as a ``maestro'' of training and
so fitting that three of the horses he brought here are named Bach,
Brahms, and Stravinsky. But, said Kinane, he is not temperamental,
``but a man who is always working, a workaholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent O'Brien won with his first (and only) Breeders' Cup
horse, Royal Academy, in 1990. Aidan O'Brien ran sixth in last
year's Mile with his first entrant, Second Empire, who checked
sharply going into the first turn. O'Brien has two horses, Brahms
and Mull of Kintyre, in the Juvenile (Arazi is the only European,
of 23, to win the Juvenile), Warrior Queen in the Juvenile Fillies,
and his big horse, Stravinsky, in the Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, all four of O'Brien's horses are running on dirt, and not
grass, as the Irishman tries to beat the Americans at the
Americans' game. Stravinsky would have been highly regarded in The
Mile on grass but the Tabor-Magnier-Coolmore group sees a huge
increase in Stravinsky's stallion value if he can win on the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gulfstream Park does not look as fearsome to these
Europeans as it has proved to the 28 European horses of the past.
Indeed, when Kinane _ who won the 1990 Belmont Stakes with Go'N'Go,
was asked which is his favorite American track to ride, he gave a
most-Irish reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can ride a winner (Saturday),'' said Kinane, ``it'll be
Gulfstream.''

it has the answer. As its name suggests, the Alibi Agency is

anything from false phone numbers, bogus conference invitations,

   IRAN-TRIAL _ TEHRAN. Iran _ The judge kept up his grilling until
young college student Ali Abbas Nemati was answering though his
tears. ``Aren't you sorry for what you've done,'' the judge chided
the student, who stood in front of a row seats filled with turbaned
mullahs from Iran's religious establishment. Nemati had not
committed murder or sedition. He was not a radical newspaper editor
or reformist politician. He was a scared playwright, pleading his
loyalty to Islam and denying charges that his play about a Muslim
holy figure was an insult. Nemati was sentenced to three years in
jail this week (Tuesday) in the latest case of Iran's religious
conservatives flexing their muscle. As they try to stave off
growing calls for reform, the conservatives are targeting writers
as well as their political opponents. The case illustrates the
limitations ? sometimes highly ambiguous ? faced by Iranian
writers. But, the reformers say things are improving and even site
Nemati's case as progress because it was handled in the courts and
not the streets. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTO.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ You ever get mad at your boss?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question Ben Coates was asking Thursday after he was
widely criticized for his comments following the Patriots' 27-3 win
over the Arizona Cardinals Sunday in a game where he was more
difficult to find than the Loch Ness monster.
</P>
<P>
   Coates was upset that he's seen the ball less this year than the
teammates of Lloyd B. Free used to. A five-time Pro Bowl tight end,
Coates has only 16 catches, 17 fewer than a year ago at this time,
and well below the pace that had brought him 458 receptions in
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   For Coates, this change in his job description has been
difficult to swallow, especially when his boss keeps saying
nothing's different. Coach Pete Carroll insisted again Thursday,
``We haven't changed our thoughts. Our tight end is a factor in our
offense. He's one of our key guys. The fact that the numbers aren't
there to support that is a concern to us because of the fact the
numbers aren't there. But I don't see our tight end playing any
different than we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, he's not looking, because Coates has spent more
time being kept in to block on the backside on third down than at
any time in his career. At 6 feet 5 inches, 245 pounds, Coates can
help with that well enough, but at the moment only five tight ends
in history have more receptions, and anyone with a memory longer
than a year can recall how he has made his bones in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't by blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Coates has made five straight trips to the Pro Bowl and earns
more than $2 million a year, because when the Patriots needed a
tough catch over the years, he made it. Not always, but most
always. Another 68 such catches and he will pass Kellen Winslow,
who is second on the all-time list of tight ends with 541
receptions, and that is a point of honor with him. It is important,
even to a guy for whom numbers beyond his contract and the win
column have always seemed less than important.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers were never an obsession with Coates even in 1994, when
he set an NFL record for his position with 96 receptions. But he is
closing in on the kind of records that can take a man to the Hall
of Fame, so it is difficult at age 30 to see his production
suddenly slipping when he knows he has only a few years left to
make his case for football immortality.
</P>
<P>
   So last Sunday, a frustrated worker unhappy with what he's been
given to do, blasted his bosses. He said he was unhappy not getting
the ball and if this continued, he wanted to work elsewhere. He
even said he might go home to North Carolina and not come back, a
statement even he laughed about Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' Coates said. ``I got about 900,000 reasons to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he does, because he'll earn at least that much the second
half of this season, catches or no catches. He will be paid that
kind of money because over the years he's made the catches. Earned
it not only for catching 474 passes and taking them for 5,285 yards
and scoring 50 touchdowns, but also for making the big catches that
kept so many drives alive and won so many games, like the one
against the Giants in 1996 with three fourth-quarter receptions
capped by the winning score that put New England on the road to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he has been the antithesis of the selfish
athlete his whole career, having played time and again on ankles
and knees that would have kept most players on the sideline for
weeks. He played most of one season, in fact, on two ankles swollen
the size of oranges and colored like plums. He didn't complain. He
played.
</P>
<P>
   But the public _ and sometimes his employers _ have short
memories, Coates thinks. Despite all he has done, he made one
statement one afternoon and has been ripped for being selfish by
people who probably have done more complaining at their desk or in
their garage or up on the roof or with a paint brush in their hands
in a week than Coates has his entire working life.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that bothered Coates more this week than his
team's choice not to put him in position to catch passes last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke out of frustration,'' Coates acknowledged. ``I was a
little hot-headed at the time and said some things it would have
been better not to say, especially after we just won a game. But
don't all these people criticizing me complain at their work?
That's an everyday thing. It don't mean you want the company to go
broke or not be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older you know you've only got so many years to win
a Super Bowl and get to the numbers people will remember. I think I
can do more. I know I can do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to do more, last time I checked, was not an indictable
offense. It's an admirable one. Does Coates now wish he'd kept his
complaints to himself? Perhaps, but he also knows that is how he
felt that day and how he still feels about the way he's being used.
Or not used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what was on my mind and I still feel the same way, but
I got over it,'' Coates said. ``It just doesn't feel like I'm doing
anything to contribute to our winning and I believe I can. I still
think I'm some guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a reference to a remark Carroll made on the day
Coates's comments became public. A remark that may be illustrative
of the chasm between the two and Carroll's lack of understanding
about what makes some of his best players tick.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was asked about Coates's criticisms and said his team
was not going to mold its offense to ensure getting the ball to
``some guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some guy? Ben Coates has not been some guy since his third
season in Foxborough. Since then he's usually been The Guy. It's a
role he still believes he can play but to refer to a five-time Pro
Bowler as ``some guy,'' is to show a lack of understanding of who
Coates has been for so long here.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say Coates's timing was wise. Even he lamented it
Thursday. But to act like it is unfathomable why a once highly
productive player would be upset about fading into the woodwork is
not only unfair, it is disingenuous on the parts of those hollering
at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's frustrated,'' Carroll said Thursday. ``There's no
mystery here. He took an opportunity to speak out about it. It
doesn't go along with what team thoughts are all about, the team
approach, and that's why we're upset about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, fine. But know this: There are still plenty of people in
the Patriots locker room who believe the ultimate team guy _ Sam
Gash _ was driven out of town by Carroll, who they feel made a
decision that had nothing to do with team.
</P>
<P>
   They feel the same way about the dumping of Willie Clay two days
before training camp. As Chris Carter's play has made clear to many
in New England's locker room, that wasn't a decision based on
``team thoughts'' either. It was personal, they believe.
</P>
<P>
   Just like what Ben Coates had to say last Sunday.

FOX HOPING TO TIP SCALE WITH BASS TOURNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On an autumn weekend that finds most outdoorsfolks outdoors, the
Fox television network is rolling the dice on the chances that it
can keep lots of them very much indoors sitting on their couches.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, tournament fishing will be telecast live,
right in the middle of one of the busiest sports hours of the
weekend _ 2:30 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The event is the Ranger Millenium M1 Bass Tournament at Cypress
Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla., featuring 10 professional bass
anglers competing in the finals for the richest purse _ $3.6
million _ in the history of tournament fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 55 million people who call themselves anglers,''
says Fox producer Jeff Gowen. ``Will fishermen actually watch
people fish? That is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, says Fox, 90 minutes of live fishing is a big gamble
_ at least $500,000 in production costs by the Chicago-based
Intersport, about the same as producing an NFL game. The payoff?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just don't know,'' says Gowen, referring to the
Monday morning ritual of the television business _ checking the
weekend ratings. ``If we get a 1 rating, we'll get some
congratulations. If we get a 2, there'll be some shoulder
shrugging. If it's a 3, some eyebrows will raise. But if we get a 4
share, there will be meetings at all four networks on Monday.
Nobody knew what would happen with Regis Philbin's `Do You Want to
be a Millionaire?' either.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 3 percent of TV households must tune in to make the show a
success, according to Fox advertisers. If that happens, all
involved agree that there will be more competitive fishing on TV.
</P>
<P>
   While the fishing show will be weaved together something like a
golf tournament, with a mixing of live action blended with taped
coverage of earlier holes, the show's real complexity is its plan
for getting close to each angler.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 pros, finalists of a four-day tournament, will be spread
out on five lakes in the Cypress Gardens area. Each contestant will
be in his own boat with a camera boat following, taping every move.
Anglers will explain their strategy for working whatever area
they've chosen to fish.
</P>
<P>
   In a catch-and-release tournament, anglers catch, weigh, and
eventually release the fish. They are working on an aggregate
weight total with a clock running down toward a finish. The
pressure of the clock, combined with a big purse for the winner,
will be part of the mix Fox is betting will make compelling TV.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the alloted time, an angler might boat one last
fish, then be forced to hit speeds of 60 miles per hour to get to
the final weigh-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of emotion,'' Gowen said. ``It may be trendy to
be cool on TV, but you'll see guys kissing their fish, their lure .
. . and if (an angler) loses a 5- or 6-pound bass in a tournament,
there can be a lot of emotion. This is a proactive hunt, a
strategic battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning angler will win at least $400,000 and up to $1
million with various bonuses _ prize money about four times that of
an average tournament on the Bass Masters seasonal tour.
</P>
<P>
   All the anglers will wear wireless cameras and stay in touch
with Fox on-air anchors Joe Buck and Bob Brenly, announcers best
known for baseball coverage. Veteran tournament angler, Forrest L.
Wood from Arkansas, will act as analyst in a presentation, says
Gowen, that will closely resemble a golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference is that unlike golf tournaments, bass fishing
has an element of motor sports, with anglers speeding around in
high-powered boats, each one a logo-bearing billboard for likes of
Timex, Coca-Cola, Fuji, or Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the high hopes for this show is a survey indicating
that 55 million Americans consider themselves anglers. Of these,
there are 20 million freshwater bass anglers _ about twice the
number of golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing contributes about $108 billion to the US economy, and
recreational fishing accounts for 1.2 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the spectacle, producers of this show hope viewers
will feel an intimacy with the anglers that few other sports
afford. ``It takes an act of God to get a football coach to wear a
mike,'' says Buck. ``But with these anglers talking strategy, (the
viewer) will get involved and learn as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament started Thursday, and by Sunday's show, Fox will
have enough tape, Gowen hopes, to fill in dry spots should biteless
moments occur. The job will be to knit it all together in a
production effort that involves 100 staffers and 40 microwave
systems.
</P>
<P>
   As anglers near the finish gun, viewers will have a rough idea
of each angler's total, but not until the last weigh-in will the
final score be known. That bit of ceremony, which could keep
viewers at their sets until the last commercial, will be
``meticulously rehearsed,'' says Gowen, in order to extract the
highest drama.
</P>
<P>
   Is more of this coming? According to Operation Bass spokesman
Brian Seyner, the interest in tournament fishing has grown wildly
in the last decade, and now pushes numbers that begin to look like
those for NASCAR racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something different, a whole different experience,'' he
said. ``And it's also something that almost everybody can relate to
and feel a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Seyner said that a walleye tournament is being planned, and that
his organization is talking about saltwater tournaments as well.
</P>
<P>
   Will fishing play on TV? Obviously some people think the odds
are good enough to try. ``Fox has a history of firsts,'' said
company spokesman Lou D'Ermilio, ``like a hockey puck that glows.
And we're willing to take chances.''

A WORTHIER BATTLE FOR PARENTS OF SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abandoned by a president and a Congress too cowardly to call for
gun control, the parents of the victims of school shootings are in
a petty, pointless, and ultimately fruitless battle to escape their
sadness. They are suing the parents of the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of victims are suing the parents of killers in
Littleton, Colo., West Paducah, Ky., Pearl, Miss., and Jonesboro,
Ark. There is even a lawsuit in Springfield, Ore., that goes after
the estate of the parents of Kip Kinkel, even though they were
killed in Kinkel's rampage. One lawsuit states Kinkel's parents
should never have given Kinkel a firearm ``when they knew or should
have known that Kip Kinkel was disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits say the parents knew enough to stop the tragedy.
Didn't they see the guns? The bombs? The knives? The violent video
games and letters? The pornography? The swastikas?
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask us if we blame the parents?'' said Michael Shoels,
father of Isaiah Shoels, who was killed in Littleton. ``Who else do
we blame? I taught my son right from wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They raised a monster,'' said Gwen Hadley, mother of Nicole
Hadley, who was killed by Michael Carneal in West Paducah.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot blame the parents of the victims for legally going
after the throats of the other parents. They are operating in a
national vacuum, with Clinton and Congress still paralyzed, six
months after Littleton, over relatively minor gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has said how demonizing and financially destroying
the parents of the killers solves anything. Geoffrey Fiegler, the
attorney who represents two families who are suing the parents of
Littleton killers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, said, ``I find it
impossible to believe that those parents fulfilled a normal
parent's responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a pompous statement asks the obvious question: What is
``normal'' responsibility? Anyone who knows anything about
difficult adolescents knows how hard this is to define.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to sniff out bad parents in cases of abuse and
abject neglect. But holding parents legally responsible for knowing
precisely the moment their child is about to smoke a joint,
shoplift a dress, download X-rated Web pages, or explode upon the
world, particularly in a country that depicts explosions as
entertainment, is a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   There is another way for the families and the rest of us to to
channel our grief. In Dunblane, Scotland, the families of the 16
young schoolchildren who were gunned down in 1996 became outspoken
advocates of banning handguns in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Those parents did not wait for weak-kneed leaders to come to
their rescue. They were not intimidated by the gun lobby or their
supporters in Parliament. They put their faces on posters, and
advertisements. They supported the Snowdrop Petition, which
collected 750,000 signatures calling for a handgun ban.
</P>
<P>
   They criticized government reports and procedings that
threatened to avoid gun control. In mid-1996, when a government
committee rejected a sweeping ban on handguns, John Crozier, who
lost a 5-year-old daughter in the massacre, said, ``This report and
its findings are a disgrace to our Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   When Britain passed a ban, but excluded .22 caliber guns from
it, the parents said, ``This is a compromise. It will result in the
deaths of more innocent people. It is not acceptable to us. It
should not be acceptable to the people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not acceptable until the parents helped beat the
government down into a full ban, including .22 caliber weapons.
There were no lawsuits on the estate of gunman Thomas Hamilton, who
killed himself after the massacre. Kenny Ross, who lost his
daughter Joanna, said, ``We don't think about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the parents do think about Hamilton, but not enough to
cloud their vision. Last year, after the complete ban went into
effect, Charlie Clydesdale, who lost his daughter Victoria, said,
``Getting everything done that we set out to acheive about handguns
in the first year was great. It makes us feel a bit more assured,
although sometimes I can't help wondering if we have done enough. I
still blame myself for Victoria's death, asking myself if I could
have done more. A policeman once told me that even if I'd been with
Victoria every second I couldn't have saved her from what happened
and that helped.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, it will be very difficult to prove that
the parents of Klebold, Harris, Carneal, and the rest of the
schoolyard killers had done enough. Even if they had been with
their boys for ``every second,'' a laughable proposition for anyone
who has tried to keep a flow chart on even ``perfect'' teenagers,
they could not have been able to stop what happened.
</P>
<P>
   One can still hope that instead of pursuing the law to a petty
and pointless end, the families of victims could unite to make a
point. Then, they might be more assured that their children's lives
were not lost in vain. In Scotland, the families of the victims won
because they had a point no one could deny. The point, as Crozier
said, was, ``My daughter's right to live is more important than
anybody's right to shoot a gun.''

MEDICAL SOCIETY FACES DEBATE ON PRESTIGIOUS JOURNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To some of Boston's most prominent doctors, a debate to
occur Friday and Saturday at the semiannual meeting of the
Massachusetts Medical Society is nothing less than a struggle for
the organization's soul.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, they say, is the luster of the medical society's crown
jewel, the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial report circulating among the 500 members of the
society's House of Delegates argues that the group needs to be more
entrepreneurial to maintain the competitiveness of its enviable
publishing franchise, anchored by the New England Journal, in the
uncertain Internet Age.
</P>
<P>
   The report also proposes tightening the medical society's
control over the journal's editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes that the society's committee on publications
``review and approve all editors, hired or appointed, and their
editorial boards.'' Until now, such appointments have been the
prerogative of the Journal's editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   The entry of new Internet publishers of medical information in
the marketplace testifies ``to a change in in the competitive rules
of the game, and our future has become, to no small degree, more
uncertain as a result,'' says the report, authored by the chairman
of the society's committee on publications, Dr. Ronald Arky.
</P>
<P>
   The Arky report is widely viewed as representing the position of
the society's top leaders and staffers.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership's views on the governance of the New England
Journal and the expansion into new publishing ventures are being
sharply challenged by many within the medical society, led by the
Suffolk District Medical Society, an arm of the statewide group.
The roiling dispute has plunged the 218-year-old medical society
into what Dr. Leonard J. Morse, a former president, called a
``cyclone of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a divide that is not really bridgeable, between people
at the New England Journal of Medicine who are for academic freedom
of thought and independence and those at the Medical Society, who
think the best way to serve members is to have a larger budget,''
said one involved doctor, who spoke only if he could remain
unnamed.
</P>
<P>
   The strains led in July to the firing of Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer
as editor in chief of the New England Journal over Kassirer's
objections to using the journal's prestige to give more loft to new
publications.
</P>
<P>
   This month, questions emerged about the society's dealings with
an Internet publisher, HealthGate, founded by an influential
medical society official, Dr. Barry Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a lawyer representing Manuel threatened a libel suit
against an Ohio State University medical professor, Dr. John M.
Stang, for circulating to 316 medical colleagues around the nation
an e-mail message defending Kassirer and the New England Journal
and citing news accounts of HealthGate's dealings with the
Massachusetts Medical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was merely trying to affirm a mentor and a journal that I
treasure. I felt it was a matter of conscience to do so,'' Stang
said.
</P>
<P>
   All these issues will be on full display this weekend as the
medical society's 500-member House of Delegates engages in its most
contentious debate in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between business ethics and medical
ethics and that's what's driving this,'' said Morse, chairman of
the society's ethics committee and a member of its committee on
publications. ``I'm not pointing fingers, but I think we need to
sit down and talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical society's current leaders are girding themselves for
the battle. ``Sometimes it gets pretty feisty, but people can
remain friends,'' said Dr. Jack Evjy, the medical society
president, who plans to deliver what a spokesman called ``an
important set of remarks'' on the issues this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Evjy Thursday declined to talk about any specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the journal's 24-member editorial board called the
Arky report's proposal to require medical society approval of all
New England Journal editorial appointments ``a terrible idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be viewed as the beginning of the decline of
this journal,'' said this physician, a prominent Boston doctor who
requested anonymity. ``It would make it harder to appoint really
superb editors. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a mass
resignation of the editorial board if that passed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report proposes that the nine-member
publications committee become the arbiter of the New England
Journal's editorial independence. For instance, it invites those
who believe they have seen a compromise in editorial independence
to report it immediately to the committee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the meeting agenda are three resolutions passed recently
by the Suffolk District Medical Society that are aimed at defending
the New England Journal from meddling by its medical society
stewards. The Massachusetts Medical Society has owned the New
England Journal since 1921, but until recently had maintained a
hands-off stance and allowed its editor wide latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Medical society leaders have said repeatedly in recent months
that they are determined to protect the editorial freedom of the
New England Journal and its editor. The fate of the Suffolk group's
resolutions will test those assurances, their sponsors say.
</P>
<P>
   The key resolution, many say, would make permanent the
principles on editorial freedom negotiated last summer by Dr.
Marcia Angell as a condition of accepting the post of interim
editor in chief while a search is made for Kassirer's successor.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution proposes that the next journal editor in chief
and future successors ``shall continue to enjoy complete editorial
independence and shall have authority over the use of the name,

   Another Suffolk resolution would establish a standing committee
of the deans of the four Massachusetts medical schools and three
schools of public health to ``advise on any major issue pertinent
to the Journal, at the request of either the editorial staff, the
medical society, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, sources said, implicitly suggests that the
traditional buffer role played by the committee on publications is
not working.
</P>
<P>
   A third resolution calls for ``a more conservative policy with
repect to new publishing and medical information ventures _ a
policy more commensurate with the Society's resources, committee
structure, and limited ability to take entrepreneurial risks.''

FIVE BOOKS THAT WILL HAVE YOU COVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As much as I hate shopping and as wonderful as
the Internet is, the whole idea of buying books online seems a bit
crazy to me.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because I work in a newsroom, where I've seen stacks
and stacks of books on the giveaway table _ books that nobody
thought were worth reading, even when we got them for free.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those giveaways are career books, ones that have catchy
titles and cute little covers, then overwhelm you with buzzwords
and babble once you take a look inside. For every wonderful and
useful book out there, there are a dozen mediocre ones, and three
or four that are just plain horrid.
</P>
<P>
   So I wouldn't buy any career book sight-unseen _ well, unless
Dave Barry decides to write one. I'd normally include Stephen King
on that list, but writing a horror story about the American
workplace would be redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the virtual world hasn't wiped out all the world's
bookstores, and there is even a career-related gem inside San
Francisco's Jukebox Marriott, of all places. On the second floor of
the hotel is a bookstore run by the American Management
Association, with dozens of titles that go beyond the basics like
hunting for jobs and changing careers.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstore Manager Jean Kroll says one of the most popular books
there is James E. Neal Jr.'s ``Effective Phrases for Performance
Appraisals,'' a catchy title if there ever was one. Neal obviously
understands how managers struggle with performance reviews, and his
book is essentially a collection of phrases you can use to describe
an employee's skills.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare it ain't, but it's a terrific niche book.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of terrific books, here are the five best
career-related ones I've seen in the last year that don't involve
job hunting or career changing or Dilbert (not all of them are
necessarily at Kroll's store): _ ``First Hired, Last Fired,'' by
Robert M. Bramson and Susan J. Bramson.
</P>
<P>
   Through dozens of interviews, the authors identified those
characteristics that make employees indispensable _ the kind of
people who are not likely to get laid off.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly useful aspect of the book is that it's about
using your energy in the right direction, not dedicating every
waking moment to the success of the office. In fact, the authors
say that indispensable workers are invariably those who opt for a
balanced life rather than workaholism.
</P>
<P>
   For rank-and-filers, this is the most useful book on the list.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Pushing the Envelope All the Way to the Top,'' by Harvey
Mackay.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice mixture of anecdotes, homespun wisdom and practical
advice from Mackay, author of such previous bestsellers as ``Swim
With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive'' and ``Dig Your Well
Before You're Thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   This has more humanity that most business or career books, and
is perfect for business travelers. Because it's a collection of
short items, you can read this one for a few minutes at a time,
then set it aside for a week or two, then read a few minutes more,
and you won't feel as if you've lost track.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hiring Smart!'' by Dr. Pierre Mornell.
</P>
<P>
   The worst mistake most bosses make is hiring the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   This book by a Mill Valley psychiatrist not only offers a
variety of safeguards to protect you, but is far livelier than any
other book on hiring I've seen.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the book has to do with interviewing, of course, but
Mornell points out many techniques for learning about candidates
before and after the interview _ the kinds of things managers often
overlook.
</P>
<P>
   The book retails for $24.95. One big hiring mistake is likely to
cost you 10,000 times that amount. Do the math.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Building a House for Diversity,'' by R. Roosevelt Thomas Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The first things that come to mind about diversity are usually
race and sex, but Thomas might change your way of thinking about
what diversity really is. The book doesn't preach about the wonders
of diversity, but does explain how it can be valuable _ and
sometimes even harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies consider themselves diverse if they hire more
women and minorities, but Thomas points out that such a strategy
doesn't really encourage diversity if everyone has to fit into the
same mold. He also explains how diversity applies to all sorts of
personality traits, and how people whose attitudes are in the
minority can feel discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``First, Break All the Rules,'' by Marcus Buckingham and Curt
Coffman.
</P>
<P>
   These two writers from the Gallup Organization, who base their
book on 25 years of surveys, point to a list of wrong-headed ideas
that mediocre managers tend to share. This is by far the best of
the five books for managers.
</P>
<P>
   They explain how the best managers do play favorites and help
employees focus on strengths rather than overcoming weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   They also describe how the top managers meet with employees
frequently and know when to help them and when to leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even rank-and-filers can use the book, not only to learn what
they can do better, but how their bosses can help.

 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were not heroes.
At least one of them _ Sacco _ might actually have been connected
with the crime for which both were executed. But what happened to
them at the hands of the Massachusetts judicial system, say
scholars and historians, stands as one of the great legal
controversies of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pointless to debate their guilt or innocence,'' said
Peter W. Agnes Jr., presiding judge of Charlestown District Court
and a leading expert on the case that riveted Boston and much of
the world in the 1920s. ``Whether they were or were not responsible
for murder, they did not receive a fair trial, in part because of
popular hysteria, a biased judge, and a flawed legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the millions of immigrants who had entered the United
States in the opening decades of the century, Sacco and Vanzetti
worked in menial jobs. They were, Vanzetti later wrote, ``nameless,
in the crowd of nameless ones.'' Sacco, 32 at the time he was
arrested, was a shoemaker living in Stoughton; Vanzetti, 29, was a
fish peddler in North Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   But their hearts were with socialism, labor rights, and
anarchism. And they ran with a dangerous political crowd. They were
followers of Luigi Galleani, one of the most radical Italian
anarchists of the day, a man who was advocating the violent
overthrow of the US government and had instigated a wave of
terrorist bombings against public officials just after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Sacco and Vanzetti look especially innocent on May 5,
1920, when they were arrested in connection with an armed robbery
three weeks earlier in South Braintree in which two men had been
killed. The arresting officer testified that Sacco and Vanzetti
appeared to be reaching for their weapons when apprehended. And
they lied to police. And they changed their stories. And Sacco's
gun was linked to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, no assumptions are safe in the Sacco and Vanzetti
case, not evidence, not testimony, not judicial impartiality.
Especially not judicial impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of Sacco's and Vanzetti's death certificates are housed
in an inner sanctum of the Boston Public Library, along with a
canister of their ashes, their death masks, a box of bullets, and
other personal items. The death certificates contain the most
chilling words of all the millions that have been said in the case
since 1920. Cause of death: ``Electric shock. Judicial homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   To millions of people around the world _ especially to liberals,
labor activists, and Italian-Americans in the 1920s and 1930s _
judicial homicide sums up what Judge Webster Thayer of Dedham
committed when he ordered the two men strapped into the electric
chair in Charlestown State Prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sacco and Vanzetti case was one of the great trials and
one of the great causes of the century, especially for those of us
from immigrant backgrounds,'' said former governor Michael S.
Dukakis, who issued a proclamation in 1977 acknowledging the
injustice done to the men. ``It remains poignant, sensitive, and
very important in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep anti-immigrant sentiment &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The actual crime for which the men were accused was the April
15, 1920, murder of a paymaster and guard during a daring daylight
robbery outside the Slater and Morrill shoe factory. It was a scene
made for silent movies: a shootout in the street, an escape in a
sputtering Buick with curtains blowing from the windows, tacks
scattered to deter pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   No one got a good look at the assailants. Neither Sacco nor
Vanzetti had a criminal record. They were political activists who
spoke at labor rallies and followed the fevered imaginings of an
anarchist movement that most people would find hopelessly arcane
today.
</P>
<P>
   A gang led by Joseph Morelli had been carrying out similar armed
robberies in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and a confederate of
the Morellis later confessed to the gang's involvement in the South
Braintree job. (Longtime New England mob boss Raymond L. S.
Patriarca was a member of the gang in his youth.)
</P>
<P>
   Police, judge, jury, and media were obsessed with a Red Scare
and deeply concerned about labor unrest in the factories of New
England. The Justice Department had just conducted the notorious
``Palmer raids,'' rounding up radicals, most of them Italian
immigrants, for deportation. This led authorities to try to link
the South Braintree crime to local anarchists, to stake out a
garage where a tipster said the car used in the crime was being
repaired (it was a different car), and to arrest Sacco and Vanzetti
when they showed up. As radicals feeling the heat from the Palmer
crackdown, Sacco and Vanzetti looked and acted nervous to police
when they were apprehended. And they were armed.
</P>
<P>
   But the way in which police connected the two men to the South
Braintree slayings, especially the coaching of witnesses, has
appalled legal specialists for decades. Agnes called the
eyewitnesses to the crime ``extremely confusing and contradictory''
and said forensic evidence linking Sacco's gun to the crime was
``overstated.'' There are persistent claims that police tampered
with the evidence and the Justice Department colluded with local
authorities as part of the antiradical campaign.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was compounded by deep anti-immigrant sentiment in
the country. It was especially directed at the dark-complexioned
southern Europeans with accents who poured into the country in the
early years of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Frankfurter, then a law professor at Harvard University
and later a Supreme Court justice, published a scathing critique of
the criminal case in the Atlantic Monthly in 1927, while the case
was still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every reasonable probability points away from Sacco and
Vanzetti,'' Frankfurter wrote. ``Every reasonable probability
points toward the Morelli gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Thayer would not be swayed. History has cast the white-haired
judge as the great villain. Thayer had unsuccessfully prosecuted an
anarchist earlier (he chastized that jury for returning an
acquittal). He assigned himself to the Sacco and Vanzetti case.
Throughout the trial in the summer of 1920, he seemed to be leading
the jury toward conviction. His instruction to jurors on how to
judge the immigrant radicals included urging them to remember their
``loyalty'' and their ``true American citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just in case they were not influenced by the iron cage
in which the men were kept during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   After sentencing the men to death, Thayer was quoted as telling
an acquaintance: ``Did you see what I did to those anarchist
bastards the other day? I guess that will hold them for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Thayer turned down every appeal. The law gave the trial judge
sole discretion over ``fact questions'' such as those involving new
evidence; this law was changed in 1939 as a result of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when new evidence seemed overwhelming and public
outrage was peaking, Governor Alvan T. Fuller appointed a
commission headed by Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell to review
the case. The Lowell commission supported Thayer's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brahmins had an agenda to show that the radical Italians
did it,'' said Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law
School and a scholar on the case. ``I think that kind of thing
could happen again. The `they' and the `we' would be different, but
ethnic politics is alive and well, especially in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The execution went forward. The scene that night, Aug. 23, 1927,
was surreal for the onetime ``Athens of America.''
</P>
<P>
   State Police set up machine gun nests atop the walls of the
prison, now the site of Bunker Hill Community College, to keep
watch over streets that had been blocked off to keep out
protesters. Gunboats patrolled Boston Harbor. Partisans greeting
each other with ``comrade'' and wearing hammer-and-sickle emblems
milled about Boston Common. From Beacon Hill, society matrons who
had been won over to the Sacco and Vanzetti side watched the lights
of the prison dim then brighten as each man was electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands marched in the funeral procession that took the bodies
from Joseph A. Langone's funeral home in the North End to Forest
Hills Cemetery, where they were cremated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather buried those two people,'' recalled Fred
Langone, a former city councilor who was 6 years old at the time.
``I remember watching the funeral from across the street, but
really it was more a political than an Italian-American affair.''
</P>
<P>
   The executions so outraged people around the world that Paris
was in a state of siege the day afterward; the American Embassy was
ringed by tanks to protect it from being sacked. Mobs rampaged in
Geneva, and there were demonstrations in Europe and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Literati such as Edna St. Vincent Millay and John Dos Passos
campaigned for the men's freedom. In the aftermath of the
executions, they heaped scorn on Boston for ``legalized murder'' by
``lynchers in frockcoats.'' Poet Harry Crosby penned a
fire-breathing curse, the mildest lines of which were ``City of
Swan Boats, City of Frog-Ponds, you are an Abomination.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The case that will not die
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, an Italian-American sits in the governor's office.
Another is in his second term as mayor of Boston. ``It is a vastly
different, much more tolerant, diverse, and accepting society
today,'' Dukakis said. Italian-Americans occupy positions in
business, civic, social, and religious circles throughout Boston.
Many would just as soon see the Sacco and Vanzetti case go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prominenti have always been uneasy with Sacco and Vanzetti
because the men were anarchists and militant revolutionaries,''
said Robert D'Atillio, a historian.``Also, many Italians just
wanted to assimilate and didn't want to be concerned with radical
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case still will not die. Every few years there is a new
revelation. In 1988, for example, Charlie Whipple, a former Globe
editorial page editor, recalled how when he was a cub reporter in
1937 he bumped into Sergeant Edward J. Seibolt, a police ballistics
expert. As they chatted, Seibolt told Whipple he had worked on the
Sacco and Vanzetti case. ``You know,'' he said, ``we switched the
murder weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   It was stunning news, because Sacco's gun was the one piece of
physical evidence that connected the men to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I print that?'' Whipple asked. ``If you do, I'll call you
a liar,'' Seibolt replied. Whipple kept quiet for 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes, the Charlestown judge, is hoping for more revelations as
scholars examine the 42 boxes of material at the Boston Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   David Rothauser, who teaches television and film production at
Newbury College, has spent almost 30 years developing a screenplay
on Sacco and Vanzetti. Next year he hopes to begin production on an
independent film. ``It has absorbed me all these years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothauser was once warned by a woman who had stood on Beacon
Hill that August night 72 years ago that ``Once you start on this
case it will follow you for the rest of your life.''

DESPITE STRONG PERFORMANCES, `COLLECTOR' DOESN'T ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BONE COLLECTOR 
Directed by: Phillip Noyce 
Screenplay by: Jeremy Iacone (novel: Jeffrey Deaver) 
Starring: Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah, Michael
Rooker, Mike McGlone, Luis Guzman, Leland Orser, John Benjamin
Hickey, Ed O'Neill 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violent content including grisly images, and for
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The body parts don't quite come together in ``The Bone
Collector.'' Still, it does yank us into the heart of some grisly
darkness, thanks to compelling performances from Denzel Washington
as a bedridden police forensics expert and Angelina Jolie as the
rookie cop pressed into service as his eyes and ears on the
streets. Come to think of it, she also spends a lot of time beneath
them, too, in dank tunnels where, you can be sure, nothing
appetizing awaits. It seems a serial killer is reenacting notorious
turn-of-the-century murders involving ingeniously sadistic methods
of death and much pain for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   It takes Washington a while to discern the pattern. In fact, it
takes him a while to muster the will to start playing detective
again, after an on-the-job injury has left him paralyzed and
suicidal. But he's hooked by the challenge of the puzzle, although
his way of solving it incurs the wrath of his chief and colleagues,
all of whom he bypasses, choosing instead a rookie as a partner.
The credibility problem facing the film isn't what you'd expect.
Although virtually immobile, Washington is easily able to hold our
attention as the film's central figure. While it initially may seem
far-fetched that he'd go so far afield in choosing a partner, it
makes sense on two counts.
</P>
<P>
   First, he knows Jolie's rookie will do what he says. Second,
using her as an extension of his senses and paralyzed muscles is
his way of regaining a measure of control over his world and
feeling less powerless. Not that Jolie's earnest cop is a puppet.
This film will further her installation on the A-list, since she
makes us feel what her character feels when Washington sends her
into some pretty scary and gruesome places to find some brutally
unpretty murder victims. Riding grandiosely creepy midnight imagery
_ dripping stone walls, cavernous sewers _ director Phillip Noyce
darkly and expertly tests the limits of how far a film can go in
terms of serving up grisly killings in the name of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying for admission to the rarefied stygian delirium of
``The Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Seven,'' ``The Bone Collector''
only gets as far as, say, ``Kiss the Girls.'' The ending isn't
satisfyingly built. When it comes, it's too sudden and even a
little mundane, with a disappointingly pedestrian killer making his
way into the loft where Washington's quadriplegic lies pinned to
his bed, defenseless. The film never really gathers suspense and
tension. Instead, it proceeds from one Guignol set piece to another
as the string-pulling killer remains too shadowy, too hidden. We
see only one bloody piece of his handiwork after another; then he's
arbitrarily thrust upon us. Washington and Jolie earn their stripes
here, but more texture would have resulted, I think, in more
terror.

FUN `BANDITS' ROCKS OUT TO A GOOD TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

BANDITS 
Directed by: Katja von Garnier 
Screenplay by: Uwe Wilhelm, von Garnier 
Starring: Katja Riemann, Jasmin Tabatabai, Nicolette Kreblitz,
Jutta Hoffmann, Hannes Jaenicke, Werner Schreyer, Pater Sattmann 
At: Kendall Square Cinema, Cambridge 
Running time: 109 minutes (in German with subtitles) 
Rated: R (language, sexuality and some drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' as an angry rock musical in German
and you'll be on your way to plugging in to ``Bandits,'' Katja von
Garnier's celebratory femme-skewed musicians-on-the-lam caper. It
has fun making literal the outlaw energies of rock music when a
band consisting of four inmates of a women's prison breaks out of a
police van after a guard has taken liberties. Being trucked off to
perform at a policemen's ball, they escape instead.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, they become media heroines, then pop cult icons
when a record company issues their previously rejected demo tape.
They and their music consist mostly of attitude and intensity,
which, when factored with their underdog status, make them the kind
of escapees the police know they must pursue with an avoidance of
heavyhandedness. Hannes Jaenicke's cop in charge of retrieving them
is smart enough, when he isn't eyeing his distracting blond
assistant, to proceed softly.
</P>
<P>
   Amusingly, it's Peter Sattmann's shark of a record company exec
who displays a real shortfall in the light-touch department. After
first trash-canning the demo tape, then retrieving it and trying to
rob the women with a contract and a ballpoint pen, he grits his
teeth and gives them what they want. Ironically, they can't enjoy
the perks they had dreamed of for so long. Their mission is to get
to the port of Hamburg and flee the country by ship. They've even
got an American groupie posing as a kidnap victim, Werner Schreyer,
who keeps the sexy film funny, too.
</P>
<P>
   The story line _ what there is of one _ is all over the place,
as, indeed, are the women. Von Garnier relies on the steamroller
effect of their upbeat energies to carry the film, which they
mostly do. The go-for-broke ending starts with a rock concert on
the roof of a riverside warehouse, with frenzied fans below
blocking the converging cops. But then ``Bandits'' is a fun bad
movie with at least six endings for its four wired fugitives _
Katja Riemann's steely Emma, Jasmin Tabatabai's fiery Luna,
Nicolette Krebitz's seductive Angel, and Jutta Hoffmann's stoical
Marie, who suggests a Teutonic Helen Mirren who might have wandered
in from a production of Brecht's ``Mother Courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the going gets tough, ``Bandits'' turns itself into a
high-energy music video. Ultimately, ``Bandits'' is pretty
sentimental and empty. But its partying energies are hard to resist
as it invites us to share its delight in striking poses while it
belts out its jailbird rock. Not surprisingly, there'll be a
Hollywood remake of ``Bandits.'' Joel Schumacher will direct it for
Warners. The sun over Los Angeles doubtless is being eclipsed by a
flurry of faxes flying between deal makers and the likes of
Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Claire Danes, Sarah
Michelle Gellar, Neve Campbell, and the rest of Hollywood's golden
girls.

`SHOW ME' AN ENDEARING LOOK AT TEEN ANGST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SHOW ME LOVE 
Written and directed by: Lukas Moodysson 
Starring: Alexandra Dahlstrom, Rebecca Liljeberg, Erica Carosopn,
Mathias Rust, Stefan Horberg, Ralph Carlsson, MAria Hedborg 
At: Kendall Square Cinema, Cambridge 
Running time: 89 minutes 
(in Swedish with subtitles) 
Rated: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you didn't see movie posters for ``Scream'' and Baz
Luhrmann's ``Romeo and Juliet'' on the walls of a couple of
teenagers' rooms, and you didn't hear a reference to the Back
Street Boys, you'd be excused for thinking that ``Show Me Love''
was about teen love pangs in the '60s. Much of the time Lukas
Moodysson's engaging film plays like a Beatles film without the
Beatles. As one of its endearingly innocent heroines in the Swedish
backwater of Amal exclaims when she's told that her dream of going
to a rave is out of date, by the time anything gets to Amal, it's
not only no longer cool _ it's over.
</P>
<P>
   This charming and, compared with most Hollywood films like it,
refreshing teen comedy is Sweden's second-highest grosser, right
behind ``Titanic.'' It's driven by Moodysson's empathy for the
desperation and boredom of its teen characters. The biggest
nightmare experienced by Alexandra Dahlstrom's cute little
pepperpot, Elin, has her never leaving Alam, marrying a dull guy,
and getting stuck there for the rest of her life. By the narrow
standards of a place where vocational choices run to hairdressing
and auto repair, the sentient loner named Agnes is weird and knows
it. One notch above Elin on the social ladder is Agnes.
Delightfully embodied by Rebecca Liljeberg, with bright, alert eyes
that constantly precede her into any situation, sizing everything
up, she's a lesbian who wants to be a writer.
</P>
<P>
   The conforming kids around her do little to comfort Agnes. And
by shrewdly refusing to demonize her parents, as so many Hollywood
films do, and making them sympathetic, Moodysson makes us feel how
this actually makes life worse for Agnes. Her parents, who pride
thesmelves on their enlightenment and sensitivity, are utterly
clueless about what's driving Agnes. Still, they're too nice to
justify the kind of rebellion on which she'd like to embark. Elin,
on the other hand, is dying to rebel. She's disappointed when her
older sister tells her they can't get high, as Elin had hoped to,
by overdosing on their mother's Alka-Seltzer. Agnes, who has a
``Casablanca'' poster on her wall, wants to be a psychiatrist.
Elin, who wouldn't know what ``Casablanca'' was, wants to be a
model.
</P>
<P>
   When Agnes lets Elin know she's attracted to her, Elin turns on
her cruelly and rushes into the arms of a sweet but dim boy. But
Elin is clearly intrigued by Agnes and finds her way back to
Agnes's bedroom. The question is whether the two girls can handle
the consequences of pairing off and going public as Elin's
oft-proclaimed wish to escape conventionality is put to the test.
You'll care, partly because Moodysson's in-your-face shooting with
telephoto lenses gets us inside his identification with the girls'
desperation and makes their story seem like a front-line dispatch.
Clearly, he remembers how things were in the teen years, when
emotions are magnified. Apart from Dahlstrom and Liljeberg, he used
a mostly nonprofessional cast, which enhances the immediacy and
authenticity of his demonstration that Sweden's teens, for all
their feeling that they're weird and isolated, are members of a
universal club.

GRUNWALD LOOKS AT THE METAPHYSICS OF SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TWILIGHT 
Losing Sight, Gaining Insight 
By Henry Grunwald 
Knopf, 130 pp., $20 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Grunwald was immersed in the pleasures of writing and
reminiscence when clouds began to gather. Former editor in chief of
Time Inc. and onetime US ambassador to Austria, Grunwald had rented
a villa in Italy in 1992 and was working on an autobiography after
a long and busy career. On a gloomy afternoon, he poured water into
a glass; he missed.
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald consulted an optician when he returned to New York. The
diagnosis was as grim as it was puzzling: macular degeneration, a
disease of the retina that afflicts about 15 million Americans and
is one of the most common causes of irreversible loss of vision. As
Grunwald would find, there is no known origin, and no known cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twilight'' is a rhapsody about the art of seeing, an
autobiography of the eye and its ineffable link to memory. As such,
it is an elegant, poignant postscript to his 1996 book, ``One Man's
America: A Journalist's Search for the Heart of His Country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with macular degeneration means living in a half-veiled
world,'' Grunwald writes. ``I can still see a sunrise, mountains,
buildings, can, in fact, see almost everything _ but as if through
a scrim.'' That scrim would change his relationship with his wife,
his grandchildren, with art, with words, with the world. It is the
eye, he discovered, that ``enables us to reach out into life. It
means freedom, independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustering his journalist's detachment, Grunwald surveys the role
of the eye in myth, history, and science. He finds enough mystery
to make any rationalist uneasy: ``Science has long ago
demythologized the eye, but not entirely. Even Charles Darwin felt
that way. `The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder,' he wrote
in 1860. He meant that its development was what any layman would
consider miraculous and was difficult to explain through
evolutionary theory.''
</P>
<P>
   How did the pinhole eye of the flatworm, the seeing tissue of
the retina, evolve into the metaphysical? Metaphors abound in
poetry, literature, and drama: evil eye, mind's eye, inner vision.
Grunwald unearths an Assyrian chant bound to raise goosebumps: ``O
clear eye, O doubly clear eye, O eye of clear sight?''
</P>
<P>
   Utterly devoid of self-pity, Grunwald makes a quietly passionate
argument for the importance of beauty in everyday life. It is clear
that Grunwald has spent a lifetime constructing a personal
aesthetic sense _ one that will sustain him through this particular
scourge. As he puts it, ``I became a visual glutton, devouring the
images around me in order somehow to hold on to them before they
grew even dimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald continues to haunt museums. As his eyesight fades, he
is startled by the vivid images that can emerge from a familiar
canvas, particularly the painting by Georges Seurat, ``Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884-1886).''
</P>
<P>
   A writer his entire life, Grunwald had to give up the tactile
pleasure of pen-scratch on paper and begin to dictate. He found
some company in history: Henry James dictated his later novels.
Aldous Huxley and Jorge Luis Borges were blind, or partially blind.
Blind poet John Milton wrote wrenchingly about Samson, eyeless in
Gaza. The empathetic reader can imagine Grunwald's yearning for the
simplest daily acts: tapping out a letter to a friend, flipping
through a newspaper. And can only hope that he finds recompense in
memory and in the details that remain visible.
</P>
<P>
   As he writes of Seurat, ``One must pay as much attention to the
parasols as to the monkey, the cane, the fishing pole. The simple
lesson is that there are no unimportant details in a good
picture.''

BUSH BLOSSOMS WITH `SCIENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gavin Rossdale is getting used to this stardom thing. As singer,
songwriter, and chief heartthrob of the British band Bush, he's
dealt with endless scrutiny in recent years, but hasn't let it
bother him. The same patience applied to writing songs for the new
Bush album. He rented a seaside house in Ireland for three months
and, instead of panicking over deadlines, invited friends to share
it with him.
</P>
<P>
   He worked by day, partied by night, and all was right with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `You can come stay and we'll drink great drinks and
hang by the fireside, but I'm working 8, 10 hours a day. You look
after yourself and do what you want during that time. Use my car,
whatever.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I got into a very consistent schedule,'' says Rossdale.
``I'd look around and see those rolling hills and beautiful
crashing sea on the black rock and just be thinking of how much fun
I was having _ and realizing that I was still making the music I
wanted to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossdale's seaside tenure served him well, because the newly
released Bush album, ``The Science of Things,'' is the band's best
yet. He wrote 25 songs and whittled them down to 12, including the
fast-moving new single, ``The Chemicals Between Us,'' which just
hit No. 1 on the alternative-rock charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking a lot about the differences between people,''
he says of the song. ``There are the fundamental, most genetic
differences such as DNA, but I was also realizing that one of the
loneliest places you could ever be is lying in bed with someone and
not saying what is on your mind. You seem miles away from the
person next to you. And that was the basis of the song: `The
chemicals between us, the walls that lie between us, lying in this
bed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's angst and anger on the album _ a Bush calling card _ but
also a generous ray of hope, as on ``Jesus Online,'' which is
``specifically about trying to accept yourself and find something
spiritual in this technological age. The whole society is obsessed
about how we're not good enough, but sometimes we should just shut
up and accept ourselves. We should say that we don't need a new car
or new jacket or new hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The album, featuring lively guitar tunes and some soft,
meditative tracks, strikes a thoughtful balance in the lyrics. Some
are wild, some are deep, but almost all show growth in Rossdale's
songwriting. ``It's just an ode to my 17 personalities,'' he says
with a laugh. ``It's the honesty I have about the contradictions
that I have to face within myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those contradictions are about love (``Obviously, I
don't think anyone's love life is perfect,'' he says). Some are
about the new millennium (``There is nowhere left to hide,'' he
sings in the spacy ``40 Miles from the Sun''). And some show a
profound new sensitivity about relationships, as in the
AIDS-inspired song, ``Letting the Cables Sleep,'' about a friend
who contracted the disease but had trouble talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that my friend was HIV positive and I'd heard the
rumors for a while,'' says Rossdale. ``I started to hear it so much
that I felt a responsibility to lend my support. So I asked him if
he was sick and he said yes. It was just the whole stigma of the
disease that made him not say anything before. I felt so bad that
he'd had to endure months without his friends knowing. It upset me
a lot that we hadn't communicated about it. It further made me feel
that communication is everything . . . and how much better we all
feel when you purge yourself of what is really going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for purging on another level, Rossdale and Bush received new
respect for the band's performance at Woodstock '99 this summer.
The group had the unenviable task of headlining over Korn one
night, but more than held its own with a hard-rocking set that
stunned any detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock is now famous for the Sunday night fires and the
terrible rapes,'' says Rossdale, whose group performed on the
Friday of that weekend. ``It was definitely a testosterone scene,
but when we played, people had a lot of love for us. I like Korn a
lot and I wasn't worried about following them. I've always been of
the opinion that if you just go out and do your thing, that's all
that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for Bush to do some radio-sponsored Christmas shows in the
next month, then mount an official tour next year.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The job market recovered in October from
damage inflicted by Hurricane Floyd, government data show. But even
as job growth accelerated, workers' earnings rose less than
expected. Non-farm payrolls grew 310,000 in October, in line with
expectations, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1 percent from
4.2 percent, the lowest level since January 1970. But average
hourly wages grew just 1 cent to $13.37, a sharp slowdown from
September, when wages posted a 5 cent jump, the biggest since
September 1983. Slower wage growth may ease concerns expressed by
Federal Reserve policy-makers that rising wages will spark a pickup
in inflation. In early trading, stock and bond prices rose sharply.

BRYAN FERRY SETS THE STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could be forgiven if you thought this: Bryan Ferry _ solo
artist and once (and future?) singer-frontman of art-rock avatars
Roxy Music _ has been in semi-retirement, enjoying the country life
on his estate in rural England. Doing things like tending the
garden and, with his wife, raising their four sons, contentedly
removed from the hustle and bustle of the pop life.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Ferry has, after all, been absent from the new
release racks at the record stores and the concert stages of
America for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not,'' says Ferry, with a slight laugh at his
own expense, ``I have been in the studio for the last few years, in
my eyes experimenting and doing things that I was anxious to get
out. But one of the snags was the record company (problems). And it
was very frustrating to take such a long time to explore things, to
see what I like and don't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sad that I haven't put out enough stuff in the
last 10 years,'' Ferry continues, from a London rehearsal studio.
``I apologize. But I am doing a tour of the States and a tour of
Europe, so I'm getting around there gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferry, joined by a 13-piece band (including string and horn
sections), is currently featuring songs from the just-released ``As
Time Goes By,'' an album of standards _ some playful, some somber,
most romantic _ from the 1930s. He will include revamped material
from other solo and Roxy Music albums, making for a 90-minute set.
The Roxy music, he says, is ``sounding great with this
configuration.''
</P>
<P>
   Why now for such an album?
</P>
<P>
   ``The impetus comes, I guess, from '73,'' says Ferry, referring
to the year of ``These Foolish Things,'' his first solo album of
covers. ``That was the first time I did songs from the '30s period.
I had dabbled in that period. I grew up with these things, being a
jazz fan as a young lad, and I used to go to the local city hall in
Newcastle and listen to Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, all sorts
of touring American jazz bands. I was a Billie Holliday fan for a
long, long time _ as a teenager till now _ and she, of course,
explored that repertoire, and that was sort of the benchmark I
stood by, the late-'30s things she did with Teddy Wilson. Luckily,
with this band I found a piano player-arranger (Colin Good) who has
the spirit and some of the skill of Teddy.'' In four songs on the
album, Good employs what might be called an antique synthesizer
from that era, called an ondes martenot.
</P>
<P>
   With Roxy Music, Ferry and his mates pioneered a
retro/futuristic style. Onstage, Ferry donned a tuxedo in an era of
scruffy blue jeans and T-shirts. He has long put forth an image of
rock 'n' roll sophistication, a pose sometimes laced with irony if
not ennui. Thus, a reach six decades back to the jazz era does not
seem forced or untoward. That music has always been a part of his
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people expect something different from me,'' says
Ferry. ``I always hope to be doing that and I think they know that
my heart is in the work. I was intrigued by the notion of doing a
complete album of these songs. Now is as good a time as any to do
it, being the end of the century and (there being) a certain air of
nostalgia for people looking to evaluate where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   His strength as a cover artist is not to be underestimated. His
version of John Lennon's ``Jealous Guy'' towered above the original
and his rendition of Neil Young's ``Like a Hurricane'' lent a
certain elegance to the song. Ferry's first two solo releases, done
early in Roxy Music's life, contained radical reinventions of songs
such as Bob Dylan's ``A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall'' and the Rolling
Stones' ``Sympathy for the Devil.'' (He also covered the old-timers
``These Foolish Things'' and ``Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.'') Some of
the songs verged on campy, others were wildly over the top or
tongue in cheek. They were not, mind you, without substance _ just
reconfigured in grand style.
</P>
<P>
   Ferry is closer to the source material on ``As Time Goes By.''
Songs include Cole Porter's ``Just One of Those Things'' and ``Miss
Otis Regrets (She's Unable to Have Lunch Today),'' Kurt Weill's
``September Song,'' ``I'm in the Mood for Love,'' ``Falling in Love
Again,'' and ``Love Me or Leave Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to choose too many gloomy songs,'' says Ferry.
``There is, hopefully, a respect and a lot of affection for the
songs, which I think is very important. You know, it is very hard
to write a great song that will sound great 60 years later. I don't
think people appreciate how difficult that is.'' Doing these songs,
he adds, was ``to some extent a sort of stylistic exercise, doing
things in a period style.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``As Time Goes By,'' Ferry's crooning vocals are mixed high.
The songs themselves, says Ferry, are much more melody-driven than
groove-driven, a shift from his more rock-oriented material. And
the basic tracks were recorded live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just a real privilege to be able to do this material and
it is very refreshing as a songwriter to get away from my own life,
as it has been throughout my career. Sometimes, it's a real
pleasure to get away from it and to explore wonderful songs with
great lyrics and a strong melody.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his own writing, Ferry confesses to the eternal struggle.
</P>
<P>
   David Stewart, half of the recently reunited Eurythmics, worked
with Ferry on his other project, a rock album that will likely see
release in a year's time. Stewart said that, like his own partner
Annie Lennox, Ferry is intensely self-critical and self-doubting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote 10 songs with Bryan last year or the year before,''
Stewart said recently. ``Bryan is really like `Aargh, I'm not good
enough,' and he'll stop talking and be pacing around outside my
studio and looking out the window, sighing.'' Stewart added that
one day he poked his head in the studio and offered a cheery `How's
it going?' and, in response, Ferry made a motion with his hand and
neck as if to hang himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ferry laughs as that anecdote is recalled. True story. So how
did the record turn out? Did he finally unblock his muse?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says, and then adds, ``I will let you know next year.
I have a lot of stuff in the can which is at various stages of
readiness _ some things are mixed and nearly complete and a lot of
stuff is hovering around in the background. Hopefully, I can get
back to it when I finish my tour, but that might not be till around
April or May.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Stewart, Ferry worked with his old Roxy Music partner
Brian Eno and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have been floating about a Roxy Music reunion. There is a
new retrospective disc out called ``The Best of Bryan Ferry + Roxy
Music,'' and Virgin is remastering the entire Roxy catalog for
rerelease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a chance,'' Ferry says, of a reunion. ``But
what the band would consist of if we do it, I don't know. But I am
very pleased with how (the albums) sound. Obviously, I have had to
listen to those records to OK the remastering and they sound
terrific. It was very much a trip down memory lane listening to it
all _ you usually don't listen to your (own music). And, yeah, it
made me think one day it would be nice to do it with (saxophonist)
Andy (Mackay) and (guitarist) Phil (Manzanera) and it would be
great if Eno was there.''

A VIVID HISTORY OF EARLY FEMINISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
``Not For Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP;
Susan B. Anthony'' 
Documentary by: Ken Burns and Paul Barnes. 
Narrator: Sally Kellerman 
When: Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m. 
On: WGBH-TV 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Ramses to Napoleon to Lindbergh, from the sinking of the
Titanic to the building of the Hoover Dam to the Battle of Midway,
the past is present on television as never before.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a fascination with history has gripped the tube, a
big piece of the picture has been missing: women.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the occasional made-for-TV movie about Cleopatra or
Joan of Arc, the giants of women's history and the causes for which
they fought have been relegated to the periphery. As for
contemporary feminists, it seems they command media attention only
when unmasked as secret advisers to Al(pha Male) Gore.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to welcome ``Not For Ourselves Alone: The
Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP; Susan B. Anthony.'' The
documentary by Ken Burns and Paul Barnes, airing Sunday and Monday
at 8 p.m. on WGBH-TV, is an overdue homage to the visionary figures
who galvanized the women's rights movement in the 19th century and
laid the groundwork for women's suffrage.
</P>
<P>
   For what the film tells us about that time and our own, this is
a worthy and sometimes inspiring addition to the Burns oeuvre. He
and Barnes have found an irresistibly dramatic tale to tell _ and
one that may be unfamiliar to many viewers, especially when it
comes to Stanton, a brilliant writer and thinker not widely known
today.
</P>
<P>
   By the conclusion of the four-hour ``Not For Ourselves Alone,''
it's hard to disagree with the assertion by journalist and author
Lynn Sherr that ``the combination of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton is one of the great miracles in the history of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The iron determination of these early feminists is evident in
the photographs that punctuate the film, but ``Not For Ourselves
Alone'' also draws on a trove of pictures of ordinary 19th-century
women who put a human face on the social reforms for which Anthony
and Stanton were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Women would not gain the right to vote in their lifetimes, but
no one did more to propel the issue to the forefront of public
thinking. The established order knew it had a pair of dogged
opponents in Stanton and Anthony. Stanton was the firebrand
theorist, Anthony was the pragmatic campaigner. ``I forged the
thunderbolts. She fired them,'' Stanton once said of Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   They battled custom and convention at almost every turn. On her
wedding day, Stanton insisted that the word ``obey'' be stricken
from her vows. But then she knew the value of words, and could be
tactically incendiary in her use of them. Fighting for divorce
reform in 1860, she described marriage as ``legalized
prostitution'' _ even though she had a decent marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the right to vote was denied to women, along with
most legal and property rights, Stanton and Anthony broke rules and
ground for half a century, beginning in 1848, when Stanton
organized the first women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y.
When Anthony gave a speech on behalf of a woman's right to vote _
as she did thousands of times _ it was often the first time any of
the spectators had heard a woman speak in public. She was pelted
with eggs, burned in effigy, subjected to verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   When Anthony cast a vote in Rochester, N.Y., in 1872, she was
promptly put on trial for breaking the law and found guilty, after
which the judge made the mistake of asking Anthony if she had
anything to say. She did, scorching him and the unjust legal system
with a fiery fusillade.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Stanton and Anthony relied on each other for moral
support. Their friendship, illuminated by excerpts from their many
letters, frames and deepens ``Not For Ourselves Alone,'' lending it
an intimate dimension beyond their public crusdades. The film also
describes the friction, as when Anthony railed at Stanton for
bearing child after child (seven in all), keeping her off the
battlefield for long periods. ``My whole soul is in the work, but
my hands belong to my family,'' Stanton wrote Anthony. At one
point, in the spirit of whatever-it-takes, Anthony moved into the
Stanton residence to keep house and care for the children so
Stanton could write.
</P>
<P>
   All of the commentators on ``Not For Ourselves Alone'' are
women, as were the film's advisers, but the driving forces behind
``Not For Ourselves Alone'' are three men: Burns, who produced and
directed it; coproducer Barnes; and scriptwriter Geoffrey C. Ward,
who crafted a smooth narrative to complement Burns's images.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has acknowledged that he felt ``humiliated'' because he
initially did not know much about Stanton and Anthony. He has
compensated for that with a film that will make them hard to
forget.

`INSIDER' A DEEPLY RIVETING MEDIA THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much of Michael Mann's ``The Insider'' is rendered as opera
that it doesn't take long for things to seem as if Al Pacino's
hoarse fire- breathing is going to break into an aria. As the ``60
Minutes'' news producer Lowell Bergman, Pacino looks like he wants
to burst into song but is too burnt out to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, Mann has made a film whose sense of
journalistic justice is stretched to the breaking point, so he
turns a real-life ethical morass involving a fired tobacco
scientist (Russell Crowe) who spills his beans to Mike Wallace into
an epic dirge.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's is a world in which even the critical exchange of faxes
carries the dramatic intensity of a cliffhanger and the ambient
techno score takes on the weight of orchestral movements.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``The Insider'' about the highly flammable tiff between
factions at CBS News and Big Tobacco? Or is it an exercise in
audio-visual arousal?
</P>
<P>
   The way Mann weds one to the other, it's both.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to think of ``The Insider'' as a meticulously
assembled dramatization of a grossly controversial moment in TV
history. Or the longest, most arrestingly cinematic segment ``60
Minutes'' never aired.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of ``Miami Vice'' creator Mann, ``The Insider'' is a
handsomely constructed production, from Dante Spinotti's gorgeous
and dynamic photography to the make-up artists who've gotten
Christopher Plummer's skin that perfect, leathery Mike Wallace
salmon shade of pink.
</P>
<P>
   In what's essentially a supporting role, Plummer plays Wallace
as a prissy, self-serving hard-ass.
</P>
<P>
   It's a magnificently hammy performance that doesn't go out of
its way to counteract Mann and Eric Roth's script (inspired by
Marie Brenner's infamous 1996 Vanity Fair story), which portrays
Wallace as an egotistically driven blowhard/diva, with a severe
disconnect between his sense of journalistic integrity and the
close-knit staff of reporters making sure it remains intact on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   An early scene of Wallace going berserk before an interview with
a Saudi sheik is a bit so burlesque it's shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the film's treatment of Wallace is more fair than
the real Mike Wallace would have you believe, in that Plummer's
replica has an innate understanding of the vicissitudes of TV news,
a smidgen of compassion and is not malevolent, simply mildly
megalomaniacal.
</P>
<P>
   And if ``The Insider,'' thanks to Brian Morris' production
design and Spinotti's shot-making, has a painterliness about it,
then it would follow that the film itself is about portraits of
several men, including Plummer's Wallace. But chiefly, the film is
a head shot of Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) and especially Lowell Bergman
and the way one man can't quite trust himself to trust the other.
</P>
<P>
   After he's forcibly removed from a high-paying job as the head
research scientist at Brown and Williamson, maker of such fine
narcotics as Kools, Wigand's shell-shock and anger compel him to
ship a box of files to Bergman's door in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Wigand shyly, nervously expresses an interest in
sharing with Bergman and the world Big Tobacco's knowledge that _
despite its claims _ cigarettes really are addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Once Wallace interviews Wigand for ``60 Minutes,'' CBS News,
fearing an apocalyptic lawsuit from B&AMP;W, which made Wigand sign a
confidentiality agreement, decides to run the piece without Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a decision made, as Bergman reminds the brass (which
includes Gina Gershon as a network lawyer), without a consideration
of the possibility that it could destroy the already unstable
Wigand, who's been counting on the airing of the segment to
vindicate himself.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, which was never quite clear to begin with, gets
increasingly muddier as the CBS legal department clamps down on CBS
News and as a zillion little facts about Wigand's past come to
light.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's storytelling here is so tense that even the NYC taxis
sweat. The smaller characters, such as Wigand's vaguely unstable
wife (Diane Venora, under a Jessica Lange spell) and ``60 Minutes''
executive producer Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall, resisting
caricature), have inner lives.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe has been made up to look like such an ashen-gray, middle-
aged, Middle-American schlub that the occasional emergence of the
actor's Australian accent doesn't matter. His performance is an
unraveling knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand, whose life is in a constant state of siege, finds
himself increasingly degraded and humiliated and the object of both
media and corporate scrutiny. Crowe's sullen, trenchant,
beleaguered demeanor makes you grateful that it's Wigand and not
you.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is not a politics-first director. He's supremely skilled at
pensive action films such as ``Heat,'' in which even shoot-outs
felt contemplative.
</P>
<P>
   Though you'd think someone with a specialty in the gray matter
of black and white issues would take on a story with so many
complications willing to play the designated outsider, ready to
meld the good and the bad with the ugly and the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he shows an aberrantly Capra-esque sense of twisted
optimism and worships the wrong hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' has one obvious villain in Big Tobacco and an
untouchable warrior of justice in Bergman, in whom the film has
found its unconditional hero. He can circumnavigate the
simultaneous meltdown of his TV show and his star source, be a
loving husband and do most of Mike Wallace's job for him _
sometimes from a remote hut in the Bahamas. He's no ordinary
producer, he's Captain America with a Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's unwavering aggrandizement of Bergman is as false a note
as the film's 555 phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pacino, in righteous ``... And Justice For All'' mode,
remains as furious and fiery as anything he's done. He makes the
guy appear complex where on the page he probably just seemed busy.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's made nothing less than a deeply riveting media thriller.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one whose emphasis on Bergman's sacrificial decency
rather than Wigand's far more intriguing imperilment makes it seem
as if the lingering ruin of a life is something you can summarize
in a caption before the end credits scroll.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: The flavors of life long ago
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Carole Aguirre
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Ga. _ When I recall my days of yore, it is more of a
taste that I remember than anything visual.
</P>
<P>
   Mama Hawkins, my paternal grandmother, lived next door. Cooking
was her most notable skill.
</P>
<P>
   She baked angel food cakes from scratch using a dozen egg whites
and filled the center with powdered-sugar icing made from a secret
recipe. Her pecan divinity could bring on ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   When company came, she would spend days in preparation, sifting,
beating, stirring, peeling, stringing.
</P>
<P>
   In her garden she raised pole beans, onions, lettuce, beets,
peppers, corn, squash, cucumbers, watermelon and fleshy red
tomatoes as big as a sheep's head.
</P>
<P>
   There was a scuppernong arbor, pear and apple trees. She picked
wild plums and blackberries and made jellies and preserves, and
lined the pantry with colorful quart jars of canned vegetables that
on cold winter nights would bring back the taste of summer.
</P>
<P>
   She kept a flock of chickens for the fresh eggs as well as the
pullets that wound up on her table, baked or fried.
</P>
<P>
   She had a cow named Toy that she loved and treated more like a
pet than a farm animal. From Toy's milk she skimmed off the cream
and churned butter.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fresh. When Mama Hawkins put a meal on the table
it could be traced to the day she placed the seeds in the ground.
It was her way.
</P>
<P>
   I remember visiting her when I was 5 and pushing a chair against
the china cabinet so I could reach the angel food cake that
presided over the room from its lofty perch.
</P>
<P>
   All I wanted was one fingerful of icing. I don't know what went
wrong, but the cake sailed over my head and rolled on its side
across the room, the icing clinging to the floor like a carpet
unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   My mother and Mama Hawkins came running. All my grandmother said
was, ``Dammit.'' It was the only time I ever heard her use such a
word.
</P>
<P>
   That also was the year Fluffy, Mama Hawkins' white Persian cat,
bit me on the back of my hand.
</P>
<P>
   Fluffy liked to sit on the well house, and that is where she was
perched when I reached out to stroke her fur. Suddenly she struck,
drawing blood and a blood-curdling scream that once again brought
the grown-ups running. Mama Hawkins only laughed.
</P>
<P>
   From then on I wanted only to push Fluffy in the well, but I was
afraid to go near her.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the family, my Grandmother Bramlett grew
strawberries that she made into pies and put up in quart jars.
</P>
<P>
   I knew she kept her cache of the heavenly fruit in the bottom of
the hutch cabinet, and when no one was around I would unscrew the
top of each jar, reach my hand in and grab a few bites, not
realizing I was ruining the whole batch.
</P>
<P>
   When I see my saintly grandmother again, and I believe I will, I
must confess my sin.
</P>
<P>
   Granddaddy bought fresh butter from Miz Jenny Hill who lived
down the road, 30 cents for a half pound, a little round cake
wrapped in wax paper.
</P>
<P>
   After pinching off a sample from my grandparents' refrigerator,
I knew I had discovered a new vice.
</P>
<P>
   The butter was pure and sweet as candy. From then on, when I got
my allowance, I would go to Miz Jenny's and buy a cake of butter
and eat it as one would an apple, half for now and half later.
</P>
<P>
   My own mother was a great cook but she worked at Sears behind
the catalog desk, so when she got home in the evenings she would be
in a hurry to get dinner cooked and served.
</P>
<P>
   She commanded all the help she could get, so before I was tall
enough to see over the table, I was in the kitchen helping with
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir the gravy,'' she would say. ``String the beans. ... Wash
the lettuce. ... Get the rolls out of the oven. ... Turn the
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time I was 11, I cooked dinner for my dad on nights
Mother had to work late.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember not knowing how to cook. Years later when
someone asked me how I learned my culinary skills, I could honestly
say, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm old enough to wish not to disclose my age, though I will
say that I'm a card-carrying AARP member, and when my children take
me to dinner they select sushi bars or specialty restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The food is good and the company is great, but how can I tell
them that what I long for is the taste of my youth?
</P>

<HEADLINE>
`THE BONE COLLECTOR' PROVIDES FEW CHILLS AND NO THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Bone Collector,'' Denzel Washington plays Lincoln
Rhyme, a quadriplegic forensics genius and respected textbook
author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quadriplegic'' means not even Hollywood can make him walk.
Instead, it can give him millions of dollars worth of
voice-operated technology and a mouse for his one working finger to
click _ all from the comfort of Rhyme's spacious New York
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Quadriplegic also means that the star of ``The Bone Collector''
is consigned to a bed for the entire film, and can move only what's
above his shoulders, that ring finger and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, the NYPD rookie who
uncovers a corpse beneath the rocks beside a set of busy train
tracks. The care she puts into detailing the specifics of the crime
attracts Lincoln to her. He was NYPD's head of forensics before his
accident, and he recognizes her craftsmanship as his own: She's
read his books.
</P>
<P>
   The clues left at the scene suggest that the killer will strike
again, and Rhyme believes that together they can keep that next
victim from slaughter. But despite her evident aptitude for
forensics and his fervor, Amelia prefers to remain in the youth
services division. She's a Ziegfeld girl who refuses to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Before being presented with this case by his detective friend
(Ed O'Neill, reminding us he can still do more than dial
1-800-COLLECT), Rhyme was suicidal. Upon being told off by the New
Yawky Donaghy, the glint in his watery eyes sends a smoldering
smoke signal: ``I want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she's inhaling his fumes, discovering the dead
bodies in New York's catacombs and explaining to him what they look
like. Alas, ``quadriplegic'' means Denzel Washington and Angelina
Jolie will not get it on, regardless of how much they seem to want
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's on-screen celibacy is maintained, and he's invited
to do Jimmy Stewart in a high-tech ``Rear Window.'' It's something
he does with his usual steely command, and Jolie is a firebrand
Grace Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   (Here, ``Window's'' Thelma Ritter has been replaced with Queen
Latifah in a permanent Pearl Bailey snit, which is just as good.
But Latifah is just Washington's nursemaid and de facto security
guard _ all sass, no sex, like Bailey, who was always sexy even if
no one around her seemed to think so. Latifah never raises an
eyebrow when Jolie visits.)
</P>
<P>
   At this point, movies about urban maniacs are just like disaster
movies: The good ideas have mostly been done. And ``The Bone
Collector'' fancies itself in the vein of adventurously grimy
frightmares like ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not even as risky or adroit as ``Blink'' or
``Copycat.'' This is more in the dead vein of something that
belongs in NBC's now-deceased Saturday Thrillogy.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a competent theater of clichs that's been directed
by the once-exciting Phillip Noyce, who announced himself a major
suspense director with 1988's ``Dead Calm,'' then wound up making
Tom Clancy thrillers and ``Sliver.''
</P>
<P>
   This is neither a psychological thriller nor an erotic one, so
any interest in the story is purely the work of its stars.
</P>
<P>
   Noyce moves things with the dexterous thrill-seeking of a
page-turner. But even he seems to know what a dog had been made of
this adaptation of Jeffery Deaver's bestseller, so he just supplies
numerous close-ups and gratuitous non-narrative shots of who we're
supposed to believe is the film's serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   The faux killer is not nearly as ridiculous as the actual one.
</P>
<P>
   This guy whisks random New Yorkers away in his cab to various
dirty locales around the city, torturing them, stealing their bones
and convincing you that if you've seen one guy eaten alive by NYC
rats, you've seen them all.

CHEAP DIGITAL VIDEO CHANGING RULES OF FILMMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. entertainment technology
column) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A year ago, it was a novelty to make a film with
cheap digital video cameras, dump the footage into a relatively
inexpensive desktop computer for editing, then stick it on the
Internet, a digital projection system or a DVD for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   This year, well, it's not quite so novel anymore.
</P>
<P>
   On the camera side, Sony's VX-1000, Canon's XL-1 and others are
hot commodities with independent and documentary filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Those cameras allow you to dump the video onto powerful and
cheap desktop computers such as Sony's Digital Studios line and
Apple's iMac DV and G4 lines, which come with the high-speed data
ports and built-in video editing software that digital directors
need, for less than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Film Festival will have a digital film projector
for some screenings this year for the first time, with other venues
to follow soon.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the Internet, a bewildering array of start-ups _ such as
Atom Films (www.atom-films.com), Sightsound.com (sightsound.com),
iFilm (www.ifilm.com) and MediaTrip.com (www.mediatrip.com) _ are
busily buying up rights to digital shorts for distribution online.
</P>
<P>
   And now, George Lucas is using high-end digital cameras designed
by Sony and Panavision for his next Star Wars prequel, while other
notable filmmakers such as Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh and Gus Van
Sant are using or considering using digital cameras in their next
features.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a good time to be Jonathan Wells, editor of RES magazine
and director of RESFEST '99, the touring festival of digital
filmmaking that arrives in Los Angeles this week (see
www.resfest.comfor detailed schedules).
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to many independent filmmakers who used to shoot in
16mm (film) and now they shoot only in DV because they can do so
much with it,'' said Wells. Lars Von Trier's new film used 100 DV
cameras. You would never hear of someone using 100 35mm cameras in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of digital are substantial for little guys, said
Max CiVon, a producer and director of photography who is finishing
his first feature-length high-definition digital movie ``Sordid
Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the beginning of how a lot of motion pictures
will be made,'' CiVon said. ``I love film. I'm a cinematographer.
But this is very empowering. You get the high quality of film for a
lot less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to say it is the less money you have to spend,
the more powerful orginating on video becomes,'' said CiVon.
</P>
<P>
   RESFEST will show off many works that take advantage of
digital's benefits, focusing heavily on Von Trier and his Danish
school of ultrarealist cinema. But it also will feature a wide
variety of animated and live action films and shorts, shown over
five days (beginning Wednesday) in three L.A. theaters, Wells said.
And several panels will focus on the artistic and economic details
of digital filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The RESFEST is part of a larger run of meetings focused on DV. A
more technical Apple-sponsored conference will be held Monday
through Thursday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The Quick
Time Live conference revolves around the excellent Quick Time 4.0
software Apple makes to broadcast audio and video on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And during the nine-day AFI Los Angeles International Film in
late October, two days of digital filmmaking symposiums featured
directors Spike Jonze (``Being John Malkovich'') and Penelope
Spheeris (``Wayne's World''), cinematographer John Alonzo
(``Scarface'' and ``Chinatown'') and producer Kevin Foxe (``The
Blair Witch Project'').
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great creative shift,'' said Keith Hatounian,
Apple's business development manager for digital video. ``Ten years
ago, the barriers were so huge that many filmmakers never got out
there to do their projects. There's been a big shift from a
filmmaker spending all their time raising money and creativity was
second. That's been turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo sees DV more prosaically, as just another useful tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this whole new world of digital is just another form of
film stock,'' Alonzo said. ``And it's a brilliant film stock. I use
it to get a particular look.''
</P>
<P>
   Spheeris, whose ``The Decline of Western Civilization''
documentaries detailed the L.A. punk rock scene, used digital
cameras to do a similar look at the Oz Fest hard rock music tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``With digital, you can make a movie for nothing,'' Spheeris
said.
</P>
<P>
   There can be downsides to low cost, portability and ease of use,
however. Spheeris shot 55 hours of DV on the Oz Fest tour, creating
a headache when it came time to edit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's bad about DV?'' asked Barry Braverman, director of
photography on ``Bottle Rocket.'' ``There's a lot that's bad. In
the old days, you had to think before you picked up a camera. With
DV, you can shoot forever. But craft still applies. You have to
understand how to tell a story and how to use a camera
efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things, it seems, just haven't changed.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROTTEN RADIO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Neil Young can go back to Crosby, Stills and Nash for a
reunion album and tour, then perhaps one of his most noted lyrical
subjects, the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten, can go forward, into
Internet radio.
</P>
<P>
   Rotten _ who used his birth name, John Lydon, through much of
the 1980s _ is again rotten to the core in a talk show on eYada.com
(at www.eyada.com). Lydon/Rotten has had his Los Angeles home wired
so he can do the weekly broadcasts beginning Saturday from 1 to 5
p.m., Pacific Standard Time. &QL;

   They play with the card version, sleep with the stuffed version,
watch the television and movie versions.
</P>
<P>
   And now they can eat the fruity version of _ what else? _
Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   The anime's ever-expanding empire spread to grocery-store
shelves this week with the introduction of Pokemon Punch Red Rolls,
a supersweet rolled fruit snack overrun with images from the
Pokemon clan.
</P>
<P>
   For about $2.50 a box, you'll get six 3-foot rolls in plastic
pouches bearing a picture and the vital stats of one of 10
characters. The rolls themselves come on a paper strip printed with
Pokemon trivia and game tips.

   And for a limited time, the makers also are dangling a Pokemon
carrot before collectible-crazy kids: Each box will contain one of
five Pokemon trading cards, possibly even a special gold-bordered
Meowth card.

   Good luck getting out of the grocery store with just one box.

TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE BABY SPOONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by  LANG Group )  
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to tell when baby food you've heated _ especially in
the microwave _ is too hot for tiny mouths. So Questech
International has come up with a heat-sensing spoon that tells
parents when food needs to cool down before baby's asked to open
wide.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl of Too Hot colored spoons lose their pigment and become
white when used to stir food 105 F or hotter.
</P>
<P>
   The spoons, which come two per package, are made with a
co-injected plastic process that gives them a soft, flexible bowl
for baby's tender gums and a solid handle. The spoons are
dishwasher-safe and made of non-toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
   Too Hot spoons aren't available in local stores yet, but you can
order them by mail by calling Questech's customer service
department at (800) 966-5367. With shipping and handling, a pair of
the spoons will cost $7.95. &UR;  &QL;

RANGERS HAVE UNDERMINED MY BOYCOTT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then, someone wants to know what it would take to
convince me that I should stop boycotting baseball. I usually offer
up some smart-alecky reply along the lines of, ``Oh, I don't know _
how 'bout a 25-year prison term for Albert Belle?''
</P>
<P>
   I don't really know what _ if anything _ might cause me to
abandon my boycott, which has continued on and off, in some form or
other, for more than nine years. But I'm pretty sure that I'll know
it when I see it.
</P>
<P>
   And I cannot tell a lie. The Texas Rangers did something the
other day that very possibly poses the greatest threat to the
boycott since the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home-run race of 1998:
They shipped Juan Gonzalez to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   My condolences to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm well aware that the now ex-Ranger outfielder who has
won two Most Valuable Player awards is not in a class with Belle or
even Darryl Strawberry when it comes to blighting the baseball
landscape. As far as we know, Gonzalez is a law-abiding citizen and
a more or less decent human being.
</P>
<P>
   But neither is Gonzalez in a class with McGwire, Sosa or Ken
Griffey Jr. when it comes to playing and representing the game of
baseball. Gonzalez has amassed some spectacular batting statistics
over the years, but he is not the sort of inspirational player who
can lead a baseball team to championships.
</P>
<P>
   He has no use for the fans whose hard-earned bucks have made him
a millionaire. He has so little respect for the game that has
brought him fame and fortune that he refused to participate in its
All-Star Game last summer because fans declined to vote him into
the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The weeping and gnashing we've been hearing in response to
Juan's departure is baffling. Seeing Juan pack his bags and head
for the Motor City is almost enough to turn me into a Rangers fan.
</P>
<P>
   Almost _ but not quite. The local franchise has more work to do.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Rangers need to take some of the money they saved by
unloading Gonzalez and use it to sign third baseman Todd Zeile to a
new contract. Zeile is a throwback ballplayer, the kind of player
who was a staple of the game back in the days when it was known _
and deserved to be known _ as the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile plays as hard as he knows how to play, eagerly sacrifices
himself for the good of the team and generally behaves as if he's
thrilled to get paid for doing what he loves to do. If the Rangers
had 25 Zeiles on their roster, they would stand a far better chance
of someday prevailing over the otherworldly New York Yankees than
they'd have with 25 ``superstars'' such as Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's No. 1: Sign Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2: The Rangers must resist the urge to acquire the services
of free-agent pitcher Kenny Rogers. The Rangers just plain don't
need a sniveling prima donna with a knack for losing big games.
</P>
<P>
   Should the management of the Rangers, by some bizarre freak of
fate, happen to comply with these conditions _ well, I may have no
choice but to consider bringing an end to my boycott.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that so many fans became disillusioned
with baseball was the mind-boggling explosion of player salaries,
which in turn caused the mind-boggling explosion of ticket and
concession prices, parking fees, etc. The problem isn't just that
the paychecks are enormous; it's that so many of the enormous
paychecks are going to undeserving players.
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers have done in trading Gonzalez is something that
few teams have had the courage to do. They looked at an overpaid,
overrated ballplayer and said: ``You are not worth the amount of
money it will take to keep you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers decided that the team _ and its fans _ would be
better served by saying thanks and see ya later to Gonzalez than by
capitulating to the outrageous salary demand that he'll be making
when his current contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   For that, the Texas Rangers bosses deserve the fans' undying
gratitude. It was only one player, one contract, but it was a
start.
</P>
<P>
   If this keeps up, my boycott is surely doomed.

CBS MANAGES TO HOLD INTEREST WITH ROCK 'N ROLL MINISERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SHAKE, RATTLE &AMP; ROLL 
When: Sunday 9-11 p.m. and Wednesday 9-11 p.m. 
On: CBS-TV 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network television continues to mine gold from musical
nostalgia. NBC scored high ratings last year with ``The
Temptations'' and ``The '60s,'' a pair of miniseries that leaned on
music. Now CBS is in the act with ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll,'' a
surprisingly well done birth-of-rock miniseries that debuts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes this series is the many contemporary stars _
including Dicky Barrett of Boston's Mighty Mighty Bosstones _ who
sing oldie-but-goodie hits, as well as an impressive batch of
original songs penned in a retro style by Bob Dylan, Carole King,
Lieber and Stoller, Lamont Dozier, and Graham Nash.
</P>
<P>
   It should add up to more gold, because the just-released spinoff
album will also be marketed through a mail-order telephone number
displayed at the end of each segment. (Last year's soundtrack to
``The '60s'' sold 400,000 copies.) The two-part series continues
Wednesday from 9 to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts as a rock fable and ends up a morality tale
about the deviousness of a record industry that eats its young.
Mixing fact and fiction skillfully, it starts in 1955 with the
high-school attraction of two Missouri teens (energetically played
by Brad Hawkins as Tyler Hart and Bonnie Somerville as Lynn Danner)
who start a band called the HartAches. She's the brains behind it,
playing keyboards, writing the songs, and bringing in ``race
music'' cover songs by Big Joe Turner, Chuck Berry, and Little
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, Hart, is an Elvis-like hunk who sings them and is
later signed as a solo act by the fictional Czar Records, whose
boss is played to slimy perfection by James Coburn, assisted
nefariously by Dana Delaney. The Delaney character later manages
the band and has an affair with Hart, who by this time has
succumbed to the label's demand to kick his girlfriend out of the
group, since acts with females were discriminated against by many
radio stations in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins a female empowerment theme (Danner later becomes a
top songwriter in New York) and a powerful racial theme. That
starts when Hart sells out by doing a pitiful, Pat Boone-like cover
of Little Richard's ``Slippin' and Slidin','' which sells much more
than Richard's version.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way are some dynamite performances by Barrett as Bill
Haley, Terence Trent D'Arby as Jackie Wilson, B. B. King as a
fictional bluesman (playing a sharp new Dylan tune, ``Fur
Slippers''), Billy Porter (Broadway star of ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'')
as Little Richard, Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus of blink-182 as a
surf-rock duo, Chante Moore as a member of the Shirelles-like
Emeralds, and K-Ci and JoJo (of Jodeci fame) as part of a doo-wop
quartet.
</P>
<P>
   The first installment has the upbeat flavor of the Tom Hanks
film, ``That Thing You Do,'' about the early days of rock 'n' roll.
Wednesday's finale is more serious, as the issues of unwanted
pregnancy, internecine band squabbles, and fights for career
survival all become more intense. The record industry, by contrast,
moves into a bubblegum phase (the series ends just as the Beatles
are about to give rock a much-needed wake-up kick in 1964). To
escape the bubblegum, Danner and her consciousness-raising friend,
Marsha Stokes (played likably by Samaria Graham), leave their New
York homes to travel to Mississippi to march in a civil rights
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the story ends on a happy romantic note, but not
before a few tears are shed. Overall, it's a compelling tale and is
laudably honest about the shaking, rattling, and rolling of those
early years.

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest that the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Even with electrical power out, the pilots could have continued
flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables rather than
a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system failed, the
hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the engines were
running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

JOBLESS PAY MAY AID PARENTAL LEAVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Taking time off from work to care for a newborn or a
newly adopted child is a luxury for lots of workers. Many folks
can't afford to because it's typically unpaid leave.
</P>
<P>
   However, it soon may be more affordable to take time off. The
Labor Department is expected to change the rules for unemployment
compensation insurance, allowing states to pay workers who take
time off from work to care for a newborn or newly adopted child.
</P>
<P>
   The change would allow workers to get a weekly unemployment
check even if they aren't available for work when they apply for
unemployment compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, federal law generally has required workers to be
available to work in order to collect unemployment compensation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Labor Department has allowed some exceptions to
that rule, such as allowing laid-off workers to forgo a job search
if they're subject to a recall.
</P>
<P>
   But when states began inquiring whether workers have to be
available for work after having a baby to collect benefits, the
Labor Department began studying the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal isn't set in stone yet. Once the regulations are
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, they'll have to go
before public review.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is reportedly support for the change from the
Clinton administration, and several states have been toying with
the idea of making it easier for workers to collect unemployment
benefits upon the birth of a baby or adoption of a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiative will help parents to be with their newborns and
newly adopted children,'' said Labor Department spokeswoman Chung
Seto in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MOVEMENT STARTED IN VERMONT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate started when the Vermont Legislature was considering
whether to give unemployment benefits to workers who weren't
available to work because of the birth of a baby, said Maurice
Emsellem, staff attorney for the National Employment Law Project, a
nonprofit advocacy group for low-wage workers that's based in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Emsellem said a local Labor Department official said that wasn't
allowed under the rules.
</P>
<P>
   That caused the Labor Department in Washington to intervene and
it is expected to give states broad latitude to give benefits to
new parents. The length of benefits and other eligibility questions
would be left up to the states.
</P>
<P>
   There are some federal rules that govern unemployment
compensation, but the states have wide latitude to decide
eligibility and other rules.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, several other states, including Massachusetts,
Washington and Maryland have proposed legislation to broaden the
use of unemployment compensation for family leave, Emsellem said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will be a boost for state campaigns to get going,
Emsellem said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PAY IDEA GETS WIDE SUPPORT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time off for family and medical leave is a popular issue with
voters. According to a poll taken last year by the National
Partnership for Women &AMP; Families in Washington, D.C., 79 percent of
workers favor government efforts to set minimum standards for time
off.
</P>
<P>
   However, extending unemployment compensation to new parents
doesn't look like it's a hot issue for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit the radar screen, said Ray Sullivan, spokesman for
Texas Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   But there are 13 months before the next legislative session
begins, so it could come up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit the radar screen of the Republican Party either,
said Robert Black, the party's spokesman in Austin, Texas. However,
Black said he suspects the party would not be in favor of the
government paying people during maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Levy, legal director of the Texas AFL-CIO, said the issue
of giving benefits to new parents will definitely be on the agenda
during the next session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight has to be waged,'' he said. ``Too many workers are
losing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of the worst states in providing unemployment
benefits, he said, making it hard for low-wage, part-time and
short-term employees to collect benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, Texas also doesn't allow part-time
employees to collect benefits if they're just looking for a
part-time job, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas system was designed for a male breadwinner who is in a
job for a long time. The rules simply haven't kept up with the
changing workplace, and it's time they changed, Levy said.

CUTENESS HELD TO A MINIMUM IN NEW `ANNIE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANNIE 
Starring: Audra McDonald, Victor Garber, Alicia Morton, Kathy
Bates, Alan Cumming, Kristin Chenoweth 
Directed by: Rob Marshall 
On: ABC 
Time: Sunday at 7 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few Broadway musical tunes are more cloying and annoying than
``Tomorrow,'' the insanely optimistic little ditty whose strains
can turn a harmless department store into a torture chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But the new TV production of ``Annie,'' the Broadway show that
made ``Tomorrow'' never die, manages to minimize the saccharine
potential in the tale of Little Orphan Annie and her plucky
positivism. This ``Annie,'' presented as part of ``The Wonderful
World of Disney,'' is a short, not-too-sweet, and easy to swallow
bit of family entertainment. Thanks to some savvy plot
simplification, the excision of a few songs, and swift pacing, it
has been downsized into a nice little TV musical that gets in and
gets out without an excess of sentimentality or garish spectacle.
Directed by Rob Marshall, choreographer and co-director of the
recent ``Cabaret'' revival, the Disney ``Annie'' is plain, playful,
and surprisingly painless.
</P>
<P>
   The made-for-TV movie, which airs Sunday night at 7 on ABC, is
based on the 1977 Tony-winning musical, which produced a dull
screen adaptation in 1982 directed by John Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Originally known through the 1920s comic strip ``Little Orphan
Annie,'' the familiar story is an American fairy tale with a
Dickensian twist, as our redheaded heroine travels from an abusive
orphanage in Depression-era New York into the mansion of a famous
billionaire. The rich man, Oliver ``Daddy'' Warbucks, falls for
Annie and longs to adopt her, but she's convinced her parents will
come looking for her. When Warbucks offers $50,000 to find them,
Miss Hannigan, the miserable orphanage matron, schemes with her
slimy brother and his girlfriend to get the money. And that's it,
until the inevitable happy ending (it's set during Christmas time,
after all). Thanks to assistance from President Franklin Roosevelt
(whose subplot has been chopped down for TV), the once beleaguered
Annie and her lovable mutt, Sandy, wind up sitting quite pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The songs in ``Annie'' are nothing special, from the ordinary
``It's a Hard Knock Life'' to the cliched homage to Manhattan,
``NYC.'' You begin to feel tired of them before they've even ended
for the first time. But the dancing is bouncy, the multicultural
casting adds freshness, and the performances are appealing. Annie
is played by a straight-haired newcomer named Alicia Morton who
manages to work against the expected Shirley Temple cutesy-poo
business. Her rendition of ``Tomorrow'' is low-key and bittersweet.
Andrea McArdle, the original Annie, appears briefly during the
``NYC'' sequence, a reminder of perkier and more cartoonish Annies
from productions past.
</P>
<P>
   The villains are the most fun, of course, and a simplistic
musical like ``Annie'' rides on the comic opera of its bad guys.
Kathy Bates steals the show as Miss Hannigan, but without any of
the overacting that ``steals the show'' implies. Bates, who
successfully finesses her limited singing voice, appears to be
having a good time playing ``villain lite,'' wringing the neck of a
doll and forcing the girls to say ``I love you Miss Hannigan'' when
she knows they despise her. She is equaled by Alan Cumming, the
slinky MC in Marshall's ``Cabaret,'' who plays her criminal brother
with relish. They make ``Easy Street'' into a juicy vamp.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the good guys don't hold their own in this production.
Victor Garber is a solid Warbucks, and Audra McDonald glows as
Warbucks's admiring assistant. She adds depth to her songs, and to
one of the show's least interesting roles. She becomes the happy
mother in the family of choice that ``Annie'' celebrates.

CHISHOLM TRAIL IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN IN LURE OF TOURISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN WOOD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The state of Texas spends tens of millions
of dollars to lure millions of tourists who spend billions of
dollars soaking up the state's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the state hawks itself and its heritage to visitors
from as far away as Europe and Japan, it has done almost nothing to
promote what is probably one of the most famous elements of its
cowboy history: the Chisholm Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We market the cowboy thing,'' said Doug Harman, chief
executive of the Fort Worth Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. But ``the
central historical element of the cowboy history of Texas is not
being used for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few historic markers statewide that mention the
trail. There's also a handful of commemorative markers that were
minted nearly 70 years ago placed in some towns along the trail,
which stretched from Brownsville to the Red River.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing else has been done to commemorate the trail on a
state level. The Chisholm Trail isn't on the list of 10 Texas
Travel Trails established in 1968 as part of Hemisfair in San
Antonio and maintained by the Texas Historical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't sit well with Harman, who has led the bureau's
campaign to turn the city's Western heritage into tourism dollars.
He is leading a campaign to make the Chisholm Trail an official
Texas Travel Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Harman has recruited towns, cities and businesses along the
trail to his cause, including Houston, Austin and the King Ranch.
He has also recruited students from the University of Texas at
Arlington to do research on the trail, information that he plans to
use in a brochure for travel planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a tourism standpoint, (the Chisholm Trail) oozes Texas,''
said John Clary, economic development director for the City of
Lockhart and one of Harman's allies. ``It's all the things Texas is
known for. It's cowboys, cattle and longhorns. It's cattle drives
and dust. It's having meals on the chuck wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the state's lack of promotion even more puzzling,
Harman and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm surprised as a lot of people would be,'' said
Richard Francaviglia, director for the Center of Southwest Studies
and a professor of history at the University of Texas at Arlington.
His class is helping Harman with the project. ``We're going to
rectify that by addressing that oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Travel Trails are loop drives that were established as
``planned pleasure driving,'' according to a state brochure. The
Texas Historical Commission oversees these trails even though some
of them, like the Texas Lakes Trail (which includes Fort
Worth-Dallas) and the Texas Tropical Trail, have little or no
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The Chisholm Trail, on the other hand, played a key role in
Texas' development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a part of our history and our heritage that
deserves some recognition by the state,'' said David Kercheval,
executive director of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers
Foundation. ``The cattle industry, from the time of the Civil War,
especially to the turn of the century, was the dominant industry in
the state. It helped us develop to what we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Texas Travel Trail, the Chisholm would be included in the
state's marketing materials and would be eligible for state money.
The Texas Historical Commission got $500,000 from the Texas
Department of Transportation, for example, for four heritage
trails, including the Texas Forts Trail and the Texas Independence
Trail. Some of that money went for signs and marketing materials.
</P>
<P>
   Signs and marketing are key to attracting tourists to visit not
only the trail, but the towns along the trail. Towns like Lockhart,
where a number of the cattle drives assembled and where some of the
drovers lived; Temple, home to the Santa Fe Depot and Railroad
Museum, and Belton, with its Chisholm Trail exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   These towns, which are off the beaten path, have the Western
heritage and exhibits that tourism officials say tourists _
especially foreign tourists _ go crazy for.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to come for the Western experience,'' said Eve
Gardiner, of First Public Relations, the British agency that
represents the state's tourism office. ``I think this (Chisholm
Trail) tour kind of fills that quite nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be a hard sell without markers and without marketing
support from the state, according to Terry Stine, a travel
consultant who has worked with cities around Texas to develop
package tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so conducive to packaging,'' Stine said. ``You need to
have something that is truly of interest to the traveler and easy
to navigate. With the Chisholm Trail it needs to be clearly marked
to get from one place to another... Without the markers and the
signage, you've got a challenge for customers right there. You get
the signage from the state and the interest level increases from a
usability standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Historical Commission has applied for grant money that
will allow it to do a study of the trail and the communities along
it, said Mario Sanchez, heritage tourism program director of the
commission.

CATHOLIC, LUTHERAN ACCORD A MOMENTOUS STEP TOWARD UNITING
CHRISTIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are we saved by grace or by works? Or both? The question caused
the Protestant Reformation, bloody religious wars and church
divisions extending to this day.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, Roman Catholics and most of the world's
Lutherans signed a statement that seemed to sweep away 482 years of
often-violent disagreement over how one gains salvation.
</P>
<P>
   They signed a Joint Declaration in Augsberg, Germany, declaring
that God grants salvation as an unearned gift but that one's
salvation also is reflected in good works.
</P>
<P>
   What was that? Roman Catholics seem to be saying that Martin
Luther was right, that we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Lutherans, who have denounced any hint that
``works'' are a part of salvation, are saying that works, indeed,
are necessary fruits of the free gift of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this joint agreement will ultimately lead to the
reunification of the Catholics and Lutherans who were so rudely
split during the Protestant Reformation is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   But they certainly are getting closer together.
</P>
<P>
   On the part of Catholics, many leaders are saying they have
always recognized that salvation is a free gift of God, but they
strongly believe that good works must be done or the salvation is
not valid.
</P>
<P>
   Lutheran leaders say they have always believed that good works
are a reflection of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Vatican's Pontifical
Council for Promoting Christian Unity, signed the agreement for the
world's almost 1 billion Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   All but 3 million of the world's 61.5 million Lutherans were
represented by Bishop Christian Krause, president of the Lutheran
World Federation, and by the Rev. Ishmael Noko, the federation's
general secretary. The statement declares:
</P>
<P>
   ``By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not
because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and
receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and
calling us to good works.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the agreement means the whole Protestant Reformation
spawned by an ugly exchange between Martin Luther and the Roman
Catholic hierarchy was, perhaps, a misunderstanding. But what a
momentous misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. H. George Anderson, presiding bishop of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, the nation's largest Lutheran body,
with 5.2 million members, issued a statement calling it a
significant breakthrough toward reunion of the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman Catholics and Lutherans are saying, `We don't have any
church-dividing difference between us any longer on the teaching of
justification by grace through faith. There is a difference in how
we interpret the Christian life after being saved by grace through
faith. There is where discussions will go on.'''
</P>
<P>
   But some conservative Lutherans, who were not a part of the
``Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification,'' say it is
not a breakthrough at all.
</P>
<P>
   They claim the Roman Catholic Church hasn't changed its position
that works are a part of salvation and that Lutherans have
compromised Martin Luther's stands in signing the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the Joint Declaration to be a surrender of the
most important truth in God's word,'' said the Rev. A.L. Barry,
president of the 2.6-million- member Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod. ``The declaration is a clear, stunning departure from the
Reformation and thus is contrary to what it means to be a Lutheran
Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Texas pastor, the Rev. John Tietjen, who formerly was a
bishop in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, said the
agreement could be momentous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think we have transcended the differences over how
we are saved,'' said Tietjen, pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in
Fort Worth. ``My fond hope is that our long dream of unity will
come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Beaumont, pastor of St. Bartholomew Catholic
Church in Fort Worth, echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to quit fighting,'' he said. ``I'm totally convinced
God wants his church to be united.''

AND ABOUT THAT E-MAIL YOU SENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: As an outside sales representative with a
company computer, I sometimes have to return my machine for repair
or an upgrade. Some other sales people and I were discussing how
best to erase personal information like resumes, sexist jokes,
etc., saved on the hard drive in a Word file. We have been opening
the file, deleting the copy and saving the blank page. Then we
delete the empty file. How secure is this?
</P>
<P>
   _ Paranoid
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PARANOID: Why don't you just post your resume on the
company bulletin board? Do not, repeat, do not ever put something
you don't want anybody else to see on a company computer. And
never, ever assume that just because you delete a file it's going
to go away forever.
</P>
<P>
   When a file is ``deleted'' it usually goes to the Windows
Recycle Bin, which is just a place to stick stuff you're thinking
about tossing for good. When you empty the Recycle Bin, the files
are merely hidden and the space they take up on the hard drive is
marked available for the next thing that needs to be saved. They
can be recovered with dozens of different file-utility programs
until they are overwritten.
</P>
<P>
   Deleting the copy, then saving the file is a nice trick most
people don't think about, but make sure Word isn't saving back
versions. If ``Versions'' is grayed out when you open the File
menu, you're relatively safe.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, your boss says she'd like to see you about something
important as soon as you've finished reading this column.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When I look up things using a search engine
like Yahoo!, in the middle of the list of displayed sites there is
an ad for Amazon.com. I don't know how to move or get rid of it.
Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ad Infinitum
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INF: Get used to it. Do you really think all those
Webmeisters are running search sites because they're committed to
the free flow of information? The only free flow most of them care
about is the unrestricted flood of dollars, deutsche marks and
drachmas into their already bulging bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ads on the Internet are here to stay, and Web-search sites are
getting very good at it, basing the banner you see on the query you
make. You can try ad-blocking software like At Guard
(www.atguard.com), but the people who design the ads always seem to
be about a half-step ahead of that technology. My advice: Work on
getting rid of commercials during the Super Bowl. That might be
easier.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I keep all your columns. Problem is, newsprint
gets old and yellow. Solution: Start a Web page, and that way
readers can look up all your old archives. As brilliant as you are,
it must be a budget thing, so maybe we should start a fund drive.

   DEAR A: Just make sure the contributions are in cash, preferably
small denominations. And they said there was nothing we could learn
from the Nixon administration. Ha! I also learned that it's best to
let your henchmen take care of the dirty work, which is exactly
what maintaining a Web page turns out to be. Find me a Haldeman and
an Ehrlichman to take the rap when we miss an update, and we'll
talk. What's more, I'm sure that if the powers that be thought
there was a single dime to be made that way, they'd have squeezed
the blood out of that particular turnip long ago.

`BLUE' WILL RETURN TO TUESDAY SLOT, BUT MANY VIEWERS HAVE MOVED ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy, now?
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco and his ``NYPD Blue'' crew have their time slot
back, having negotiated in the press what they apparently couldn't
in the glass offices of ABC. The cop show returns in January at 9
p.m. CST Tuesdays, but only after much whining that the series
couldn't possibly move to another day to make room for the new
hotshot ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise moves on both sides: Bochco and Dennis Franz and Rick
Schroder for articulating their ``hurt'' and ``disappointment'' and
coming across as wounded victims; ABC for realizing that if
``Blue'' were forced to find a new night, it would have to work
harder to retain its audience (14 million, down from a peak of 23
million).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue'' is on its last legs, and ABC knows it. Bochco may know
it, too. But with all his past successes _ he is, after all, the
doyen of the current crop of hustling TV producers _ it's harder to
accept the unacceptable. If ``Blue'' left the air today, Bochco
would have nothing in prime time. Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have remained for ``Blue's'' second resurrection,
the one without Jimmy Smits, must admit to its sense of sameness,
its clever but constant revamping of an old formula. Emotionally,
the series is flat and spent and distant, like a lover no longer
intrigued but hanging around because she can.
</P>
<P>
   Franz's Detective Andy Sipowicz and his combative attitude won
yet another Emmy last season, which was surprising considering how
he has become something of a caricature of the gruff veteran street
detective with a big bark and soft heart. Will he hit the bottle?
Will he play the bigot card? We know the drill.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder got fine press as Smits' replacement, but was it due in
part to critics being shocked that he wasn't an utter failure?
</P>
<P>
   Bochco was supposed to be supervising ``Blue'' and the ``Hill
Street Blues'' update, ``Brooklyn South,'' if it weren't for those
pesky Nielsen ratings. ``South'' was signature Bochco _ fast-paced,
large cast, gritty, more about character than crime. It was pumped
with realism and written with an astute sense of the police
profession as more of a calling than a 9-to-5 job.
</P>
<P>
   To Bochco, police are the most conflicted people on earth, and
perhaps the most misunderstood. They pack on their armor each day
and hit the streets to serve and protect for low pay and little
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``South'' was so mushy-eyed in its view of police officers that
no one believed it, even though Bochco, master seller, managed to
lure a number of eyeballs to the premiere with the most explosive
series opening I've ever witnessed. That viewers never returned
says something about ``South's'' miscalculation, and why ``Blue''
and Bochco's sociological cinema have simultaneously run their
courses. Which isn't a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   What has always unnerved me about Bochco's products are their
them-vs.-us mentality, and not police against scum but middle class
against the underprivileged. Digest enough Bochco shows, and you
start to avoid certain neighborhoods and look over your shoulder
wondering what desperate crackhead is about to put a pistol to your
head.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the recent two-part episode about race on Lifetime's
``Any Day Now,'' I was reminded how ambitious and gutsy this drama
continues to be, and how much easier it is for shows like ``Blue''
and even David E. Kelley's crop of series to deal with class and
race issues as long as they never leave the criminal justice
system. (Or an institution, like a hospital, where Bochco's
upcoming ``City of Angels'' is set.)
</P>
<P>
   Bochco needs to reinvent himself as a producer if he is what he
said he is over the summer, a TV guy giving us real life. But that
may come only by escaping network TV for the creative freedom
offered by cable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the whole ABC diss, you have to wonder whether the fans
who have supported his body of work were more concerned about
``Blue'' dying a quicker death than they were upset over the
apparent lack of respect from ABC. Since when has a network
programmed by heart and not profit, making its cinematic chess
moves for the good of societal needs and because a series
``deserves respect,'' as Franz uttered in a published report?
</P>
<P>
   Respect? In network TV?
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, ``Once and Again'' would have been shelved
ruthlessly Nov. 9 to make way for ``Blue'' had it not generated a
nice little audience (plus a lot of oh-what-a-good-show buzz from
critics).
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the point a fellow cyclist at the YMCA made
recently. ``Blue,'' she said, is no longer gripping, no longer
provocative, no longer a generator of the kind of emotional sparks
that once claimed her attention. It's now just a world of cops and
perps that she's seen many times before.
</P>
<P>
   I have to agree.

THE SKINNY ON RAWHIDE CHEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you look down at your dog gleefully tucking into a big
rawhide chew, you might think, ``It must be really bad for her if
she likes it this much.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, fear not. The lowdown on rawhides is that, for the most
part, they're OK. Still, there are a few things you should know
about these dried tissue treats (yes, they are basically made from
the ``hypodermic interstitial tissue,'' or underskin, of cows).
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Lisa Freeman, a veterinary clinical
nutritionist at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine,
``There are concerns about dogs who chew just a little and then
swallow.'' When dogs bolt large pieces of food, they are in danger
of having chunks of rawhide become obstructions in the digestive
tract.
</P>
<P>
   But even that does not happen very often. Dr. John Berg,
chairman of the department of clinical sciences at Tufts, is the
man who scrubs up and operates on pets to remove the strange things
they've eaten. He has been doing this for 18 years and has yet to
surgically eliminate rawhide from a dog's gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've removed cloth, balls, rocks _ those kinds of things,''
Berg says. ``But I've yet to see a rawhide stuck in a dog. They are
pretty digestible.'' In one famous case at the hospital, Berg
operated to dislodge several toys from a dog's intestine _ on
X-ray, the shapes of the plastic scorpion, soldier, and lizard
could clearly be seen. In another, he and his associates counted
2,000 pebbles that they hauled out of one pet's innards.
</P>
<P>
   Berg cautions, though, that there probably are surgeons who have
had to deal with rawhide-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they tend not to gum up your dog's system, are they
fattening?
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight rawhide is not particularly fattening,'' says
Freeman, who adds that there are many other kinds of chews on the
market now, some made of such things as potato, that can be loaded
with calories.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that coated or basted rawhide chews may be high
in salt, and owners of animals with underlying conditions, such as
heart problems, should use caution and discuss the issue with their
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   As most pet owners know, packaging often fails to reveal
ingredients or details of processing, but that is changing. In the
October issue of Tufts's Your Dog newsletter, an article recommends
looking for chews processed in the United States, where
manufacturing regulations are strict.
</P>
<P>
   The dog training team of Brian Kilcommons and Sarah Wilson,
authors of ``Good Owners, Great Dogs'' and ``Paws to Consider,''
concurs. ``Look for US rawhide,'' Wilson says. ``It'll be cleaner,
since you know it wasn't sprayed down while being shipped. And you
should look for unbleached rawhide. Manufacturers are getting savvy
and are printing on the packaging when (the product is)
chemical-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilcommons warns that people should watch for dogs that become
possessive with these coveted treats. Dogs may either snap at
someone or bolt a large chew in an effort to protect it. He
suggests not giving them to a pet who behaves this way. ``Only if
the dog bought the bone can he claim the bone,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There is one strange cautionary note. Last spring, a young husky
was rushed to the emergency room at Tufts, dying from a massive
infection. Ultimately, it was determined that the culprit was a
long-buried rawhide in the backyard that had been dug up and eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Moist chews can pick up bacteria, so it's best to make them an
indoor toy. Most vets had never heard of such a thing happening
before, which indicates it's rare. But it's certainly worth
avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a little information, you can relax . . . and pass
the chewie.

   EASTEUROPE-BRIDGES (Esztergom, Hungary) _ Here in Esztergom, the
ruined bridge is a harbinger of a new spirit of amity: Hungary and
the Slovak Republic, both eager to earn entry to the European Union
by showing that they can embrace their neighbors, have decided to
put aside centuries of ethnic animosity and rebuild a ruined bridge
by the year 2001. But the long, cranky negotiations between
Bulgaria and Romania over where to build one more bridge on their
600-mile river border shows how difficult it is for the old order
to give way to the new: the Bulgarians want a bridge on the west
end of the border to zip trucks quickly from Asia Minor to western
Europe; the Romanians are happy with the old bridge at Giurgiu on
the road to Moscow, its former No. 1 ally, because they collect
bigger road-use fees by forcing trucks to detour several hundred
miles east.

hourly wages grew just 1 cent to $13.37, a sharp slowdown from
September, when wages posted a 5 cent jump, the biggest since

VIEW: LIFE ON THE HIGH-FAT BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 7) 
(jt) 
 By LAURA ZIGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say there are no sure bets in this world, but I disagree.
I'd stake my life on the fact that right now, somewhere in America,
a man is telling a woman he's going on a diet.
</P>
<P>
   One of those ridiculous all-fat, all-meat, all-cheese,
all-you-can-eat diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-fat, all-meat, all-cheese, all-you-can-eat diet? You're
sure you're ready for such drastic deprivation?'' this woman will
say with obvious sarcasm. Call her old-fashioned, but she remembers
Diet Workshop. The old Weight Watchers (pre-Duchess of York,
pre-Nutra-Sweet, pre-Snackwell's). She remembers when the gerund
``dieting'' meant ``eating small portions of low-calorie, low-fat,
yucky-tasting foods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the whole point!'' the man will say, missing her point.
``I won't be deprived! I get to eat all my favorite foods. Eggs.
Bacon. Sausage. Steak. Sour cream. Nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   She will be confused. She thinks she remembers him eating an egg
once, but it was poached, not fried, and he left half of it on his
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never eat anything like that,'' she'll say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly! Now I'll get to eat the things I love that I never
get to eat. The only thing I won't be able to eat is bread.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you love bread,'' she'll say. An understatement. He loves
bread and muffins and bagels and toast and cereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So? Dieting is about sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   She will remain unconvinced. ``What about rice?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No rice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Potatoes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pasta?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No pasta. No sugar of any kind. No fruit, even.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No fruit?'' she'll hiss. ``The next thing you'll tell me is
you can't eat salad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can, but it's limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Limited? Suddenly, the only thing stupider than the fact that
the man standing before her is about to embark on this extremely
absurd or absurdly extreme diet is the fact that the man isn't even
fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're not even fat!''
</P>
<P>
   He will be gleeful, joyful, proud. ``Oh yes I am!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?'' She'll hiss again when he pulls up his T-shirt to
reveal a stomach the size of one of her hips on a good day.
``That's not fat, that's skin,'' she'll say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skin with fat underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're ill.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll push and poke at this alleged fat, then fail in an
overzealous attempt to grab a full handful of it. ``Say what you
will, but I'm fat, and I'm not going to take it anymore,'' he'll
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``And your solution is to eat grease and lard and butter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he will say, as if no truer words were about to be
spoken. ``I'm going to fight fat with fat.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm fat and I'm not going to take it anymore. I'm going to fight
fat with fat.
</P>
<P>
   Do I detect the faint but unmistakable ring of a battle cry? Has
Iron John-Robert Bly come out with a diet book?
</P>
<P>
   It's a given, of course, that this new warrior _ this fighter of
fat with fat _ will most likely be a man, since, let's face it, few
women are arrogant enough to believe an idiotic diet like this can
work. Not to mention the fact that it is men now who have become
completely obsessed about their weight, and walk around all day
obsessing about how fat they think they are:
</P>
<P>
   Do these pants make my thighs look big? I feel so bloated today.
Can I get that dressing on the side?
</P>
<P>
   I can't, in fact, remember the last time a woman said she was on
a diet. Women, it seems, have just stopped eating. They have gone
quietly into that dark night of weight loss with an equally radical
and equally misguided notion: not eating is better than dieting
because dieting means you actually have to eat food!
</P>
<P>
   Men, as we all know, are different. They don't go quietly into
anything. If they're on a diet, the whole world has to know about
it. Which is why you can't stuff your face with rice cakes these
days without hearing about how the country's bowels are in an
uproar over this latest media-driven fad: the Fat Diet.
</P>
<P>
   Enough about the medical controversy: the health-benefit versus
health-risk debate. Enough about which used-car salesman of the
diet industry (Robert Atkins, Dean Ornish, Suzanne Somers) is less
untrustworthy. If you're a woman who is involved with a man on this
sort of diet, you must consider this:
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment. And the expense.
</P>
<P>
   On every trip to the supermarket, he _ the nonfat fat man, your
beloved _ will fill the cart with pornographic food of every kind.
Eggs. Bacon. Sausage. Eggs. Steak. Chops. Eggs. Cheese. Cream
cheese. Sour cream. Whipping cream. Nuts. Eggs. You might as well
be sitting in the cart naked; that's the level of horror your
fellow shoppers will regard you with. You will try to block their
view as your fat-laden groceries parade themselves obscenely down
the strip of moving rubber at the cash register. You'll elbow him:
Help me! For heaven's sake, help me! Where's all your fat when we
really need it? But he's too busy breaking into a can of cashews
and tearing open a packet of beef jerky with his teeth to notice
the judgmental world around you.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the beginning. Back home, during the two days this
$100 worth of high-fat food lasts, the fat-bath will continue. In
the mornings, he'll cook bacon and sausage, then make himself an
omelet with cream cheese. When you bite into your dry bagel, he'll
smile, grease dripping from his chin, and throw a half cup of sour
cream onto his plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can eat all the fat I want,'' he'll bray smugly for the
millionth time since starting this moronic regimen.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner have the breakfast dishes been degreased than lunch
will begin. Egg salad and tuna salad with as much Hellman's as the
bowl can hold. Or hot dogs _ six of them. Eight of them.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner? Steak. And a salad: one lettuce leaf, one cup each
Russian dressing, hard-boiled eggs, avocado and grated cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Dessert (and I'm not kidding): a bowl of whipped heavy cream
(giant spoon optional).
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the evening, when he's not fat-loading, he'll
stand in front of you, pulling his shirt up over his head: ``Do I
look like I've lost weight? Do I look any thinner?'' When you don't
answer, you'll catch him in front of the bathroom mirror or in
front of any semi-reflective surface (window, sliding-glass door,
toaster) looking at himself sideways. The scale may not show any
real change, but you'll think he's smaller. Or maybe the body just
naturally shrinks slightly during the final stages of
arteriosclerosis, right before it goes into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   At night in bed before falling asleep, when he whispers, ``What
do you want for breakfast?'' you'll roll over in the dark and feel
your own fat with your hands and realize that you've gained weight
on his diet. You are eating the bacon and the eggs now, too, and
the steak and the cheese and the nuts. Only you never gave up the
toast. Or the bagels. Or the Honey Bunches of Oats.

   Now you're really starting to worry about what will become of
the two of you weight-wise: Will you both get really fat on this
diet? Will you gain weight while he (the ultimate injustice) loses
weight? Then suddenly he'll come down with a fever of 103 and a
virulent case of pneumonia. Three visits to the local emergency
ward, a one-night overnight stay and six days of eating nothing but
soup and Jell-O will leave him drawn, gaunt, hollow-eyed. He'll
never look happier. He'll cough and lift his T-shirt over his head,
and you'll just know he's beaming under there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look! I've lost 15 pounds!'' he'll say. And he will have.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted from the exertion, he'll fall back asleep. Which will
be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have work to do.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to rid your kitchen of all the fat foods you and he
will never eat again.

   NEW YORK _ It was just after 2 p.m. last Tuesday, and William
Calvert, a 30-year-old designer of the kind of clean-looking
evening dresses that fashion editors invariably call modern, was
waiting for his next fitting. An assistant to the designer sat
hunched over a phone, rolling her eyes. Seems there was a problem
with the security guard downstairs. A little matter of building
policy: no dogs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say he's a client,'' Calvert said. ``Say he's a celebrity
client. You'd think for the money we're spending ...'' He trailed
off. Calvert was one of 23 designers making dog-and-people clothes
for a dog fashion show called Canine Couture on Wednesday night at
the Kit Kat Klub. It was a benefit for the Design Industries
Foundation Fighting AIDS, sponsored by Pets.com, the new Web child
of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The client in question, eventually released by the downstairs
security guard, turned out to be a sad- and lovely-eyed Gordon
setter named Scout, for whom Calvert had planned a taffeta jumpsuit
with contrasting cuffs and _ wait for it _ an obi.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of pop-cultural kismet, many of the same Canine
Couture designers, including Todd Oldham, Donna Karan and Nicole
Miller, were making dog-and-people clothes for another dog fashion
show, Paws for Style, held the following night. It, too, was a
benefit and promotional party, this time organized by a new
magazine about pets named Animal Fair, as in Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Two dog fashion shows in one week? Has the world gone barking
mad?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it goes beyond finding a new market for fashion,''
said Ingrid Sischy, the editor in chief of Interview magazine, who
is planning a special pets issue in May. ``I mean, dogs are the
only ones who aren't running around SoHo in all these labels. At
least not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a moment,'' she continued. ``People are clearly
obsessed with their animals, and that's a good thing.'' Sketching
out the ingredients for her special issue, she said: ``We'll do
animals in art, music, film. We'll do star stories, consciousness
stories, the whole Interview thing, and there'll be a CD with
animal songs chosen by Elton John. It's going to be big.''
</P>
<P>
   Big, indeed. The dog as metaphor seems rampant just now. Naomi
Wolf, the feminist author, was reported by Time magazine last week
to be exhorting Al Gore to find the canine within and become an
Alpha male, even as Susan Faludi asked readers of ``Stiffed''
(William Morrow &AMP; Co.), her latest book, to ponder the sad fate of
so many American men who've lost the ability to act alpha doggy.
(Ms. Wolf said later that she mentioned the Alpha thing to Gore
only in passing.) Meanwhile, in Manhattan, real dogs are being
asked to express their inner Naomi Campbells.
</P>
<P>
   Have you been to Barneys lately? So much animalia! There are
$225 hand-beaded cashmere dog sweaters by Fifi and Romeo, and $95
woven-leather dog beds from Henry Beguelin. The first cover of the
giddy and appealing Animal Fair, which calls itself a ``lifestyle
magazine,'' features Renee Zellweger and her retriever-collie mix,
Dylan. Inside, Brad Pitt poses with his Weimaraner, Purdy, and
Wendy Wasserstein writes about her calico cat, Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Is it all random, or are deeper forces at work, perhaps the
product of ``morphic fields,'' or telepathic links between pets and
humans, as described by the British biologist Rupert Sheldrake in
his new book, ``Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home''
(Crown Publishers)?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the shifting roles of the modern dog _ from suburban
buddy to stylish accessory to pampered child and, now, well-dressed
helpmate, an equal in every way. Beyond the still-burgeoning market
for services _ dog spas and dog gyms, doggy day care and doggy
menus (Michael Jordan's: The Steak House is selling roasted shank
bones in three sizes as a take-home treat for Fido) _ is the vast
universe of style, whose surface has only been scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ford, who lives with a Jack Russell named John, pointed the
way a couple of years ago, with items like a 1970s-style acrylic
dog bed and a black goat-hair dog blanket. Now, every designer
worth his or her logo sells dog carriers, leashes and collars. At
Fetch, a dog-and-cat emporium on Greenwich Avenue that looks like a
Pottery Barn for pets, you can buy sleek formica and
stainless-steel food bowls, which look so right beside your sleek
midcentury-modern furniture. Also at Fetch: dog coats by WagWear
with cargo pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reaction to all those recent books about the
psychology of dogs,'' said Henry Alford, a contributor to Animal
Fair. ``We know our dogs have complicated emotional lives. Now we
have to think of them as potential canvases for our
self-expression, too. As in, `If I just rethink his hair, I think
my Doberman can carry 12 pages in Vogue.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You've decorated your apartment, you've dressed your partner
and/or child, now your gaze turns, uh, floorward,'' Alford said.

<P>
   In 1996, Marjorie Garber, the director of the center for
literary and cultural studies at Harvard University, published a
book called ``Dog Love'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster); two years later,
Caroline Knapp, the author of the memoir ``Drinking: A Love
Story,'' came out with ``Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between
People and Dogs'' (Dial Press) Both books, in different ways,
suggested that people, especially urban professional people, need
dogs more than ever, as sources of uncritical affection in an
increasingly unaffectionate world.
</P>
<P>
   Both authors are nonplussed by the notion of dog fashion shows.
``If you don't compromise the dog, what the hell?'' Ms. Knapp said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garber said: ``Fashion is about pushing the envelope. People
wear dog collars and dog tags. I don't think the reverse is
necessarily a sign of decadence. In any case, I think that dogs
bear putting in the spotlight better than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last Tuesday evening, Wendy Diamond, 28, the voluble and
animated editor of Animal Fair, prepped Eric Nies, the M.C. for her
magazine's dog fashion show two nights later at the Puck Building.
Nies, a semicelebrity from ``The Real World'' and ``The Grind'' on
MTV, exuded an amiable, slouchy self-confidence. He listened with a
half-grin on his unshaven face as Ms. Diamond ran through the
program. ``Kate Spade is walking,'' said Ms. Diamond, her Siberian
husky-blue eyes wide, ``so you might make a funny comment like,
`All dogs should be spayed!''' She laughed wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Nies' business partner and childhood buddy, Robert J. Harper
Jr., said: ``Eric is the best ad-libber in the business. No
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diamond was wearing a red-and-black plaid swing coat trimmed
and lined with fake mink. Like those mother-daughter dresses from
the 1950s, it is part of an ensemble, and comes with a matching
canine version. It is one of the many products being developed by
Ms. Diamond to sell on her magazine's Web site. Marc Bouwer, who
has made clothes for Shania Twain, will also contribute to the
site. (``I'll do a lot of stretch, a lot of pleather,'' said
Bouwer, who has a Yorkie named Goliath and who says he has trouble
finding masculine, guylike clothes for his dog.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine is about designing a lifestyle with your pet,''
explained Ms. Diamond, who used to export designer clothing to
Russia. Five percent of the magazine's Web site sales, as well as
the proceeds from the fashion show and 10 percent of subscription
sales, will be donated to animal charities, she continued, adding:
``We're moving into premium products, and it makes sense. Think
about it: Calvin Klein has done a men's line and a women's line.
He's done a home line. What's the next step?''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't make it to Ms. Diamond's show (you can have too much of
a good thing), but I did hit the Kit Kat Klub the night before.
Canine Couture was a, well, howling success. Two downtown club
personalities presided: Johnny Dynell as the D.J. and Chi Chi
Valenti as the M.C. The model Maggie Rizer swaggered out with
Moses, a Rhodesian Ridgeback with a quizzical face and no formal
runway training (it was his first gig). Both wore Donna Karan: a
gray suit for Ms. Rizer, a green python collar for Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Scout, on the other hand, the Gordon Setter dressed by Calvert,
missed his moment in the spotlight. He showed up, but his outfit
was worn by a white borzoi named Nirvana. Marley, a yellow Lab mix
in the front row, craned so hard on his leash that Ms. Valenti
invited him up onto the runway. ``A star is born,'' she announced,
as Marley sniffed around.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase the writer Marcelle Clements, ``We have seen the
dog, and the dog is us.'' &QL;

   PORTRAIT-PAINTERS (New York) _ The tradition of society
portraiture is back at the end of this century, with clients
ranging from Diane Von Furstenberg to George Plimpton to Hilary
Auchincloss. Portrait shows of Sargent and Ingres, whose names once
elicited yawns, are suddenly proving to be hot at the box office.
``A big fact of the late 20th century is that portraiture is on the
rise,'' said Robert Rosenblum, the art historian who wrote the
introductory essay for the catalog of the current Ingres show at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. By Ruth La Ferla. Photo.

   FAT-DIET (Undated) _ Men, as we all know, are different. They
don't go quietly into anything. If they're on a diet, the whole
world has to know about it. Which is why you can't stuff your face
with rice cakes these days without hearing about how the country's
bowels are in an uproar over this latest media-driven fad: the Fat
Diet. By Laura Zigman.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKSTAR-LOFT (New York) _ The Rockstar Loft, is the oddly
elitist name for the anti-elitist party that Englishmen Sam Houser
and Terry Donovan, both 28, has thought up (it is named for their
video-game company, Rockstar Games). ``We decided it was our
obligation to offer an alternative, to sort of level the playing
field,'' Houser said. To get into Rockstar Loft, at a secret
location in Chelsea, prospective revelers have to leave their phone
number on a hot line and then a Rockstar representative will call
back to ask taste-prodding questions like, ``Who is your favorite
D.J.?'' and ``What do you consider an ideal night out in New
York?'' If you give the ``right'' answers _ loosely defined as
anything playful or cool _ then two pink tickets will arrive in
your mailbox soon after. By Julie Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   NY-NITEOUT-JOVOVICH (New York) _ Milla Jovovich, the model and
actress, played the orange-haired alien in ``The Fifth Element.''
In her latest and biggest role, she is Joan of Arc in ``The
Messenger,'' which opens Friday. She is also seen in L'Oreal makeup
ads. But last Monday, she was on her way to sing with her band at
the scruffy Arlene Grocery on the Lower East Side in Manhattan. By
Anthony Lappe.

   CANINE-COUTURE (New York) _ William Calvert, 30, a designer of
the kind of clean-looking evening dresses that fashion editors
invariably call modern, was waiting for his next fitting. An
assistant to the designer sat hunched over a phone, rolling her
eyes. Seems there was a problem with the security guard downstairs.
A little matter of building policy: no dogs allowed. ``Just say

   GARDEN-COLUMN (New York) _ But one of the pleasures of growing
your food _ if only a pot of basil in a concrete courtyard _ is
feeling secure that it hasn't been sprayed with insecticides. And
yet this summer, gardeners had no choice. Malathion was sprayed by
helicopters, the pyrethroids by trucks. The New York City Health
Department was following standard procedures recommended by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which
documented seven deaths and about 50 illnesses caused by the West
Nile virus in the New York region. But malathion and pyrethroids
don't kill just mosquitoes; they kill all insects, including
important pollinators like bees and butterflies, and all the worms
and bugs needed to feed migrating birds. By Anne Raver.

A NIGHT OUT WITH MILLA JOVOVICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 7) 
(jt) 
 By ANTHONY LAPPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was no limo. It wasn't even a car. But Milla
Jovovich, the fledgling rock star, seemed not to mind perching on a
wobbly amplifier in the back of a rented van crammed full of music
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jovovich, the model and actress, played the orange-haired
alien in ``The Fifth Element.'' In her latest and biggest role, she
is Joan of Arc in ``The Messenger,'' which opens November 12. She
is also seen in L'Oreal makeup ads. But last Monday, she was on her
way to sing with her band at the scruffy Arlene Grocery on the
Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the funnest part of my life,'' she said, bracing
herself as the van careered onto Houston Street. She hopes her
band, Plastic Has Memory, will score a record deal, though she
doesn't want to be known as a Hollywood star with a vanity music
project. Indeed, she has paid some dues: a solo album five years
ago, ``The Divine Comedy,'' sold 140,000 copies in the United
States, according to SoundScan.
</P>
<P>
   The billing at Arlene Grocery on Stanton Street read, ``Milla
Jovovich and Plastic Has Memory.'' ``I hate when they do that _
yeah, like everyone wants to see the L'Oreal girl,'' she said
unhappily. Inside, Ex Makina was playing to a crowd of about 12.
The space was small, the stage tiny, the air dank. ``Nothing is
more depressing than getting to a place this early,'' said Mark
Jordon, Ms. Jovovich's drummer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jovovich was unfazed. By the time the second band, the
hard-rocking Even Tide, started, she was sipping a Heineken, doing
a snakelike dance with her hands and whooping into the deadly quiet
between songs. The bartender said, ``We have to have you here every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jovovich was whisked away to a Mexican restaurant across the
street by Chris Brenner, her keyboardist and manager. ``Aw, they
were just starting to rock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After beers and nachos, Brenner asked, ``What time does that
sombrero on the wall say?'' Nearly 10. They were up next.
</P>
<P>
   The small club had filled to capacity. So much for Ms.
Jovovich's efforts to pose as another hard-working rocker. A
cameraman from MTV was in the house. So were models, movie
directors and a Columbia Records executive, who was interested in
signing the band. There were also many young men who seemed to be
there to ogle the L'Oreal girl.
</P>
<P>
   The set was a short, spacey barrage of guitar reverb and melodic
organ, complemented by Ms. Jovovich's voice, at times sultry, at
times raspy and powerfully loud. When the music stopped, Mick
Jagger pushed through the crowd and extended his hand. Ms. Jovovich
went red. After huddling with him, she reported: ``He wants to
talk, you know, give me a critique, which is cool. It's Mick.''
</P>
<P>
   At a bar next door, the rock legend, 55, and the upstart, 23,
sat together. ``You were really great,'' Jagger said, adding that
Bono had told him to come. ``You guys have a really good sound.
Really.''
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour, he asked, ``So do you want to go dancing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Ms. Jovovich said quickly.
</P>
<P>
   She arranged to meet him at Sway, with her band. Loading the van
took an hour. Ms. Jovovich began to fade on the ride to Brenner's
loft. She groggily picked up a keyboard and disappeared up four
flights. Only the drummer said he thought he could make it to Sway.
On this night, time was not on Jagger's side.

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest that the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Even with electrical power out, the pilots could have continued
flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables rather than
a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system failed, the
hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the engines were
running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

 &HT;    KEY PLAYERS IN THE MICROSOFT CASE
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are the key players in the Microsoft antitrust
case:
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Penfield Jackson: As one of 15 U.S. District Court judges
based in Washington, Jackson has been involved in the Microsoft
case since August 1995. Judicial observers say that in the process,
he has gained a broad insight into the high-tech world. He often
carries his own laptop into the courtroom and has developed his own
computerized database during the trial. Nominated by President
Reagan, Jackson was active in Republican politics before joining
the federal bench in 1982. Jackson graduated from Dartmouth College
and Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Gates: The chairman and co-founder of Microsoft ranks as
the world's richest man by virtue of his 25 percent stake in the
world's foremost software company. His videotaped trial testimony
was widely seen as a publicity disaster for Microsoft. A Harvard
dropout, Gates has made no secret of his deep resentment of the
government's intrusion into what he regards as a high-risk,
lightning-paced culture in which companies quickly shift from being
partners to be being competitors, and can even be both at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joel Klein: As the assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's antitrust division, Klein has taken a direct
and deep interest in the case, spending many days seated on a
crowded hard wooden bench behind the prosecution table to monitor
developments. He served two years in the White House counsel's
office, where he handled Whitewater matters, before assuming his
present role in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Boies: One of the nation's leading top antitrust
lawyers, Boies took less than a tenth of his customary $600-an-hour
fee to enter the case at Klein's behest in 1997. The government's
top gun in the courtroom is now a partner in the firm of Boies &AMP;
Schiller LLP. In a prior incarnation, Boies opposed the government
in defending computer giant IBM against allegations of monopoly
behavior in its ``big iron'' mainframe systems business.
</P>
<P>
   _ William Neukom: Microsoft's dapper senior vice president for
law and corporate affairs sat at the head of the defendants' table
throughout the year-long trial. He joined Microsoft shortly after
its founding, when it was a 12-person shop. Neukom negotiated the
initial modest real estate lease for the company at the behest of
William Gates Jr., Bill Gates's father, who at the time served as
the managing partner of the law firm that also launched Neukom. He
is a graduate of Dartmouth and holds a law degree from Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Warden: A booming presence in the courtroom, Warden
serves as Microsoft's lead attorney in the case. He is a veteran
senior partner in the elite Wall Street law firm of Sullivan &AMP;
Cromwell, which has long represented Microsoft. Warden initially
built his reputation in antitrust circles in successfully defending
Eastman Kodak in a precedent-setting private suit decided in 1979.
He is a graduate of Harvard and University of Virginia Law School.

<P>
   It's hard to tell when baby food you've heated _ especially in
the microwave _ is too hot for tiny mouths. So Questech
International has come up with a heat-sensing spoon that tells
parents when food needs to cool down before baby's asked to open
wide.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl of Too Hot colored spoons lose their pigment and become
white when used to stir food 105 F or hotter.
</P>
<P>
   The spoons, which come two per package, are made with a
co-injected plastic process that gives them a soft, flexible bowl
for baby's tender gums and a solid handle. The spoons are
dishwasher-safe and made of non-toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
   Too Hot spoons aren't available in local stores yet, but you can
order them by mail by calling Questech's customer service
department at (800) 966-5367. With shipping and handling, a pair of
the spoons will cost $7.95. &UR;  &QL;

EXPERT: SPEED ALONE COULD HAVE CAUSED FLIGHT 990 TO DIVE, THEN
CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the
Boeing 767 would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed
increased, according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data show that the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
dive, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, a structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, according to Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive could have caused
it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His expertise is
current jet transports. Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated
in a simulator to fly the 767. He teaches a course on the 767s
navigation and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they think the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorize that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke. A few think the problem is on the
other end, with the radar data itself, which they say cannot be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data simply offer no clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests that the
plane may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during
the dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators
say. The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final
plunge toward the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo, the roller coaster ride ended at 10,000
feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of what happened to Flight 990 now
depends largely on investigators being able to extract good data
from the plane's two black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt
to recover as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, a
National Transportation Safety Board radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short, though.
Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet to
16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about midway
through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies based on
temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they don't know what caused the plane to dive so
suddenly that the pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>

for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure

_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>

   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser that deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided

A-ROD ASKS TO STAY, AT LEAST UNTIL NEXT FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the Mariners deal Alex Rodriguez this winter, it
won't be because he asked them to.
</P>
<P>
   At a 90-minute meeting with team officials in Las Vegas
Thursday, the shortstop reiterated his desire to stay with the M's
through the end of his contract, which expires after 2000, and to
hold no negotiations until next fall.
</P>
<P>
   A similar meeting with Ken Griffey Jr. in Orlando on Monday
ended with the center fielder asking to be traded and the Mariners
saying they would honor that request.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Alex wants to fulfill the obligations and
goals he made with the Mariners when he signed a four-year contract
(in 1996),'' said agent Scott Boras, who attended the meeting with
president Chuck Armstrong, new general manager Pat Gillick and new
chairman Howard Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to see how the new Mariners work together. Today I
think they expressed the interest. They are bright people. They're
positive people. I think the meeting was something that needed to
happen so that Alex could grow to know the people he'll be working
with next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick _ who had ``a couple of conversations'' about potential
Griffey trades before traveling to Las Vegas Thursday _ said the
meeting went well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I can characterize it is very positive and
upbeat,'' Gillick said. ``Really, the crux of it is we plan on
meeting again in the near future. So you could say that it was a
good meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was Gillick's second in a week with Boras. Gillick
traveled to Southern California last Saturday to meet the agent
informally. The two have had their differences in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a meeting to basically build confidence and trust,''
Gillick said. ``It was very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Thursday's meeting, Boras said the Mariners' eight-year
contract offer to Rodriguez, worth more than $15 million per
season, was not discussed. Neither, he said, was the pending
departure of Griffey. In the past, Rodriguez has said he would have
no interest in re-signing with the Mariners unless Griffey was also
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex feels as a player, he shouldn't intervene or question or
judge anything that they do,'' Boras said. ``That's their job, not
his job. As far as the discussion, personnel was really not the
dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who could not be reached for comment, has been
unconvinced of the team's commitment to winning. The Mariners tried
to communicate their intent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every organization says that their mandate is to win,'' Boras
said. ``They wouldn't have the jobs they hold if they said anything
different. The point is, what is the potential for that to happen,
how can it happen, what efforts are there to make that goal become
a reality? That's really what the meeting was about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have said they wanted a response to their offer by
mid-November, but Gillick has seemed more flexible since taking
over as general manager on Oct. 25. He did not address the prospect
of trading Rodriguez Thursday, but he can expect inquiries once he
gets to Laguna Niguel, Calif., Friday for the general manager
meetings, which begin on Sunday.

PAYTON OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHANCES OF `COOL' SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Forgive. Forget. Move on.
</P>
<P>
   If Gary Payton can do it, what about the rest of you inhabitants
of Sonic Nation?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Whatever brush fires were smoking in the Sonics'
house Thursday season, they're hosed down and cool now. Last year's
no-playoff apocalypse is done _ even if the Sonics' home opener
Thursday night proved there might be plenty of skeptics out there.
</P>
<P>
   Swaths of empty seats were abundant at Key Arena. Guess that
Vernon Maxwell, Horace Grant, Greg Foster, Shammond Williams, Brent
Barry and Ruben Patterson aren't the sort of names to inspire
instant awe amongst NBA fans.
</P>
<P>
   But these guys went to work with some energy, thumping the
Mavericks 106-96 and living up to Payton's hype that this year's
version of the Sonics will be, at the very least, worth keeping an
eye on.
</P>
<P>
   Payton is oddly at ease these days. He predicted he wouldn't
have to score so much, and Thursday night, 10 points was all the
Sonics needed from The Glove.
</P>
<P>
   He penetrated and dished and watched Vin Baker and Maxwell each
clock 22 points, as Patterson added 17 and Grant pitched in 14 and
that was more than good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't have to do as much. A lot of people are making up
for a lot of things I had to do last year. Today, when Dallas was
doubling me and getting the ball out of my hands, the guys did what
they were supposed to do: attack and score baskets,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're looking at Payton more closely these days. The last,
lone Seattle-reared superstar left in town after the tense divorces
of Shawn Kemp, Randy Johnson and now Ken Griffey Jr., Payton is
kicking off the new NBA season with an attitude fresher than a
handful of Pike Place Market flowers or a bucket of Penn Cove
mussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is cool, man. When you don't have to get stressed
out about whether you're going to win this game, worry about
playing 60 minutes and trying to be the defensive player and the
offensive player, doing this and that,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   The more he hears about how no one has given the Sonics an ounce
of credit, the more Payton likes to talk up his crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team can win any game. That year Houston won,
they weren't a championship team either. I don't think San Antonio
was a championship team last year until they jelled at the end of
the year and they made a big run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team can do whatever it wants to. Everyone's counting us
out. What if we go 15-1 right now? Then everyone is going to start
talking about how this team is something to reckon with. So I don't
believe that. I only believe in an 82-game season anything can
happen. We get into the playoffs, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer Payton sticks around, the greater his capacity to
surprise appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   While other stars have begged out of Seattle because of losing
seasons, the search for financial nirvana or frustration with
management, Payton is here to give it another go-round.
</P>
<P>
   He has vowed the only way he'll ask for a trade is if the Sonics
go ``20-62 this season.'' At this early date, it looks like that
won't be happening.
</P>
<P>
   But as everyone whom Payton has ever known or played with as a
Sonic _ from Kemp to Sam Perkins and Nate McMillan to Tim Grgurich
to George Karl to Detlef Schrempf and Hersey Hawkins _ has skipped
or been run out of town, Payton lives to start a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
   He has ridden out storms. He has stuck around, and suddenly,
something like this almost seems like a laudable act of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   The real shock is that, at least at this infant juncture in the
season, Payton appears happy, committed, dedicated and eager to let
this all-new Sonics team roll through this new season and see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Want to be further shocked?
</P>
<P>
   Payton is so into this team, he's practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking to me, too,'' Payton said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't have to do as much. Last year, I was playing 45
minutes. I'm tired and I'm coming back here and my back's hurting.
Now I don't have to do all that. You're not struggling to get a
win. It's easier. We're playing basketball, we're running. And now
you see everyone's up on the bench, giving each other high-fives.
You didn't see that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever mistaken Payton for being the eternal optimist.
He has had his share of meltdowns and blast-offs during tough
times.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from his gush of words at the start of this new
season, it seems pretty clear that last year's abysmal team
chemistry really troubled Payton.
</P>
<P>
   While he has been viewed at times as the root of all that's been
wrong with the Sonics, with his practice habits and tough talk, it
appears that Payton was just frustrated last season when guys like
Don MacLean, Olden Polynice, Schrempf, Billy Owens, Dale Ellis and
Hawkins did nothing to themselves to inspire love and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   He said it bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, you go into the locker room and you feel that (guys
aren't communicating). Then you walk out of the locker room and say
`Damn, I can't talk to him. He's got that smirk look on his face
and you can't talk to him,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy. I can't be going around trying to talk to
everyone and see if they're all right. I've got my kids at home. I
don't need to be adopting 12 more.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe Payton didn't want to adopt those guys. These guys,
this year, he would.

MAXWELL OFFERS BOOST AS SONICS TOP MAVS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Normally, Gary Payton's frustration would ooze out. If
this had been any other season, the Sonics point guard might have
forced the issue after missing seven straight shots at the start of
a game.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton just did other things. He stole the basketball,
passed it around, and wore a look of contentment along with the
well-known scowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have promoted new faces. Their optimism is tied to a
new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Payton allowed both to take over and the Sonics
took out the Dallas Mavericks, 106-96, in the home opener in
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics improved to 2-0 on the young season behind a balanced
offensive attack. It is still too early to define how their season
will play out. But the Sonics have already shown they are capable
of having a different player step in the forefront each night.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mavs' defense concentrated on stopping Payton, Ruben
Patterson, Horace Grant and Vernon Maxwell picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I can go scoreless for a half and we're still up by
10, then we're a good ballclub,'' said Payton, who finished with 13
assists and 10 points on 3-of-15 shooting. ``When Dallas was
doubling me and taking the ball out of my hands, those guys did
what they were supposed to and attacked the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell and Vin Baker each scored 22 points. Baker added 13
rebounds. Grant chipped in 14 points and 11 rebounds. Patterson was
again a force at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Grant and Patterson set the tone for the Sonics at the start of
the game with rebounding and aggressiveness. The Sonics' defensive
pressure and their 58-41 rebounding edge allowed them to run past
the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' said Patterson, who finished with 17 points and
four rebounds. ``We're just going out there being aggressive.
That's why it's going to be an interesting season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' win yesterday was interesting for several reasons.
The game was the first time since KeyArena opened that the Sonics
were without a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   That meant a capacity crowd did not see the Sonics in their new
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics introduced a new secondary road uniform. Instead of
their home white, the Sonics played in brick red uniforms. The
jersey is V-neck wide sleeves, similar to the secondary road jersey
the New Jersey Nets displayed last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs obliged a request and wore their home white uniforms.
Dallas also followed the script for the Sonics' home opener. The
Sonics were ahead 92-84 with 7:12 left in the game when the Mavs
succumbed to an 8-2 run down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani McCoy and Brent Barry each gathered steals and scored
dunks on back-to-back possessions in the fourth. The sequence put
the Mavs away and gave the Sonics a 100-86 lead with five minutes
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics twice led by as many as 15 points. Dallas never got
closer than six points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we met all the challenges we needed to,'' Sonics
coach Paul Westphal said. ``We beat them on the boards and we made
them earn their shots. They were hitting some tough shots, and it
seemed like they weren't going to miss. But in the end, it was a
good routine win.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams struggled with shooting early on despite blasting
each other with fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was off the most.
</P>
<P>
   He missed several layups and did not get to the foul line in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics again deferred to Maxwell. Maxwell entered the game
in the second quarter and promptly made his presence felt. He
scored 17 points in 15 minutes. His scoring came from strong drives
through the lane and from beyond the three-point stripe.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell provided a similar boost in the Sonics' 104-92 win
against the L.A. Clippers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal tried to beat the Mavs with quickness by employing a
three-guard lineup most of the period. Maxwell was on the floor
with Payton and Barry when the Sonics made their run.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barry's dunk that gave the Sonics a lead they never
relinquished. He broke a 44-44 tie, and the Sonics led 56-46 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same confidence and enthusiasm, just different
players,'' Dallas' Cedric Ceballos said of the Sonics. ``The
attitude is still to push the ball and play good defense. It's a
little different faces, but a lot more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast-break style looks good so far on the Sonics. Playing in
transition has allowed everyone to get involved offensively and
promoted scoring balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great balance,'' Baker said. ``Every night we come
into a game, we have six or seven players capable of 20 points, 13
rebounds or 10 assists. You know a lot of people here are capable
of doing that, and it's a luxury to have because a lot of teams
don't have that ability. We've got that ability so we're going to
take advantage of it.''

 &HT;    CONGRESSMEN WANT REVERSAL OF RIGHTS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ In a letter to President Clinton, 18 Republican
congressmen Friday called for the reversal of a decision that would
give certain legal rights to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley of Florida, the primary author of the letter,
has also introduced legislation that would ban the policy
established by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EEOC's decision flies in the face of everything we as a
country are trying to do to discourage illegal immigration,'' Foley
said. ``In states like Florida, Texas, and California, fighting the
steady tide of illegal immigrants is a daily challenge of
legislators and law enforcement authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the EEOC decision, illegal immigrants would be able to get
back pay from employers and sue for punitive damages and
reinstatement to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the administration is worried about unscrupulous employers
mistreating illegal workers, it should go after those employers who
are already breaking the law, not extending rights and protections
that legitimately should be enjoyed by legal workers,'' Foley said
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's letter was signed by 17 other Republicans, including
Reps. Tillie Fowler, Fla., Lamar Smith, Texas, Sam Johnson, Texas,
Nathan Deal, Ga., Jack Kingston, -Ga., Paul Gillmor, Ohio, Robert
Ney, Ohio, and Cass Ballenger, N.C.

The Falcons were winning big, and the players reaped all the
``benefits.'' Now the Falcons are losing again, and Chandler and
his teammates have become targets of criticism . . . scourges. It's
just another example of how fame is fleeting in pro sports.

   BREEDERS-SHEIKS _ ``The Sheiks,'' as the horse-racing brothers
from Dubai's ruling family are known around the world's
thoroughbred tracks, know a good investment when they see one. So
for America's richest race, Saturday's $4 million Breeders' Cup
Classic at Gulfstream Park, the royals are putting their 4-year-old
colt Almutawakel (Arabic for ``In the Hands of the Gods'') in the
hands of a 42-year-old recovering alcoholic who once shoveled
manure for a living and relaxes today watching The Weather Channel
and coaching Little League. That's right. Almutawakel _ winner of
the prestigious 1999 Dubai World Cup _ will be guided by a 5-foot-5
college dropout. Jerry Bailey is all of that. And on racetracks
from Saratoga to Hollywood Park, he is ... well, something else.
With uncanny instincts and a meticulous preparation regimen, he is
perhaps the hottest jockey in horse racing. (Palm Beach Post).

THE ANTI-ELITIST CLUB PARTY: READY OR NOT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Can you open a club in New York with no velvet ropes,
no VIP lists and no snooty attitude? That's what New Yorkers _ and
I don't care whether you are Prince, Lauren Hutton or Derek Jeter,
we've all been snubbed by a Praetorian Guard at a nightclub door _
say we'd like to see. Do we?
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, three Englishmen set out to give New
Yorkers what they say they want: a happening party where admission
was not based on looks, the right shoes or a bold-face name. The
only way to get in was to answer a series of seven questions over
the telephone, and if you so much as dared drop the name of your
cool company or your chic, Prada-clad friends, no dice.
</P>
<P>
   The idea began with Sam Houser and Terry Donovan, both 28, who
moved from London last year, eager to participate in the New York
night life they had heard so much about. But when they went out,
they were horrified to find mainly paparazzi-infested magazine
parties and celebrity-philiac lounges, where, Donovan said,
``people spent the whole time looking over your shoulder hoping to
spot someone more important to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Houser added, ``How many times do you have to be ignored by
celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio at some horribly trendy club to
know that it's not going to make you a happier person?''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Rockstar Loft, the oddly elitist name for the anti-elitist
party Houser and Donovan thought up (it is named for their
video-game company, Rockstar Games). ``We decided it was our
obligation to offer an alternative, to sort of level the playing
field,'' Houser said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming up with John Davis, the host of a Sunday-night club
party called Body and Soul at Vinyl, which is known for dancing,
not preening, the partners put their utopian vision into action.
</P>
<P>
   To get into Rockstar Loft, at a secret location in Chelsea,
prospective revelers had to leave their phone number on a hot line
and then a Rockstar representative would call back to ask
taste-prodding questions like, ``Who is your favorite DJ?'' and
``What do you consider an ideal night out in New York?'' If you
gave the ``right'' answers _ loosely defined as anything playful or
cool _ then two pink tickets arrived in your mailbox soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the party spread quickly, thanks to fliers, a Web site
and a couple of magazine articles that listed the phone number:
shades of the groundswell for ``The Blair Witch Project.'' By last
Saturday, the hot line in the Rockstar office was ringing every 45
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to test my luck and call. For fun, I said I enjoyed
attending film premieres with celebrities like Julia Roberts, and
going to bars like Moomba where I might see Donald Trump. I said my
favorite DJs were ones who also modeled. I started making other
plans for Saturday night, but to my surprise, two pink tickets
appeared in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and I decided it would be wise to arrive early,
around 11:30, to avoid the crowds. But there wasn't a crowd, and we
breezed in. ``No re-entry,'' the doorman, a perfect gentleman,
warned. Inside, our hosts were taking the anti-glamour theme
seriously. For snacks, there were fruit plates set out on folding
tables with white table cloths.
</P>
<P>
   Guys in baggy jeans and record label T-shirts hovered around the
DJ booth. One guest with spiky hair and a Nike sweat band around
his head compared it to a ``Silicon Alley launch party.'' Most
disconcerting, there was only one bar, which was mobbed seven
layers deep. I got in line. My friends got out their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' my friend Juaretsi said after a few calls. It was the
night before Halloween, and she was an urban Snow White in a yellow
gown and a white fur coat. ``It's happening over at Lot 61. Kirsty
Hume, Donovan Leitch and Amber Valletta are having a party.''
</P>
<P>
   Juaretsi is an events planner for a magazine, with a nose for
tracking down the hottest scenes. We cabbed over to Lot 61, where a
mob of models dressed as sultry kittens and men in Andy Warhol wigs
clamored to get past the ropes. ``I'm Donovan's cousin!'' one man
in a wig yelled, before a bouncer hustled him to the crowd's
outermost ring. A woman in a 1970s disco halter tried to get in
with a threat: ``I'm going up to Puffy's party,'' she said, but the
ropes didn't part.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the warehouse-size Lot 61 was decorated in jungle vines.
There were an absurd number of celebrities: David Bowie, Chloe
Sevigny, Helmut Lang. The elusive hosts Donovan and Kirsty, draped
in vines, were dressed (barely) as Adam and Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was dancing exuberantly to tried-and-true party staples
like Joan Jett's ``I Love Rock 'n' Roll.'' I recognized a few
defectors from Rockstar Loft sheepishly sipping free Cosmopolitans.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m., I convinced my friends to revisit the Loft, since I
was eager to hear Dimitri From Paris, a celebrated house DJ Leaving
Lot 61, we passed a guy wearing a velour tracksuit peddling his
bicycle alongside a limousine, while negotiating a cell phone under
his chin. ``The DJ was killing me in there!'' he screamed. ``They
say Moomba was good 10 minutes ago, but now it's whack. Some people
are heading up to a party called Rockstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Rockstar Loft, a man outside was freely dispensing the
once-coveted tickets. We whizzed back in without a hitch. I ran
into a friend who had been to a party at the club One 51 where,
surprise, Prince and Derek Jeter were. (``It was really silly,''
she said. ``Everyone spent the whole time trying to cram into the
VIP section. But once they got in, they wanted to get into the VIPs
VIP section, where Puffy and Jennifer Lopez were. But the people in
there were just sitting around staring at Puffy and Jennifer.''
</P>
<P>
   I was happy now, with Dimitri From Paris spinning records,
perfect for dancing, but my friends were restless. ``What are you
doing?'' one of them asked yanking me off the floor as if I were
crazy. ``I just got a call. It's really good down at Sway.''
</P>
<P>
   We made a beeline for the door. Bless our superficial little
hearts, but we New Yorkers find a hot, nonexclusive party a
contradiction in terms.

WEIGHING THE VALUE OF BUGS IN A WORLD OF PESTICIDES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many gardeners in the New York area felt helpless and
confused in September as helicopters and trucks sprayed their
neighborhoods with malathion or pyrethroids to try to kill
mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   My Brooklyn neighbor Izzy even decided not to eat her beautiful
Concord grapes, though the vines were full.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was illogical, considering all the fruit and
vegetables we buy that have been sprayed with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the pleasures of growing your food _ if only a pot of
basil in a concrete courtyard _ is feeling secure that it hasn't
been sprayed with insecticides. And yet this summer, gardeners had
no choice. Malathion was sprayed by helicopters, the pyrethroids by
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Health Department was following standard
procedures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, which documented seven deaths and about 50
illnesses caused by the West Nile virus in the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   But malathion and pyrethroids don't kill just mosquitoes; they
kill all insects, including important pollinators like bees and
butterflies, and all the worms and bugs needed to feed migrating
birds. Both also kill fish, and pyrethroids can kill birds.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``humans are relatively tolerant to
malathion, and it breaks down rapidly, within 24 hours,'' said Dr.
David Pimentel, a professor of ecology and agricultural sciences at
Cornell University, in Ithaca, N.Y. The same is true, most experts
say, for pyrethroids.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito campaign got me thinking about pesticides over
which the public has no control, not only those used to grow food,
but also the insecticides used in homes, apartment buildings and
schools. Dursban, for instance, commonly used for termites and
roaches, is now being re-evaluated by the Environmental Protection
Agency for its health risks, particularly to children.
</P>
<P>
   Any pesticide is by definition a poison and can be dangerous if
the directions on the label are not followed to the letter.
Unfortunately, many people are bad at following directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not 100 percent against pesticides, but there are serious
costs,'' Pimentel said. ``Every year in this country, we have about
110,000 pesticide poisonings _ not deaths _ and about 25 deaths.''
Routine agricultural spraying in this country kills 67 million
birds a year, he said, and about 74,000 dogs and 15,000 cats. The
damage to bee colonies and to crops that fail because of lack of
pollination amounts to $320 million a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some ecologists say there are more effective but less flashy
ways of control than aerial spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aerial spraying is a really chancy thing,'' said Dr. George
Fenwick, a pathobiologist and the founder of the American Bird
Conservancy, in Plains, Va. ``You're going to hit some and you're
going to miss some. So, it's better to go after the larvae in the
ground or water, larviciding with bacillus or dormant oils on
bodies of water that shouldn't be drained, and drain the ones you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   But such mundane chores might not satisfy a nervous public.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear of human death, there's almost a need for a
psychological response,'' Fenwick said. ``It needs to be seen that
big things are happening, like machines zooming overhead dumping
chemicals all over. Nobody's going to notice when they send out
crews looking into barrels and swamps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control recommends killing larvae for
mosquito control, but in New York, ``the disease was being
transmitted by adult mosquitoes,'' said Barbara Reynolds, a
spokeswoman. Spraying began on Sept. 3, and after Sept. 22 there
were no new cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   People can help control mosquitoes, she added, by not letting
stagnant water sit around in flower pots and wading pools. But they
certainly don't have to stop feeding birds and filling up their
birdbaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to wholesale abandon the beauty of these
wild birds and think of them as pests,'' Ms. Reynolds said. ``Even
if a bird is a carrier of West Nile virus, the mosquito is the
transmitter, and the bird is only infectious for four or five days.
If it doesn't die, it recovers, and just like a human, it will have
antibodies for the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance is very small, she added, that a mosquito is going to
bite a bird at your feeder, and then you, but if you're worried
about it, don't feed the birds until after a hard freeze kills the
mosquitoes, or use a mosquito repellent.
</P>
<P>
   And relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Nile virus is not one of the most serious diseases, but
it's one of those things that sort of spook people, because it's
carried by mosquitoes,'' Pimentel said. ``People are afraid of bugs
_ and most of them are good.''
</P>
<P>
   We need to learn to love our bugs.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, it seemed almost futile to be encouraging bees and
butterflies in my Maryland garden, because a helicopter
periodically sprayed pesticide on the bean fields not 50 feet away.
The wind carried it right over my garden.
</P>
<P>
   I don't blame the farmers. This is how most food is produced in
this country. Organic farming is more labor-intensive, and requires
a whole new way of thinking about soil and biological cycles.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to be done about drift, or pesticides anywhere,
until people recognize that they're part of a larger community, and
change the way they grow food. And how they think about insects _
as their enemies, or as powerful players in a healthy ecosystem.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are the milestones in Microsoft's antitrust
dealings with the government:
</P>
<P>
   1990:
</P>
<P>
   May 30 _ The Federal Trade Commission staff opens an antitrust
probe of Microsoft Corp. The agency ponders charges that Microsoft
illegally thwarted competition while adding hidden codes to its
operating system software in a bid to hinder competing applications
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   1993:
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 5 _ On a 2-2 vote, FTC deadlocks on taking action against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 20 _ The FTC decides to drops its Microsoft probe. The
Justice Department says it will take over the case.
</P>
<P>
   1994:
</P>
<P>
   July 16 _ Microsoft and Justice Department trustbrusters reach a
settlement that requires the company to change a variety of
business practices, including key aspects of its licensing
agreements with personal computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   1995:
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 14 _ U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin rejects the
proposed settlement, asserting that it does not go far enough to
curb Microsoft's anti-competitive conduct.
</P>
<P>
   April 27 _ The Justice Department sues to block Microsoft's
acquisition of Intuit Inc., maker of the popular Quicken personal
finance program. Within a month, Microsoft abandons its proposed
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   June 9 _ Microsoft reveals the Justice Department is
investigating Microsoft Network, its newly launched online service.
</P>
<P>
   June 16 _ A federal appeals court upholds the 1994 settlement,
reversing Sporkin and removing him from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 21 _ U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson approves
the 1994 settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   1996:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 19 _ Microsoft reveals that the Justice Department is
probing the bundling of its Internet Explorer browser with Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   1997:
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 20 - The Justice Department sues Microsoft, charging the
company with having violated the 1994 court-approved settlement by
requiring computer makers to install Internet Explorer in order to
license Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 11 - Jackson issues a preliminary injunction that bars
Microsoft from requiring computer makers to install its online
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15 - Microsoft says it will comply with Jackson's order by
offering computer makers two new options, both of which the company
claims would undermine computer performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 17 - The Justice Department asks Jackson to hold Microsoft
in contempt, alleging that the proposed changes fail to meet the
terms of Jackson's preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   1998:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 22 - The Justice Department and Microsoft reach a
settlement on the pending contempt charge.
</P>
<P>
   May 14 - Microsoft and the Justice Department reveal that they
are conducting settlement talks aimed at heading off a wide-ranging
antitrust action.
</P>
<P>
   May 18 - After the settlement negotiations fail, the Justice
Department and 20 states file a broad antitrust suit against
Microsoft. The case is assigned to Jackson, who seeks to expedite
the proceedings by setting an early trial date.
</P>
<P>
   June 23 - A federal appeals court rules that Microsoft did not
violate a previous agreement with the government when it combined
Windows 95 and Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 19 - The federal antitrust trial opens in Washington, with
Jackson presiding without a jury. After showing videotaped
testimony from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the government
alleges that the company systematically used its dominance over the
operating system market for personal computers to illegally thwart
competition.
</P>
<P>
   1999:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 10 - The government rests its case after calling 12
witnesses. The prosecution repeatedly seeks to portray Microsoft as
a bullying monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 29 - The defense rests its case after also calling 12
witnesses. Microsoft denies all charges of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   June 2 - After a three-month recess and unsuccessful
secrecy-cloaked efforts to reach a settlement, the trial's rebuttal
phase opens.
</P>
<P>
   June 25 - The last rebuttal witness leaves the stand, eight
months after the antitrust trial began. William Neukom, Microsoft's
general counsel, says: ``The government has put on a great
performance, ``but it does not add up to a solid antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 10 - Each side offers the court book-sized documents
detailing what each it believes are the real facts in the case.
Microsoft's take: The government proved no wrongdoing in the
eight-month trial. The government's: Microsoft clearly engaged in a
``broad pattern of unlawful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 10 - Each side files another stack of voluminous rebuttal
briefs that largely review their prior arguments while disparaging
the opponents' case.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 21 - Nearly a year after the trial began, the courtroom
phase comes to a close with oral arguments from the opposing
lawyers. Once again, the government casts Microsoft as a monopolist
that squelches competition while the company's lawyers accuse the
plaintiffs of unwarranted meddling in the rough-and-tumble software
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 5 - Jackson issues his own findings of fact, to be
followed, probably early next year, by his conclusions of law.
Taken together, they will constitute a verdict in the trial _ one
that, barring a settlement, is virtually sure to be appealed.

NETWORKS GAMBLE AGAIN ON GAME SHOWS, SUPERMODELS AND DREW CAREY
LIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no official declaration to speak of, but November is the
peak of the silly television season.
</P>
<P>
   One of three unexplainable peaks, actually, as networks inject
their programming with a gotta-be-big-and-bold serum in order to
get noticed by viewers, in order to attract advertisers, in order
to sweeten revenue.
</P>
<P>
   November sweeps, like those in February and May, is designed as
a measuring tool for local stations, which try to post higher
ratings so they can charge higher ad rates. But how this
programming maneuver helps viewers has always escaped me.
</P>
<P>
   Networks claim viewers win with a menu of ``above-average''
programming, a whole month of ``best-ofs,'' so to speak. But that
usually means guest-star stints (supermodel Elle McPherson as
Joey's roommate on a Nov. 11 ``Friends''; Farrah Fawcett in a
sexual harassment suit on a Nov. 29 ``Ally McBeal'') and gimmicks
like ``The Drew Carey Show'' going live with an improv episode on
Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   That, or a slew of specials featuring the hot music trend of the
moment (Ricky Martin and Shania Twain on CBS), or the miniseries
and movies that cost a lot and look great but are usually rather
thin at the core.
</P>
<P>
   Anything noteworthy about this year's crop of sweeps programs?
Not really, unless you count the pair of competing game shows
(Fox's new ``Greed'' premiered Thursday) and the networks taking
the cocky approach of firing their big guns the first weekend,
taking the risk of canceling each other out.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the networks go head to head with their main sweeps
weapons: CBS airs the heavily promoted ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll,''
about the creation of rock 'n' roll. NBC goes for the miniseries
``The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns'' with Randy Quaid and
Whoopi Goldberg. ABC bets on yet another adaptation of the Broadway
musical ``Annie,'' this one starring Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ace in the hole is, of course, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the game show that attracted an average of 14
million viewers during a two-week ride in August. It returns Sunday
for 15 consecutive days, airing for an hour Sundays at 8 p.m. CST,
an hour Mondays and Saturdays at 7 p.m. CST and a half-hour
Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is so pumped about ``Millionaire'' that it will bump David
E. Kelley's surprisingly popular drama ``Snoops'' for at least
three weeks, which couldn't have made the superproducer happy. (But
who better understands special treatment?)
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that ratings winner Barbara Walters returns
with ``Barbara Walters Presents the 10 Most Fascinating People of
1999'' or that ABC on Nov. 13 airs ``Come On Get Happy: The
Partridge Family Story,'' a dramatization of life behind-the-scenes
of the '70s TV series. (The fact that the cast members have been so
candid about the behind-the-scenes problems gives this a leg up on
those ``Brady Bunch'' reunion movies.)
</P>
<P>
   Getting little publicity, but a special that I recommend highly,
is ``Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's End,'' with Glenn Close and
Christopher Walken returning for the third installment in the saga
of Sarah and Jacob Witting. It's a Hallmark Hall of Fame
presentation airing Nov. 21 on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of TV without a safety net will certainly draw viewers
to ``Drew Carey,'' which will use a script only as an outline.
Producer Bruce Helford promises that lines for most of the episode
will be made up on the spot, which at least separates the series
from what ``ER'' did with its live episode and from ``Roc,'' which
went live as a matter of course (and because its theater-trained
cast was bored.)
</P>
<P>
   Improv ``games'' will be inserted into scripted portions of the
show and played out by regulars Ryan Stiles, Kathy Kinney and
Carey, all strong improvisation players. (Christa Miller and
Diedrich Bader aren't improv comics, so it might be fun to watch
how they handle it all.)
</P>
<P>
   The episode, about Kate (Miller) falling in love with Drew, will
also be performed live three times _ once for each time zone. And
it will look different as well, since it will be shot on tape and
not film.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in recent years, this November sweeps includes the
Thanksgiving holiday, traditionally a bastion of reruns and
theatrical perennials. NBC will air original episodes of
``Friends,'' ``Just Shoot Me,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' and
``ER'' (featuring Julianna Margulies' Hathaway going into labor _
and where's Dad?). Meanwhile, CBS has the Twain special and the
movie ``The Secret of Giving.'' ABC will stay the course with an
airing of ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   A Thanksgiving episode worth watching (although not airing near
the holiday) is ``The Hughleys,'' which began its two-episode
storyline last night and concludes Friday. It features Darryl (D.L.
Hughley) coping with the aftermath of discovering that he's not his
father's biological son.
</P>
<P>
   It intimately plays off Hughley's real-life experience: His wife
actually found his biological father via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole experience blew me away,'' Hughley said. ``As soon
as we got the show up and running, I knew this was going to be a
storyline. Something that's touching and dramatic and real. Now
here it is.''
</P>
<P>
   And just in time for sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   November sweeps: What else to watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a taste of other sweeps menu items worth at least a
sample:
</P>
<P>
   ``Aftershock: Earthquake in New York'' (Nov. 14 and 17, CBS)
Charles S. Dutton, Cicely Tyson, Lisa Nicole Carson and Tom
Skerritt star in this four-hour miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary, Mother of Jesus'' (Nov. 14, NBC) Pernilla August and
Christian Bale star in an inspirational drama from executive
producers Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her son, Bobby Shriver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry and Tom'' (Nov. 14, Showtime) _ If it's Joe Mantegna, it
must be about mobsters. He co-stars with Sam Rockwell in this
comedy about, yep, contemporary mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and Blue'' (Nov. 17, CBS) _ Mary Stuart Masterson and
Anthony LaPaglia star in this suspense thriller, adapted from the
Anna Quindlen book of the same name, about a battered woman who
flees her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K'' (Nov. 21, NBC) _ You knew it was coming, right? Ken Olin
stars in this thriller as a Y2K troubleshooter trying to save us
all from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Babies: Switched at Birth'' (Nov. 24, CBS) _ Melissa
Gilbert and Rosanna Arquette star in this true-life drama as
mothers who discover their babies were switched.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Special Night'' (Nov. 28) _ Julie Andrews and James
Garner, who starred in the film classic ``Victor/Victoria,''
reunite for this love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution of Justice'' (Nov. 28, Showtime) _ Tim Daly and
sister Tyne star in the true story of Dan White, the man who
murdered Harvey Milk and George Moscone.

SOUTH SURRENDERS TO NEITHER PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) (lh) 
 By CARL HULSE AND SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two decades of steady _ and at times
explosive _ gains in the region, Republicans face a resurgent
Democratic party in the South.
</P>
<P>
   With both parties tallying significant wins last Tuesday, the
elections underscore the fact that the GOP march is slowing after
thinning Democratic ranks throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no majority party in the South,'' declared Merle
Black, a scholar and expert on Southern politics at Emory
University. ``It's a very competitive region,'' added Thad Beyle, a
professor of political science at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, Paul Patton, the incumbent Democratic governor,
easily won re-election. Democrats also appear to have captured the
governorship in Mississippi. Because neither Democrat Ronnie
Musgrove nor Republican Mike Parker captured a majority of votes,
the state House of Representative will have to pick the winner. And
that body is dominated by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The expected Democratic victory in Mississippi follows
gubernatorial wins in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans earned their own bragging rights. They captured a
majority of seats in the Virginia State Senate, thereby winning
control of the legislature for the first time ever. In an earlier
election, they held onto the governor's seat in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``More of the same,'' Black said. Beyle believes ``deadlock''
will continue for the next several years with marginal shifts in
party strength that vary by state. He doesn't think either party
will enjoy an overwhelming regional Southern advantage in the 2000
elections, although Republicans still seem to have the edge in
presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have in many states now is 40 percent Democrats and
40 percent Republicans, and then you get these people who swing
back and forth,'' Beyle said.
</P>
<P>
   CLOTHES HORSE
</P>
<P>
   Reprising a familiar role, Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., was on
the Senate floor recently, railing against a new trade bill that he
believes will cost the United States jobs in manufacturing,
particularly textiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no education in the second kick of a mule,'' Hollings
declared, asserting that earlier trade agreements had cost
thousands of jobs. His colleagues disagreed, approving by a 76-19
margin a bill that promotes trade between Africa and the Caribbean
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings went down with his usual flair. He waved an editorial
from The Wall Street Journal that criticized ``Ol' Fritz'' as an
isolationist and dubbed him ``the senator from Milliken &AMP; Co.,'' a
reference to the South Carolina textile giant.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings, who asked that the editorial be printed in the
Congressional Record, dismissed it as ``silly.''
</P>
<P>
   HAIL MARY PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Two issues near and dear to the hearts of many Southern
lawmakers recently converged on the playing field that is the floor
of the House of Representatives _ school prayer and football.
</P>
<P>
   Objecting to a recent federal court decision banning prayer
before school sporting events, the House passed a non-binding
``sense of Congress'' resolution that urged the Supreme Court to
get on the ball and allow such pre-game rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the measure, many of them Southern schoolboy football
fans, said there was more to the matter than just sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong religious message, coupled with good sportsmanship,
instilled by adult role models can make a positive long-term
influence on our nation's young people,'' said Rep. Robert
Aderholt, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   One watchdog group said Congress should have stayed on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court, not Congress, decides constitutional issues
such as school prayer,'' said the Rev. Barry Lynn, head of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ``If prayer at
football games is all the House has to offer, heaven help us.''
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN SURVIVORS
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mixed message delivered in Tuesday's elections, it
is not easy to be a Democrat in some parts of the South these days.
Recognizing that fact, the magazine Congressional Quarterly
applauded some Dixie lawmakers for their staying power in a special
report that focused on 50 members who have devised different
approaches to doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala., and Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., were
placed in the category of ``political survivors:'' folks able to
remain in office when their constituents have shown a definite
preference for the other party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cramer has adapted himself for survival over the years ... by
distancing himself from President Clinton, playing up his
conservative bona fides through leadership in the Blue Dog
coalition and redoubling his attention to district needs,'' said
CQ, explaining Cramer's success.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings, it said, perseveres ``the old-fashioned way, by taking
advantage of his seniority to funnel funds to home-state
interests.''

 By RUTH LA FERLA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her spine buttressed by a pillow, her coppery hair
set off by the russet shawl draped behind her, Elena Patterson sat
for Hilary Cooper, a New York portrait painter, a picture of comely
repose.
</P>
<P>
   In a lambent corner of the studio where Ms. Cooper works in Long
Island City, the two savored a moment of easy intimacy. ``What's
really fun is to watch the artist at work,'' said Ms. Patterson,
glancing at Ms. Cooper, who stood in a beat-up crewneck sweater and
jeans, applying streaks of rusty brown to her canvas.
</P>
<P>
   So restful was the scene, so evocative of the languor once
famously captured in oils by John Singer Sargent, that you half
expected a retainer to appear bearing a bright silver tea service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Patterson, 57, who sat for the portrait to please her
husband, a banker, found the ambience enchanting. ``This is another
world,'' she said, brushing aside a stray swatch of hair. ``I'd say
that it's old-fashioned, and that definitely appeals to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene did indeed conjure an earlier epoch, a more gracious
and leisurely age when people embarked on grand tours, collecting
bibelots along the way, and having their likenesses rendered by the
leading painters of the day. As well it might. The fin-de- siecle
tradition of society portraiture is back at the fin of this
century, with clients ranging from Diane Von Furstenberg to George
Plimpton to Hilary Auchincloss. Portrait shows of Sargent and
Ingres, whose names once elicited yawns, are suddenly proving to be
hot at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big fact of the late 20th century is that portraiture is on
the rise,'' said Robert Rosenblum, the art historian who wrote the
introductory essay for the catalog of the current Ingres show at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The bravura painting of a Sargent
or a Giovanni Boldini ``used to thought of as totally irrelevant
trash,'' he said. ``Now these artists are hot stuff again.''
</P>
<P>
   The effete sophistication and formality of earlier masters has
lately cropped up in the works of contemporary portrait painters
and photographers as disparate in style and technique as Paul
Benney, a British artist who paints urbane Londoners in a
19th-century style, right down to their elegant frock coats; Adam
Fuss, a modern photographer who is currently experimenting with
daguerreotypes; and Lorenzo Poccianti and David Seidner, two
photographers whose portraits, inspired by old masters, depict New
York's ambitious young plutocrats in hyperglamorous fancy dress.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly studied indolence shows in the work of Francesco
Clemente. A latter-day Andy Warhol, if not in style then certainly
in attitude, Clemente is driven, like his famous predecessor, to
document the reigning divas of the hour, including Gwyneth Paltrow
and Jerry Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does fashion portraits of glamorous people _ the Vanity
Fair world,'' Rosenblum said. ``I think up to a point, he has tried
to step into that role.''
</P>
<P>
   His skills, and those of his peers, are feverishly sought after
by clients who just a few years ago would no sooner have
commissioned a portrait than they would be likely to vote for
Donald Trump for president. During most of postwar art history,
portraiture of prominent subjects, and especially commissioned
portraits, were associated with fawning, sentimentalized images of
children clutching posies, crusty dowagers and overfed captains of
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the genre, once the art world's fallen woman, has dusted
itself off and reclaimed its respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago people would have been embarrassed to have their
portraits done,'' said Martine Assouline, an aristocratic
Frenchwoman, who, with her husband, Propser, published the
portraits of Seidner, who is known for his hyperglamorous images of
men and women in fancy period dress, like Pia Getty, Judith Peabody
and Anderson Cooper. Mrs. Seidner died in June. ``But today if he
were alive, he would have 10 commissions a day,'' Ms. Assouline
contends.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for what her husband calls the ``portrait mondain,''
portraits of worldly subjects, is indeed on the climb. ``People
want elegant, sophisticated images of themselves,'' Assouline said.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the homes of affluent new Yorkers, stroll into many
Manhattan galleries, or flip through the glossy magazines, and you
will likely be greeted by pictures as formal, lavish and
unabashedly gorgeous as any Sargent might have wrought. Here are
the Boardman sisters, Serena and Samantha, modern society swans
swathed by Seidner in old-fashioned tulle; here is Gale Hayman, the
cosmetics entrepreneur, limned in a vintage green Halston dress by
Aaron Schickler, the painter who memorialized Jacqueline Kennedy in
a picture that hangs in the White House, and more recently, Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the children of Carol Mack, the society decorator,
portrayed like tiny potentates in the period of the raj, as
envisioned by Poccianti, a Florentine who photographs his subjects
and transfers them to canvas with the aid of computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, are Clemente's self-regarding odalisques: Ms. Von
Furstenberg stretched out on a divan and the Princess Gloria von
Thurn und Taxis, stern in a jeweled choker, and as impervious to
the passage of time as a bug in amber. They are among the
procession of models, society queens, tycoons, film stars and
fashion makers clamoring to be mythologized on canvas by Clemente,
whose sketches and portraits of Ms. Paltrow were used in the film
``Great Expectations.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Some of Clemente's commissioned portraits, which he paints for
fees of $50,000 to $100,000, are on view at the Guggenheim Museum
and have been collected in a new coffee-table book, ``Life Is
Paradise'' (PowerHouse Books, $TK). In becoming a portraitist for
hire, the artist, a leading light of 1980s Neo-Expressionism, is
continuing in a tradition at least as old as Rembrandt, but one
that has always carried a built-in risk. If he frets that the need
to flatter the socialites and celebrities who commission him might
compromise his integrity, it doesn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to be respectable?'' he recently told W magazine,
scoffing at the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of contemporary portrait sitters hope to recapture the
languor of a vanished era or halt time in its tracks, a
preoccupation increasingly common among those baby boomers now well
into their middle years.
</P>
<P>
   Others commission portraits as an unabashed act of
self-veneration. In today's celebritocracy, ``if somebody is known,
they want to document their fame,'' Poccianti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they're not an icon, they want to create a beautiful
image, both for themselves and for their posterity,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Weld, a social figure in New York, who quipped, ``Most
of these people don't have ancestors or family portraits _ but
you've got to start somewhere.'' Ms. Weld commissioned a portrait
of herself last year by Juan Fernando Bostos, known for his
paintings of velvet- and pearl-freighted Washington ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Marian MacKinney, the president of Portraits Inc., a storefront
gallery on upper Park Avenue, said, ``People come into the gallery
and say, `I want to have my portrait done like a John Singer
Sargent,''' Ms. MacKinney, who represents about 200 artists and
receives about the same number of commissions each year, said that
about 60 percent of the business used to come from institutions
like banks seeking portraits of directors for the boardroom. But
these days, it is equally divided between industry magnates and
private clients and their families, she said. She ascribes her
clients' interest in part to millennial fever. ``Portraits speak to
people's sense of history,'' she said. ``Our clients want to
connect with the century they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   For some people, sitting for a portrait is an act of
self-expression, something like having a couture dress designed or
a room lavishly redecorated. Poccianti tells of a patron in San
Diego who wanted a portrait to go with his house. ``I have this
great old castle,'' the client told the him, and the client wanted
a medieval-style portrait to suit it. ``He was really into the
vibe,'' Poccianti recalled, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   For others, however, a sitting can be more profound. Ms. Weld,
who elected to pose in the attitude of annunciation, said the
painting, which hangs behind a curtain in her Upper West Side
living room, meant for her eyes only, was symbolic, intended to
celebrate the fact that Ms. Weld, who is in her 40s, was receptive
to her own creative impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Such whims can be costly. Artists' fees range from about $10,000
for a portrait by Ms. Cooper, who has done likenesses of Plimpton
and young plutocrats like Hilary Auchincloss (a wedding commission
from the subject's mother) to $25,000 and up for the work of top
portrait artists, and into the hundreds of thousands for a painting
by a world-renowned figure like Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   But sums like these aren't apt to put off young Wall Street
hotshots, newly arrived gentry and self-styled grandes dames
commissioning portraits nowadays. Billy Sullivan, a New York artist
whose work was featured as that of the character played by Greg
Kinnear in ``As Good as It Gets,'' has painted likeness of
Hollywood notables like Sophia Coppola and Gina Gershon. He
remembers being importuned by a caller from Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ```Everyone in Mexico has done my portrait except Diego Rivera,
and that is only because I was too young,''' the diva crooned into
Sullivan's telephone. Some weeks later, he recalled, she
materialized on his threshold, a pair of yelping terriers in her
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Clients of Poccianti, readily part with $10,000 to $15,000 for
the privilege of being photographed in the regalia of real or
imagined ancestors, in the opulent style of an Ingres or Bronzino.
``They like the theatrically, the feeling they are playing a
role,'' Poccianti said. ``You can even sense a certain state fright
when they are having their hair and makeup done.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Boardman, who posed for Seidner last year for a
photograph assigned by Vanity Fair, approached the project with
bemused detachment. ``It was fun, almost like playing dress-up,''
said Ms. Boardman, who was photographed in a frothy couture evening
dress by Christian Lacroix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to commission a painting,'' she added, but
conceded that might be intimidating. ``It seems an awfully grown-up
thing to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her feeling is shared by sitters of all ages, many of whom will
do almost anything _ from slouching to dressing in gingham or jeans
_ to avoid appearing stuffy. ``Our clients come with lofty
expectations _ they want to look as attractive as they can,'' said
Ms. MacKinney of Portraits Inc., who customarily tells her artists
to shave five pounds and at least as many years off their subjects.
But they rarely ask to appear in costume or be portrayed as grander
than they are. ``I haven't seen any Napoleons lately,'' she said
Nor has anyone approached her asking to look like an Ingres. ``But
who knows,'' she added. ``It could happen any time.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN RULING PARTY'S HISTORIC PRIMARY: RUSE OR STEP FOR
DEMOCRACY?
 &HT;    With PRIMARY-BOX-$ADV07.
 &HT;    EDs: Poll information attached at end of story.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In an event being billed as a historic step for
democracy, Mexican voters go to the polls today(Sun.) to select the
next presidential nominee for the world's longest ruling political
party.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since it took control of Mexico's presidency
70 years ago, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is
holding a primary to select its candidate for the country's general
election _ scheduled for July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting, although self-supervised by the PRI, has been
portrayed as a critical thaw in the party's seven-decade grip on
most power in Mexico from the municipal level to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the race has helped usher in a new era in Mexican
electoral politics, with fiercely competitive rhetoric and costly
media ads pitting two top PRI rivals against each other. They are
former interior minister Francisco Labastida, who has pulled ahead
in some polls with a 10-point lead, and former Tabasco state
governor Roberto Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   But during a three-month campaign that wrapped up last
Wednesday, the primary has also been attacked _ by Madrazo and two
other underdog candidates _ as a skewed competition where
frontrunner Labastida benefited from vote-buying and received
forbidden support from the PRI's many governors and its well-oiled
political machine. Today's balloting will prove if the PRI can hold
an election clean enough to keep followers united, and renovate it
image internationally and at home.
</P>
<P>
   Dulce Maria Sauri, the PRI's secretary general, acknowledged
that charges of scattered irregularities on behalf of Labastida had
diminished some voters' confidence in the primary. The party
announced the election only last May.
</P>
<P>
   The primary marks the first time since 1929 that voters rather
than the sitting president of the republic will pick the party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are various types of resistance (to this change). Some
of it comes from nostalgic people who long for the past,'' Sauri
told Cox Newspapers in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sauri said, ``I hope that people will give us the
benefit of the doubt and go out to vote . . . At first there was an
incredible level of disbelief (in the primary). But now I think
we've reached a level of reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pollsters say that the greater the number of voters, the
better the chance of Madrazo pulling off an upset over Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   But a poll published last week in Mexico City's Reforma
newspaper indicated that interest in the primary among Mexicans in
general was weak in spite of the opportunity for choice that it
represents. Only 34 percent of respondents were sure of when the
primary would be held.
</P>
<P>
   An October poll conducted by Indemerc-Louis Harris of Mexico
found that only 36 percent of those surveyed thought the balloting
would be completely honest.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's evolving electoral code does not yet cover primaries,
so the PRI alone monitored the rules of the campaign. The party
prohibited all PRI figures from the president down to the municipal
party leader from organizing support for a candidate or using
government programs and resources to help win votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida's rivals charge this prohibition was flouted. The
party's vast network of PRI-affiliated unions and neighborhood
groups were allowed to lobby for favorites and try to convince
members to toe the line in the secret ballot election.
</P>
<P>
   Trained PRI observers, as well as candidates' representatives
will supervise the balloting. Party leaders say the voting will
emulate constitutional elections supervised by Mexico's independent
Federal Elections Institute. Mexico counts about 54.5 million
credentialed voters. All are invited to participate. The party
expects only about 6.5 million to turn out, most of them PRI
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots will be cast at 64,500 booths set up around the
country's 300 election districts. The candidate who captures the
greatest number of districts, not direct votes, will win the
nomination. Mexico state and Mexico City are expected to be hotly
contested because they have 36 and 30 districts, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate is allowed to post up to two representatives at
each polling station who can monitor the voting and a computerized
count. The party says it has built in safeguards so that ballots
can be counted at the district level as well as at a main
headquarters in Mexico City by an independent firm under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of fraud is almost impossible,'' said PRI
primary coordinator Francisco Gutierrez Barrios.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Madrazo's supporters say they will be watching for
signs of cheating and will ``immediately denounce them if
discovered,'' said Madrazo press secretary Octavio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's reaction to the election will be key. If he denounces
the balloting as fraudulent the PRI's attempts to unite Madrazo's
followers behind Labastida could fail and hurt the PRI nominee in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is viewed as a candidate who would fundamentally
follow President Ernesto Zedillo's free-market economic reforms in
Mexico, although he is under pressure to advance programs for
Mexico's poorest and address discontent in the countryside over
less government support for Mexican farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Labastida's opinion poll ratings on sincerity and
competence have increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't seem pompous,'' said Consuelo Garcia, a PRI
activist and Labastida supporter in the huge Mexico City
working-class neighborhood of Iztapalapa.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, portraying himself as a PRI outsider, launched a
television and state-by-state campaign blitz against Labastida and
the government's current economic policies. He has appealed to
disgruntled PRI members who believe the PRI has abandoned Mexico's
working class by reducing subsidies, farm credit and other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Elvia Molina, who had a Madrazo poster pasted on her tin-roof
house in a poor barrio in Iztapalapa, said, ``Madrazo looks more
like regular people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supposedly, we are going to elect the candidate,'' she added
with a shrug. ``But we know it's not really so.''
</P>
<P>
   If the PRI fractures, PRI opponents say they are ready to appeal
to the disaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, presidential nominee of the National Action Party,
or PAN, invited Madrazo supporters to join his campaign. In one
recent poll, Fox was only a couple of points behind Labastida in
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took my role,'' Fox said, acknowledging that Madrazo's
``change'' theme stirred a healthy number of voters. But Madrazo is
a ``false prophet,'' he said, and a PRI insider who wanted to
remake himself as a reformer to capture votes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Fox clashed with Zedillo's government over an
alleged attempt to censor a biting new PAN ad that challenges the
credibility of the PRI's primary and makes fun of the party's new
slogan, ``a new PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they think we have no memory?'' a voice says against grainy
pictures of Mexico's last five presidents and campaign slogans
promising better lives for Mexicans. The last shot is of a square
that says, ``reserved for the old face of the new PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   An undersecretary in Zedillo's interior ministry called the PAN
and urged the party to pull the ads, contending that they
interfered with the PRI's primary. The PAN refused and publicly
denounced an attempt at censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who is developing an image as a democratic reformer,
has championed the primary as a pivotal reform for the PRI and for
Mexico. Since neither of the major opposition parties in Mexico
held a primary, the PRI has busily touted its internal competition
as an example of how it is more democratic than its opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's election is supposed to represent the end of Mexico's
presidents selecting the party's nominees _ in effect, their
successors _ by the secret process known jokingly here as the
``dedazo,'' or ``the big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens today, said Madrazo spokesman Garcia,
``we'll never go back to the way nominees were picked in the
past.''

WORST TV COMMERCIALS: THE READERS SPEAK
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Nov. 8)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I asked readers to identify their least favorite TV commercials
and, as expected, the response was tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   From the many letters and e-mail you sent me I was able to draw
several, general, conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _ The person responsible for airing the first
feminine-hygiene-product commercial should spend eternity fighting
a persistent yeast infection.
</P>
<P>
   _ It may have taken a lot of courage for Bob Dole to talk about
E.D. on TV, but it would be an even braver thing if he'd stop.
</P>
<P>
   _ You wish that the parents of the little girl who runs through
the store shrieking that she just ``went poo-poo in the potty''
discover, to their eternal horror and disgust, that this was the
first and last time she would ever do it.
</P>
<P>
   According to you, a bad commercial is one that annoys,
irritates, disgusts or offends. The worst bad commercials manage to
push several or all of these buttons at once.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of pushing buttons, many readers, despite their
advancing years, boast of lightning-like reflexes when it comes to
punching the ``mute'' button on their remote-controls.
</P>
<P>
   (Certainly a safer and more ``high-tech'' solution to the
problem than the rocks and baseball bats of yore. Reformers who
speak of ``TV-related violence'' don't realize how much worse it
would be without these nifty gadgets.)
</P>
<P>
   Commercials that glorify bad table manners really get under our
skin. Jeane Snelgrove thinks the worst offender is the Stouffer's
French Bread Pizza featuring a ``teen-ager eating with his mouth
wide open, his hat on backward and his feet on the table. I will
not buy Stouffer's products at all after seeing it. A world ruder
than today's will not be pleasant to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Harrison takes to task a certain ``large orange-juice
company'' for the commercial that features a ``fat child who is
sucking air through his soda straw while a pretty little girl looks
adoringly at him, apparently admiring the rude noise he is able to
produce at such high volume. No wonder parents are going nuts these
days ....''
</P>
<P>
   Norm Shaw votes for the Snickers commercial where the guy in the
``halo'' neck brace is unsuccessfully trying to stuff a candy bar
into his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very sensitive commercial written by someone obviously
sensitive to people who have been in horrible accidents. Yech!''
</P>
<P>
   Really bad commercials can evoke really strong reactions in
certain viewers. Dee Trowbridge is so annoyed at a Dunkin' Donuts
commercial that she would ``like to find the ad agency personnel
that created it and destroy their ancestors to stop its eventual
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Other readers, like Paul Curtis are simply perplexed. ``A bunch
of police officers charge into a room and confront a man eating a
(Taco Bell) Chalupa, or at least trying to eat it. They tell him to
drop the Chalupa. Why? He is not a criminal. He has no weapon. Why
should he drop the Chalupa? Then one of the officers says, `Call
for backup.' For what? What is the point of this whole episode?''
</P>
<P>
   Ads for personal-injury attorneys may actually cause injuries,
such as sprained thumbs from pounding the mute button, and local
car dealers have a certain segment of the population looking for
public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But, without a doubt, it's feminine-hygiene-product commercials
that people hate the most. Christopher Cotter objects to everything
about them, especially the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sickens me to have commercials come on, without warning,
asking me to contemplate women's bodily fluids and biohazardous
micro-organisms while I'm eating. As a consumer, I have no
curiosity to listen in on a friendly debate between a mother and
daughter regarding cures for feminine itch and yeast infections as
I'm eating creamed chipped beef on toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even worse is the commercial featuring two women walking along
a beach. Invariably, one will casually (and cheerfully) ask, `Do
you douche?' at the moment I chomp down on a tomato!''
</P>
<P>
   For summing up so many people's feelings so graphically, if not
necessarily eloquently, I award Cotter first place in the Worst TV
Commercial contest. Per his request, he will be awarded a bottle of
Emetrol rather than Alka-Seltzer to help him keep future meals
down.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone else who contributed I'd like to say thank you, and
happy muting!

HONDA'S ALL-NEW S2000 ROADSTER IS A FINE THROWBACK TO THE 1960S
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The open-top roadster from the '60s is back with a vengeance in
the all-new Honda S2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, first came the Mazda Miata in 1990, then the BMW Z3 a few
years later. Those vehicles also re-created the experience of the
roadster that dates to the days of the MG, Triumph, Sprite, Sunbeam
and other open-top two-seaters _ mostly from Britain. They were
quite the rage.
</P>
<P>
   The Miata and Z3 have their fans, and they are decent roadsters
that deserve credit for reviving this fun-yet-impractical
specialty-vehicle class.
</P>
<P>
   But I believe Honda has done the most credible job so far in
bringing out a (nearly) affordable roadster _ with a list price of
$32,000 _ that stays true to the original theme. The S2000 provides
exciting performance, including power and road-hugging abilities,
and an exhaust note that is sweet to the ears.
</P>
<P>
   This high-performance sports car is close in appearance to the
Honda SSM concept car that was first shown at the 1995 Tokyo Motor
Show. It has a race-car feel to it, reflecting Honda's success in
both CART and Formula One racing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what I like best about the S2000, though, is that it
doesn't pander to our spoiled side, the one that enjoys cushy cars
that ride so smoothly you can imagine you're still at home in your
favorite recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who ever drove one of the '60s roadsters knows the ride
is supposed to be a little rugged, the passenger compartment a bit
cramped and the noise a bit on the wild side. That's the way it is
in the S2000, as evidenced by one of my co-workers' comment after
she went for a ride in this beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kinda rough, isn't it?'' she said. ``And there's not much room
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. Right on!
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is a macho thing, but I don't think so. I know lots of
men and women who owned and thoroughly enjoyed the Spitfires and
Tigers and such, even if those vehicles did ride a bit like trucks.
There is a reason for such a stiff suspension: it goes hand-in-hand
with the road-hugging capabilities of cars of this genre.
</P>
<P>
   The S2000, like Honda's much-more expensive Acura NSX sports
car, is mostly hand-built, and it shows in the detail. This car is
well put-together, and the unique Honda X-bone frame is largely
responsible for the structural rigidity that is one of the S2000's
most remarkable attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Most convertibles shake and shimmy over every little bump. The
S2000 holds together and takes a bump in one big lump the way a
performance car should. Cross beams and a reinforced center tunnel
help create this rigidity at the bottom to compensate for the lack
of continuity in the structure at the top. (The soft top comes
down, remember?)
</P>
<P>
   These reinforcements intrude a bit on the passenger space, but I
can live with that. I took this baby around some tight turns and
hilly curves that would challenge most decent sporty coupes, and
the S2000 showed me what I had traded that interior comfort for.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine turns out a whopping 240
horsepower _ the most power for this much displacement of any
non-turbocharged vehicle on the street. There is no automatic
transmission available, and I hope none is ever offered _ it would
spoil the effect.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car that is meant to be driven by someone who likes to
drive, and for that, it takes a manual gearbox. The S2000's is a
six-speed with a tight, short throw that allows for up- and
downshifting quickly and precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a rear-wheel-drive vehicle, too _ something that
was necessary to re-create the roadster. Honda's last rear-drive
car was the S500 roadster in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 153 foot-pounds of torque that this car gives at
7,500 rpm, I was never able to break the tires free from the
pavement on start-up, which means that all the traction is there to
move this car along quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With a very high redline of 9,000 rpm, this car gets rather
noisy when wound up, but that's just part of the thrill. It is hard
to get it up to 9,000 rpm on urban streets _ at least without
getting a ticket or raising too much attention. That kind of
driving is best left to country roads.
</P>
<P>
   I really like the S2000's muscular looks. It's not as pretty as
the Miata and Boxster, and not as weird as the BMW (not that
there's anything wrong with that ... ). Our test car came in the
only color that truly makes sense: arrest-me red.
</P>
<P>
   There are some concessions to our latter-20th century wants,
including an electrically operated convertible top, power windows
and door locks and a racing-style digital instrument panel. I'll
allow the power accessories, but I'd prefer an analog speedometer,
tachometer and other gauges. Digital just isn't true to the
roadster heritage and certainly isn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Braking ability is among the best I've tested in any vehicle,
thanks to large power-assisted disc brakes with an antilock system
(standard). The rack-and-pinion steering is power-assisted, too,
but with a variable-ratio setup that keeps the wheel rigid at
highway speeds for better road feel and control.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the S2000 is a bit different. You turn the key to the
``on'' position, then push a red starter button on the dash to the
left of the steering wheel. This arrangement isn't new to me; my
Piper Tri-Pacer has a red start-button under the pilot's seat. I
can pretend I'm about to take off in my airplane when I fire up the
S2000 _ it will almost fly, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Curb weight is 2,800 pounds, heavy enough to hold the S2000 to
the ground, but light enough to give the engine a chance to move
the car along.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other creature comforts included in the price:
leather seats, cruise control, air-conditioning, remote keyless
entry, high-intensity-discharge headlights, and an
AM/FM/compact-disc stereo (which can stay hidden behind a pull-down
dash panel while you control it with remote buttons on the left
side of the dash above the starter button). Dual air bags are
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering and raising the top are easy. To lower it, you just pop
loose the two catches at the top of the windshield, then pull back
on the center-console-mounted switch (which operates only with the
hand brake applied). The top folds back within a few seconds, and
there is a tonneau cover in the trunk to make everything look neat
and tidy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bit more luggage space once the cover is removed from
the trunk, but still the total is just 5 cubic feet _ slightly
smaller than the Miata's trunk.
</P>
<P>
   With a $415 transportation charge, total price of our test car
was $32,415. No options are offered _ a Honda tradition that
continues with this vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 20 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on
the highway. But only if you behave yourself. The tank holds 13.2
gallons of fuel.

 &HT;    HOUSE RESTORES $11.5 BILLION TO MEDICARE PROGRAM
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Responding to complaints that Medicare spending had
been cut too deeply, the House voted overwhelmingly Friday to
restore $11.5 billion to the program over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 388-25, is expected to ease financial
pressures faced by hospitals _ particularly in rural areas _ and
nursing homes as a result of provisions in the 1997 Balanced Budget
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would provide more money to managed care
organizations whose efforts to shift Medicare enrollees from the
traditional fee-for-service program suffered after the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure is pending in the Senate, and President
Clinton has expressed support for the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hailed the bill as a step toward preserving Medicare
from the unintended consequences of earlier legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our proposal, families won't have to drive to the next
county to get emergency care, seniors will have the flexibility to
enroll in new plans to get the benefits they need, and doctors will
make more house calls,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman
of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill does nothing to reform the Medicare program, which
is expected to face severe financial problems in about a decade.
Medicare reform has been the subject of much attention from the
White House and Congress, but the lack of agreement over a wide
range of policy issues _ including how to provide prescription drug
coverage _ has stymied prospects for action this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of lawmakers warned that efforts to pass a
patient's bill of rights this year will fail unless Republican
House leaders show more support for the bill. A House-Senate
conference committee has been appointed to work out differences
between versions passed by the two chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker appoints 13 GOP conferees and only one voted for
the bill and the two Republican authors aren't named as
conferees,'' complained Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, an author of the
House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., another author of the bill, said
that ``although I believe there is still an outside chance of the
conference coming to a decent agreement, it will take an
unprecedented victory of political persuasion to overcome the total
stacking of the deck by conferee appointments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare bill restores $3.5 billion to the Medicare-Plus
Choice program that gives seniors a choice between a variety of
managed care plans and the traditional fee-for-service program.
HMOs have complained since 1997 that the cuts imposed that year
were too deep.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also pumps more money into rural hospitals, many of
which were in danger of closing because of financial problems they
claimed were caused by the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   A provision authored by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., was designed to
lessen the impact of Medicare cuts to hospitals for outpatient
services. Under Foley's plan, reductions would be phased in over a
three-year period and hospitals would be guaranteed they would not
lose more than about 10 percent the first year and 5 percent the
next two years as a result of the formula changes.

YOUR EXCUSE IS PRETTY LAME, JUNIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LOWELL COHN   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could make a list of the world's worst excuses: The check is
in the mail. The dog ate my homework. The devil made me do it.
</P>
<P>
   But the absolute worst, the weakest by far is the one Ken
Griffey Jr. came up with the other day. He wants out of Seattle, he
said, so he can be closer to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but that one wins the Baloney of the Week Award, and I'm
not the only one who says so. John McGrath, a sports columnist at
the Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune, had this to say about Griffey's
love of family:
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his family used to live around here. Now he wants to
play for a team closer to the family that used to be here in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Griffey lives in Orlando, Fla. It's where lots
of famous athletes cluster these days. But Griffey, who is turning
his back on $18 million a year for eight years from the Mariners,
easily could afford a second home in Seattle, or in the Phoenix
area. Hey, he could probably buy the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Griffey's need to be close to his loved ones has
nothing to do with his request for a trade. He doesn't like the
dimensions of brand new Safeco Field. He doesn't think the Mariners
can win a championship. He doesn't like the weather in Seattle. The
list of his gripes could go on, but I only have limited space here.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to add, though, that Mariners management, which
groveled at Griffey's feet, said he's ``courageous'' to put family
before baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Give us all a major break.
</P>
<P>
   Understand this. Atlanta is already the front-runner for
Griffey. The Braves certainly have the players for a trade _ Kevin
Millwood, Andruw Jones, maybe even Chipper Jones. If he goes to
Atlanta, Griffey will earn top dollar from one of the best and
richest teams in baseball, and he'll probably end up in the World
Series. Given all that, I see nothing courageous in what Griffey
has done, nor do I think it's a testament to family values. It's a
testament to something, but I'm not sure what.
</P>
<P>
   I expected the Seattle sports writers to be in mourning over
Griffey, the same as if Tony Gwynn were leaving San Diego. You
know, a god is blowing town, boo hoo and all that. No way. You
should have seen what the Seattle columnists had to say about
Junior.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Blaine Newnham of the Seattle Times: ``We were
blessed to have him, his grace in the outfield and power at the
plate. And blessed, too, that he will be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, this gets better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' Newnham continued, ``in his last year as a
Mariner, Ken Griffey Jr. was a grumpy home-run hitter. He quit
running out ground balls, he quit taking leadership in the
clubhouse, he almost refused to be invigorated by the new ballpark
when everyone else was. Always there was the playing hard-to-get,
the whining that peppered almost every conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   For a minute, I thought I was reading about Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kelley, also of the Times, didn't exactly seem
grief-stricken about Griffey, either: ``It doesn't have to be the
end of baseball as we know it,'' he wrote. ``Remember, (the
Mariners) have finished a total of 13 games below .500 the past two
years with Griffey and (Alex) Rodriguez. They've won exactly one
playoff game with both of them in the starting lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that something? Griffey is supposed to be the best
baseball player alive, and neither Times columnist could muster the
energy for a real eulogy. In fact, both quickly started suggesting
trades that would benefit the Mariners and help them get a team
better suited to the new ballpark. It was as though Griffey already
were gone, or maybe he was lying in the gutter, and they were
stepping over his prone body.
</P>
<P>
   You know what? Their attitude toward Griffey is entirely
justified. Aren't you sick of superstars running out on fans,
cold-heartedly deserting adoring cities?
</P>
<P>
   So you want out, Junior? Fine. Here's the door.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Seattle writers are talking about the difference
between a selfless team and a star-driven team. They think selfless
teams are more fun to watch. Newnham wrote, ``(The Mariners')
chances are better without Griffey, as heretical and ungrateful as
that might sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds fine to me. I understand the disgust Newnham feels for
Griffey. We all have it _ if not specifically for Griffey, then for
Bonds and people like them. We dream of a past when ballplayers
played for the love of it and didn't whine or make themselves
obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those days are long gone _ I'm not sure they ever
really existed. One request, though. The next time a great player
abandons a city, he should be forced to upgrade his excuse. The
I-have-to-be-closer-to-my-family thing has been done to death.

`X-FILES' SEASON PREMIERE COULD BE SHOW'S LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't help watching the Sunday season premiere of ``The
X-Files'' without a bit of sadness and nostalgia creeping over you.
Barring a miracle _ and the soothing of a lot of bruised egos _
this is the end of the line for a landmark TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Being away from Chris Carter's signature series for so long
allows you to forget how brilliant it can be. We tend to view shows
that have been around so long _ and have buffed up to feature film
status along the way _ with a dismissiveness that hides a conceit
for things new, a feeling that we've all been there and done that
and we're tired.
</P>
<P>
   And it's true _ ``The X-Files'' was beginning to show its age,
was losing direction while simultaneously trying to answer myriad
questions raised through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the show should have been at its most fascinating _
pulling a Houdini and providing explanations for so many
far-fetched and fantastic ideas that began six seasons ago _ it
lost focus, seemed inferior to previous years. Not every episode,
but a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that this is the beginning of the end, ``The Sixth
Extinction'' episode (9 p.m. Sunday, Channel 2), can never be
viewed in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of thinking that ``The X-Files'' will be around for
one or two more seasons, and thus we can pay attention to a
fledgling series from the fall, a newfound appreciation for
Carter's vision is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the most important year to pay attention to ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Extinction'' begins this seventh season as a
two-parter. Carter loves to keep viewers guessing _ and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the finale put Scully in Africa, staring down at a
spaceship in the waters off the Ivory Coast, and Mulder was in some
asylum, gone loony with head pain after discovering an ancient
artifact _ clearly extraterrestrial in origin. The unexplained
conclusion seemingly hinted that Earth was nothing but a lab
experiment for a greater race of aliens and oh, by the way, the
project is over and they're coming back.
</P>
<P>
   What do we learn from the beginning of this two-parter?
</P>
<P>
   Well, mostly that humans who think they can figure out the
deepest secrets of the cosmos by fiddling with that spaceship and
piecing together the vast puzzle ought to be prepared for some
serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   You wanted a definitive answer?
</P>
<P>
   That's never been the idea behind the series. It's the not
knowing that keeps us returning. That and Carter's endlessly sly
pop culture trick of giving the masses of America a confounding
dose of ``science and mysticism,'' religion and philosophy,
morality, politics and science fiction _ when all along they
thought it was just a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Fox was much too quick to pull the plug
on Carter's latest series, ``Harsh Realm,'' after bungling the
promotion and abandoning patience. It wasn't the most auspicious
pilot ever, but when you have someone as creative as Carter, you
let out the rope. We never got a chance to see if he'd hang himself
or craft yet another imaginative, compelling series. And that's a
shame.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as ``The X-Files'' winds down, we're left to wonder what
could have been with a series that had Carter fully engaged. As
viewers, we can only hope that this final season rebounds
spectacularly, reaffirms our faith in one of the industry's better
producers.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that we lost our appreciation for what Carter offered
last season simply because he set the bar so high in so many
different episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' has had 53 Emmy nominations (winning only once,
for best drama series), plus three Golden Globe awards. But its
impact has been greater in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' was one of the first Internet-fueled shows, a
trend networks monitor closely these days. And it ushered in a kind
of dark, skeptical dramatic genre that spawned many clones _ none
of them successful.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Star Trek'' before it, ``The X-Files'' created legions of
fans who attended conventions and helped, along the way, to create
a pop culture identity that few shows have been able to match. You
didn't have to be a sci-fi person to like ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   It appealed to conspiracy theorists, action and horror fans, and
anyone who liked a well-crafted anthology drama.
</P>
<P>
   That's why watching the season premiere episode creates a rush
of emotion _ nostalgia, appreciation, the show's patented
confusion, etc. This is it.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has already said that he's writing the show as if it were
the last season. He's going to wrap up complicated storylines. And
now that star David Duchovny has sued over royalties and Carter has
been ill-treated by Fox _ issues that go beyond the stars wanting
out and other problems that would have hurt the possibility of
additional seasons _ there's no getting around the inevitable
conclusion of this fine series.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if we find the truth that is allegedly out
there. It's the journey of discovery that has been the most
interesting.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hannah Sandler isn't scared of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The West Hills third-grader pricks her own finger six times a
day to check her blood sugar levels. And before she got her
pager-sized insulin pump, she used to give herself the daily
insulin injections that keep her alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched my mom do it and I wanted to learn how,'' said
Hannah. That was when she was 5{ years old; she turns 8 on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah talks about diabetes with the easy calm of a physician
and a level of understanding that's far beyond many adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has insulin in their stomach, but I don't have any
so I have this insulin pump,'' Hannah explains.
</P>
<P>
   It's that simple. To Hannah, multiplication tables are more
vexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tough kid,'' said her mom, Helaine Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   She's also an amazing fund-raiser. For the past few years,
Hannah, her mom, dad Scott, and 5-year-old sister Della have pulled
together huge teams for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's Walk to
Cure Diabetes. Hannah's supporters often outnumber corporate teams.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves Hannah's Bananas _ a nod to a nickname
Hannah picked up as an infant swaddled in a yellow wrap. This year
about 120 people will put on donated T-shirts and carry donated
inflatable Chiquita bananas for the walk through Griffith Park. The
team hopes to raise roughly $8,500 toward the foundation's $1
million fund-raising goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part is if people donate money they can find the
cure,'' Hannah said.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's doctor says she is likely to see that cure in her
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not far off,'' said Dr. Norman Lavin, a pediatric
endocrinologist and director of the diabetes center at
Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center. ``By the time she's 25 or
30, this will be like dealing with a cold, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   The pager-sized insulin pump Hannah now wears is just one of the
recent innovations in the treatment and management of diabetes, a
chronic, incurable disease that affects roughly 16 million
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One million people like Hannah have Type I diabetes, a condition
caused by the body's inability to produce insulin, the key that
allows glucose to fuel up cells and run all vital functions. It's
still not clear what causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 15 million people have Type II diabetes, a
variation of the disease in which the body still produces insulin
but can't process it effectively. Type II diabetes strikes mostly
older people, though it is on the rise in severely overweight
children.
</P>
<P>
   Type I diabetics rely on insulin shots to keep them alive. Type
II diabetics can sometimes take oral insulin. In both cases,
insulin only helps to keep the disease from ravaging the body. It
is not a cure. Both Type I and Type II patients must live by strict
diets designed to help balance their blood glucose levels.
</P>
<P>
   If blood glucose levels are not tightly controlled, both Type I
and Type II diabetes can result in complications such as kidney
failure, blindness and amputations due to poor circulation. Low
blood sugar also can cause blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, treatment of the
disease costs about $105 billion annually. But there is reason for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers report promising results in the transplantation of
insulin-producing islet cells into a damaged pancreas, a
breakthrough that, if successful, would cure diabetes. Other
scientists believe that by cracking the mysteries of DNA they will
be able to turn on insulin production in any other organ. For
example, a diabetic's stomach or liver could be turned into an
insulin-producing organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens on a microscopic level so we don't need much
room,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, companies such as Sylmar-based MiniMed are
working to combine blood sugar testing technologies and the insulin
pump into an artificial pancreas. The device would constantly check
the body's blood chemistry and add sugar or insulin as needed to
maintain tight control _ the key to avoiding the serious health
complications associated with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hannah relies on her insulin pump and a strict diet to
control her blood sugar levels. All the children in her class know
how to spot the signs of low blood sugar and report it to a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these kids have been with Hannah since kindergarten,
when she was diagnosed,'' said third-grade teacher Christina Young.
``We're like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah describes the low blood sugar feeling like this: ``I
start seeing purple stuff and I feel weak, so I have to take a
glucose tablet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's typical matter-of-fact Hannah Sandler. She's more
interested in Pokeman or kickball than she is in pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an almost 8-year-old, she's incredible,'' said Helaine
Sandler. ``She likes being in the limelight. I attribute a lot of
it to her having to grow up really quickly _ having to be strong.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Disney's new version of `Annie' shines
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The networks say they hate them. Many viewers don't like them.
But you can set your calendar by them: the TV sweeps periods. Four
times a year _ November, February, May and July _ Nielsen Media
Research takes special ratings measurements to set ad rates for
many network affiliates. So the networks line up special programs
and then schedule many of them on Sunday evening, the night with
the most folks watching. Tonight's shows have been hyped to the
heavens. You may want to watch them all but probably can't. Our
roundup of reviews can help you decide what to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie'' shines, like the top of the Chrysler Building.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when there is very little on television that an entire
family can sit down and enjoy together, Disney's new version of the
road-show perennial is a blessing, a musical that practically
bursts out of the confines of the set. Purists may not like the way
it's been cut down for TV, and cynics may choke on the high sugar
content, but that's their hard-knock lot in life.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the trimming that's been done is what makes this
``Annie'' sing. The 1982 movie ran more than two hours, as does the
stage play, but Disney has whittled it down to 90 minutes, the
standard TV movie length (commercials and credits fill out the
two-hour block).
</P>
<P>
   A couple of lesser songs have been cut, but all the favorites
are here, with choreography that looks like several million bucks:
``Tomorrow,'' ``Maybe,'' ``Little Girls,'' ``Easy Street,''
``You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile'' and ``I Think I'm
Gonna Like It Here.'' That last one is blown out as much as any
$40-a-ticket Fox show, as a battalion of high-kicking chambermaids
and dust rag-popping butlers cavort around Daddy Warbucks' mansion.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``It's the Hard-Knock Life,'' it's fun to imagine some
kid who's only heard Jay-Z's rap sample of that song seeing
``Annie'' for the first time tonight and hearing the full song
build its joyous harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   What's been lost? Big chunks of the story, but face it, we're
not exactly chopping up Eugene O'Neill here. ``Annie'' now is
mainly song-song-song, with enough segue scenes so that the
narrative still makes sense. Punjab is gone, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt appears only in a brief roll-on cameo, and the Depression
angle is present but played down.
</P>
<P>
   Watching all this whiz by, you realize how bloated director John
Huston's 1982 film was. That, of course, will still be the
yardstick by which fans will judge the new set of performances, and
only Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks suffers, in comparison to the
movie's Albert Finney: Garber isn't nearly gruff enough. Kathy
Bates, however, is a hoot as orphan-wrangler Miss Hannigan (``I
love my job _ it's kids I hate''). And 12-year-old newcomer Alicia
Morton is a little more real, a little less cartoony than Aileen
Quinn. She also doesn't have that tremulous vibrato so many Annies
have, which is a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting note is that Audra McDonald, the three-time Tony
winner who plays Grace (Daddy Warbucks' secretary) is
African-American, in a role nearly always cast white. This makes
the blossoming romance between Warbucks and Grace interracial, but
it's handled with such mildness it barely registers.
</P>
<P>
   The same producers did 1997's wildly successful ``Rodgers &AMP;
Hammerstein's Cinderella'' with Brandy and Whitney Houston. One TV
musical every other year does not mark a return to the '50s and
'60s, when musicals were plentiful on TV, but maybe ...
``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie''
</P>
<P>
   7 tonight on ABC.

   Grade: A-

 &HT;    `Leprechauns' short on magic for everyone
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov.07.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is two movies. One is a magical, like-they-used-to-make-'em
fairy tale for kids. The other is a ridiculous, will-this-never-end
endurance test for adults. NBC's two-part ``Leprechauns'' is almost
never just one movie for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Randy Quaid and Whoopi Goldberg, ``Leprechauns'' is
billed as family entertainment, but it's really only entertaining
for those family members under 10. Too bad. Leprechauns are
supremely cool, no matter what age you are: sneaky little toughs
who prefer stealth and pranks to the teacher's-pet tendencies of
elves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fun-loving people full of pep and vigor,'' Seamus
Muldoon (Colm Meaney) explains tonight to a visiting American
businessman (Quaid).
</P>
<P>
   ``And booze, given half the chance,'' adds his wife Mary (the
brilliant Zoe Wanamaker, who's criminally wasted here).
</P>
<P>
   There are special effects galore to enchant the kids: flying
fairies, hovering castles, talking trees and Goldberg, a walking,
talking special effect who as the Grand Banshee is so absurdly
coifed and dressed you'd think she was hosting the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   But following it all is a chore. There might not be a story
written, ever, that it doesn't borrow from. ``The Wizard of Oz,''
``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Alice in Wonderland'' _ it's got a piece of
them all.
</P>
<P>
   Kids won't mind, of course, except that it starts too late for
them tonight and four hours of this stuff over two days is too much
for anybody. But for parents looking to spend quality time with
them in front of the boob tube, ``Leprechauns'' is more work than
whimsy. Unlike a good feature-length Disney cartoon, it's not for
everybody.
</P>

 &HT;    Rock 'n' roll miniseries misses the beat
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wanna go in the barn and make some of the devil's music? It'll
be really cool!
</P>
<P>
   That's the screwball, it's-so-crazy-it-just-might-work sentiment
that runs through ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll,'' CBS' dumbed-down
miniseries about the life and death of '50s rock 'n' roll. This is
pop history reduced to a bland, hammy hybrid of daytime soaps and
high school theatrics. It's lousy with good intentions; there isn't
a slight or slur here that everyone isn't just bursting to
reconcile. But even its nods to the civil rights movement feel more
playacted than heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's race music,'' one of them crazy, barn-playin' kids
gee-whizzes while listening to a Chuck Berry record in the hayloft,
``I must be the wrong color!''
</P>
<P>
   And I must be going now. But CBS knows what it's doing. It
learned from NBC's ``The '60s,'' last season's horrible, horribly
successful miniseries, that historical melodrama, backed by an
oldies beat, can be a ratings bonanza. Apparently we can't resist
it: You try to turn the channel while somebody croons wop bop a loo
bop a lop bam boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll'' promises to do this one better: new
songs by Bob Dylan, Carole King and Graham Nash, as well as an
appearance by B.B. King.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it all feels more like Archie comics than the birth of a
musical revolution. Too sweet-faced Brad Hawkins and Bonnie
Somerville star as Tyler Hart and Lyne Danner, a couple of
heartland kids infected with the new sound that Negroes are playing
on the radio. They fall in love with both the music and each other,
and through their journey we get a Rock 'n' Roll for Dummies
education.
</P>
<P>
   But even though their journey is full of happy accidents that
place them beside all the era's greats _ Little Richard, Fats
Domino, Elvis _ they never really go anywhere. Whether breaking in
with Sun Records, playing at the Atlanta Civic Auditorium in 1957
with Bill Haley and the Comets, or heading to New York and falling
in the sinister clutches of record execs (James Coburn and Dana
Delany), Tyler and Lyne are perpetually arrested in wide-eyed
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   So what's finally presented is neither rock nor roll. It's
baloney. Makes you wanna holler.
</P>

 &HT;    Suffragists get the Burns treatment
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how much women prefer to lean on men, to be protected
and supported, or how much men prefer to have them do so, the
voyage of life is alone. ... In the tragedies and triumphs of human
experience, each mortal stands alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lines sound as if they might be a voice-over on ``Ally
McBeal,'' spoken as she trudges down a Boston street at the end of
an episode. Actually, they are from a speech by feminist founding
mother Elizabeth Cady Stanton more than a century ago, in 1892.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally'' is just the poster girl in the latest flare-up in the
gender wars, and a piddling little skirmish it is compared with
what women endured _ the triumphs and tragedies _ at the launch of
the women's rights movement in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Burns (``The Civil War'') tells this story by focusing on
the two leaders, Susan B. Anthony and Stanton. Anthony, who got her
head on a dollar coin, is the better remembered of the two, but
they were a perfect team, a nearly lifelong collaboration of like
minds and unlike temperaments.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony _ cranky, flinty and never married _ was a firebrand
speaker and activist. But it was Stanton, a happily married mother
of seven, who provided much of the philosophy that Anthony spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forged the fireworks, and she fired them,'' Stanton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Early feminism grew in part out of the temperance movement, but
even more so out of the antebellum abolition movement. Both women
tried to be prominent in the abolition movement, only to be shunted
aside by seemingly sympathetic male leaders, who told them to wait
their turn for emancipation, that ``this time belongs to the
Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   The two fought the good fight their entire lives, but never did
get their turn. Stanton died in 1902, Anthony in 1906, but the 19th
Amendment, which they had written in the 1870s, did not extend the
vote to women until 1920.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Burns' storytelling is impeccable. He's assembled a
cast of historians and celebrities to give voice to the women _
Julie Harris as Anthony, Ronnie Gilbert as Stanton, with Sally
Kellerman narrating _ and has unearthed many ancient photos that he
uses to advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But it's that very ``as always'' that sticks a little. Burns has
been America's most beloved documentarian for almost a decade now
(``Civil War'' was in 1990), and his technique never changes or
grows. There's a sameness to Burns' work that grows wearisome after
a while, even though there are no particular flaws in the work
itself: You may find yourself saying ``Enough with the evocative
fiddle music'' midway through. Burns is chronicling
revolutionaries; a little revolution within his own approach might
yield some interesting dividends.

 &HT;    Mummy mania raises profile of ancient Egypt
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mummies stir imaginations, star in movies and tour in
art exhibitions. They are so fascinating that young and old will,
as Emory University's Michael C. Carlos Museum discovered during
its recent fund-raising campaign, break open their piggy banks to
bring the wrapped wonders close to home.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, mummies are forever. Mummy mania, however, is only two
centuries old. There was a time, and it lasted for centuries, when
the Western world was oblivious to Egypt and its customs. Only
after Napoleon invaded the desert land in 1798 and brought back
tales of pyramids and sphinxes did interest in the ancient culture
stir.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of information that accompanies ``Life and Death
Under the Pharaohs: Egyptian Art From the National Museum of
Antiquities in Leiden, the Netherlands,'' opening Nov. 14 at the
Fernbank Museum of Natural History. And that's the sort of
information that makes Fernbank's antiquities display different
from the typical object-oriented art exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibition assumes people know pretty much about Egypt,''
says Fernbank archaeologist Max Miller. ``What we're trying to do
is to use the objects as a core to inform the visitor about
everything from geography and the ebb and flow of historical phases
to archaeology. Context is what it boils down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernbank has an exemplary ``core'' to work with. The Leiden
collection is one of the finest in the world. Most of it was
acquired during the first post-Napoleon wave of enthusiasm in the
early 19th century when entrepreneurs could export artifacts from
Egypt with impunity. According to Peter Lacovara, the Carlos
Museum's curator of ancient art, the holdings of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are
the only U.S. museums that could approach Leiden's in breadth or
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Dutch museum is renovating, it has sent 300 objects
on the road. Fernbank is the only American venue to host the
display of sculptures, reliefs, books, jewelry and domestic objects
as well as the scene-stealing mummies and sarcophagi. They are
organized thematically in sections about the gods, the pharaohs,
daily life and the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   In each section Fernbank has added information to enrich the
experience. Visitors can learn about the measurement of time in
ancient culture, the symbolism of Egyptian architecture and the ins
and outs of archaeology _ subjects that Miller calls ``the meat and
potatoes of a natural history museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Together with the array of artifacts and the accompanying Imax
movie, ``Mysteries of Ancient Egypt,'' Fernbank appears to have
prepared an Egyptian feast.

 &HT;    Levi relishes raising the sinister tension of Bartok's creation
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov.7.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Bluebeard's Castle'' is ``a bloody mess,'' says
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra music director Yoel Levi.
</P>
<P>
   He's being literal. The sole opera by Hungarian composer Bela
Bartok is filled with blood.
</P>
<P>
   It's also ``a masterpiece,'' says Levi, who will conduct a
complete performance of the work with the ASO Thursday through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The blood will be strictly symbolic. As Judith, the newest wife
of Duke Bluebeard, opens the seven forbidden doors of his castle,
red light will spill out of each. ``We will do it with the means we
have,'' says Levi of the limited technical wizardry at Symphony
Hall. ``With good imagination, you can create great things.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the name of Bartok fills some music patrons with fear and
trepidation, ``Bluebeard'' is rich stuff _ romantic enough to have
attracted the likes of Jessye Norman. Here the role of Judith will
be sung by internationally known mezzo Florence Quivar.
</P>
<P>
   The story is common to several European cultures. By some
accounts, the original Bluebeard was Gilles de Retz, a French
nobleman who fought alongside Joan of Arc at the Siege of Orleans.
He also, apparently, went through several wives under suspicious
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a version of the Dracula story,'' says Levi. ``And
since I was born in Transylvania. ...''
</P>
<P>
   There are several opera versions of Bluebeard's tale, including
``Ariane et Barbe-bleue'' by Paul Dukas, better known for the music
to ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Dukas and Bartok both took their
story from a version by the Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck.
</P>
<P>
   Maeterlinck was the standard-bearer for a short-lived but
influential literary movement called symbolism, based partly on the
relationship between symbols and the psyche in Freudian analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In Maeterlinck's ``Bluebeard,'' the seven doors do not hide the
bodies of the previous wives but are entryways into Bluebeard's
heart and mind. One door opens onto an armory, the weapons stained
with blood: his male identity. Another is a garden whose flowers
have been watered with blood: his artistic soul, which pours its
own blood into the creation of beautiful things. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The last door opens to reveal his former wives, alive but
forever imprisoned. Judith, having breached their secret, joins
them, and Bluebeard is left alone and comfortless because of his
inability to share himself. It's a tragic ending for both
protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the doors where a man has all his secrets,'' Levi
says, ``and his wife really wants to possess all the inner
resources of his soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartok, just 30 at the time of the opera's composition, may have
seen himself as Bluebeard. An intensely private person, he was so
guarded about his personal life that when the dean of Hungarian
composers, Erno von Dohnanyi, wrote him a congratulatory note about
his marriage, Bartok became angry and threw it away, according to
his biographer, Halsey Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the musical language is very Bartok,'' says Levi.
``For every door, he found a way to express the most fundamental
feelings. And the tension that grows from door to door, it is
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera has had a checkered performance history, largely
because of national politics. Completed in 1911, it was rejected in
a competition to choose a Hungarian national opera. The irony of
this is that Bartok, a collector of indigenous Hungarian music,
wrote ``Bluebeard'' to reflect the speech patterns of Hungarian,
which has no upbeats. (All words are accented on the first
syllable.) ``Bluebeard'' is much more Hungarian than the ersatz
Gypsy operas favored at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1918, the opera finally saw production in Budapest, to great
success, but Hungary's reactionary postwar government demanded that
the name of the librettist, the left-wing writer Bela Balazs, be
removed. Bartok refused, and the opera was withdrawn, not to appear
again until 1937. Then World War II closed most opera houses. But
between 1948 and 1973, ``Bluebeard's Castle'' had more than 500
performances and was recorded several times. It was regarded as a
profound representation of 20th-century man.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO performances will be sung in English. ``Even though it
is in my mother tongue,'' says Levi, who was born in a part of
Transylvania that has belonged at different times to Romania and
Hungary, ``people need to pay attention to what is said and what is
sung. When they are involved, it will be like watching a movie _ an
R-rated movie, PG-13 is not acceptable in this case! _ and the
music will serve all the dramatic developments onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, besides, finding singers to do it in Hungarian is very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Quivar has sung the work before and has brought together several
translations for her text. Metropolitan Opera bass John Cheek
(Bluebeard) also has sung the work _ in Hungarian _ at its only
previous Atlanta performance, under Louis Lane in 1981, according
to Nick Jones, program annotator for the ASO. The minstrel's
prologue will be spoken by Lois Reitzes, program director of
WABE-FM (90.1).

 &HT;    Whole Life Expo owner Justin Hilton went from spiritual rags to
riches.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's fourth annual Whole Life Exposition &AMP;
Conference will feature everything from power crystals and
telepathic healing to speakers who say they've talked with angels.
</P>
<P>
   The expo's most fascinating subject, however, may be the
dramatic life its new organizer has led.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hilton, its 34-year-old owner, is grateful to be alive.
His life demonstrates _ better than a self-help book or a clever
lecture _ that the alternative spirituality to be explored at next
week's New Age fair isn't just yuppie navel-gazing. It can save
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's story of redemption is proof.
</P>
<P>
   He ran away from home at 14 and lived on the streets of Austin,
Texas, eating stale doughnuts from trash bins and sleeping in
laundromats. He became a drug addict. His life changed when he
experienced a spiritual awakening that started when he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was a boy, I thought that he would either end up in
jail or be a millionaire by the time he was 30,'' said Carol
Hilton, 54, his mother. ``I hoped it would be the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hope came true.
</P>
<P>
   Today Justin Hilton remains very much alive and is a millionaire
real estate developer. He's built a business empire in Austin worth
$20 million by constructing what he describes as environmentally
friendly housing, including one apartment complex that has a
massage clinic and stargazing area.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is rich, Hilton's street memories remain vivid. He
still carries paper bags full of tofu sandwiches around with him.
It's a habit he developed when he was homeless and food was scarce.
And he talks easily about the ``spiritual masters'' and ordinary
folks who saw potential in him when he was a strung-out teenager
with a green mohawk haircut.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the expo to spark the same hope in others that was
ignited in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not this ethereal event,'' he said. ``We want to give
people a very practical, grounded way to have a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   The expo, organized by a California-based company that holds
personal growth conferences in cities around the country each year,
returns to Atlanta on Friday. Organizers expect at least 20,000
people to take part in the three-day event at the Atlanta Apparel
Mart downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The mart's floors will be filled with at least 250 colorful
exhibits, including a meditation room, a bookstore and a natural
food section. Speakers will include authors such as Gary Zukav,
Wayne Dyer and Marianne Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton is excited, however, by a new dimension he is adding to
the New Age fair this year _ social activism. The expo will hold
workshops on issues such as environmental activism, teen violence,
racism and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The expo's focus on social issues reflects one of Hilton's core
beliefs _ spirituality without service is shallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not putting your spiritual practice into service,
what good is it?'' Hilton said. ``If you're not touching people, if
you're not helping people or being with people in some way, you get
lost in your own practice. It doesn't have depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton purchased the expo last fall. The original owner, who
launched it in San Francisco in 1983, said the New Age fair had
become too big for him. It was also losing money. Hilton said the
expo is operating at about a $500,000 deficit even though it
grosses about $6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton took little time to place his mark on the expo. In recent
months, he's added 10 staff members and plans to add 12 more shows
next year. He is also considering a proposal to create several expo
retail stores and a Web site to sell products.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton may have the business drive of a Fortune 500 executive,
but he has the temperament of a mystic. His typical office attire
is baggy jeans and loose-fitting casual shirts. He lights candles
in his office while meditating. And he drives a green Dodge Caravan
minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Like a modern-day Thoreau, Hilton is trying to simplify his
life. He's even thinking of moving out of his three-bedroom house
near San Francisco into a ``yurt,'' a domed tent used by nomadic
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hilton's California mellow exterior masks a ferocious will
and an entrepreneurial flair. His business career began when he
used a $5,000 student loan to buy, renovate and sell a home in the
1980s. He made money from that home and found a niche. He purchased
real estate in Austin when the market became depressed in the late
1980s. When the market took off, he reaped the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the right place at the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton was a born businessman, but he also cared for others,
said his mom, Carol. As a kid growing up in Austin, he had soda pop
stands, a paper route and a newspaper recycling business. But he
would care for stray animals and bring home kids who had no place
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton said being an only child forced him to reach out to
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an only child, you're always trying to create some kind of
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had a more difficult time connecting with his father. Carol
Hilton said her son had a stubborn, independent streak, while his
father, Robert, an IBM salesman, valued conformity. Hilton's
parents separated when he was 6 months old, but Hilton spent time
with both parents.
</P>
<P>
   His life spun out of control in the summer of 1979. Hilton, 14
at the time, argued constantly with his father. He returned home to
his mother that fall. His father, 33, died of a heart attack a
short time later. Angry and inconsolable, Hilton fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left each other angry that summer,'' Carol Hilton said.
``There was never any resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The first night on the streets was the worst, Hilton recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just cry,'' he said. ``I thought, `I can't go back and
I can't go forward.' I felt completely on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton learned to survive. He ate food from trash bins, K
rations purchased from Army surplus stores, and cold pizzas thrown
away by pizza shops.
</P>
<P>
   He also started taking drugs _ heroin, cocaine, speed _ and
drinking. ``I was trying to connect with some form of
spirituality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hilton delved deeper into the world of drugs, people
refused to give up on him. Ron and Peggy Weiss, the owners of a
restaurant in Austin, hired him as a dishwasher. Peggy Weiss fed
him chocolate chip cookies and let him sleep on their couch at
night. Hilton looked like a walking cadaver _ he was 6 feet and
about 100 pounds with long stringy hair _ but she took a liking to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had that special smile that set him apart,'' Peggy
Weiss said. ``You knew there was a really good person in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's mother reached out to him as well. He refused to come
back home so she helped him get an apartment. Once, when she took
him to a therapist, the counselor warned Hilton that 15-year-olds
can't live independently. Hilton's mother winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, lady!'' Carol Hilton said. ``We don't ever draw lines with
this child because he's obligated to cross them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton continued on a reckless path. It took being stricken with
hepatitis and listening to some of his street friends before he
became willing to re-evaluate his life. He was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all these junkies come in and say, `I've had it
(hepatitis) three times and I'm all right,''' Hilton said. ``I
always thought I was going to die at 19. But when I looked at them,
I thought, `Maybe I'm going to get old and bitter.' That was a
shocking thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton knew he had to change or die. He entered a 12-step
recovery program. He became a vegetarian. In 1983, when he was 18
years old, he moved to San Francisco on a spiritual quest. He
attended and a master's degree from the California Institute of
Integral Studies in San Francisco, and became a counselor for
runaways and addicts at a treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Hilton married his college sweetheart, Jill. Two years
later, he moved back to Austin to take advantage of the boom in the
real estate market. His business succeeded. But his marriage
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton, who has no children, became convinced it was time to let
his business go, move to India and explore his spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Ford changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a personal growth speaker, author and frequent workshop
leader at the Whole Life Expo, met Hilton at an expo event in
Austin last year.
</P>
<P>
   She told him he didn't need to go to India. She told him he was
running away from his potential to do something powerful for
society. ``I told him to cut his hair,'' Ford said. ``He had long
hair in his face. You could tell he was hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   While talking to Ford, Hilton said, he suddenly got an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in a flash,'' he said. ``I had to buy the expo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's friends say his rags-to-spiritual-riches story has made
him even more determined to help others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a huge heart,'' Ford said. ``He's someone who wants
to give without getting anything back, who feels the pains of
others. He's a beautiful example of an authentic human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's mother is also proud of him, but admits she still
doesn't understand her son's restless spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he really understands himself,'' she said,
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton does understand this much. He said his life _ and the
expo's message _ is the same: ``Anything is possible.''

 &HT;    Tom Cox lovingly cultivates a multicultural arboretum
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Cox hops down from his John Deere tractor in the
lush green yard of his metro Atlanta home, muddy moccasins untied.
In his knit shirt, he looks the typical suburban golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Until he starts talking about his Heptacodium miconioides, the
seven-son tree of Korea. He strokes its smooth bark, pointing out
the subtle streaks of orange in the trunk. He cups his hands to
demonstrate the size of its starry white bloom. He feels its
leaves. He says the tree, a Korean symbol of peace, is one of the
tallest of its kind in North America, and....
</P>
<P>
   Before he finishes the sentence, Cox is motioning toward his
Chinese parasol tree with leaves that make it look like a fancy
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Wait till you see this....
</P>
<P>
   Cox, 54, is a boy on a great adventure. It's as if he'd played
in every tree's branches, smelled and felt every leaf. He uses
careful, precise words when he talks about the textures of leaves:
``crisp,'' ``refined,'' ``leathery'' or ``lacy.'' It's the same
with the subtleties of different bark. One is ``striated,'' another
like ``patchwork.'' Still another is ``smooth like silk.'' He
describes in meticulous detail how certain trees will look in 10 or
15 years. He envisions the blossoms, leaf color or berries they'll
display at different ages and seasons. When he leans down to
examine a young tree, it's as if he were whispering encouragement
to a child.
</P>
<P>
   But like a child himself, he jumps from one tree to another. He
exhibits wonder and awe over each.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look _ now isn't this refined?
</P>
<P>
   It's a paperbark maple with curls of thin bark that fall around
its trunk and limbs like ringlets of sun-splotched auburn hair.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Ten years ago, Cox made his dream of a lifetime come true. He'd
been planting things since he was a small boy in rural Alabama,
helping his mother nourish small plants under the house until they
were ready to set outside. Later he fussed with suburban gardening,
winning neighborhood awards for the best yard. He began to read
about trees, look for unusual ones, visit aboretums. The more he
learned, the more determined he became to start his own collection.
</P>
<P>
   He purchased 14 acres, built a house, planted trees on half the
property and started his private Cox Arboretum, which he shares
with garden clubs and groups like Trees Atlanta, which held one of
its fall tree walks there recently.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has 600 trees, varieties representing 38 countries, and
he tends them all himself. Small signs identify each by genus and
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my legacy,'' he says. ``Some people leave books _ I leave
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's passion borders on obsession. Despite the demands of his
job as a senior contract manager at BellSouth and the 45-mile
commute to work every day, he's never too weary for his trees.
</P>
<P>
   Cox touches leaves, strokes bark, pauses and takes a step back,
as if discovering something new to savor in each familiar tree.
</P>
<P>
   Come over here so I can show you this snakebark....
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 a.m. he leaves for his job at BellSouth's downtown
Atlanta office. When he takes MARTA, he reads about trees on his
commute. When he arrives home a little after 6 p.m., he waters and
tends his trees again.
</P>
<P>
   The drought forced Cox to rise at 4 a.m. and drag hoses around
to water his trees. It also made him own up for the first time to
his wife, Evelyn, that his project was, as he puts it, ``getting
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   She does some weeding and mulching, but he doesn't ask her to
water. Or mow. He cuts the grass, careful to avoid nicking a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cox, a commercial real estate consultant, says she
respects her husband's accomplishments and admires his passion.
``He's intense about everything he does,'' she says. She can't
remember in their 16 years of marriage when he wasn't excited about
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first started, he'd buy bare root plants and call me
outside every Saturday to look at a new bundle of sticks _ and at
tree bark,'' she says with a laugh. ``He's really into bark, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the arboretum is maturing, she feels lucky to enjoy
such beautiful surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   She travels with her husband to a lot of weekend plant shows.
They drive in a 10-year-old Mazda station wagon with 258,000 miles
on it. She calls it the ``dirtmobile.'' He calls it the
``plantmobile.'' She laughs about sitting in a kind of jungle on
the way home, wedged in between 60 or 70 plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to fend off an occasional spider or two,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, I just enjoy seeing him enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn admires the fact that her husband is self-taught.
</P>
<P>
   He says anybody who wants to start an arboretum would do well to
start with some basic reading at the Atlanta Botanical Garden's
library.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's a good idea to get on mailing lists for workshops and
shows and go to as many as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Cox reads voraciously about trees. He's familiar with the field
notes of some of the world's most famous arborists, especially E.H.
Wilson, a pioneering botanist who secured many rare plants for the
Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls the daring adventures of Harvard scientists who
discovered the handkerchief tree at the turn of the century. Forced
to use crude modes of transportation, Wilson traveled thousands of
miles into mainland China to find the rare tree with the bluish,
heart-shaped leaves and bring seeds back to the United States.
Cox's three handkerchief trees are about 10 feet tall now, but
they'll grow as large as 35. In 10 years, they should bloom for the
first time, their double flowers resembling dogwood blossoms,
hanging from the leaves and fluttering in the wind. Cox says he
hopes he'll be around to see them burst into their stunning
6-inch-wide blossoms of nature's whitest white.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Cox points to University of Georgia professor Michael Dirr,
well-known for his books on trees, as the person who's helped him
most.
</P>
<P>
   Dirr admires Cox for his persistence. He says Cox shows up every
place people are talking about or comparing trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's phenomenal _ he's chasing the latest, greatest, craziest,
most unusual trees in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, after enjoying a rare chance to spend time with
the curator of the Asian collection at the National Arboretum in
Washington, Cox was offered a mini-arboretum _ if only he could get
the 60 rare plants back to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say no.''
</P>
<P>
   He put the plants in large cardboard boxes and then had to plead
with Delta Air Lines to get them on the plane. They were the very
last items squeezed on as cargo. Back in Atlanta, the boxes
wouldn't all fit in his car. So, he unpacked all 60 plants and
crammed them into every possible nook of the trunk, floor and
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Cox attends conferences where professional arborists and
academics make presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the same class with them,'' he says. ``But I think
they respect what I'm trying to do and the fact that I'm doing it
on my own dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox says he's probably spent $15,000 on his trees, more like
$30,000 in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Now, this is a show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   He rushes ahead to an area where he's planted 22 varieties of
Asian maples. Though his arboretum contains maples other than those
from Asia, Cox loves seeing the Asian varieties standing together.
He sees their subtle differences as a rare piece of outdoor art.
</P>
<P>
   You can get the full picture over here....
</P>
<P>
   In what could be a United Nations Grove, just across the road
from the maples, Cox's trees stand far apart from each other. That
way, he can admire each representative from trunk to tip.
</P>
<P>
   He feels like a proud father, he says, as he walks at a slower
pace through the grove. He stops to admire his Chinese pagoda tree,
one of three sacred trees planted at the tombs of high Chinese
officials and scholars. Its leaf clusters spread like miniature
painted fans, and, in the fall, the tips are dipped in red.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Cox points to the Chinese turnip green, the toon tree,
whose leaves the Chinese cook as a vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   And I want to show you just one more....
</P>
<P>
   It's a tung oil tree from Japan, which Henry Ford once planted
in groves in Florida. In the past, its seed pods were the primary
source for fine furniture oil. It's still used for that purpose
today, and as an additive for some paints. Cox planted it eight
years ago and it bloomed for the first time this spring.
</P>
<P>
   He stops to gloat over it. ``That really made my heart go
pitter-patter.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees have sex appeal, too,'' he says with a chuckle, pointing
out the chaste tree, which turns vivid purple in summer's hottest
months.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox keeps on returning to his special fondness for
evergreens. His come from unlikely places. He stops beside a
Serbian spruce with delicate drooping needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look how peaceful and graceful it looks, and from that
war-torn country.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away is a small pine from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Did I show you my painting?
</P>
<P>
   It's a conifer (evergreen) garden near his house, strategically
placed for viewing from the kitchen window. It provides a multitude
of contrasting green hues, differing textures, cones and
``frostings'' year-round. Nearby is his `Fat Albert' blue spruce, a
favorite from the American West.
</P>
<P>
   Cox thinks gardeners in the Southeast could grow a larger
variety of trees. Unusual trees aren't hard to grow, he says, just
hard to find, ``because nobody asks for them.'' Take his Japanese
apricot, which blooms bright orange in February. ``Everybody would
have one, if they only knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox is also mad about his array of hornbeams _ ``sturdy,
straight-forward trees.'' He points out his American, weeping,
looseleaf, Japanese, Korean and Oriental hornbeam trees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I want to show you just one more....
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't use any chemicals in his arboretum, just fertilizer
and a common garden spray to control Japanese beetles in summer.
</P>
<P>
   He's had his share of failures, too. The saddest was a rare
evergreen from Taiwan. He paid a huge sum for it, around $600, at a
plant show in Houston several years ago. He fertilized it with
10-10-10. ``It was too dry and I burned its roots,'' he says. He's
been on the lookout for another ever since. Two weeks ago, he found
three and bought them all.
</P>
<P>
   Though he orders from nurseries from Oregon to the East Coast,
Cox often spots unusual trees in local hardware stores. One of his
favorite evergreen trees is a Japanese black cedar he bought at an
Ace Hardware in south Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine 10 years from now, or 50 _ that's the neatest part....
</P>
<P>
   Cox is keeping ``session records,'' modeled after those
maintained by well-known arboretums. He records where each plant is
from and when and where he acquired it. His vision is that a
university or private foundation might want to manage his arboretum
some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be too much to hope for,'' he says cautiously. Then
he shares a story about Walt Disney. At the opening of Disney World
years ago, an executive commented that it was too bad Walt couldn't
see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he did see it,'' Cox says, ``or it wouldn't be there.''

   Tom Cox's planting tips
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to zone information that tells where in a
particular state or region a plant will grow best. Beware of
afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Understand the needs of a plant _ sun, shade, dry, moist.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose the site carefully. How large will the plant or tree
grow? Avoid proximity to power lines and sewer and gas pipes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Follow simple planting preparation rules: Dig a hole no deeper
than required but be sure it's three times as wide as the plant.
Look for good drainage but leave a ``saucer'' around the roots so
water will soak in.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Amend the soil sparingly. Except for plants like azalea and
rhododendron, no need in most cases to add topsoil or other
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mulch is superimportant. If it's too fresh, it should sit
awhile to decompose sufficiently so it won't rob the soil of
nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If a plant has tightly wound roots when it's taken out of a
pot, place it in a large pail of water for a few hours. Try adding
a few willow leaves _ which contain elements that guard against
transplant shock _ to the water.

EURYTHMICS RAISE ROOF AND SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Soulfulness and staying power were rare
commodities among '80s British techno-pop bands. That's perhaps one
reason you won't find many of them playing today's shiny new
basketball palaces.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly where you could find Eurythmics on Thursday
night, preaching the gospel of hip political causes without
forgetting how to move an audience to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   It's been roughly a dozen years since androgynous diva Annie
Lennox and technical whiz Dave Stewart had a Top 20 hit in this
country. You wouldn't know they'd been away from the limelight so
long, though, from the fervent, somewhat brisk set they performed
Thursday at the Staples Center, in a benefit concert for Greenpeace
and Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many of their synthetic British peers, the Eurythmics
really know how to rock. If anything, the guitar-driven, hard-edged
arrangements of Thursday's show were somewhat lacking in the varied
ambient textures that made the band's music, at its best, so
hypnotically compelling and so popular in dance clubs.
</P>
<P>
   If that concession was partly prompted by the arena-rock
acoustics of the new venue, at least there was a flipside. Pumped
up to roof-raising levels, the sleek, energetic Lennox seemed more
than ever like a fiery pop evangelist, enjoining the crowd to keep
faith with Eurythmics' upbeat, vaguely spiritual musings and
Stewart's thundering guitar licks.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in identical Army camouflage outfits and silver parkas,
which they later discarded, Lennox and Stewart gave the appearance
of ultra-hip crusaders waging a kind of pop holy war on behalf of
progressive political causes. Stewart made the point early with a
wailing, bluesy solo introduction to ``Missionary Man,'' which
Lennox, sporting a short red coif, delivered with ferocious
urgency. Three black female singers lent strong support to her
powerful, gospel-tinged intonations, particularly on the rousing
``Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennox followed with sinuous, passionate versions of the band's
major hits, taking a deliberative and nuanced approach to songs
like ``Walking on Broken Glass,'' ``Who's That Girl?'' and a
stripped-down acoustic version of ``Here Comes the Rain Again.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the fire and brimstone, however, Eurythmics' new
material was generally weak and the show was disappointingly short,
barely more than an hour and a half after the set crew spent what
seemed like an inordinate amount of time getting the mist machines
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Opening-act Meredith Brooks probably would've gladly used that
time to whip up her own faithful adherents. After scoring a debut
pop hit with ``Bitch,'' her amusingly forthright declaration of
selfhood to a lover, Brooks is busily promoting her new CD
``Deconstruction.'' Like Stewart, she's a pop artist with a
penchant for blues guitar, as she demonstrated with a short,
spirited set.
</P>
<P>
   The high point was her fist-pumping hip-hop update of Melanie's
1970 social protest hymn, ``Lay Down (Candles in the Rain).'' On
``Deconstruction,'' Brooks gets help with this song from Queen
Latifah, but Thursday she brought out the Crenshaw High School
Elite Choir, whose emotive singing was every bit as powerful as
their joyous appearance.!dlim! &QL;

PATIENTS' RIGHTS BILL DEAD FOR NOW AS CONGRESS NEARS ADJOURNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patients' rights legislation favored by an
overwhelming majority of Americans has no change of becoming law
this year, lawmakers said Friday as Congress moved closer to
adjourning until January.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved sweeping legislation last month designed to
give patients more rights in dealing with their health insurance
companies, including the right to sue them for denying coverage.
The bill, by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Charles Norwood,
R-Ga., was supported by most Democrats and one third of House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have consistently shown that 80 percent of Americans put
health care near the top of their list of concerns and that 80
percent favor legislation that includes the right to sue their
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   But only this week did House Republican leaders appoint
lawmakers to a panel that will work out the vast differences
between the House bill and a much narrower Senate measure approved
in July.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday some lawmakers who favor the House measure accused
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., of purposely delaying naming panel
members to ensure that time would run out on the legislation.
Congress is currently scheduled to adjourn next week.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing frustrated, Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, who also helped
craft the House measure, said, ``The American people are demanding
action on this issue.'' He asked rhetorically, ``When is my
leadership going to get it?''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and many conservative Republicans have said they oppose
allowing people to sue their health plans, arguing that would drive
up the price of health insurance, cause employers to drop insurance
coverage and swell the ranks of the 44 million Americans already
without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare move, Hastert further upset several lawmakers in both
parties by loading the House GOP membership of the House-Senate
conference committee with opponents of the bill. Twelve of the 13
House Republicans on the panel voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   He also kept Norwood and Ganske off the panel. Usually,
conference committees include authors of the legislation at issue
and a majority of lawmakers who favor it. The 20 Senate members of
the conference panel are expected to oppose the House plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker has given himself a black eye by not naming me and
Charlie to the conference committee,'' Ganske said.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell _ one of seven House Democrats on the conference
committee _ said that in the 44 years he has served in the House he
has never seen a speaker keep the main sponsors of a bill off a
conference panel.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it's highly unlikely the panel will meet before
Congress leaves town next week. But he urged Hastert to consider
allowing panel members to meet during the holiday recess so that
Congress could approve a compromise bill when it returns in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the conference committee does meet, negotiations on a
compromise bill are expected to take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell conceded that the panel will have a difficult, if not
impossible, task crafting a compromise that can garner a majority
of votes in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate versions are strikingly different. The
House bill applies to all 161 million Americans with health
insurance and gives them the right to sue while the Senate version
applies only to the 48 million Americans whose insurance plans are
governed by federal _ rather than state _ law, and it bars patients
from suing their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills require the plans to provide for emergency care,
allow greater access to specialists and establish an appeals
process for patients to challenge decisions made by the plans when,
for example, they refuse to pay for a specific medical treatment or
test. Women would also be allowed to see a gynecologist without
first getting permission from a primary-care physician.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment there are not enough votes in the Senate to
support a bill that includes the right to sue health plans, and it
is unlikely that a majority of the House would go along with the
narrower Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., a supporter of the House bill, said the
patients' rights issue is currently on ``life-support.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ganske was more optimistic about the bill's chances next
year. ``Sometimes strange things happen when you get closer to an
election,'' he said.

TELEVISION REALLY WANTS YOUR EYEBALLS
</HEADLINE>

(For use Sunday, Nov. 7 or thereafter) 
By MARLA MATZER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two earthquake specials, two million-dollar-plus
game shows, a renewed interest in filmic portrayals of Jesus: It
must be TV sweeps time. Those who normally find little to watch on
TV may suddenly be confronted with too many choices to deal with _
Betty White on ``Ally McBeal,'' or Mr. T on ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie''? _
and may want to stock up on videotape. Even public TV is in on the
game: A new Ken Burns documentary is being trotted out this week.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the usual three-ring circus of viewing choices, though,
the larger question looms: Why does all high-profile programming
hit TV during the same 12 weeks out of the year ... and is this the
way it will remain, now that technology and cable are changing the
TV landscape?
</P>
<P>
   For at least the next couple of years, the tradition of sweeps
periods in February, May and November appears firmly entrenched.
It's a function of research-driven advertising spending: Viewership
in smaller markets isn't measured most of the year. Their ad rates
are set based on these dozen weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There are grumblings, though, that this ritualized
cannibalization by the networks doesn't make sense. But when and
how the sweeps setup may change over the next five to 10 years
depends on a number of factors: Will a rival to Nielsen, the rating
service, take off? (Past attempts at this have failed.) If so,
would advertisers accept it and adjust their own methods of
planning? Will continued pressure from cable TV hasten change, and
will the introduction of digital video recorders (such as Tivo and
Replay) have a significant impact on viewing habits?
</P>
<P>
   Sweeps periods got their name in the mid-1950s, when Nielsen
would send out TV-viewing ``diaries'' to households beginning on
the East Coast, then ``sweeping'' across the country. These diaries
today remain the only system for measuring demographics in smaller
TV markets, while larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles
are now electronically tallied. Simply counting an estimated number
of viewing homes isn't enough: Marketers buy time based on not just
how many people are watching, but who those viewers are. Especially
desirable across the board are young adults who can afford to buy
things like Lexus cars and Banana Republic clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research and the advertising community don't show
any signs of quickly overhauling the way they do business.
Television is driven by tens of billions of dollars in ad money
each year. Companies spending that kind of money demand research to
tell them where to invest it: enter the Nielsen monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives often grouse about having to put all their
top-drawer programming into sweeps periods at the expense of the
other 40 weeks of the year. ``As a network guy, it is frustrating,
because you have to fight this battle three times a year,'' says
Preston Beckman, executive vice president of program planning and
scheduling for NBC. ``But the end result is profit for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a cost in a network clustering its best
programming. ``Imagine a football game where the winner was
determined by who had the most points in the third quarter,'' says
David Poltrack, executive vice president of research and planning
for CBS Television. Poltrack and others attribute some of the
networks' viewership ``erosion'' to the fact that cable has been
able to capitalize on the lack of year-round fresh programming on
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Already, cable has tremendously altered where and when people
watch TV. Out of necessity, cable programmers learned to
``counter-program'' the broadcast networks, offering viewers more
racy and offbeat fare and fresh programming during the summer, when
broadcasters are showing reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Cable programmers, particularly those that don't own stations,
are generally more than happy to sit out sweeps. The sweeps system
is ``bad for television but good for Showtime,'' crowed Mark
Zakarin, executive vice president of original programming at
Showtime Networks. ``While the networks are silent in the summer,
we put on our new series. We relish that,'' Zakarin says.
</P>
<P>
   He continues, ``There is no business purpose for sweeps for us,
and there's less and less at the broadcast networks.'' Asked why
sweeps continue to exist, Zakarin, who spent 12 years at ABC (until
January 1996), replied: ``No one's had the guts to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zakarin said that while he was at ABC, he saw talk _ but no
action _ on the topic of the decreased importance of the sweeps
period. ``But it didn't really cause people to alter their
programming strategy; the business stays very competitive,''
Zakarin said. He added that Showtime basically reacts to sweeps by
putting on more ``high concept, easily promotable'' original movies
rather than more rarefied fare. For example, Showtime will debut
``Execution of Justice,'' a docudrama about the man who shot San
Francisco politician Harvey Milk, on Nov. 28, while HBO has ``RKO
281,'' the story of the making of ``Citizen Kane,'' on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that under the current system, it's not just local
affiliates that are being kept happy by events-packed sweeps. The
networks make a lot of money on the stations they themselves own
because the affiliates can charge more for their local ads and
bolster local programming during sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stations for every network are generally the most
profitable component of their business,'' admits Beckman, ``so one
of the most important things we can do is to make sure the stations
we own are strong and competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckman is skeptical that any major changes in sweeps will occur
in the near future. ``Unfortunately, no _ sweeps aren't yet on the
way out,'' says Beckman. He says the only thing he could imagine
changing that scenario is a viable competitor to Nielsen entering
the field with a way to measure nationwide demographics
electronically all year long. ``Then suddenly, Nielsen would find a
way to do it yesterday,'' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Poltrack is a bit more optimistic. ``Soon, we'll have the top 50
markets measured electronically (by Nielsen),'' he says. ``Once
that's done, it'll be incumbent on the advertisers, agencies and
media planners (to adjust their methods). ... We'll develop models
to take their data and project it (to provide year-round data).
Right now, the tail is wagging the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the networks seem to have done to increase their
competitiveness this year is to scuttle programs early on that were
underperforming. ``The networks don't agonize as much this year
about pulling their weak shows prior to sweeps. I think it was
like, `Who are we kidding?''' Beckman says. A number of shows on
several networks have already been yanked, either for good or to be
put on the dreaded ``hiatus'' (Translation: We're not quite ready
to cancel you, but we're close). ABC's ``Wasteland'' is one such
show.
</P>
<P>
   NBC pulled ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' after only two episodes.
Fox, struggling in the ratings and no doubt eager for the
``X-Files'' season to start, has put two ``edgy'' comedies on
hiatus _ ``Action'' and the animated ``Family Guy'' _ while giving
the hook to ``Harsh Realm'' and ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One.'' More
heads are sure to roll after sweeps are over.
</P>
<P>
   As Zakarin says, ``You take all of your big, big guns ... and go
up against the big guns of the other networks three times a year.
It's not the most effective way to program, but it's a competitive
business.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Large swings in daily temperatures will continue to jar parts of
the western Plains as a dry and potentially warm air mass is
activated by abundant sunshine. At night, the day's heat will
escape rapidly to space, paving the way for predawn temperatures
Sunday morning in the 30s from western South Dakota to the northern
panhandle of Texas. Readings in the 20s are possible again Sunday
morning in parts of western Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   A cool-down is slated for the Northeast as a cold front moves
rapidly from west to east across the region. The brunt of the
cool-down will occur Sunday as brisk winds from the northwest
import modified Canadian air. On Saturday, the main effects
following the passage of the cool front will be an increase in
winds from the west-northwest, which will average 15-30 mph along
the Northeast seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will dampen much of the Pacific Northwest from western
Oregon to western Washington as Pacific moisture streams inland
ahead of an approaching cold front from the Pacific. The brunt of
the rain will likely occur in northwest Washington on west-facing
slopes of the Olympics, where invading Pacific winds are forced to
rise over the sloping terrain. Rainfalls over an inch are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, rain will take aim on parts of the southern California
coast as the southward-expanding front and a trailing jet stream
disturbance pivot toward land.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, warming days and a lessening chill at night will be
the tenor of the weather pattern across much of the Southeast
states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Day of Two Seasons
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the western Great Plains basked in summer Thursday
afternoon, but awoke to a wintry chill Friday morning. Indeed,
across parts of Nebraska, the high temperature reached the low 80s
on Thursday before lows fell into the middle 20s early Friday
morning. Yet nary a cold front was to be found. During the day, a
potentially warm air mass reached its potential as the sun shone
brightly across the region. Then, at night, the ground's heat
rapidly escaped through the dry, tranquil air mass, paving the way
for temperatures to plummet as much as 60 degrees after dusk.

`Annie' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the passing of days, or decades: Few will
probably even blink, let alone cry blasphemy, that the latest
incarnation of ``Annie'' features an adorable moppet with red hair
utterly bereft of curls for most of Sunday's ABC telefilm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Orphan Annie,'' the comic strip serving as source
material for Sunday's extravaganza, has long sat unmolested in the
remainder bin of pop culture. Its iconography _ Annie and pet dog
Sandy's creepily pupil-free eyes, Sandy's ubiquitous cry of ``Arf''
and Annie's of ``Leapin' Lizards,'' Daddy Warbucks' fantasy
opulence _ is virtually forgotten or meaningless for today's
audiences. So is reviving ``Annie'' an exercise in nostalgia for
the innocence of the Depression era _ or for '70s Broadway
musicals?
</P>
<P>
   There's not a lot of point in remaking ``Annie'' in 1999, except
for the fact that the bloated 1982 movie didn't do the musical
justice _ and the simple verity that the musical boasts what
remains an impossibly infectious score. Sunday's version from ``The
Wonderful World of Disney'' gets right everything that the earlier
cinematic version got wrong _ it keeps the spectacle manageable and
not overwhelming and, above all, focuses on the songs _ ``It's a
Hard-Knock Life,'' ``I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here'' and, of
course, the show-stopper ``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old newcomer Alicia Morton plays the mischievous
orphan, stranded in a life of servitude in a run-down orphanage run
(down, of course) by the harridan Miss Hannigan (Kathy Bates).
Depression-era billionaire Daddy Warbucks (Victor Garber), as a
public-relations stunt, attempts to adopt Annie, but she still
pines for her real parents, so Warbucks announces a nationwide
search for them. Hannigan's ne'er-do-well brother Rooster (Alan
Cumming) and his dizzy squeeze Lily (Kristin Chenoweth) plot to
pose as said parents to grab Warbucks' generous financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   The one misstep in all this comes when the filmmakers attempt to
give Bates, their biggest star, more to do and have her attempt the
parent-trap ruse with Rooster instead. Logically, it makes little
sense _ wouldn't a savvy kid like Annie suss out her tormentor of
the past decade in a New York minute? _ while logistically it
deprives colorful Tony-winner Chenoweth of a prime opportunity to
chew scenery.
</P>
<P>
   My young stepdaughters immediately declared this version
superior to the 1982 production starring Albert Finney (who reminds
them too much of Austin Powers' archenemy Dr. Evil _ they preferred
Garber's smoother, less gruff performance). They noted that
multiple Tony winner Audra McDonald, as Warbucks' private
secretary, has far superior pipes than Ann Reinking, who played the
role in the film, and preferred Morton's cute-but-not-(BEGIN
ITAL)too(END ITAL)-cute turn as Annie to her predecessor Aileen
Quinn's. They preferred director/choreographer Rob Marshall's
streamlined work to John Huston's heavy lifting in the earlier
film. They're actually pretty savvy little critics. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP;
Susan B. Anthony' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Blessed with an innate sense of what in our history is both
significant and makes for stirring drama, Ken Burns has long been
America's premier historical documentarian. His work not only
brings his topic to vivid life but also massages the usually
unwieldy subject matter into a compelling narrative with a skill
that matches Hollywood's best storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP;
Susan B. Anthony'' examines a woefully underappreciated chapter in
our nation's chronicles _ the suffragette movement _ relating a
story that spans a century in a concise, taut fashion while
powerfully evoking the potent emotional underpinnings that propel
this saga. By the end of the four-hour film, premiering Sunday and
Monday, the viewer thoroughly feels the bittersweet nature of the
victory posthumously achieved by these extraordinary women.
</P>
<P>
   As narrator Sally Kellerman explains, when these two women were
born in the early 19th century, those of their gender were, like
slaves, considered property, could own nothing of their own when
married and were scarcely allowed educations. They were born into a
classic Catch-22: The political process was the only means to
improving their lives, but since law forbade them from getting
involved in the political process, there wasn't much chance for the
laws getting changed. Would men willingly mess up the sweetheart
deal they had created for themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony made for an unlikely
alliance _ Stanton was ebullient, colorfully witty and prodigiously
procreative in her marriage, while Anthony was a taciturn spinster.
Historian Ann Gordon points out, ``It's a little hard to guess how
the chemistry (between them) worked so fast,'' but suggests that
the clever homebound wife supplied the spinster who was free to
travel with the words and theories of the suffragette movement to
disseminate to others. And author Kathleen Barry notes, ``There
would be no women's history without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Incremental victories came with a cost, and losses _
particularly at the end of the Civil War, when African-American men
were accorded the rights of free white men but women were summarily
snubbed _ were frequent. Together, Stanton and Anthony helped form
the National American Woman Suffrage Association, but as Stanton
became increasingly radical in her beliefs, Anthony assumed a kind
of tunnel vision, keeping her eyes set on one goal: Women's right
to vote. Anthony's persistence of vision sometimes meant joining
forces with dubious allies _ she looked the other way as
African-American women were banned from outposts of the
organization run by religious Southern women, seriously
compromising the movement; Stanton's progressive views eventually
got her booted from the very organization she created. The
political intrigue is endlessly fascinating.

   Burns employs his usual stylistic gambit _ actors expressively
reading period letters and manuscripts over close-ups of evocative,
sepia-toned antique photos adorned by simple, poignant acoustic
music. It's particularly effective here, since both Anthony and
particularly Stanton were not just articulate but even poetic in
making their case; their eloquent words compensate for the paucity
of archival live-action footage he has to work with. Burns artfully
re-creates Stanton's triumphant final speech on the issue, ``The
Solitude of Self,'' a brilliantly argued and wrenchingly emotional
personal assessment of the necessity for female self-empowerment.
``Not for Ourselves Alone'' is inspirational and insightful, a
worthy addition to Burns' canon of Americana.

`Medal of Honor' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Also inspiring but laced with far more testosterone is ``Medal
of Honor,'' one of those patriotic productions that seem to get
made more through Ted Turner than anyone else in Hollywood. Less
than 3,500 of the 50 million men who have served in the American
military have been given the Congressional Medal of Honor, which
venerates acts so heroically courageous that more than half are
awarded posthumously. This hourlong documentary examines a few
nearly impossible acts of bravery in ordinary men.
</P>
<P>
   Having been shot twice and hit with shrapnel, medic Clarence
Sasser labored seven hours under fire in an ambush in Vietnam,
rescuing fellow soldiers. Henry Erwin grabbed a fiery flare that
exploded in his plane in World War II, dragged it in his scorching
hand to a hole in the plane and threw it out, disfiguring himself
but saving the lives of the entire crew. Ron Rosser saved dozens of
fellow GIs in Korea by jumping into a trench filled with the enemy
and dispatching them after his unit had been ambushed. And James
Stockdale, best known unfortunately for his quixotic run for public
office with Ross Perot, endured seven torturous years in a
Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp without succumbing to his captors.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enactments try too hard to parrot ``Saving Private Ryan'' in
some instances and are overused in general, and the diffident,
banal narration (``War is all about risk'') doesn't come close to
capturing the heights of heroism these men achieved. The stories of
these men scarcely need production-value accessorizing _ they're
genuinely riveting in their own rights. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`Shake, Rattle and Roll' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' _ a miniseries that should be
considerably more mini _ has a look and feel of a '50s teen B
flick, only filled with idiotic revisionist touches. Bonnie
Somerville _ her real name is more appropriate for this material
than her character's actual moniker _ plays Lyne Danner, a freshly
scrubbed, strong-willed woman who introduces ``race music'' to a
sleepy Midwestern town, and in particular, to dreamboat-aspiring
singer Tyler Hart (Brad Hawkins).
</P>
<P>
   Told this new music is called rock 'n' roll, Tyler inanely
replies, ``Cool music _ dumb name, though.'' Ty's bland girlfriend,
on the other hand, tries to dissuade him from playing in a band
with a line that wouldn't have passed muster in a teensploitation
movie from that era: ``It's wild music, Tyler _ it's what juvenile
delinquents listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that Tyler and Lyne hook up _ or that their
first single is a hit, or that bumps occur on the road to success.
A record label expresses interest in Tyler, belittling the rest of
the group, then molds him to its fatuous specifications. This leads
to much inner torment over selling out, a rather specious argument
for that period, generally, and for Tyler particularly, since
there's not exactly what you'd call conviction to his band's tunes.
It takes a whopping four hours to relate what was essentially the
plot of one episode of ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Atrocious dialogue explains the characters, after a fashion:
``Lyne Danner has more class in her little toe than Noreen Bixlar
has in both those Double-D headlights you love!'' ``If you're not
going to go to school, the least you can do is stay home and help
with your retarded brother.'' Thuddingly expository lines likewise
help us keep track of where we are in history: ``I just keep
thinking about Buddy Holly, Richie and Bopper going down in that
plane last week.'' ``Listen to Bob Dylan _ a hard rain's gonna
fall, and I plan to be out in it until it washes us clean!''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler and Lyne are the Forrest Gump of '50s pop, variously _
and, usually, hokily _ encountering Elvis Presley, Little Richard,
Jackie Wilson, Eddie Cochran, B.B. King, Neil Sedaka and other
musical icons. The depiction of the era's race relations is shallow
and simplistic, which might be explicable if director/co-writer
Mike Robe had simply chosen to sidestep the messiness of the issue;
instead, he blunders headlong into it, making everyone look
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' is a cliche-riddled
show-biz rise-and-fall story, padded mercilessly to miniseries
length by repeated performances of new songs in an attempt to
convince you to buy the soundtrack CD, much like Tom Hanks'
similarly plotted, '60s-themed film, ``That Thing You Do!'' In
fact, you could watch (BEGIN ITAL)both(END ITAL) ``That Thing You
Do!'' and the ``Johnny Bravo'' episode of ``The Brady Bunch,'' and
still save 90 minutes off ``Shake, Rattle and Roll's'' running
time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`The X-Files' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' returns for what will likely be its last season,
what with David Duchovny suing his bosses and creator Chris Carter
miffed that Fox yanked his new show, ``Harsh Realm,'' without
giving the show much of a chance. This series lost a little steam
in the wake of the release of its movie last year, which posed more
questions than it answered, and got fans wondering whether the
mythology could even be resolved satisfactorily after having been
expanded to such unwieldy proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Last season ended (inevitably, if you think about it) with
Mulder (Duchovny) going bonkers and Scully (Gillian Anderson)
discovering yet more of the kind of evidence of an extraterrestrial
presence on Earth that always seems to disappear before the
authorities or public can see them. The season premiere is
basically just a stopgap to a resolution that'll come a week or two
down the line, but it audaciously and portentously suggests that
the origin of human life and all that science can't explain is tied
to early alien visitors. The evidence, of course, disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny spends the entire episode in a catatonic stupor,
looking as though a particularly rabid fan had just explained all
of the series' plot convolutions to him in one sitting. The good
news, however, is that with ``Harsh Realm'' out of the way, Carter
can devote his time to ensuring that this season of ``The
X-Files,'' if it is indeed its last, will be particularly
memorable. &QL;

 &HT;    GORE CRITICAL OF BUSH'S INABILITY TO NAME FOREIGN LEADERS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Political categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore chided Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas on Friday for failing to identify key foreign leaders in a
TV interview and questioned whether the Republican presidential
candidate has enough understanding of foreign policy to protect
America's interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton was a bit more forgiving in his reaction
to Bush's lapses, suggesting that the GOP White House hopeful
``should, and probably will, pick up'' the names of the leaders of
three world trouble spots in the course of his pursuit of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Gore said the issue raised by Bush's
inability to identify the world leaders is ``not whether
presidential candidates can pass a pop quiz, but whether they have
the basic foreign policy knowledge necessary to protect America's
interests and security around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview with a Boston television station
Wednesday, was asked to name the leaders of four world hot spots:
Chechnya, Taiwan, India and Pakistan. Bush was able to give a
partial response to only one: Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   He further compounded his political dilemma by suggesting that
the Oct. 12 military takeover of Pakistan was ``good news'' in that
it had brought political stability to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our
country _ the world's oldest democracy _ would characterize this
military takeover as 'good news,''' Gore's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said the United States ``should not carry on
business as usual'' with Pakistan until its military leader, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, takes steps to ``restore a constitutional,
civilian and democratic government.''
</P>
<P>
   And because Pakistan is a nuclear power, Gore renewed his
criticism of the Texas governor's opposition to a proposed nuclear
test ban treaty, which was recently rejected by the Republican-led
Senate on a vote that closely followed part lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments
about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons _ shortly
after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The interview with WHDH-TV in Boston was not Bush's first
difficulty with foreign policy issues. He once confused the
European nations of Slovakia and Slovenia and has referred to
Greeks mistakenly as Grecians, Kosovarians instead of Kosovars and
East Timorians instead of East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday with Sam Donaldson on ABCNEWS.com, Bush
said his inability to name the leaders of Chechnya, India and
Pakistan would not resonate with American voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``America understands that a guy doesn't know the name of every
single foreign leader,'' Bush told Donaldson. ``That's not what
Americans are making their choices on about who's going to be the
president... People are making their choices based upon judgment,
based upon vision, based upon philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Clinton made similar comments rather than agreeing
with his vice president that Bush's response revealed a major flaw
in the presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Bush would ``soon enough learn their
names,'' Clinton told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program. ``The
most important thing is, do you have a clear idea of what the world
ought to look like and what America's policy ought to be in these
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``as a presidential candidate, in the main trouble spots
in the world, he should, and probably will, pick up those,'' the
president added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes criticized WHDH-TV's interviewer,
political reporter Andy Hiller. ``The person who is running for
president is seeking to be the leader of the free world, not a
'Jeopardy' contestant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, echoing his campaign aide's criticism of Hiller,
acknowledged that ``people can trick me'' with questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wish he would have asked and I know I'm going to be
asked a lot is, what do I think the United States' role is in the
world...,'' Bush told Donaldson. ``This country has got a choice to
make, Sam, whether we become isolationists, whether we retreat
within our borders or whether we promote peace. As president, I
intend to promote the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who developed an expertise in defense policy and nuclear
arms control during 16 years in Congress, said the nuclear test ban
treaty opposed by Bush and the Republican leadership of Congress is
``an indispensable tool'' in promoting peace.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Gore's sole challenger for the Democratic
presidential nomination, dismissed the interview as ``a pop quiz
that not everybody could answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley added, ``I think the real question is where do you want
to take the country and how are you going to get there?''

three marriages in the United Kingdom end in divorce, one of the
highest failure rates in Europe. And it's another fact that many
divorces are caused by adultery. Now a new British company claims
it has the answer. As its name suggests, the Alibi Agency is
offering cheating husbands or wives the perfect way to hide their
affair from their spouses. Now the company plans to branch out into
the United States. (Emling, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTO.

   IRAN-TRIAL _ TEHRAN. Iran _ The judge kept up his grilling until
young college student Ali Abbas Nemati was answering though his
tears. ``Aren't you sorry for what you've done,'' the judge chided
the student, who stood in front of a row seats filled with turbaned
mullahs from Iran's religious establishment. Nemati had not
committed murder or sedition. He was not a radical newspaper editor
or reformist politician. He was a scared playwright, pleading his
loyalty to Islam and denying charges that his play about a Muslim
holy figure was an insult. Nemati was sentenced to three years in
jail this week (Tuesday) in the latest case of Iran's religious
conservatives flexing their muscle. As they try to stave off
growing calls for reform, the conservatives are targeting writers
as well as their political opponents. The case illustrates the
limitations ? sometimes highly ambiguous ? faced by Iranian
writers. But, the reformers say things are improving and even site
Nemati's case as progress because it was handled in the courts and
not the streets. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTO.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hard to decide which star to praise first in
ABC's joyous new film of the Broadway musical ``Annie.'' Who knew
Kathy Bates could sing and dance? (Like a dream.) And is there any
performer with a more radiant combination of face and voice than
Audra McDonald? Is there any fabulously sleazy character that Alan
Cumming can't make thrilling, even when he has to tone it down for
a G rating? And God bless 12-year-old Alicia Morton, who plays
Annie: When she sings ``Tomorrow'' (that harrowing ghost tune of
little girl auditions past), strolling through the melting-snow
streets of Manhattan with her new dog, Sandy, she really does seem
to be thinking about tomorrow _ rather than how precious she is.
</P>
<P>
   Heartwarming is hard to get away with these days. Musicals are
hard to do. So when one of the broadcast networks, the underdogs of
the decade, presents two hours so heartwarming, charming, elating
and pure that even brittle, irony-proud New Yorkers may sit
entranced and smiling like idiots, gushing is required. One hero
behind the scenes is Rob Marshall, the director and choreographer,
who was Sam Mendes' choreographer and co-director on the Broadway
revival of ``Cabaret.'' Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, two of the
executive producers, also brought us Brandy in Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``Cinderella'' two years ago and Bette Midler doing
``Gypsy'' on CBS in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Depression-era New York, seen through lightly
falling snow, look lovely from the first scene, but poor Annie has
never been allowed outdoors to see them. She's stuck in a dismal
all-girl orphanage run by the evil Miss Hannigan (Ms. Bates in all
her splendor, blowing a whistle and telling one unfortunate girl
with conviction, ``Your days are numbered''). Luckily, when Miss
Hannigan leaves the room, the girls can burst into song (``It's a
Hard Knock Life,'' while they scrub the floor. Best rhyme: ``No one
cares for you a smidge/When you're in an orphanage.''). Elsewhere
in the orphanage Ms. Bates is singing about her own woes (``Little
Girls,'' a lament about just how many of them she's surrounded by).
It is Ms. Bates' genius to make Miss Hannigan simultaneously
monstrous and sympathetic, just a victim of career frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Grace (Ms. McDonald), the secretary of Oliver
Warbucks, richest man in the world, turns up. Warbucks (Victor
Garber), trying to reverse his bad image in the press, has decided
to invite an orphan to spend the Christmas holidays at his
cavernous marble-floored mansion. Soon Annie is on a five-star
vacation with a servant-orphan ratio of about 10-to-1. And Ms.
McDonald is making her mark with what, in other hands, would be one
of the show's lesser numbers (``I Think I'm Going to Like It
Here''). Television viewers who don't know of Ms. McDonald, 29, and
her three Tonys (``Carousel,'' ``Master Class'' and ``Ragtime'')
won't know what hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Little Orphan Annie faces a couple of glitches on the road to
love, wealth and happiness as Warbucks' adopted daughter, but they
pass quickly. Even the president (that would be Franklin D.
Roosevelt) turns up, in his wheelchair, promising to find homes
with ``fine, upstanding'' families for all of Annie's pals.
</P>
<P>
   Garber does nicely as Warbucks, particularly in the number
``NYC,'' a paean to New York. Andrea McArdle, who played Annie on
Broadway back in 1977, looks and sounds great in the same number,
doing a cameo as a Broadway star. And Kristin Chenoweth, Broadway's
newcomer of the year (she won a Tony for her role as Sally in
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown''), is appropriately bimboish as
Lily St. Regis, who is named for the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes together when the amazing Cumming (whose life
changed a year and a half ago when he first played the emcee in the
revival of ``Cabaret''), Ms. Bates and Ms. Chenoweth burst into
song and exuberant dance in ``Easy Street.'' They swing around
desks, do a little soft-shoe on top of file cabinets and take it
into the streets. You'll almost want them to succeed in their
scheme to cheat Warbucks out of a $50,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   The film's best choice of all, however, is that the young
heroine just gets her hair curled a little, rather than turning up
in what in most productions of ``Annie'' looks like a red Afro wig.
And she only wears that peculiar red dress with white trim in one
scene.

   NEW YORK _ First, in the world of full-size humans, you've got
Randy Quaid as the love interest. Then there's a half-baked ``Romeo
and Juliet'' plot about a fairy princess and a wide-eyed, big-eared
leprechaun, the children of feuding little people and trooping
fairies. (They're called that because they troop, OK?) There are a
few too many steals from ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Humans and mythical creatures alike look a little stunned
throughout, particularly Roger Daltrey as the fairy king Boric.
This film, from the prolific (and possibly overextended) producer
Robert Halmi Sr., is about as unmagical as four hours of this many
special effects can get. It does make Ireland look beautiful, but
how hard is that?

THE SOUL OF THE NEXT NEW MACHINE: HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROB FIXMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ray Kurzweil discusses human destiny, it is not always
clear whether he's talking about technology or theology.
</P>
<P>
   It is technology that defines his resume; he has spent 34 of his
51 years inventing ingenious uses for artificial intelligence. But
like a priest caught playing in a physics lab, he keeps coming up
with inventions inspired by aesthetics and social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when he was still in high school, he wrote a
program that composed music, while his latest software, available
at his Web site, writes poetry. In between he created machines that
read to the blind, software that draws and paints, electronic
keyboards that produce the sounds of acoustical instruments and one
of the most advanced and commercially successful forms of computer
speech recognition.
</P>
<P>
   All were concrete products of a restless mind consumed by the
question of what will be. A more abstract product of that vision is
his latest book, ``The Age of the Spiritual Machine: When Computers
Exceed Human Intelligence'' (Viking, 1999). In it, he looks at the
exponential increase in computing power over the last 50 years and
concludes that within 50 years, machines will not only be smarter
than humans but smart enough to persuade us that they are conscious
beings in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion, not surprisingly, has drawn the wrath of several
prominent philosophers who question his definitions of both
intelligence and consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Searle, the renowned University of California at
Berkeley professor of philosophy, wrote in The New York Review of
Books that the fatal flaw in ``Kurzweil's entire argument'' is that
``it rests on the assumption that the main thing humans do in their
lives is compute.'' In a phone interview this week he added:
``Kurzweil's proposals are preposterous science. I think he got a
little carried away and made massive philosophical errors, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the debates about what defines intelligence and
consciousness have gained the most public attention, the far more
compelling idea in the book is his prediction that our progeny _ if
not some of us alive today _ are destined to be human-machine
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Based on current trends in computer and biological sciences, he
says that a superpowered intelligence will result from such a
hybrid. The merging of human brains and computer circuits, he
asserts, will enable the species to redesign itself and determine
not just its own destiny but the fate of the universe. To become,
in other words, God-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view,'' Kurzweil writes in the book's conclusion, ``the
primary issue is not the mass of the universe or the possible
existence of antigravity or of Einstein's so-called cosmological
constant. Rather the fate of the universe is a decision yet to be
made, one which we will intelligently consider when the time is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   In his review Searle, writes in an amazed tone: ``Kurzweil does
not think he is writing a work of science fiction or a parody or
satire. He is making serious claims that he thinks are based on
solid scientific results.''
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner at the Boston Ritz Carlton, Kurzweil insisted,
``This stuff isn't science fiction.'' His voice was soft, almost
emotionless, but the ideas emerged fully formed, articulated with
machinelike precision.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, he was clearly multi-tasking _ answering
questions and expounding on complex technologies without so much as
a pause for a breath, his eyes all the while parsing the salmon
entree before him. (He takes eating very seriously indeed. His
previous book, ``The 10 Percent Solution for a Healthy Life,'' was
about nutrition, specifically about a low-fat diet he put together
to battle his own congenital heart disease.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``stuff'' he's talking about is no less than a physical
hybrid of human beings and their technology. He says the machines
being created today are the beginning of our metamorphosis from
thinking mammal to all-knowing hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   Biological evolution has already given way to much more rapid
and less random technological evolution, Kurzweil argues. And
within 30 years, he predicts, direct links will be established
between neurons in the human brain and computer circuitry. The
implications are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Such links would mean that the entire contents of a brain could
be ``insubstantiated'' _ copied (and preserved) in an external
database. Not only would the brain's biological capacity be
supplemented with enormous amounts of digital memory, it would also
be linked to vast information resources like the Internet at the
speed of thought.
</P>
<P>
   And it would produce, through direct neural stimulation, a
virtual reality indistinguishable from objective reality.
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil cites existing medical treatments in which silicon
chips have been successfully implanted in human brains or been made
to communicate with neurons as examples of primitive steps toward
his predictions.
</P>
<P>
   While these sorts of visions might seem far-fetched, other
respected futurists find Kurzweil's ideas compelling. Marvin
Minsky, Toshiba professor of media arts and science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has called him ``a leading
futurist of our time,'' while the techno-guru George Gilder says,
``This book makes all other roads to the computer future look like
goat paths in Patagonia.''
</P>
<P>
   That Kurzweil's theories are given a serious hearing is
testament to his credentials. Since his teen-age years he has been
harnessing computer power to ``pattern recognition,'' which
Kurzweil describes as ``that part of the artificial intelligence
field where we teach computers to recognize abstract patterns, a
capability that dominates human thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, at age 17, his music composing program won a
Westinghouse science award, a visit to the White House and a spot
as a contestant on the old television game show ``I've Got a
Secret.'' (Young Ray's secret stumped the former Miss America, Bess
Myerson, but was guessed by the second panelist, the actor Henry
Morgan.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time he graduated from MIT in 1970, Kurzweil had already
achieved his first business success, having founded a computer
database service that helped high school students choose the right
college. That endeavor, which he sold for $100,000, was followed by
a string of successful businesses built on his inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Among his best known is the Kurzweil reading machine for the
blind, which was a true marvel when it was introduced. CBS News was
so impressed with the device that Walter Cronkite used it to
deliver his signature sign-off ``And that's the way it was, Jan.
13, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Kurzweil has won a raft of accolades in both
business and academia and received nine honorary doctorates. Today,
in addition to writing his next book, he is developing Fat Kat, an
artificial intelligence system that applies evolutionary algorithms
to securities investment decisions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Kurzweil's vision of the future, the man-machine hybrid will
be accomplished not through some Frankenstein-like amalgam but
through an elegant technology: microscopic, self-replicating robots
called nanobots that will be introduced through the bloodstream and
will interact with individual neurons throughout the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' Kurzweil said, ``is to direct nanobots to travel
through every capillary in the brain, where they will pass in very
close proximity to every neural feature.'' This, he says will
enable the tiny machines to scan each neuron and ``build up a huge
database'' _ basically, the entire contents of a brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all these nanobots would be communicating with each
other,'' he said. ``They'd basically be on a wireless network. They
could also be on the Web and communicating with computers
maintaining the database outside the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in nanotechnology came several years ago with
the discovery of the nanotube, a carbon molecule of enormous
strength. Just about anything can be fabricated from nanotubes, at
many times the strength and at a fraction of the weight possible
with conventional materials.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, nanotubes have a far greater capacity for raw
computing power than the commonly used silicon. This combination of
features holds out the possibility of building machines no larger
than a blood cell that are fully programmable and perhaps even able
to construct replicas of themselves from carbon atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the technology is decreasing so rapidly, Kurzweil
says, that ``within 30 years, both the size and cost of this
scenario will be feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such technology would inevitably be accompanied by
terrifying dangers. By scanning a brain into a database, a person's
most private thoughts and memories would be vulnerable to
intrusions by hackers. And wouldn't the brain also be vulnerable to
external control of information, thought processes and even
perceptions of reality?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are real concerns,'' Kurzweil admits. ``Organizations,
like governments or religious or terrorist groups or just clever
individuals could put nanobots in food or water supplies, trillions
of them. These would then make their way inside people and would
monitor their thoughts and even could control them and place them
into virtual environments.''
</P>
<P>
   But he adds: ``We won't be defenseless. We have these concerns
today at a primitive level with Trojan horses that make their way
into our computers.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Kurzweil says there is no turning back. Once
evolution produced a technological species, it locked us into a
relentless quest for understanding and control of our universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to be optimistic, but that's more of a personal
orientation than something I could scientifically argue for,'' he
admits. ``There definitely are dangers, and we do tend to address
them imperfectly, so there is some possibility that this will
fail.''

 &HT;    Newest Apple operating system respectable, but not a milestone
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple has begun shipping the latest version of its operating
system, and it is now in computer stores across metro Atlanta and
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Called OS 9, this update of the company's now venerable
operating system represents no big breakthroughs in ease-of-use or
power. But it does offer a collection of nice enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   As with any new version of an operating system, which controls
the look and feel of a computer, there are a growing number of
reports about conflicts with other programs.
</P>
<P>
   So far the conflicts aren't crippling. Typically these conflicts
are fixed over time as Apple and developers release patches that
can be downloaded for free from the Internet. A patch is a little
bit of code that corrects a conflict between the operating system
and a program.
</P>
<P>
   Among the popular programs that won't work now with OS 9 are Ram
Doubler, Speed Doubler and shareware FreePPP. Connectix, which
makes the Doubler programs, plans to release fixes by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, for example, has already announced free patches that fix
incompatibilities between OS 9 and its ATM typography programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some printers won't work with OS 9. These printers
include Apple's StyleWriters 2400 and 4400. Some Epson printers
won't work when trying to use the ``print one copy'' feature with
OS 9.
</P>
<P>
   That said, OS 9 does have some interesting new features. It lets
multiple users, for example, create separate and protected settings
while sharing the same Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Another new feature is called Keychain. A safebox of Internet
and other passwords, Keychain enables users to automatically log in
to any protected site or account. You have to type a password into
Keychain just once.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has also remade its new search feature, called Sherlock.
Now you can use Sherlock to search the Internet from your desktop
for news, people and comparative prices for merchandise. It still
retains the original features, which let you search not only for
files on your hard disk but for words within files as well.
</P>
<P>
   Should you rush out and buy OS 9? I'd say wait a few weeks.
While the program may be worth its $99 price tag, waiting is smart.
The longer you wait, the more the inevitable bugs will have been
fixed and the greater the program's stability.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Vote for century's most important technology
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Hustedc. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   With the millennium approaching, you'll see all sorts of lists
of the bests and worsts of the century _ everything from the best
baseball team to the most influential people. Someone will come out
soon with a list of the best lists of the century.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to know what you _ the readers of this
column _ think is the most important technology of the century.
Imagine deciding on just one technology for a period that saw the
advent of space travel, the transistor, the computer and the atomic
bomb. If you think it is hard to come up with the best first
baseman for the past 100 years, think of the competition you'll
have for the most important technology.
</P>
<P>
   Since this isn't a formal contest, the rules are loose. Write me
at tecbud(at)ajc.com and tell me your thoughts on the most
influential technology of the century. It doesn't have to be a
technology that was invented during the century, just the one that
had the biggest impact during that time. So if, for instance, you
think the telephone had the most impact, the fact that it was
invented before the start of the century does not disqualify it.
</P>
<P>
   When I tried to answer the question myself, during my commute to
work this morning from Technology Ranch in far Smyrna, I was
surprised at my answer. Lists of ``bests'' and ``most importants''
are subjective. So I will make no attempt to convince you I'm
right; instead, I'll tell you what I think and why. Maybe _ whether
you agree or disagree _ it'll start your own thinking process. When
I have enough answers, I'll write another column and may share your
thoughts with the rest of the readers. Just in case I decide to do
that, include your name and city with the e-mail. And, so it'll be
easier for me to separate out the entries, in the subject area for
your e-mail, use the title: Best of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   My own vote for the most influential technology of the century
is the creation of the electrical grid that serves this country.
I'll start off by admitting I'm biased. My grandfather, Clyde Key,
was a lineman for Arkansas Power &AMP; Light. Back in the 1920s, he was
one of the many people across the country who had the joy of
bringing electricity to rural homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing spiked boots called climbers, he scaled many a utility
pole to string the wire that carried the electricity to remote
homes in Arkansas. Once he was done, the world was forever changed
for the people who lived in those homes. Now they could read into
the night or simply sit and talk way past the usual bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   I can still hear him talk. I remember his story of one family in
rural Arkansas. After the electrical service had been installed,
the father stood at the wall switch and turned the power on and off
while the rest of the family watched in amazement. It's hard to
comprehend the miracle of turning a light on at the push of a
button in today's world, where the darnedest things are taken for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most of modern America now comes with an on/off
switch.
</P>
<P>
   And electricity did more than change our bedtime. It powers _
one way or another _ the manufacturing plants that create
automobiles, aircraft and almost any other product you use.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that I'm right. This test has no single correct
answer. And I hope that some of the answers will surprise me,
extolling the virtues of some technology we take so much for
granted that it would never make its way onto most lists.
</P>
<P>
   Let me know what you think. I'll gather your responses and, when
the time seems right, I'll tell you what I learned.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'll champion my own favorite: electricity,
because it pushed back the night.

 &HT;    Writer recounts legends of flowers named for Virgin Mary
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTERVILLE, Ohio _ Legend has it that when the angel Gabriel
came to visit the Virgin Mary, he held a lily in his hand. When she
touched the lily, the formerly scentless flower gave off an
exquisite scent.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary, pregnant with Jesus, journeyed to the home of her
cousin, Elizabeth, a columbine flower sprung up wherever her foot
touched the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Since medieval times, flowers have taken their names from the
virtues of Mary, or from events in her life. Legends also cropped
up, like violets in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   During their flight into Egypt, the Holy Family found cover in
the protective branches of a juniper bush; fuchsia, or ``our lady's
eardrop,'' is the jewel-like flower that Jesus playfully hung on
his mother's ears.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mary's Flowers: Gardens, Legends and Meditations'' (St.
Anthony Messenger Press, $29.95), Centerville writer Vincenzina
Krymow, 69, has gathered many of these stories together into her
own bouquet. Thirty legends are recounted, and each is accompanied
by a meditation and a woodcut image. The mediations are written by
M. Jean Frisk, who has a degree in sacred theology and is on the
staff of the Marian Library at the University of Dayton. The
illustrations were created by A. Joseph Barrish, a Marianist
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations, made with a silkscreen printing process, are
on display until Thanksgiving at the University of Dayton's Marian
Library gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The book also gives instructions for creating a devotional Mary
garden, and features five famous Mary gardens, including the Mary
Garden at Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto at Mount St. John in
Beavercreek.
</P>
<P>
   Krymow, a free-lance writer and a volunteer researcher at the
Marian Library, is a devout Catholic and a gardener since
childhood. The book, she says, is a natural combination of the
things that are important to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We honor Mary in many ways, through the Rosary, special
devotions and prayers that help us contemplate Mary's qualities and
virtues,'' Krymow writes. ``In this book we offer yet another way
to honor Mary, through reflecting on flowers named after her and
immortalized in legends that tell us about her attributes and
significant moments in her life and that of her child, Jesus.
Through the meditations for each flower we experience these events
with Mary and find in them meaning for our own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are flowers associated with Mary? Krymow says she doesn't
know for sure. But in the early centuries of Christianity, there
was a concerted effort by the converted to eliminate devotion to
pagan gods and goddesses, who were often associated with flowers.
Venus, for example, was associated with the rose.
</P>
<P>
   Krymow got a lot of her information from John Stokes of
Philadelphia, who for many years published ``Mary's Garden
Nursery,'' a catalog that featured seeds and flowers associated
with Mary. He ceased publication years ago, but, thanks to the
Internet, much of his research still is available
(www.mgarden.org).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 30 legends, an appendix in the back of
Krymow's book lists the Latin names, common names and Marian names
of more than 200 flowers, along with the virtue with which it is
associated.
</P>
<P>
   Krymow has her own backyard Mary garden, planted with
snapdragons (''Infant Jesus Little Shoes'') and petunias (``Our
Lady's Praises''), surrounding a statue of Mary and a stone bench.
She doesn't get out there much, but she can see the garden from her
kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way I can still spend a little time with Mary, being
quiet _ that's the best part.''
</P>
<P>
   Krymow says she felt Mary's presence as she wrote the book.
``It's Mary's book. It's what she wanted. I feel very humbled, very
honored.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACOIMA _ During the day, the neighborhood of modest homes
surrounding Montague Charter Academy is quiet. Except for a few
grandparents and mothers with babies, the adults are at work, many
laboring at two or three jobs to support large families.
</P>
<P>
   But on the school grounds, it's a different scene: Children's
voices ring out in glee during a game of kickball on the
playground, in excitement in the classroom, at seeing a science
project work.
</P>
<P>
   This school and the neighborhood around it are in one of the
poorest areas of the San Fernando Valley. But the two are
intertwined by respect and hope for the future, and are rich in
things that can't be measured by physical possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd describe this school as `family,''' said art teacher
Sylvia Villarreal, who began to volunteer at Montague when her
daughter was a student here, and was encouraged by the staff to
pursue a career in art. ``The kids say they go to a special school.
And they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Montague, which teaches pre-kindergarteners through
fifth-graders, isn't the kind of school where parents venture onto
campus strictly for back-to-school night and the Christmas pageant.
</P>
<P>
   There are classes for parents learning English, classes for
newly recruited foster parents and classes for those working toward
U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends are a time for on-campus dance and music classes and
recitals, and the library and computer lab are open for parents to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs are found for out-of-work parents. Families with problems
are offered counseling. School staff members help fill out forms
ranging from welfare applications to naturalization papers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the school ``doing for'' the parents. The
parents give more than their share back, helping to keep the
grounds clean and blooming, distributing surplus federal food and
used clothing for others in need.
</P>
<P>
   And parent volunteers are daily fixtures at Montague, says Vista
volunteer coordinator Nina Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 1,200 kids _ most families have three or four here at
one time _ we have a roster of 256 parent volunteers. We're trying
for 300 volunteers, which would mean that virtually every parent
with a child here volunteers time,'' said Nelson, parent of seven
Montague students and graduates and herself a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of become the center of the community,'' said
principal Diane Pritchard. ``There are no theaters here. There are
no libraries. There's no place else to go. So people come to the
school. It's a balancing act between giving all this attention to
families and providing instruction for the children. But a
successful family unit makes a healthy student.''
</P>
<P>
   Montague wasn't built to be a community center. Thrown up in
1956 as postwar babies reached school age, it still has the same
look as other schools of that era, enlivened only recently by
small, verdant gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Off Laurel Canyon Boulevard just inside Pacoima's border with
Arleta, the neighborhood around the school is surrounded on three
sides by industrial buildings. A few blocks to the northeast is
Whiteman Air Park. Around the corner is a small strip of stores
that donate food and merchandise for campus events, and provide
jobs for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Of Montague's 1,200 students, 96 percent are Latino, 2 percent
are white, 1 percent Asian and 1 percent African-American.
Seventy-three percent speak limited English. And 95 percent of
students' families have incomes below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents are wonderful people, but they're poor,''
Pritchard said. ``But there's such a thirst for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a thirst that was born of hard times in another country,
where young people were forced to drop out of school so they could
work to help support their families.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grader Armando Contreras, whose dad is a tree trimmer,
said it's hard not to goof off, but his father reminds him,
``You've got to study to get a good job for your future.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sandra Cordova, who began baby-sitting for her 1-year-old
cousin when she was only 5 years old herself, remembers the look on
her delivery man father's face when he came home from citizenship
exam classes. ``He just looked so happy,'' the 10-year-old said.
``He told me, `If you're a citizen, you can have a home, a good job
and take care of your family.'''
</P>
<P>
   Otilia Flores, a dressmaker who could neither read nor write in
English or Spanish, when her youngest son enrolled at Montague
seven years ago, attended classes to become literate in both
languages. Even though both sons are grown, she continues to
volunteer at Montague, providing food for school parties and
festivals, and teaching the kids to make papier-mache flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my school _ and I say `my school' because it
still is my school,'' Flores said. ``It always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always easy to convince the parents that they were
safe and respected at Montague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started very slowly,'' said Pritchard. ``It was mostly
word-of-mouth: `You need this? Go to the school. You want to know
this? Go to the school. Yes, you can trust them.' We'd tell them,
`We don't care if you're here illegally, or what your status is; we
just want to help your children.' ... We'd convince one person it
was OK to come to the school, and she'd tell another and another.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to establish that trust are the
English-as-a-second-language classes taught by instructor Karin
Portman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class teaches so much more than English,'' Pritchard
said. ``I heard two men, two of our parents, talking the other day
while they were waiting for their children. One was bragging that
since his wife learned English, she's handling the family's budget
and writing all the checks, paying all the bills. He was so proud
of her.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the parents and students who appreciate the
school, which has had independent charter status for only three
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Montague received the Above and Beyond Award from the
city of Los Angeles for excellence in professional development, and
has earned a slew of other awards and grants, including being named
one of America's 100 Outstanding Schools by the Target stores.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente has adopted the school, providing everything
from health-based games to complete human skeletons for biology
classes, said Mei Ling Schwartz, the HMO's director of health
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we saw what they were doing at Montague, we decided this
school is a part of our community and we should do whatever we can
for it,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've been able to do at Montague is unbelievable,''
said Marian Baran, director of Mission College's foster-care
education program, who's working with Pritchard to get a grant to
help families get off welfare. ``This is the way education should
be done all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard, a no-nonsense woman in her 50s, credits the community
for the achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But few administrators work harder. Pritchard is in her office
by 4:30 a.m. most mornings. She pops into classrooms unannounced;
in one kindergarten class, her blue print dress prompts a
discussion of flowers and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   The principal isn't alone in her attempts to make life easier
for the families of Montague's students.
</P>
<P>
   School nurse Toni Braun works with parents, Childrens Hospital,
and state and county health departments to get the school's many
handicapped students physical therapy, walkers and wheelchairs. She
also arranges for free or low-cost eye exams and glasses, dental
care, and counseling services for children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one class, we were talking about hygiene, and we found that
95 percent of students didn't own a toothbrush,'' Braun said. A
plea to Colgate yielded hundreds of toothbrushes, enough for every
child in school.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Schiff, the school psychologist, counsels entire families
about alcoholism, domestic violence, coping with poverty and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   If families are hungry, she puts them in touch with a food bank.
If they need transportation, she'll make sure they know where to
catch the bus or find a cheap used car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have families living in garages, and that affects how a
child does at school,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a matter of solving just one problem,'' she added.
``We try to solve all we can. Sometimes people don't even know
where to begin, so we steer them in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Families also get help from Isabel Rayas, whose own four
children, ranging in age from 13 to 20, attended Montague. She
began working at the school as a volunteer in the cafeteria in
1990. Pritchard and others encouraged her to go to college, and now
she works as director of the school's parents center while pursuing
a degree in education and psychology at Mission College.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Rayas has found paying jobs for 10 parents by
helping the unemployed fill out applications, pick out an interview
outfit, run through a mock interview. She helps them make an
interview appointment, then follows up with both the company and
the interviewee.
</P>
<P>
   That process itself is often an eye-opener, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they try to fill out an application, they can see whether
their English is adequate,'' Rayas said. ``Often, they decide they
need to learn more, and sign up for an ESL class.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that's how the Montague family weaves together education,
work and lifestyle both on- and off-campus. It's an effort at
fulfilling a vision, though even the most devoted and determined
agree that the neighborhood is not a dream come true _ not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard would love to start a community theater for parents,
to open a preschool for children as young as 2 or 3 where parents
could learn child-care skills, to devise a program to help families
who rent get low-cost home loans, to rip up the wide swath of
blacktop in the rear of the campus and replace it with a grassy
soccer field for the whole community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our frustrations,'' Pritchard said. ``But we do what
we can, with a lot of help from the community.'' &UR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology has been the undisputed champ of the bull market. But
investors seeking a slightly less risky way to jump into the sector
may want to consider convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies have long tapped investor enthusiasm by
issuing convertibles and preferred stock to finance the next stage
of their growth. Of the $26 billion of convertibles issued year to
date, more than 30 percent were from technology companies,
according to the Value Line Convertible Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Technology convertibles make up 41 percent of the market value
of the Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertibles Index, versus 26 percent
one year ago. (Even a relatively technology-heavy index like the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 has a technology weighting ofjust 24
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill index has returned 17.8 ercent so far this year,
nearly keeping pace with the 19.0 percent return of the underlying
stocks, according to Preston Harrington III, a convertible bond
strategist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington says technology convertibles may be an attractive
alternative for investors who worry about the high valuations of
the sector's stocks. ``It's a more conservative way for investors
to play technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Convertibles are hybrid securities that can be exchanged for a
specific number of shares in the issuer's underlying common stock.
They offer much of the upside of a stock if prices are rising _
investors can sell the appreciated bond or convert it to stock.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fixed interest rate paid on them provides
some of the protection of a bond.
</P>
<P>
   The hook for investors is that a fairly priced convertible
usually rises more on an increase in the price of the underlying
stock than it falls if the shares tumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question investors can sometimes do better with a
tech convert'' than with the common stock of the same issuer, said
Michael Shamosh, bond strategist at Tucker Anthony. But, he added,
there is still plenty of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds, for example, often profit by selling short the
shares of technology companies, betting that they will decline,
while holding the convertibles, so they can profit from a steeper
decline in the stock while collecting the convertible's yield. That
creates volatility when the hedge funds unwind the positions.
</P>
<P>
   On their own, however, individual investors face big hurdles in
buying convertibles, which are often rated below investment grade.
Experts say sophisticated skills are needed to analyze the complex
risks of both the stock and the bond.
</P>
<P>
   And because most of the technology convertibles are issued on an
unregistered basis, only institutions can buy them initially.
Individuals cannot trade the bonds until they are registered,
usually 90 to 180 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Convertible funds offer one solution. These have returned 12.6
percent a year to date through October, versus 10.2 percent for the
average United States diversified fund, according to Lipper Inc.,
the research firm.
</P>
<P>
   A clutch of such funds had heavy investments in technology as of
Sept. 30. The $70 million Value Line Convertible fund had a 40
percent technology weighting, which includes the bonds of Internet
companies like Doubleclick, Mindspring Enterprises and CNET. It has
an average credit quality of BB.
</P>
<P>
   The $47.4 million TCW Galileo Convertible Securities fund, with
37 percent of its assets in technology, has stakes in
STMicroelectronics, Intel and Conextant Systems, and has an average
credit quality of BBB(minus), higher than the average convertible
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The $449 million Van Kampen Harbor fund, with 36 percent of its
holdings in technology, holds big positions in Comverse Technology
and Conextant. Its average credit rating is BB(plus).

DIVIDENDS ARE FADING AS MARKETS SIGNALS, TOO

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the market-timing models that failed to anticipate the
extraordinary stock bull market of this decade, the most
spectacular failure has been the one that is based on dividend
yields.
</P>
<P>
   According to that model, the stock market is overvalued whenever
the average dividend yield of stocks drops to historically low
levels. Between 1871 and 1990, the stock market was in danger
whenever its dividend yield dropped to below 3 percent; stocks lost
3.2 percent, on average, over the subsequent year.
</P>
<P>
   Often, such a yield portended a bear market. At the market top
before the bear market of 1973-74, for example, the dividend yield
of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was at 2.7 percent, then a
record low.
</P>
<P>
   But the signal hasn't worked in the 1990s. The S&AMP;P 500 last
traded at a 3 percent dividend yield in October 1992, when the
index itself was around 420. As of Friday, with the S&AMP;P 500 more
than three times as high, its dividend yield is near its record low
of 1.18 percent. At that rate, the S&AMP;P 500 would have to decline by
more than half just to bring it back to the level that has signaled
a major market top.
</P>
<P>
   Clues to the model's failure are seen in a new study that
examines the role of dividends in the United States economy all the
way back to 1926. The study, by two finance professors _ Eugene F.
Fama of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business and
Kenneth R. French of MIT's Sloan School of Management _ concludes
that the role of dividends has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for example, just 20.7 percent of all publicly traded
American companies even pay a dividend. As recently as 1978, that
share was 66.5 percent. And even during the Depression, the number
never dropped below 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The professors believe, first of all, that the universe of
publicly-traded companies has changed significantly over the years.
Relatively more and more companies are either unprofitable or so in
need of cash that they must invest their earnings into their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they note, such companies are relatively young and have
small market capitalizations. This class of companies rarely pays
dividends, the professors said, and has seldom done so in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the growing proportion of American public companies
that are unprofitable. In any given year before 1980, that figure
was rarely above 10 percent. At the end of 1997, however, it was
more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even when small-cap companies have earnings, however, they
rarely pay dividends. That is because they are often growing so
fast that it makes far more sense to put their cash to work
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   From 1963 until 1997, according to the study, the assets of
companies that have never paid a dividend have grown 15.7 percent a
year, on average, versus 8.7 percent for dividend-paying companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to the professors, only about half the decline in the
percentage of companies that pay dividends can be explained by the
increased prevalence of this class of companies that are often
fast-growing, small-cap or both. They attribute the other half of
the decline to an increasing reluctance to pay dividends on the
part of established, profitable and often large-cap companies _ a
class that has made payouts in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street analysts believe that the parsimony has been
caused by the increasing popularity _ since the mid-1980s _ of
companies' share repurchase programs. These stock buybacks are
really just another way for management to distribute profits to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Professors Fama and French dismiss that explanation. They
found that buyback plans have, almost exclusively, been the
province of dividend-paying large-cap companies.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, such companies are distributing a greater
percentage of their earnings as dividends today than they were
before repurchase programs became so popular. So share buybacks
cannot explain why fewer large-cap companies are paying dividends
today than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the cause, it is clear that dividends don't play
the role they used to in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that reduced relevance doesn't mean that stocks
aren't overvalued. But if a bear market does begin from today's
levels, it won't be because the market's dividend yield is too
low. &QL;

<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Buoyed by fresh inflows of overseas
investment money, stock markets in Latin America are staging a
rally that could presage a return to economic growth in many of the
region's countries next year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, indexes like the Bovespa on the Sao
Paulo stock exchange, Latin America's largest stock market, have
soared to a six-month high. In Mexico, Latin America's
second-largest country, the bolsa index reached a 3-month high. On
the coattails of these markets, stocks in Argentina, Chile and
Colombia registered healthy gains.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rally has been fueled by relief over potential
interest rate increases in the United States, as recent economic
reports have led some investors to believe that only one increase
in rates, instead of several, is likely in coming months. Lower
interest rates in the United States, Latin America's biggest source
of investment, translates into more money available for purchases
of stocks in the region.
</P>
<P>
   However, a growing consensus that Latin America is positioned
for a revival of economic growth next year is also encouraging
investors to increase their stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of some commodities prices, healthy demand for
Latin American exports in rich industrialized nations and political
and economic developments in countries like Mexico have led
analysts like Geoffrey Dennis of Salomon Smith Barney to predict
3.2 percent growth for the region as a whole next year, compared
with a four-tenths of 1 percent contraction in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are lifting the veil from a period in which Latin
America was oversold,'' said Edmar Bacha, the New York-based
strategist for Banco BBA Creditanstalt. ``What they're seeing,
minus the threat of higher Fed rates, is a region looking a lot
better next year than this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best examples of this newfound optimism is Chile, a
nation that was hit hard by the economic crisis suffered by some of
its Pacific Rim trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by lower domestic interest rates and a recovery in the
price of copper, Chile's economy is expected to grow 5.5 percent in
2000, compared with a shrinkage of half a percent this year. And
coming presidential elections are not viewed as risky, since the
two leading candidates are pledging a similar blend of centrist
economic policies, said Neil Dougall, an economist with Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, politics is also generating optimism over the economy
with concern easing over the possibility of disruption resulting
from primary presidential elections. And strong growth in the
United States, Mexico's main export market, contributes to positive
sentiment over the country's economy, which is increasingly viewed
by economists as more linked to its northern neighbors than to the
rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while prospects look better in countries like Chile and
Mexico, it is in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, where
most attention is focused. So perhaps it is no small wonder that
the rally lifting most Latin markets is nowhere as dramatic as it
is here.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Brazil's currency, the real, was getting hammered
as speculators who had been betting on weakness pushed the real
beyond two to the dollar for the first time in eight months. As
alarm grew over the real's decline, Brazil successfully sought
greater flexibility to defend the currency by using money from the
International Monetary Fund, which has oversight over such matters
because it is financing an economic aid package to the country. The
real began to strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there was much less pressure on the bank to
raise rates to attract foreign capital,'' said Carlos Novis
Guimaraes, head of Latin American investment banking at Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   With the likelihood larger that Brazil might lower rates rather
than raise them, a fresh assessment emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits, like those from eucalyptus producers
benefiting from higher pulp prices and banks prospering from
prescient investment strategies, suggested an economic recovery
stronger than once thought. Most analysts are predicting Brazil's
economy will grow 3 percent in 2000, compared with zero percent
expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors remain cautious about the potential for rebound
in Brazil and the rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   While shocks like Ecuador's moratorium on foreign bonds seem to
have been absorbed without causing much damage to investor
sentiment, other factors lead some investors to remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, interest rate increases abroad, like those
announced Thursday by the European Central Bank and the Bank of
England, could undermine Latin America's stock rally. Reticence by
Brazil's Congress to approve government proposals to simplify the
tax system and trim pension spending may also raise a red flag.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, an important shift in sentiment seems to be taking
place. ``It appears that global risk aversion is lowering after the
collapses predicted by some people never materialized,'' said
Ernest Brown, senior Latin America economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.

<P>
   PACOIMA _ During the day, the neighborhood of modest homes
surrounding Montague Charter Academy is quiet. Except for a few
grandparents and mothers with babies, the adults are at work, many
laboring at two or three jobs to support large families.
</P>
<P>
   But on the school grounds, it's a different scene: Children's
voices ring out in glee during a game of kickball on the
playground, in excitement in the classroom, at seeing a science
project work.
</P>
<P>
   This school and the neighborhood around it are in one of the
poorest areas of the San Fernando Valley. But the two are
intertwined by respect and hope for the future, and are rich in
things that can't be measured by physical possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd describe this school as `family,''' said art teacher
Sylvia Villarreal, who began to volunteer at Montague when her
daughter was a student here, and was encouraged by the staff to
pursue a career in art. ``The kids say they go to a special school.
And they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Montague, which teaches pre-kindergarteners through
fifth-graders, isn't the kind of school where parents venture onto
campus strictly for back-to-school night and the Christmas pageant.
</P>
<P>
   There are classes for parents learning English, classes for
newly recruited foster parents and classes for those working toward
U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends are a time for on-campus dance and music classes and
recitals, and the library and computer lab are open for parents to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs are found for out-of-work parents. Families with problems
are offered counseling. School staff members help fill out forms
ranging from welfare applications to naturalization papers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the school ``doing for'' the parents. The
parents give more than their share back, helping to keep the
grounds clean and blooming, distributing surplus federal food and
used clothing for others in need.
</P>
<P>
   And parent volunteers are daily fixtures at Montague, says Vista
volunteer coordinator Nina Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 1,200 kids _ most families have three or four here at
one time _ we have a roster of 256 parent volunteers. We're trying
for 300 volunteers, which would mean that virtually every parent
with a child here volunteers time,'' said Nelson, parent of seven
Montague students and graduates and herself a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of become the center of the community,'' said
principal Diane Pritchard. ``There are no theaters here. There are
no libraries. There's no place else to go. So people come to the
school. It's a balancing act between giving all this attention to
families and providing instruction for the children. But a
successful family unit makes a healthy student.''
</P>
<P>
   Montague wasn't built to be a community center. Thrown up in
1956 as postwar babies reached school age, it still has the same
look as other schools of that era, enlivened only recently by
small, verdant gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Off Laurel Canyon Boulevard just inside Pacoima's border with
Arleta, the neighborhood around the school is surrounded on three
sides by industrial buildings. A few blocks to the northeast is
Whiteman Air Park. Around the corner is a small strip of stores
that donate food and merchandise for campus events, and provide
jobs for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Of Montague's 1,200 students, 96 percent are Latino, 2 percent
are white, 1 percent Asian and 1 percent African-American.
Seventy-three percent speak limited English. And 95 percent of
students' families have incomes below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents are wonderful people, but they're poor,''
Pritchard said. ``But there's such a thirst for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a thirst that was born of hard times in another country,
where young people were forced to drop out of school so they could
work to help support their families.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grader Armando Contreras, whose dad is a tree trimmer,
said it's hard not to goof off, but his father reminds him,
``You've got to study to get a good job for your future.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sandra Cordova, who began baby-sitting for her 1-year-old
cousin when she was only 5 years old herself, remembers the look on
her delivery man father's face when he came home from citizenship
exam classes. ``He just looked so happy,'' the 10-year-old said.
``He told me, `If you're a citizen, you can have a home, a good job
and take care of your family.'''
</P>
<P>
   Otilia Flores, a dressmaker who could neither read nor write in
English or Spanish, when her youngest son enrolled at Montague
seven years ago, attended classes to become literate in both
languages. Even though both sons are grown, she continues to
volunteer at Montague, providing food for school parties and
festivals, and teaching the kids to make papier-mache flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my school _ and I say `my school' because it
still is my school,'' Flores said. ``It always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always easy to convince the parents that they were
safe and respected at Montague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started very slowly,'' said Pritchard. ``It was mostly
word-of-mouth: `You need this? Go to the school. You want to know
this? Go to the school. Yes, you can trust them.' We'd tell them,
`We don't care if you're here illegally, or what your status is; we
just want to help your children.' ... We'd convince one person it
was OK to come to the school, and she'd tell another and another.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to establish that trust are the
English-as-a-second-language classes taught by instructor Karin
Portman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class teaches so much more than English,'' Pritchard
said. ``I heard two men, two of our parents, talking the other day
while they were waiting for their children. One was bragging that
since his wife learned English, she's handling the family's budget
and writing all the checks, paying all the bills. He was so proud
of her.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the parents and students who appreciate the
school, which has had independent charter status for only three
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Montague received the Above and Beyond Award from the
city of Los Angeles for excellence in professional development, and
has earned a slew of other awards and grants, including being named
one of America's 100 Outstanding Schools by the Target stores.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente has adopted the school, providing everything
from health-based games to complete human skeletons for biology
classes, said Mei Ling Schwartz, the HMO's director of health
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we saw what they were doing at Montague, we decided this
school is a part of our community and we should do whatever we can
for it,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've been able to do at Montague is unbelievable,''
said Marian Baran, director of Mission College's foster-care
education program, who's working with Pritchard to get a grant to
help families get off welfare. ``This is the way education should
be done all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard, a no-nonsense woman in her 50s, credits the community
for the achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But few administrators work harder. Pritchard is in her office
by 4:30 a.m. most mornings. She pops into classrooms unannounced;
in one kindergarten class, her blue print dress prompts a
discussion of flowers and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   The principal isn't alone in her attempts to make life easier
for the families of Montague's students.
</P>
<P>
   School nurse Toni Braun works with parents, Childrens Hospital,
and state and county health departments to get the school's many
handicapped students physical therapy, walkers and wheelchairs. She
also arranges for free or low-cost eye exams and glasses, dental
care, and counseling services for children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one class, we were talking about hygiene, and we found that
95 percent of students didn't own a toothbrush,'' Braun said. A
plea to Colgate yielded hundreds of toothbrushes, enough for every
child in school.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Schiff, the school psychologist, counsels entire families
about alcoholism, domestic violence, coping with poverty and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   If families are hungry, she puts them in touch with a food bank.
If they need transportation, she'll make sure they know where to
catch the bus or find a cheap used car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have families living in garages, and that affects how a
child does at school,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a matter of solving just one problem,'' she added.
``We try to solve all we can. Sometimes people don't even know
where to begin, so we steer them in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Families also get help from Isabel Rayas, whose own four
children, ranging in age from 13 to 20, attended Montague. She
began working at the school as a volunteer in the cafeteria in
1990. Pritchard and others encouraged her to go to college, and now
she works as director of the school's parents center while pursuing
a degree in education and psychology at Mission College.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Rayas has found paying jobs for 10 parents by
helping the unemployed fill out applications, pick out an interview
outfit, run through a mock interview. She helps them make an
interview appointment, then follows up with both the company and
the interviewee.
</P>
<P>
   That process itself is often an eye-opener, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they try to fill out an application, they can see whether
their English is adequate,'' Rayas said. ``Often, they decide they
need to learn more, and sign up for an ESL class.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that's how the Montague family weaves together education,
work and lifestyle both on- and off-campus. It's an effort at
fulfilling a vision, though even the most devoted and determined
agree that the neighborhood is not a dream come true _ not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard would love to start a community theater for parents,
to open a preschool for children as young as 2 or 3 where parents
could learn child-care skills, to devise a program to help families
who rent get low-cost home loans, to rip up the wide swath of
blacktop in the rear of the campus and replace it with a grassy
soccer field for the whole community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our frustrations,'' Pritchard said. ``But we do what
we can, with a lot of help from the community.'' &UR;  &QL;

 &HT;    Messianic movement growing with approach of Y2K
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's Saturday morning at Temple Aytz
Chayim in suburban Boca Raton and a Torah, cloaked in blue velvet
embroidered with a yellow Lion of Judah, is resting on the rabbi's
shoulder as he parades through his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Men in yarmulkes and women in long skirts lean forward to press
their prayer books into the sacred scrolls and then reverently kiss
the pages.
</P>
<P>
   It's quintessential Judaica. Enough tradition to make any
bubbie's heart sing.
</P>
<P>
   And then the rabbi opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of Yeshua the messiah,'' Rabbi Ira Brawer intones.
``Take us into the land of Israel. Let every rabbi be a Messianic
rabbi, let every synagogue be a Messianic synagogue. Let every
Jewish person's heart be touched.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer couldn't be further from the wishes of the Jewish
community, which has long regarded Messianic Jews with disdain. But
while Aytz Chayim and hundreds of other Messianic congregations
like them have long been monitored _ and ignored _ by the
mainstream Jewish community, millennial evangelism has exacerbated
tensions and started to prompt confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Jews for Jesus and other Messianic or ``Hebrew Christian''
groups (as mainstream Jews call them) proclaim they are Jews who
have accepted Yeshua _ Greek for Jesus _ as their savior. They
argue that Jesus, himself a Jew, never intended to establish a new
religion but to fulfill the prophecies of the first five books of
Moses. Accepting Jesus does not make Messianics Christian, they
say. What it makes them are ``completed Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, they reach out as missionaries to their ``unsaved''
Jewish cousins because they believe that without accepting Jesus,
nonbelievers will burn in hell.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Jewish organizations and even rabbinical schools
have taken to producing anti-Hebrew Christian videos and mailing
them to synagogues across the country. Groups such as Jews for
Judaism are turning up at Hebrew Christian conventions trying to
win back converts, and for the first time in its history, the
Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County this year financed a $22,000
lecture series to warn area Jews _ particularly teens _ that Jews
who believe in Jesus are not really Jews at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are deceitful,'' said Aaron Schwarzbaum, the director of
an anti-missionary program who will speak at more than a dozen area
synagogues this month through May about Messianics. ``They present
themselves as Jews but they are not Jews and to say they are is a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the emphasis on salvation and the messiah that mainstream
Jewish rabbis point to when they explain why Hebrew Christians are
Jewish neither in practice nor theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Christianity, the basic tenet is that if you believe in
Jesus as your savior then your actions will follow from that
belief,'' said Rabbi Daniel Levin of Temple Beth El in Boca Raton.
``The key thing is the belief in the messiah. But Judaism looks at
it from a completely different perspective, that everyone is born
with a clean slate and your life is what you make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where Jews often define themselves by what they are
not _ what they don't eat, what they don't celebrate _ Messianic
Jews can appear to be unsettling theological oxymorons. Said
Schwarzbaum: ``They have misappropriated Jewish symbols to
perpetrate deceit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Messianic religious practices _ which vary widely within
the community _ are a hybrid of traditions and symbols. Babies, for
instance, are both circumcised and baptized. Children are bar
mitzvahed, but their bar mitzvah speech may include testimony of
their salvation through Jesus. Weddings are conducted under a
chupah but instead of reading the ketubah (Jewish wedding
contract), Yeshua's divinity is proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   To Messianic Jews, these are symbols of integrating their
salvation and their birthright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of the Jewish community,'' Brawer told his
following last month during his sermon. ``Whether the rest of the
Jewish community likes it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from liking it, observant Jews consider Hebrew Christians to
be traitors. While an enemy may have honor, traitors, by
definition, have none.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a story in the Talmud about the forest,'' says
Schwarzbaum. ``The story goes that if the forest didn't give up the
wood for the axe handle it wouldn't be in danger from the axe.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that the greatest danger the Jewish community
faces is from within.

   Schwarzbaum, a square-shouldered 6-footer with a touch of gray
in his beard, goes on to call the Messianics worse than Nazi
collaborators. ``By doing what they are doing, they are spitting on
the graves of the 6 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what they think of us, but who are they?'' asks
70-year-old Seymour Kurtzer, a Delray Beach resident who was a
practicing Conservative Jew until he accepted Jesus at the age of
50. ``The only reason they make such a stink is because they feel
threatened. When I accepted Jesus into my life I found peace. I
speak to him every day. None of what they say matters.''
</P>
<P>
   SECOND COMING
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the modern Hebrew-Christian movement date back to
the early days of Zionism. Evangelical Christians believed that
after the Jews returned to Israel, the Battle of Armageddon would
be fought and Christ would return to earth for the second time.
Jews ``saved'' before the End Times would be spiritual role models
during the new millennium. By the 1930s, nearly every city in
America had movements that would eventually evolve into the Hebrew
Christian movement.
</P>
<P>
   The movement picked up supporters during the late '60s and early
'70s and has enjoyed a resurgence as Y2K draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Jews for Jesus launched a million-dollar media campaign this
summer to convince as many Jews as possible to accept Jesus as
their savior. In full-page advertisements in newspapers and
magazines across the country, David Brickner, the executive
director of the San Francisco-based group, asks Jews to read his
literature before Judgment Day: ``Let's face it, this would be a
really bad time to finally realize Jesus is the Messiah ... if
you're Jewish, you can't afford not to read it.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which was organized by a full-time staff of 150
and financed through the group's $13 million budget, also ran on
billboards and in magazines. It resulted in 20,000 copies of the
book ``Future Hope'' being mailed out to interested people across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exist to make the message of Jesus an unavoidable issue,''
Brickner said.
</P>
<P>
   INCREASING AWARENESS
</P>
<P>
   Though there are only about 150 Hebrew Christians in Palm Beach
County and they only sporadically evangelize through organized
pamphlet drives, the level of discomfort, and perhaps paranoia,
within the Jewish community, has steadily increased.
</P>
<P>
   Hyla Levine and Robin Isaacson are co-directors of the Palm
Beach County branch of Torah Life and Living, the organization
dedicated to anti-missionary work that Aaron Schwarzbaum started in
North Miami. Horrified by Hebrew Christian outreach in their
community, they pass along stories about missionaries who
supposedly stand in the bagel aisle in suburban Boca Raton
supermarkets pitching Jesus. Missionaries who tried to join Jewish
youth basketball leagues to evangelize. A missionary who worked as
an office temp at a temple and stole a membership list. And even a
high profile rabbi who is considered ``a little too sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   More thoroughly documented are cases handled by Phillip
Abramowitz, head of the Task Force on Missionaries and Cults within
the Jewish Community Relations Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Hadassah _ the international organization of
Jewish women _ changed its bylaws when several chapters around the
country discovered their presidents were Hebrew Christians,
Abramowitz said. The board of rabbis in Toronto banned Hebrew
Christians from being buried in Jewish cemeteries after several
tried to buy plots. And synagogue members in upstate New York
expelled their newly elected president after it was learned that he
was a Messianic Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be the fifth arm of Judaism,'' Abramowitz said.
``And they're growing.''
</P>
<P>
   How fast they're growing is difficult to pin down because Hebrew
Christians are splintered into dozens of branches, among them: Jews
for Jesus, Hear O Israel Ministries, Lamb and Lion Ministries, The
Messianic Vision, Friends of Zion and Chosen People's Ministries.
But according to Jewish watchdog organizations that track the
Messianic movement, the number of Hebrew Christian synagogues in
the United States has doubled to about 400 in the past 15 years and
the number of members has grown to as many as 100,000. About half
of that membership were born Jewish and the other half were born
Christian but joined because they were attracted to the Jewish
style of worship.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brickner, about 5,000 Jews accept Jesus as their
savior every year. Jewish organizations place that number at closer
to 1,000. To put either figure in perspective, there are about 6
million Jews in America and about 5,000 gentiles who convert to
Judaism every year, according to Dru Greenwood, director of
outreach for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are small, the Jewish community says the
threat to Judaism is growing: Well-organized and well-heeled
mainstream religious groups like the Southern Baptists have
publicly stated it is their goal to convert as many Jews as
possible. Jews for Judaism, a Maryland based Anti-Messianic
organization, says evangelical organizations funnel $250 million a
year into messianic congregations.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN TONE
</P>
<P>
   In tone, at least, Messianic worship has more in common with the
evangelical churches that finance many of them than the relatively
staid Jewish services from which their liturgy and scripture
originates.
</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday morning, Rabbi Brawer implores the Holy Spirit to
touch each of the approximately 50 congregants. Typically, a few
break into tears, overcome, they say, at the feelings of joy Jesus
has brought into their lives. Faith healings and speaking in
tongues are part of some services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me really admires the faith that some of them hold,''
said Carol Harris-Shapiro, a reconstructionist rabbi who just
published ``Messianic Judaism'' after spending several years
observing a large Messianic congregation in Philadelphia. ``I
really liked how they tried to make God a part of their everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   What Harris-Shapiro found in her research was that many Jews who
joined a Messianic congregation were not well-educated about
Judaism and that many were looking for acceptance in a community
that did not stress secular achievement, as the Jewish community
often does.
</P>
<P>
   But for the majority of the Jewish community Messianic Jews are
a nonissue, Harris-Shapiro said. Or they should be. The Jewish
community is losing many more Jews to apathy and assimilation than
evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messianic Judaism has become kind of a scapegoat,'' she said.
``It's kind of ironic. The best protection against messianic
evangelism is this apathy, but it's a double-edged sword. We have
become inoculated against Christianity, but we have also become
inoculated against Judaism.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Bread Co. reveals growth plans
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Bread Company Bakery Cafe has embarked
upon an aggressive franchising effort to double its size within the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based restaurant franchisor plans to open about 60
new stores and have $131 million in systemwide sales by the end of
2000, said Jerry Couvaras, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the new restaurants will be in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as the baby boomer alternative to fast
food,'' Couvaras said. ``There's incredible demand for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sites currently under development, Couvaras said
the privately-held company is considering going international,
possibly in the United Kingdom and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The new stores also will have a contemporary look with a
revamped black-and-gold logo.
</P>
<P>
   Couvaras said he expects to invest as much as $3 million in
baking equipment within the next six to nine months in the
company's main operation, which supplies all of its stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Bread Company also will set up its own
100,000-square-foot distribution center in the metro area that will
add another $30 million in revenue to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to begin its distribution operation from its
existing Smyrna facility and to open another facility by next April
that initially will employ about 25 workers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Atlanta Bread Company was named in Entrepreneur
magazine as one of the fastest-growing franchises. The company was
started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Couvaras and his brother, Basil, came on as joint venture
franchise partners in 1994, opening their first restaurant in
Norcross. Two years later, the Couvarases, originally from South
Africa, bought the company, which specializes in soups, salads,
breads and sandwiches. Within a year, it went from 17 to 33
restaurants. Currently, there are 65 bakery cafes in 15 states, and
the company expects to have $55 million in revenue for 1999.

`MONONOKE': EPIC ECOLOGICAL PARABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an insight into precisely how stunning Hayao Miyazaki's
rich, animated epic ``Princess Mononoke'' is, you need only
consider how little of it leaves you once you've left it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loaded spectacle married to a narrative odyssey with
Tolkien, Homer and David Lean on its mind, overseen by a man who
for all practical purposes is deeply committed to the integration
of Japanese history, ideology, mythology, ecology and faith into an
action fantasia that makes ``cartoon'' sound condescending and
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed from Japanese into English, Mononoke is a classic quest
parable about a prince named Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup)
looking for a cure for his potentially fatal chemical curse brought
on by the angry boar-god _ and also to discover what set off the
boar-god, which is crawling with hosts of undulating scarlet worms.
</P>
<P>
   His search brings him to remote, embattled forest and mining
communities, where two fearless women head the opposing sides.
</P>
<P>
   One, Princess Mononoke (Claire Danes), often called San, runs
with the wolves; the other, Lady Eboshi (voiced by Minnie Driver),
presides over the construction of Iron Town, which wants to serve
as a massive haven for outcasts like Ashitaka, whose people were
evicted from their native land.
</P>
<P>
   Both women face flabbergastingly difficult moral, personal and
political quandaries the range and subtlety of which make their
Disney counterparts look like the glorified Spice Girls they are.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki, who also wrote the film (the English translation was
done by Neil Gaiman) and is best know here for 1988's ``My Neighbor
Totoro,'' raises all sorts of questions while remaining viscerally
accessible to any audience.
</P>
<P>
   The majestic pageant of images _ no sylvan landscape has been
this indelibly, dimensionally alive _ is inextricably welded to the
multifold spiritual/ecological questions about the future that
Miyazaki is contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   Can industry provide shelter for spirit? Amid the need to
evolve, can we transcend our techno-civilization to even begin to
approach an answer?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions you wish a self-proclaimed mythmaker like
George Lucas would've been more willing to confront when he was
parsing out ``Phantom Menace'' licensing deals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Armed with consumer information from the Internet, Duane Walton
walked into car dealerships in the Orlando, Fla., area expecting to
negotiate a great deal on a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Walton, of nearby Apopka, says he encountered a rerun
of other car-buying experiences over the years: He said he was
pressured, stonewalled and made to feel powerless throughout the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like every dealer in town was jerking me around,'' said
Walton, a manager at a computer repair and data entry company. So
he went back to the Internet, but not simply for information. He
was ready to buy his car on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first place I went to not only had a lower price, but on a
better version of the car,'' he said. Walton declined to say how
much he saved in all on his Toyota Sienna, but said the monthly
payments ended up being ``$75 less than what I could get in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry analysts say Walton typifies a trend in car
buying: Consumers begin the process by going to the Internet for
information, then head for a local dealer ready to make an informed
choice, only to return to the Net to make their purchase _
sometimes for hundreds or thousands of dollars less than a dealer's
best offer. J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the big market-research
company, estimates that in the first quarter of next year, 55
percent of new-car buyers will be using the Internet before making
a deal, up from 15 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a car on the Internet usually does not cut out the dealer
_ just many of the consumer's frustrations and a lot of the
dealer's profit margin. Most auto Web sites work on a referral
system; shoppers answer questions about the type of cars they are
looking for and provide contact information. Leaving a telephone
number is a must.
</P>
<P>
   That information is passed to the closest dealership that
belongs to the Web site's referral network. Some sites charge
membership fees to dealers; others do not. And the dealers agree to
terms that also vary widely, with some, but not all, required to
stick to the prices they quote on line.
</P>
<P>
   Many dealers sign up with several Web services. As a result, if
you request bids on the same car from different Web sites, you are
likely to receive at least identical bids from a single dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web services say they make the bulk of their income _ about
70 percent _from referrals to local dealers, with the other 30
percent or so generated by selling advertising on their sites.
Chris Denove, director of consumer operations at J.D. Power, says
there is no industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sites make most of their money from dealer fees,'' Denove
said. ``Others do well by getting revenue from advertising on their
Web site and/or the sale of after-market products to car buyers.
Some, like Priceline, charge consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, within 48 hours of requesting a bid, a buyer will get
a call from a member dealership quoting a price. Many dealers have
a separate office for Internet requests or assign them to their
fleet-sales office, and respond with a bid within hours. Of 10
recent requests for bids in the New York metropolitan area, 7 were
answered the same day.
</P>
<P>
   For many shoppers, buying through the Web offers convenience and
a way to avoid high-pressure sales tactics. And they also ``often
save more money than those going to dealerships,'' Denove said. He
added that Web services can expedite the whole car-buying process.
If you start off knowing which car you want to buy, you can seal
the deal, sign the papers and, depending on availability, have a
new car in the garage in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary to show up at the dealership only at the very
end of the transaction, for the hour or less that it takes to sign
the papers and drive away.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to buy her two teen-agers cars of their own,
Meryl Stern, a Los Angeles social worker, returned to the
dealership where she had purchased her last car. But she says she
found no room for negotiating. ``There just seemed like there were
too many middlemen in the process to get the price I wanted,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stern took her shopping online. In less than a week, her
children were driving Hondas _ one a Prelude, the other an Accord.
``All we had to do was go to the dealership to sign the papers and
we were out of there in half an hour,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites are trying to eliminate the need for even that
wrap-up visit to the dealer _ CarsDirect.com will arrange delivery
of a car to your home or office. CarsDirect also promises to stand
by the price it quotes online. Like the referral car sites, it
offers online showrooms and research services and has relationships
with local dealers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But CarsDirect.com searches out the dealership that most closely
matches the price it has quoted. What's more, it says it sticks to
that price even if it has to fork over cash, in the form of a
rebate to the dealership, to deliver the car as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a car exists and is available, we will stick to our
price,'' said Lou Weiss, vice president of marketing for
CarsDirect. ``We have extensive research telling us what the market
rate is, and we price our vehicles at the lowest end of that
spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   CarsDirect's chief executive, Scott Painter, says the company
set its prices so that 90 percent of consumers paid more for the
same car. Moreover, the site can process the loan application and
arrange delivery of the car to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Marc McConnel of Santa Fe, N.M., leased a Ford Explorer this way
through CarsDirect. Because he leases cars for his business and had
chosen Explorers in the past, he did not need to test-drive the
latest model.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually took longer to return the old car than it did to
buy the new one,'' McConnel said.
</P>
<P>
   All the Web services try to engage browsers in dialogue with
each other and with the site. This keeps people on the site longer
so they can be exposed to more advertising, but the interactive
nature of the information can also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Autoweb.com encourages customers to write their own
reviews of cars they have owned or test-driven. The messages range
from complaints about the cup holders (a common theme in amateur
reviews) to raves about handling and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Autoweb.com positions itself as a place not just for car buyers
but also for enthusiasts in general. There are chat areas and
message boards where visitors can talk with one another, with an
expert or even with a mechanic. Contests offer prizes for
everything from the worst commuting horror stories to the most
helpful reviews.
</P>
<P>
   CarPoint.com and Autobytel.com both have personalized
``garages'' where visitors can compare the features of any cars
they are interested in _ the practical Camry you know you should
buy, for example, versus the Porsche you dream of. The idea is to
stack up all the features of all the cars you're interested in,
weigh the pros and cons and then pick the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to selling cars, most sites offer _ or soon will
offer _ referrals for financing and insurance, often through
agreements with big companies like NationsBank or State Farm. But
CarsDirect.com offers its own financing, through a venture with
Bank One called CD One Financial, in which CarsDirect.com has a
controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   That may not prove a big advantage. Several online car buyers
interviewed recently said they would not want to arrange financing
or buy insurance over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give financial information online, and I would
never use my home phone number,'' Ms. Stern said. She used her
business line for all her inquiries and answered financial
questions only when dealing directly with a dealership.
</P>
<P>
   For John Zyzik, a computer programmer from Darien, Ill., who
bought a Honda CRV from CarsDirect.com, it was a split decision.
``I would have no trouble using the Internet to get a loan,'' he
said. ``However, I wouldn't buy insurance that way. I need a
personal touch there.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, since most car buyers are already insured, they may not
be interested in finding a new agent or studying another
complicated policy.

By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On day two of week one of CBS' new morning news-lite program,
``The Early Show,'' Bryant Gumbel jokingly observed, ``It's never
too early to have second thoughts.'' He was ostensibly responding
to a comment presidential candidate George W. Bush had made, but he
just as easily could have been addressing his own decision to
anchor ``The Early Show,'' which enters its second week today.
</P>
<P>
   For while Gumbel is his usual smooth, steady and occasionally
unpredictable self, willing to confront interviewees with at least
nominally challenging questions, he has been surrounded by a
coterie of benignly bland second bananas. Co-anchor Jane Clayson,
famous for heretofore not being famous, and frighteningly friendly
weather-shill Mark McEwen are Gumbel's supporting players,
apparently hired to accentuate just how professional Gumbel is. The
broadcast is a compendium of choices and compromises in which the
main consideration is an air personality or segment producer's ego,
with the actual needs of viewers a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Early Show'' _ its cheesy music gives it the feel of a
local program and its logo, a portion of the CBS eye, looks like an
ad for Direct TV _ is a slavish imitator of every other misfired
morning program you've seen, only sometimes played at half speed.
It's actually a positive that a fair measure of time is devoted to
segments, except that they still tend to be uninformative, so
Gumbel and company are simply taking longer to say the same nothing
that TV news is famous for. A segment promising ``A Closer Look''
at Congress's fruitless quest for strict gun-control measures was
anything but, simply trotting out typical boilerplate
bipartisanship _ Republicans saying it's the Democrats' fault,
Democrats saying it's the Republicans' fault; the report declined
to offer context suggesting where the truth might actually lie.
</P>
<P>
   Aping other morning shows, ``The Early Show'' routinely
dispatches its talent out onto the streets of New York, just
outside its studio. Weatherman Mark McEwen spends most of the show
outdoors, chattering inanely with passers-by on the opposite side
of conspicuous barricades; Clayson and even Gumbel have also
trekked outside for bits, standing awkwardly to conduct interviews
while rifling through sheaves of paper. Being outside adds nothing
to these segments and in fact detracts from the dissemination of
information, but other shows generate faux spontaneity by venturing
out where fans mingle, so this crew will pusillanimously follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   After reviews of the first day repeatedly mentioned how Clayson
had been kept in the background _ seen and not heard _ she was
thrown a bone on day two: The interview with presidential candidate
George W. Bush. She has so far shown no propensity for insightful
interviewing technique, exemplified by this softball lob to Bush:
``Tell me how, as president, you can make a difference.'' Bush,
savvy enough to have apparently read those reviews, put Clayson at
ease before the camera rather than vice versa, telling her
(incorrectly of course), ``That's a great question.'' He ended the
interview by encouraging her, ``Fine job!''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Clayson, the show's focus is hyping whatever
pop-culture event is being hurled at us at any given moment _ James
Bond movies on DVD, irrelevant but ostensibly ``fun'' magazine
lists of celebrities the editors like, Internet trends and doodads.
This isn't just ``soft'' news; it's downright flimsy. Gumbel at
least makes these interviews entertaining by being good-naturedly
truculent; Clayson interviews everyone from actors to former
members of the Clinton Cabinet in the same manner, with a wide
smile and an obviously prepared script from which she seems almost
petrified to veer.
</P>
<P>
   The show's most consistent irritant, however, is weatherguy Mark
McEwen, who apparently thinks he's doing the show for
meteorologically obsessed 8-year-olds. His forced conviviality is
to gag for _ he joked, allegedly, of a nearby department store, ``I
built a couple of floors onto that building with my credit card.''
Of a baby in the crowd, he enthused, ``Look at this little
puddin'!'' Later, he exulted, ``Who loves you? We do!'' Another
day, he described the weather as ``kinda chilly-willy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I understand that even though no human being can be that
genuinely excited about the weather, this sort of avuncularity is
expected out of weather reporters. And McEwen may even genuinely be
like this, but if so, he should be hosting a children's show. Steve
Rambo, who does the local weather cutaways during ``The Early
Show,'' does the friendly, buddy-buddy stuff far more palatably,
without ladling it on.
</P>
<P>
   But McEwen is the most annoying only because he's a regular on
the show; segment-contributors Laurie Hibberd and Martha Quinn
(yes, the former VJ) _ veritable supernovas of perky attitude _
would easily eclipse him if they were on more than seven minutes a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hibberd presents something unhiply titled ``The Hip List,'' a
monumentally shallow wade into the waters of pop culture _ or, at
least, a glimpse through the press releases that land on her desk
on any given day.
</P>
<P>
   She began by hitting us with a news flash _ vitamin C is good
for you _ then hailed, ``Move over, Matt and Ben; there's a new
actor on the screen and his name is Tobey Maguire.'' Maguire's hip
because he's appearing in two films in as many months, Hibberd
jabbered, ignoring the fact that the aforementioned Matt and Ben _
Damon and Affleck _ are hardly being eclipsed, as they have a
couple of films apiece due out in the coming months, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hibberd is the diluted version of the sassy next-door neighbor,
sporting her vivacity by pronouncing the word bargain as bargoon.
Try this one, Laurie: ``Move over, move over _ there's a new
utterly tired cliche in town!''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's not as aggressively offensive, just more pathetic. Her
occasional segment, Yikes! I'm a Grownup! is a quixotic odyssey
into Quinn's discovering that one must assume accountability for
one's actions, something one expects ``The Early Show's'' target
audience has accepted and dealt with long, long ago.
</P>
<P>
   We've gone from Motley Crue to mortgages, she declared _ no,
Martha, we haven't; you have. Maybe I've just been bitten by the
mommy bug and am just boo-hoo-ing about the big bad world, she
continued, with eyes and smile so wide and an ersatz comedic
delivery so strained that she looked like someone you'd avoid eye
contact with on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Her ostensible point was that she's rethinking her previous role
as purveyor of pop flotsam and jetsam and become a hypocritical
prude, but she pointed out, insightfully, that where children are
involved, parental involvement is vital. Duly noted.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous Martha Stewart showed up for an inevitable
segment in which she told Gumbel, ``Nothing's nicer than making
bread, Bryant,'' and home-improvement-maven Bob Vila delivered a
staggeringly dull and impossibly protracted report on how the set
of ``The Early Show'' was built. It didn't seem possible that one
could spend a twelfth of an entire day without at least a little
useful information sneaking its way into one's brain, but somehow,
``The Early Show'' has concocted a formula that manages to do just
that.

 &HT;    Day trader charged in investment scheme won't answer court
 &HT;    By Andrew Meadows
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Atlanta day trader charged by security regulators
with operating a fraudulent investment scheme involving several
million dollars will not respond in court to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The move sets up a possible default judgement against
32-year-old Mark Drucker, according to an attorney with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC will ask the court to levy fines against Drucker that
could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, said SEC attorney
Richard Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Drucker was operating a ``Ponzi'' scheme where
money is shuffled from one investor to another creating the
illusion of profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision not to respond,'' said Craig Gillen,
Drucker's attorney. ``If the charges weren't acceptable to us, then
we would have filed an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleges Drucker raised $6.2 million in 1998 and 1999
from about 80 investors living in Atlanta and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The investors believed they would receive profits of 50 percent
or more in two months or less through investments in technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the SEC alleges, Drucker shifted the money from
investor to investor in order to make his investments appear
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Drucker spent a substantial amount of the money on
personal expenses, including parties and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kadish, a law professor at Georgia State University, said
Drucker's attorney decided ``it was better to default on the civil
matters rather than have his client make any statements that could
incriminate him later.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadish also said Drucker could be indicted at some point.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office wouldn't confirm or deny whether it
was pursuing a criminal investigation; the SEC doesn't possess the
power to pursue such a probe.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the SEC would move for a default judgement against
Drucker in a ``reasonable'' period of time. If granted, he said the
SEC will ask the court to assess the fines.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Drucker faces a minimum fine of $100,000, but that
figure could grow into the millions.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is currently investigating where the $6.2 million
Drucker raised from investors is located, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, the SEC alleges Drucker used the money to host
parties at Atlanta's Swissotel as well as purchase luxury cars for
himself and friends including a $153,000 Ferrari and a $42,000
Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony in the SEC's complaint, Drucker hosted a
Fourth of July party this year on a houseboat at Lake Lanier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spending, the SEC said Drucker ``consistently'' lost
money _including $634,453 this year _ day trading stocks such as
Yahoo, Amazon.com, priceline.com, Qualcomm and Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme spread primarily by word of mouth as investors who
made money told other potential investors, the SEC said. A number
of Drucker's friends and their relatives invested with Drucker,
according to depositions in the SEC complaint .
</P>
<P>
   Drucker's assets are currently frozen pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the lawsuit as a ``relief defendant'' was Atlanta
attorney Michael Weinstock, an original investor in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock invested about $1,035,916 and received about
$1,575,514, according to the SEC. The SEC has said it does not
believe Weinstock actively engaged in the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Huddleston, Weinstock's attorney, said his client still has
a few weeks to answer the SEC. He said Weinstock plans to file an
answer, and he did nothing illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an innocent investor in this,'' Huddleston said.

PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: HHS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 49 to 48, a $314 billion
spending bill for labor, health and education programs that
includes a 1 percent across-the-board cut for spending on all
government agencies. Supporters of the bill said it sufficiently
funds programs without dipping into Social Security surpluses.
Opponents, including President Clinton who later vetoed the bill,
called the spending cut irresponsible and said money should be
included to hire new teachers. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: S-BANK
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 89 to 8, a bill to overhaul the
banking system. The measure breaks down barriers between banks,
securities firms and insurance companies. Supporters said the bill
would put in place a rational framework for the financial industry.
Opponents said the bill would create giant financial conglomerates
that would drive up costs for consumers. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

<HEADLINE>
QUIZ FOR CANDIDATE BUSH FUEL MEDIA DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a codingr)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the pop quiz heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush was awash in
embarrassing publicity Friday as networks like CNN and NBC
repeatedly aired footage of his stumbling responses in an interview
Wednesday night with Andy Hiller of WHDH-TV (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Stories also ran in the Globe, The New York Times, and on the
front page of The Washington Post about Bush's inability to name
the heads of India, Pakistan, and Chechnya during the interview.
Some analysts compared it to Senator Edward M. Kennedy's disastrous
interview with Roger Mudd in 1980, when Kennedy couldn't say why he
wanted to be president.
</P>
<P>
   But were the questions a fair test of Bush's fitness to be
president? On that, media ethicists were divided Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Amundson of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public
Affairs said that in an era of tightly orchestrated campaigns, the
questions were not only fair but necessary to learn whether the
candidate is ``attuned to foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions not too remote from many high school
students who may be quizzed on current events,'' said Amundson.
``All four of those countries are very prominent in the news these
days, and Taiwan is a huge trading partner as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Sabato, author of ``Feeding Frenzy: How Attack
Journalism Has Transformed American Politics,'' contended that the
interview was ``gotcha journalism, ambush journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We elect a president for judgment, not for his ability to win
`Jeopardy' or `Trivial Pursuit,' '' said Sabato. ``Ask him some
details about his health plan. That matters. Nobody cares whether
he knows the name of the president of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiller told the Globe Friday that he chose the four countries
``because they are areas where the next president could become
involved in foreign policy issues'' such as nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush expected softball questions from an awestruck local
reporter when he sat down for an interview with Hiller, ``He didn't
do his homework,'' observed Emily Rooney, host of ``Greater
Boston'' on WGBH-TV (Channel 2).
</P>
<P>
   Hiller, the political analyst for Channel 7, who is known for
challenging candidates with tough questions, asked Bush if he could
name the leaders of India, Pakistan, Chechnya, and Taiwan. The
candidate stumbled badly, drawing a blank on the first three, and
mustering only half of the name of Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   For a candidate whose knowledge of foreign affairs was already
in question, it was an awkward episode amplified when Bush's
flummoxed responses were repeatedly rerun Friday on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley refused to answer
similar questions during an interview with Hiller Friday night.
When Hiller asked him to name the president of North Korea, Bradley
replied, ``I'm not going to play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he considered such queries ``pop questions'' that
don't illustrate the qualities needed in a president. Earlier
Friday, in a Boston appearance, Bradley said the questions to Bush
were ``a little bit out of left field.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bush interview ended Wednesday night, Hiller said on
the air: ``While reasonable people could disagree about what George
W. Bush's answers reveal, remember: No one knows everything. No one
is supposed to. So what a test like this may tell us most is how a
candidate reacts when he's surprised and on camera. How did he do?
It's your call.''
</P>
<P>
   As with NBC reporter Jim Gray's confrontational interview with
Pete Rose last month, initial public reaction appeared negative.
Channel 7 got hundreds of phone calls and e-mails, many of them
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Hiller is known for his provocative and tough
questions,'' Channel 7 general manager Michael Carson said in a
statement. ``His interview with Governor George W. Bush was
illustrative of his ability to elicit insightful responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hiller has made waves, and news, with past interviews.
In 1984, while reporting for Bosto's WBZ-TV (Channel 4), he asked
this question of the seven Democrats seeking a US Senate seat:
``Who is Israel's prime minister?'' US Representative Ed Markey
gave the wrong answer, and candidate David Bartley was forced to
admit he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Hiller was at the center of a famous episode in
Boston politics, refereeing a dramatic mini-debate between Raymond
L. Flynn and David Finnegan. Flynn, infuriated by a Finnegan ad
labeling him a political chameleon snapped, ``You called me a
lizard, David!''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush interview is not the first time a Boston TV reporter
has caught a presidential candidate by surprise. In 1996, WLVI-TV
(Channel 56) political analyst Jon Keller asked GOP presidential
candidate Lamar Alexander, who had proclaimed himself a champion of
working families, whether he knew the cost of a quart of milk and a
dozen eggs. Alexander ducked the question but was overheard moments
later saying to an aide, ``I need you to find out the price of milk
and eggs _ right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller said Friday that Hiller asked valid questions. ``To the
extent that campaigns are real and not just TV commercials, they
are real because the candidate is forced to interact with the
media,'' he said. ``Challenges that might pop up in that
interaction provide crucial insight into who are they really are
and are they prepared for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, head of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, said the questions Hiller asked were ``a little too
obscure'' to answer whether Bush has ``an adequate grasp of the
world,'' though he noted that it is a ``good tactic'' to ask
unexpected questions of candidates because ``voters need to know:
Who are these guys? Are they somebody we want to hire for this
job?'' Amundson, of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, said
the interview ``at least adds a substantive point to a campaign
that so far has not been very dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, other media outlets thought so. By late morning Friday,
Hiller had been deluged with around 100 requests for interviews by
radio talk shows and such television programs as ABC's ``This Week
with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' CNBC's ``Rivera Live,'' and
MSNBC's ``The 10 O'Clock News with Brian Williams.'' Even the BBC
called.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller declined their requests. ``This is not a story about
me,'' he said.

HOUSE VOTE ON FOREIGN AID BILL MAY CLEAR WAY FOR OTHER MEASURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After striking a deal with President Clinton, the
House gave its approval Friday to a $15 billion foreign aid bill
that's expected to help ease the way to agreements on four other
outstanding spending measures for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate likely will give its approval to the foreign
operations legislation Monday, and if negotiations scheduled for
Sunday between Republican leaders and White House officials go
well, votes could be held in both chambers early next week on the
remaining spending matters.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote of 316-100 cleared the way for budget negotiators
to begin focusing on some of the more controversial issues that
have kept Congress and Clinton from finalizing the 13
appropriations bills needed to fund the government during the Year
2000. They include disagreements over whether to fund Clinton's
request for 100,000 more teachers and 50,000 more police officers.
Also at issue are deregulation provisions in an interior bill that
Clinton believes will be harmful to the environment and the
allotting of money for buying more public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Congress enacted its forth temporary spending
measure since the start of the new fiscal year Oct. 1 to keep the
government operating until midnight next Wednesday. Negotiators on
both sides hope to work out remaining differences by then so votes
can be held on whatever deals are struck before the latest deadline
expires.
</P>
<P>
   The budget negotiations produced little if any progress up until
Thursday night when Republicans agreed to add $799 million more to
the foreign operations bill, including $123 million for debt relief
to impoverished nations in Africa and Asia. They had previously
acceded to Clinton demands that $1.8 billion be included in the
bill to help promote the Wye River peace accord between Israel,
Jordan and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Although they caved in to many of Clinton's demands, the
Republicans insisted that the additional spending be paid for
without dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund. The two sides
finally agreed to spread out foreign aid payments to Israel next
year worth about $3 billion. The delayed payments will help save
enough money over the year to pay for the debt relief and other
international programs, such as U.N. peacekeeping efforts, that
Clinton wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had insisted on settling the foreign aid bill before
negotiating the other spending packages funding the Departments of
Education, Labor, State, Interior, Justice, and Health and Human
Services. Those bills account for more than half of the $618
billion 2000 federal budget. Now that it's out of the way,
Republicans said they hope to move quickly on giving Clinton much
of what he wants in the other areas as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give him the cops,'' said one Republican, ``and I think
he'll end up getting some of the teacher money, too. But they've
got to give us the offsets to pay for it, and we haven't seen those
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Chairman C.W. ``Bill'' Young, R-Fla., also
said that he expects remaining issues ``will fall into place rather
quickly'' with foreign operations out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans are balking at Clinton's request for nearly
$1 billion to pay off the U.S. debt owed to the United Nations.
More than half of the debt must be paid by the end of the year or
the United States could lose its seat in the U.N. General Assembly,
according to the bylaws under which the world organization was
established.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress has refused to pay the debt for
several years because of concerns that the some of the money would
end up going to international family planning organizations that
provide information on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who has led the fight against the
payment based on his anti-abortion views, said Friday that the
issue is still ``non-negotiable'' in his view, unless Clinton
agrees to language attached to the payment saying none of the money
can be used to promote abortion.

   EASTEUROPE-BRIDGES (Esztergom, Hungary) _ Here in Esztergom, the

the Slovak Republic, both eager to earn entry to the European Union
by showing that they can embrace their neighbors, have decided to
put aside centuries of ethnic animosity and rebuild a ruined bridge
by the year 2001. But the long, cranky negotiations between
Bulgaria and Romania over where to build one more bridge on their
600-mile river border shows how difficult it is for the old order
to give way to the new: the Bulgarians want a bridge on the west
end of the border to zip trucks quickly from Asia Minor to western
Europe; the Romanians are happy with the old bridge at Giurgiu on
the road to Moscow, its former No. 1 ally, because they collect
bigger road-use fees by forcing trucks to detour several hundred
miles east. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

POPE ARRIVES IN INDIA AMID WAVE OF ANTI-CHRISTIAN SENTIMENT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ John Paul II arrived in India on Friday to
meet with the Roman Catholic bishops of Asia at a time when
anti-Christian sentiment and violence among Hindu fundamentalists
is at its highest in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The political hazards of the pope's visit, which coincides with
Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Light, were made plain at his
arrival. The frail 79-year-old pope slowly descended the ramp into
a darkened airport, filled with armed security officers but
unadorned by the usual welcome banners, bands or waving groups of
Catholic school children.
</P>
<P>
   This foreign visit, his last of this millennium and the 89th of
his papacy, is likely to be one of his most challenging. The pope,
whose greatest hope for the next millennium is a renewed
evangelization throughout the Third World, is bringing that message
to a country where the word ``conversion'' carries ominous
religious and political undertones.
</P>
<P>
   During the last weeks and days, Hindu fundamentalist groups have
held protests, demanding a papal apology for massacres by
Portuguese colonists in the 16th century, as well as an end of
Christian conversions. The pope was burned in effigy in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican chose New Delhi to close the synod of Asian bishops.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Catholics remain a tiny minority, mostly ignored but
sometimes, as in China, persecuted. In India, 17 million Catholics
account for only about about 2 percent of the population, but the
vast country nevertheless has the largest population of Catholics
in Asia after the Philippines, a country John Paul has visited
twice.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope made his first trip to India in 1986, he also
encountered fundamentalist Hindu protests and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The religious and political climate since then has only grown
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of 1998, Christians in India have been subjected
to a wave of violence _ bibles burned, churches looted, priests
killed, nuns raped.
</P>
<P>
   The United Christian Forum for Human Rights says that there were
38 recorded incidents between 1964 and 1996. In the last two years,
there have been more than 150, including the murder of an
Australian missionary and his two young children in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government, which has brought in 3,500 paramilitary
troops for the visit, is worried about the pope's own safety. The
Vatican rejected an offer to erect a bullet-proof screen in front
of the pope when he says Mass at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. The
pope has accepted such a measure only once in his 21-year papacy,
at a 1987 mass in Detroit, said his spokesman, Joaquin
Navarro-Valls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When it formed a new coalition to win re-election last month,
the ruling Hindu Nationalist Party pledged to take a more
conciliatory approach toward Muslims and other minorities. But the
party relies on hardline groups for its base support, and the track
record is not entirely reassuring. Human Rights Watch issued a
report on India last month that warned about ``local and state
government complicity'' in anti-Christian attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic and other Christian missionaries are most active and
most successful in the poorest areas of the country, and Hindu
leaders accuse them of ``forced conversions,'' bribing or
brainwashing the more susceptible members of society. Archbishop
Alan de Lastic of New Delhi said his church was targeted by
political extremists because ``the Christian gospel is tearing down
all structures of caste and centuries of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defuse the tension before the papal visit, the
Vatican called for ``cooperation'' between the two faiths. The
pope, who will have a meeting on Sunday with representatives of
other faiths, including the Dalai Lama, has sought to make
inter-religious dialogue one of the hallmarks of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   But in India, he must also minister to a flock that feels
threatened and misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the recent wave of attacks on Christians was a
``small problem but a serious one,'' Navarro-Valls told reporters
on Friday that the Catholic Church in India would ``absolutely
not'' curb its missionary efforts. ``This is not an inter-religious
problem, it is a question of human rights,'' the Vatican spokesman
said. ``India, the biggest democracy in the world, is faced with
the problem of whether or not it recognizes religious freedom for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Rome on Tuesday, the pope will stop in
Georgia, a former Soviet republic, as part of his other longtime
dream of mending the schism between Rome and the Eastern Orthodox
Church. But that trip _ his second to a predominantly Orthodox
country _ is unlikely to be as rewarding as his recent historic
visit to Romania. Many Orthodox bishops in Georgia are aligned with
the Moscow-based church and reject Vatican overtures. So far, no
joint religious services are planned.

ULSTER LEADER REASSURES US ON IRISH PEACE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble,
visiting here to give the US government a status report on the
Northern Irish peace talks, said Friday a collapse of the current
round of negotiations should not be seen as an end of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be life after Mitchell,'' said Trimble, referring
to the talks being held between unionist and republican parties in
Northern Ireland with the aid of the US mediator, former senator
George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble continued to insist that Ulster's unionist majority will
not form a government with its republican foes until the Irish
Republican Army agrees to surrender its weapons. The issue of
disarmament remains the major obstacle to a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Trimble hold out much hope that the IRA's political
voice in the talks, the Sinn Fein party, is ready to make a
dramatic gesture on disarmament and break the current deadlock when
the talks resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble echoed the sentiments of Sinn Fein party figure Martin
McGuinness, who said in Belfast Friday that the talks had reached a
critical stage and could not drag on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep going on indefinitely without a loss of
credibility,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionist Party leader did offer some cause for long-term
optimism, however. A failure of Mitchell's initiative should not be
cause for despair, he said, because a great majority of the people
in Northern Ireland still want peace.
</P>
<P>
   The continued popular support for the peace process has taken
``a bit of steam'' out of Protestant hard-liners, made Sinn Fein
act more flexibly, and led to a ``significant shift in tone'' in
the last month of negotiations, Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any element in society that wants to
return to the status quo that existed'' before the warring sides
signed the Good Friday accord last year, he said.

QUIZ FOR CANDIDATE BUSH FUEL MEDIA DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a codingr)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the pop quiz heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush was awash in
embarrassing publicity Friday as networks like CNN and NBC
repeatedly aired footage of his stumbling responses in an interview
Wednesday night with Andy Hiller of WHDH-TV (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Stories also ran in the Globe, The New York Times, and on the
front page of The Washington Post about Bush's inability to name
the heads of India, Pakistan, and Chechnya during the interview.
Some analysts compared it to Senator Edward M. Kennedy's disastrous
interview with Roger Mudd in 1980, when Kennedy couldn't say why he
wanted to be president.
</P>
<P>
   But were the questions a fair test of Bush's fitness to be
president? On that, media ethicists were divided Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Amundson of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public
Affairs said that in an era of tightly orchestrated campaigns, the
questions were not only fair but necessary to learn whether the
candidate is ``attuned to foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions not too remote from many high school
students who may be quizzed on current events,'' said Amundson.
``All four of those countries are very prominent in the news these
days, and Taiwan is a huge trading partner as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Sabato, author of ``Feeding Frenzy: How Attack
Journalism Has Transformed American Politics,'' contended that the
interview was ``gotcha journalism, ambush journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We elect a president for judgment, not for his ability to win
`Jeopardy' or `Trivial Pursuit,' '' said Sabato. ``Ask him some
details about his health plan. That matters. Nobody cares whether
he knows the name of the president of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiller told the Globe Friday that he chose the four countries
``because they are areas where the next president could become
involved in foreign policy issues'' such as nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush expected softball questions from an awestruck local
reporter when he sat down for an interview with Hiller, ``He didn't
do his homework,'' observed Emily Rooney, host of ``Greater
Boston'' on WGBH-TV (Channel 2).
</P>
<P>
   Hiller, the political analyst for Channel 7, who is known for
challenging candidates with tough questions, asked Bush if he could
name the leaders of India, Pakistan, Chechnya, and Taiwan. The
candidate stumbled badly, drawing a blank on the first three, and
mustering only half of the name of Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   For a candidate whose knowledge of foreign affairs was already
in question, it was an awkward episode amplified when Bush's
flummoxed responses were repeatedly rerun Friday on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley refused to answer
similar questions during an interview with Hiller Friday night.
When Hiller asked him to name the president of North Korea, Bradley
replied, ``I'm not going to play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he considered such queries ``pop questions'' that
don't illustrate the qualities needed in a president. Earlier
Friday, in a Boston appearance, Bradley said the questions to Bush
were ``a little bit out of left field.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bush interview ended Wednesday night, Hiller said on
the air: ``While reasonable people could disagree about what George
W. Bush's answers reveal, remember: No one knows everything. No one
is supposed to. So what a test like this may tell us most is how a
candidate reacts when he's surprised and on camera. How did he do?
It's your call.''
</P>
<P>
   As with NBC reporter Jim Gray's confrontational interview with
Pete Rose last month, initial public reaction appeared negative.
Channel 7 got hundreds of phone calls and e-mails, many of them
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Hiller is known for his provocative and tough
questions,'' Channel 7 general manager Michael Carson said in a
statement. ``His interview with Governor George W. Bush was
illustrative of his ability to elicit insightful responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hiller has made waves, and news, with past interviews.
In 1984, while reporting for Bosto's WBZ-TV (Channel 4), he asked
this question of the seven Democrats seeking a US Senate seat:
``Who is Israel's prime minister?'' US Representative Ed Markey
gave the wrong answer, and candidate David Bartley was forced to
admit he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Hiller was at the center of a famous episode in
Boston politics, refereeing a dramatic mini-debate between Raymond
L. Flynn and David Finnegan. Flynn, infuriated by a Finnegan ad
labeling him a political chameleon snapped, ``You called me a
lizard, David!''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush interview is not the first time a Boston TV reporter
has caught a presidential candidate by surprise. In 1996, WLVI-TV
(Channel 56) political analyst Jon Keller asked GOP presidential
candidate Lamar Alexander, who had proclaimed himself a champion of
working families, whether he knew the cost of a quart of milk and a
dozen eggs. Alexander ducked the question but was overheard moments
later saying to an aide, ``I need you to find out the price of milk
and eggs _ right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller said Friday that Hiller asked valid questions. ``To the
extent that campaigns are real and not just TV commercials, they
are real because the candidate is forced to interact with the
media,'' he said. ``Challenges that might pop up in that
interaction provide crucial insight into who are they really are
and are they prepared for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, head of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, said the questions Hiller asked were ``a little too
obscure'' to answer whether Bush has ``an adequate grasp of the
world,'' though he noted that it is a ``good tactic'' to ask
unexpected questions of candidates because ``voters need to know:
Who are these guys? Are they somebody we want to hire for this
job?'' Amundson, of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, said
the interview ``at least adds a substantive point to a campaign
that so far has not been very dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, other media outlets thought so. By late morning Friday,
Hiller had been deluged with around 100 requests for interviews by
radio talk shows and such television programs as ABC's ``This Week
with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' CNBC's ``Rivera Live,'' and
MSNBC's ``The 10 O'Clock News with Brian Williams.'' Even the BBC
called.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller declined their requests. ``This is not a story about
me,'' he said.

HOUSE VOTES TO RESHUFFLE MEDICARE FUNDS AMONG TEACHING HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Friday to restore $800 million in
Medicare payments to teaching hospitals and to redistribute
subsidies for medical residents so that some East Coast hospitals
would lose funds while hospitals in the Sunbelt and the West would
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, 38 percent of the nation's 800 hospitals
that train medical residents would lose federal money, while the
other 62 percent would gain more federal dollars to pay residents'
salaries and the costs of their instructors over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare now pays teaching hospitals an average of $65,000 to
subsidize the cost of each resident, but some hospitals get as much
as $180,000 per resident, while others get as little as $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those payments are based on what teaching hospitals determine as
their uncovered costs of training young physicians. Thus, teaching
hospitals with other sources of income _ such as a population of
well-insured patients, a medical school, or the backing of a state
legislature _ received less Medicare money.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that older institutions, many of them on the East
Coast, generally received larger federal subsidies while relatively
newer teaching hospitals, mainly in the West and the Sunbelt,
received smaller sums.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William M. Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the health
subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, who pushed for
the new distribution formula, argued that it shouldn't cost more to
train a resident in New York than in California and that the
disparities in Medicare subsidies for residents were unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to create a blended national rate'' for paying
teaching hospitals for each resident, Thomas said. ``We have begun
the process of moving toward a national average.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a five-year phase-in, the subsidy would be
approximately the same for all teaching hospitals, with slight
variations to account for local economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching hospital provisions were part of a $11.5 billion
five-year package that the House approved 388 to 25 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would restore billions of dollars in
Medicare payments to nursing homes, home health care agencies,
therapists and managed care providers that serve Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Those Medicare payments were cut $112 billion when Congress
balanced the budget in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During the floor debate, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., complained
that the new plan for covering costs of medical residents would
``wreak havoc'' with teaching hospitals by shifting millions of
dollars among them.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Engel burst into an off-the-floor briefing that Thomas
was giving reporters and angrily shouted at Thomas: ``This kills
many teaching hospitals around the country...There's no reason to
devastate the New York teaching hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   He attacked the House plan's national average for residents'
subsidies, saying, it has ``total disregard for the type of patient
a hospital serves. There are winners and losers here and it's
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the House Ways and Means Committee provided this
breakdown of how the bill would affect specific hospitals over the
five-year period:
</P>
<P>
   _ San Francisco General Hospital would gain between $8 million
and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of California at San Francisco would gain $16
million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ University Health Systems in San Antonio would win about $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Claire's Hospital in Albany, N.Y., would lose about $1
million,
</P>
<P>
   _ Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, would gain about $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Montefiore Medical Center in New York would lose between $35
million and $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ UCLA Medical Center would gain $25 million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the state of California would gain $130 million over
five years, Washington state would gain $14 million, Texas would
gain $80 million, while New York State would lose $103 million over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said the House legislation would ``make life even
worse for teaching hospitals that were begging for mercy to begin
with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All it does is take a deck of cards and throw it in the air,''
Raske said. ``It reshuffles money all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to act on its version of the legislation. The
pending Senate bill would increase more than twice the amount of
federal funds for teaching hospitals and lacks any plan to even out
the subsidies for medical residents.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the Ways and
Means panel, criticized the House bill doesn't go far enough in
helping teaching hospitals and instead treats managed care
providers ``better than fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the drafters had geared the bill toward the
HMOs rather than to the teaching hospitals,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care providers, which have quit serving Medicare
beneficiaries in many counties in the past two years, would get
bigger payments and cash bonuses amounting to $2.2 billion if they
venture back into underserved areas.
</P>
<P>
   Also slated for increases in their fees are nursing homes, which
would get $1.8 billion, home health care companies, which would
gain $1.3 billion and occupational, speech and physical therapists,
which would get $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Knapp, the chief lobbyist for the American Association of
Medical Colleges, which represents teaching hospitals, said he
``will be working to see that the Senate version prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that Chairman Thomas recognized our issue,'' Knapp
said, referring to the effort by teaching hospitals to have
Congress restore the Medicare cuts. ``I just wish he did more and
we're going to be working for more over the weekend.''

FEDERAL AGENCIES VIE TO PURSUE WAR CRIMINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bill passed unanimously by the Senate late Thursday
has sparked an unusual struggle between two Justice Department
agencies vying for the authority to pursue modern-day war criminals
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan bill was prompted by a Boston Globe investigation
in May that revealed how scores of people have been admitted to the
country in recent years despite serious evidence that they had
participated in atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the bill has not been regarded as controversial,
and it passed the Senate by unanimous consent, a procedure by which
legislation can be approved without a floor debate or a roll-call
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is fighting
one of the bill's main provisions, which would strip the INS of its
authority over contemporary war crimes cases and hand it to the
Justice Department's anti-Nazi unit, the Office of Special
Investigations, along with unspecified additional funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has yet to take a position on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care who has the authority,'' said John Russell, a
Justice Department spokesman. ``We just think that the attorney
general should make the decision on who should take it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was founded in 1979, the Office of Special
Investigations has hunted down dozens of former Nazis and their
allies who slipped into the United States following World War II.
But INS officials contend that expanding the unit's role would be
costly and unnecessary and would amount to setting up a second
immigration division within the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   An INS official, who asked not to be identified, said the
Justice Department is ``perilously close'' to unveiling alternative
legislation. The bill, the official said, would keep responsibility
for modern-day war crimes cases within the INS but would
significantly expand the definition of human rights offenses that
can be cited to exclude or deport people suspected of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration authorities currently can take action on human
rights grounds only if there is sufficient evidence that an
immigrant participated in genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors have been concerned that the Senate bill,
which would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to include
participation in torture as a reason to take action, does not go
far enough. The INS bill would broaden the definition even further,
said the INS official, to include other crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The INS appears to be hoping to reach a compromise with Senator
Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, who introduced the Senate
bill earlier this year after the Globe reported that a Bosnian
refugee who allegedly participated in ethnic cleansing in the
former Yugoslavia had settled with his family outside Burlington,
Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and Representative Mark Foley, a Florida Republican who
has introduced identical legislation in the House, have rejected
proposals to let the INS keep its authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be OSI,'' Leahy said. ``They're the ones who
have built up the expertise. They've got the centralized and
experienced team. They know how people flee and where they tend to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is expected to be taken up when Congress
reconvenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the INS argue that the agency has already squandered
its opportunity to crack down on human rights abusers. There is no
record that the INS has ever deported an immigrant based on
evidence of a human rights crime.
</P>
<P>
   The OSI, by contrast, has stripped 61 former Nazis of US
citizenship, deported 48, and compiled a ``watch list'' of 60,000
suspected war criminals for exclusion from the United States. In
addition, Canada, which set up a Modern War Crimes Unit in 1996,
has deported 107 people because of evidence that they committed
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials have argued privately that the OSI is seeking to
stave off obsolescence by reinventing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Eli M. Rosenbaum, the unit's director, described himself as
``agnostic'' on the question of whether the OSI's authority should
be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the attorney general assigns us that responsibility, of
course we would accept it,'' he said.

QUIZ FOR CANDIDATE BUSH FUELS MEDIA DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the pop quiz heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush was awash in
embarrassing publicity Friday as networks like CNN and NBC
repeatedly aired footage of his stumbling responses in an interview
Wednesday night with Andy Hiller of WHDH-TV (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Stories also ran in the Globe, The New York Times, and on the
front page of The Washington Post about Bush's inability to name
the heads of India, Pakistan, and Chechnya during the interview.
Some analysts compared it to Senator Edward M. Kennedy's disastrous
interview with Roger Mudd in 1980, when Kennedy couldn't say why he
wanted to be president.
</P>
<P>
   But were the questions a fair test of Bush's fitness to be
president? On that, media ethicists were divided Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Amundson of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public
Affairs said that in an era of tightly orchestrated campaigns, the
questions were not only fair but necessary to learn whether the
candidate is ``attuned to foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions not too remote from many high school
students who may be quizzed on current events,'' said Amundson.
``All four of those countries are very prominent in the news these
days, and Taiwan is a huge trading partner as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Sabato, author of ``Feeding Frenzy: How Attack
Journalism Has Transformed American Politics,'' contended that the
interview was ``gotcha journalism, ambush journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We elect a president for judgment, not for his ability to win
`Jeopardy' or `Trivial Pursuit,' '' said Sabato. ``Ask him some
details about his health plan. That matters. Nobody cares whether
he knows the name of the president of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiller told the Globe Friday that he chose the four countries
``because they are areas where the next president could become
involved in foreign policy issues'' such as nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush expected softball questions from an awestruck local
reporter when he sat down for an interview with Hiller, ``He didn't
do his homework,'' observed Emily Rooney, host of ``Greater
Boston'' on WGBH-TV (Channel 2).
</P>
<P>
   Hiller, the political analyst for Channel 7, who is known for
challenging candidates with tough questions, asked Bush if he could
name the leaders of India, Pakistan, Chechnya, and Taiwan. The
candidate stumbled badly, drawing a blank on the first three, and
mustering only half of the name of Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   For a candidate whose knowledge of foreign affairs was already
in question, it was an awkward episode amplified when Bush's
flummoxed responses were repeatedly rerun Friday on national
television.

is supposed to. So what a test like this may tell us most is how a

It's your call.''
</P>
<P>
   As with NBC reporter Jim Gray's confrontational interview with
Pete Rose last month, initial public reaction appeared negative.
Channel 7 got hundreds of phone calls and e-mails, many of them
critical.

<P>
   ESZTERGOM, Hungary _ The road north from Budapest ends abruptly
at a pale green fence here in Esztergom, on the banks of the
Danube. And a good thing, too: The bridge is out. Spans of pale
green steel reach to the first pylons in the river from both the
Hungarian and Slovak sides, but the three middle pylons stand
alone. It has been thus for 54 years, since the bridge was blown up
by retreating Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, three more Danubian bridges lie in
ruins. All were bombed by NATO this past spring to cut Belgrade's
links with its northern provinces. A hastily erected orange pontoon
bridge has restored land traffic, but the ruins in the river are
causing a crisis, cutting off barge traffic and threatening to
flood the lowlands if an ice dam forms on the wreckage this winter.
</P>
<P>
   In Lom, Bulgaria, there are far older ruins; They are all that
are left of a bridge built by Rome to link its provinces of Thracia
and Dacia, the present day Bulgaria and Romania. And in the ``Iron
Gorge'' between Romania and Serbia, only a plaque marks the spot
where the troops of the Roman emperor Trajan built a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   These collections of rubble _ twisted snares of steel or
algae-covered green stones _ are metaphors for the shifting fates
of the jigsaw puzzle of countries that make up Eastern Europe a
decade after the fall of communism, and for their tangled relations
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Esztergom, the ruined bridge is a harbinger of a new
spirit of amity: Hungary and the Slovak Republic, both eager to
earn entry to the European Union by showing that they can embrace
their neighbors, have decided to put aside centuries of ethnic
animosity and rebuild the bridge by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Novi Sad bridges, and the stubborn demands made by those
preventing the rubble from being cleared, are part of the shreds
left by ethnic hatred in the former Yugoslavia, and the animosity
between the Serbs and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The long, cranky negotiations between Bulgaria and Romania over
where to build one more bridge on their 600-mile river border shows
how difficult it is for the old order to give way to the new: the
Bulgarians want a bridge on the west end of the border to zip
trucks quickly from Asia Minor to western Europe; the Romanians are
happy with the old bridge at Giurgiu on the road to Moscow, its
former No. 1 ally, because they collect bigger road-use fees by
forcing trucks to detour several hundred miles east.
</P>
<P>
   The Danube, the longest river in continental Europe is a crucial
link between the eastern and western forces pulling at
mid-continent. Beyond inspiring Viennese waltzes, it has served
both as a frontier, separating Roman legions from Siberian
tribesmen and Christian Crusaders from Muslim holy warriors, as
well as a deep-blue vein of life, carrying food, coal and people
deep inland from the Black Sea. With the canal system connecting it
to the Rhine, it lets goods all the way to the North Sea, making it
the back door to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The river has served as a border between the Austro-Hungarian
and Ottoman Empires, but ``it has always been more of a symbolic
border than an actual one,'' said Ivo Banac, a professor of eastern
European history at Yale. ``The Magyars, and Atilla and the
Germanic tribes all crossed it. You can't sidestep the Danube, but
mountains are far greater obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   It has never really been an ethnic divider except on its eastern
end between the Romanians, who speak a Latin language, and the
Bulgarians, who speak a Slavic one, said Emil Fejzulahi, vice
president of a Hungarian-speaking party in Yugoslavia. On most of
its western stretches, there have historically been Serbs, Germans,
Croats and Hungarians on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the issue here in Esztergom, where the girders
of the Maria Valeria bridge were bolted together in 1895 by order
of Emperor Franz Josef I, and named after his daughter. The
Austro-Hungarian emperor ruled from Vienna, and the bridge was a
bit of largesse to allow two of his subject peoples, the Hungarians
and the Slovaks, to commune with each other.
</P>
<P>
   But peoples don't always obey natural boundaries, and the Slovak
side of the river was really more Hungarian than Slovak, part of
the 500,000 Magyar-speaking ethnic Hungarians in the former
Czechoslovakia. While the view of the Hungarian side is dominated
by an archbishop's noble basilica, the Slovak side is full of ugly
apartment blocks erected to draw more Slovaks down-country to
dilute the Hungarian population.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of communism, in Czechoslovakia and Hungary,
conservative parties held sway. In Bratislava and Prague,
anti-Czech and anti-Slovak feeling rose, and ultimately split the
old country; in Slovakia this fed anti-Hungarian feeling, while in
Budapest the government laid claim to deciding the fates not only
of Hungary's 10.6 million citizens, but millions of others left
outside Hungary when Europe's borders were redrawn after World War
I.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, there was no government wish to fix what the Nazis had
done, no matter how much local people _ both Hungarians and Slovaks
_ were inconvenienced by the extra two-hour drive to the closest
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with new, more moderate parties in power in both countries
and an eagerness to accept the blandishments of the European Union,
a friendly bridge may well become a reality, thanks to a European
Union offer to pay half the $20 million cost.

   And yet Istvan Bindics, who has been the ferry captain here for
30 years, was somewhat saddened by the Sept. 16 signing ceremony,
not just because his livelihood may vanish, but because, he said,
he detected some of the cynicism that a new, capitalism-oriented
Europe has engendered.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidents of both countries met on a barge in mid-river,
about 1,200 people applauded on the Slovak bank. On the Hungarian
side, he said, ``it was 150 kids and nuns waving flags _ a very
forced celebration, the kind of thing you used to see in the
communist days.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the Slovak bank, he explained, were enthusiastic
because they view the bridge as a ``reconnection to the
motherland.'' But here in Hungary, the motherland, he said, ``They
don't care. There might be some business in it, OK _ but about the
people, they don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those waiting in line for Bindics' ferry, it was easy to
find the raw feelings demonstrating that even peaceful borders in
eastern Europe may be as divided by tribalism as they are by water.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Csonka, 25, a Magyar-speaking housewife from the Slovak
side, said, ``I definitely feel hated there. When I went to school
and we had arguments, even my Slovak friends said: `You don't
belong here. We had a good empire, and then you Hungarian hordes
came and invaded us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bela Szekeres, 33, a Hungarian mall security manager waiting to
make his first tourist visit across the river, said he expected
life there to be much as at home. Poverty gives easterners more in
common, he felt, than ethnic ties to westerners. Hungarians and
Austrians were allies in both World Wars, but when he last visited
Austria, he saw an infuriating sign in a border shop: ``In Magyar,
it said, `Hey, you Hungarians, Don't Steal,''' he said.
``Meanwhile, the money-changing guy was swindling from us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he added, ``we Hungarians are too nice to
everyone. The Austrians drive over our western border to shop,
because they can get things for one-tenth the price. And the
Romanians in Transylvania, when we have celebrations to mourn our
generals who were executed there, they demonstrate against them.''
</P>
<P>
   These are old grudges. The Magyar tribes invaded Slovak
territory in about 896 A.D. And the generals Szekeres referred to
were executed in 1849.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Still-simmering ethnic hatred _ brewed with bad politics _ led
to the displacement and killing of Albanians by Serbs in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province and, this spring, _ to the bombing of
the old, well-loved bridge in Novi Sad by NATO jets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rubble itself is a new source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Barges on the Danube normally move more than 100 million tons of
goods a year, and the river is lined with factories, steel mills,
rail yards, oil depots and other users. With the river blocked, as
much as $1 billion worth of business is being lost or shipped more
expensively by rail or truck.
</P>
<P>
   The debris could be cleared for about $15 million, and all the
river's users are eager to foot the bill. But Slobodan Milosevic,
the president of Yugoslavia, is insisting that it not be cleared
until NATO agrees to rebuild the bridges it blew up. The United
States and Britain, the leaders of the NATO bombardment, are
insisting that they will not help rebuild Yugoslavia while
Milosevic remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the urgency of the matter is the fear that ice will
pack onto the wreckage this winter, damming the whole river and
flooding not just Yugoslavia, but the Hungarian plains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company that owns his ferry is going bankrupt, Bindics said,
because most of its income is from Danube traffic. ``It's a huge,
huge loss financially,'' he said. ``Romania just completed a canal
system at the Danube's mouth _ that money is just sitting there.
The traffic from France and Germany can't come down. The Ukraine is
crying out. Everybody but the Serbians is interested in clearing
the river, but in their little demented closed minds, it's no
problem _ because their little local barges can get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing between Bulgaria and Romania over a new bridge has gone
on for years now. ``It's crazy,'' one U.S. diplomat said. ``The
bridge at Giurgiu is underutilized, but it's still 1,000 kilometers
of river with only one bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many truckers prefer to avoid fractious former
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria has become the obvious route from Greece and
Turkey to Europe. The Bulgarians want a new bridge at Vidin, but
Romania has balked. A bridge somewhere farther east, probably paid
for by European Union money, would draw in more money to fix up
Romania's southern roads, and more fees paid by truckers. At the
moment, the negotiations are struggling to find a compromise that
might include a hydroelectric dam that trucks can cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any of this will be fixed soon,'' said
Bindics. ``But skepticism is my middle name.''

RACING ECONOMY FUELS EMPLOYMENT IN OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's economy bounded ahead in October, driving the
unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent, the lowest in nearly 30
years, without stoking inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Labor Friday said the economy's recovery
from a sluggish September generated 310,000 new jobs in October _
the fourth highest monthly pace of the year _ while nudging average
wages up by only 1 cent an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The October report represented a sharp upturn from a sluggish
September, when only 41,000 jobs were created as Hurricane Floyd
swept the mid-Atlantic seaboard and halted commerce while residents
dealt with the devastation. That gain was a revision from an
initial estimate that showed a small loss in September.
</P>
<P>
   The last time US unemployment was lower than October's rate was
January 1970, when it was 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data, loud and clear, say `New Economy,' '' said Allen
Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in Waltham, Mass. ``The big
picture story is strong growth, low inflation withno signs of any
disturbing pickup, and a wonderfully low unemployment rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets rallied after release of the report, apparently
buoyed by the minuscule rise in average US wages to $13.37 an hour.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index, up 193 points during the morning,
ended the day at 10,704.48, up 64.84.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index also gained, closing at 3,102.29, up
46.34 _ the index's sixth consecutive record close.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists were divided over how Federal Reserve Board
members would interpret the jobs report at their next meeting to
discuss interest rates, scheduled Nov. 16. Twice during the summer
the Fed raised short-term rates one-quarter point in an attempt to
preempt inflation driven by economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing evidence of strong growth contained in Friday's
report might point to the need for a rate hike, while the low wage
figures could be an argument for standing still. Although the Fed
did not raise rates at its last meeting, Oct. 5, the board did give
notice of its ``bias'' toward future tightening of the money
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gurus are saying it's an even-money bet,'' economist
Nicholas Perna of Perna Associates in Ridgefield, Conn., said. ``I
would not rule it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. in Boston, said he could see no reason for another
rate hike until next year. Cheney noted job growth over the past
three months has averaged less than 200,000 _ a ``marked
slowdown,'' he said, from the previous quarter, when an average of
261,000 jobs was added each month.
</P>
<P>
   There are also signs of a slowdown in consumer exuberance, with
a series of other reports in recent days showing slowdowns in home
and auto sales and a softening of consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But US gross domestic product grew 4.8 percent in the third
quarter of the year, much faster than the 1.9 percent growth in the
second quarter and 3.7 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Denis McSweeney, regional commissioner of the Labor
Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, acknowledged the mixed
signals, saying: ``Sure, the economy does appear it's slowing
slightly _ but October's still a strong month.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists said Friday's midday surge in the Dow Jones stock
index was apparently inspired by the one-penny rise in average
hourly wages after September's 7-cent increase prompted concerns
about wage inflation.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, average wages in the United
States have gone up 3.6 percent, compared with general inflation of
about 2.6 pecent, the BLS said. Wages are a major component of the
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Sinai, in a telephone interview, said that there is good reason
to believe ``the US equity bull market will continue to run.''
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome is the continued tightness of the labor market.
Economists have been concerned that workers would begin demanding
higher wages, which would push up inflation. But data show this has
not happened, although labor shortages may be slowing down the
retail sector, where a decline of 30,000 jobs during October was
the third consecutive month of shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeney speculated the loss of retail jobs indicates the
industry is having a tough time filling openings as it prepares for
the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing was the only other sector to lose jobs in October.
The 15,000-job loss, however, was much less dramatic than declines
experienced earlier this year, before exports to Asian and other
overseas economies picked up.
</P>
<P>
   The services sector had the biggest jump in jobs, 215,000, in
October. About one-third of that growth was in business services.
Government added 53,000 jobs; financial companies, 18,000;
transportation and utilities, 17,000; construction, 28,000; and
mining, 4,000.

</P>
<P>
   No. 12 at Nebraska 7-1
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Nebraska lost to Texas, then trailed
Kansas at the half before awakening. Aggies quarterback Randy
McKown is playing with a separated left (nonpassing) shoulder but
like a tough guy has said: ``I could have broken my back and not
cared.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Wisconsin 7-2
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 at Purdue 6-3
</P>
<P>
   Two big offenses. Ron Dayne of Wisconsin needs 321 yards against
Purdue and Iowa to become history's leading major-college rusher.
Purdue, on Drew Brees' passing, puts huge pressure on opposing
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   No. 21 Notre Dame 5-3
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 at Tennessee 6-1
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame will need more than its usual miracle finish against

<P>
   No. 25 Minnesota (5-3)
</P>

the linebackers keep winning games.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Virginia Tech (7-0)
</P>
<P>
   at West Virginia (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tech's pass defense is generous, it won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Miami (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Pittsburgh (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   Miami must stop David Priestley, who has passed for 782 yards

</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State (2-6)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 5 Alabama (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Alabama quarterback Andrew Zow will play after spraining an
ankle, but tailback Shaun Alexander, with a similar injury, is
doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Georgia Tech (6-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Virginia (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   Tech has the nation's most efficient passer in Joe Hamilton,
Virginia the leading runner in Thomas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Mississippi (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi's good running game may not be enough here.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Alabama, Birmingham (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina wins with defense, but sometimes not easily.

   Colorado (5-3)
</P>
<P>

   Kansas State, the last unbeaten in the Big 12, must shut down
Colorado's passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 14 Michigan (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   A easy one for Michigan before finishing against Penn State and
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   No. 20 Ohio State (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 22 Michigan State (6-2)

   Michigan State tries to right itself after blowout losses to
Purdue and Wisconsin.

</P>
<P>
   No. 13 Texas (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Oklahoma State (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Tony Lindsay's shoulder is healthier, so Oklahoma
State may be tough.

<P>
   No. 9 Brigham Young (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   at San Diego State (3-5)

   If Washington wins, it will go to the Rose Bowl.

 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thomas Penfield Jackson seems a natural as a judge.
He's a big man, white haired, avuncular. But he did not seem a
clear natural for the Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is hardly a technophile; he has been known to write
opinions longhand. And while the fast moving world of technology
demanded an equally fast-paced trial, Jackson got in trouble once
for allowing a trial to go on too long _ so long, in fact, that the
Court of Appeals ordered him to rule.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers said he administered the Microsoft trial
brilliantly. It was by far the most prominent, and probably the
most important trial of his career. And he got through it winning
plaudits from both sides for the innovative procedures that allowed
testimony to be completed in less than a year, when most major
antitrust trials have typically run on for nearly a decade. What is
more, as the trial proceeded, his knowledge of the computer
industry grew; he asked more and more technical questions that
demonstrated an ever firmer grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson once told a group of reporters who happened to share a
cab with him toward the end of the trial that he tried hard to sit
Sphinx-like on the bench, so no one could read anything into his
expressions. But at that one thing, at least, he failed.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone watching could see when he was bored, when he was
captivated by the testimony, when he was angry and when he was
amused. Some judges put on expressions deliberately, to manipulate
the audience. But Jackson seemed guileless.
</P>
<P>
   While he cautioned that no one should read anything into his
questions, comments, smirks and shrugs, the tenor of his behavior
usually left little doubt that Microsoft was not winning the day,
or the trial.
</P>
<P>
   His findings of fact bore that out. And given his history, it is
clear that he prepared them with attention and care. The Court of
Appeals rebuked him last year by overturning a previous ruling in a
related Microsoft case. That was hardly the judge's only reproval
from the higher court.
</P>
<P>
   But his findings of fact are almost bulletproof by their very
nature. Appeals courts essentially have no standing to question his
judgments about the credibility of the testimony before him. And
if, as expected, the conclusions of law and verdict hew closely to
these findings of fact, the judge's eventual ruling is more likely
to withstand appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Penfield Jackson was born in 1937 and grew up in
Kensington, Md., a pleasant, leafy, middle-class suburb of
Washington with Victorian homes and its own sense of community. His
father, Thomas Searing Jackson, was a prominent Washington lawyer
who started his own firm, Jackson &AMP; Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson attended St. Albans prep school in the early grades, on
a choir scholarship. But when his voice changed, St. Albans yanked
the scholarship and demanded full tuition. So Jackson was
transferred to a first-class public high school in Montgomery
County, Md. There he played football and was editor of the school
newspaper. He has said he once toyed with becoming a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spent his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, creating a
lifelong affiliation with the school. In fact, for several years he
headed Dartmouth's alumni association in Washington. After
graduation, he spent three years in the Navy, most of it aboard a
destroyer in the Mediterranean, and then attended Harvard Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he joined his father's firm as a civil and criminal
litigator. Among other cases, he defended several medical
organizations charged with malpractice and was often described as a
tenacious litigator.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he became politically active in Montgomery
County, an area so heavily Democratic that Republicans like Jackson
were ciphers. But the flip side was that it was easy for
Republicans to stand out and be noticed, as Jackson was. He came to
the attention of the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, which
he served as a lawyer in 1972 _ and avoided any taint from
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, his name was mentioned for a possible appointment to
the District of Columbia Superior Court or the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But he was not
chosen, and some lawyers at the time said he was not selected
because of his membership in the Chevy Chase Country Club, which
accepted no black members.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that was the reason, his membership was probably
viewed as impolitic for a judge presiding over trials of District
residents, most of whom were black. But that rejection turned out
to be a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan White House clearly did not care about the club
membership. And two years later, in 1982, President Reagan
appointed him to a better position, on the U.S. District Court.
Like every judge in that courthouse, he has presided over his share
of interesting and important cases, including the 1988 trial of
Michael K. Deaver, the former top Reagan aide who was convicted of
lying under oath during an investigation of whether he had
improperly lobbied former White House associates.
</P>
<P>
   But his most prominent case, before Microsoft, was the trial of
the mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, on drug and perjury charges.
As in the Microsoft trial, he often interrupted the lawyers to ask
witnesses questions of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheeda Moore, the former model who was used to lure Barry to a
hotel room where he was videotaped smoking crack, referred several
times on the tape to ``Jell-O.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators and reporters wondered if that was a code word for
drugs, but neither the prosecution nor the defense thought to ask.
So Jackson spoke up to ask: Was Jell-O a secret word for drugs?
``No, unh-unh,'' Ms. Moore replied; she was merely talking about
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may not have believed that. In fact he had trouble with
the trial. Shortly after it ended, he complained in a speech to the
Harvard Law Forum that he thought ``four jurors were determined to
acquit regardless of the facts,'' adding that ``they obviously did
not tell the truth during jury selection when questioned about
possible bias.'' Jackson went on to say that the government had put
on a very strong case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the local paper Legal Times sent a reporter to spend a
day in his courtroom, to check stories floating around that he was
slow-moving. The reporter wrote that he took a two-hour lunch and
three ``10-minute'' breaks that each lasted half an hour. All in
all, the judge had spent 3 hours and 4 minutes on the bench, the
reporter wrote, while his breaks lasted 3 hours and 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   During the Microsoft trial, the judge scheduled a 90-minute
lunch break every day that usually lasted about 110 minutes. And he
had regular breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon, each of which
lasted about 20 minutes. Trial opened at 10 a.m. and generally
adjourned for the day about 4:20, though sometimes it went as late
as 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   So, generally, Jackson spent about four hours on the bench,
three hours on breaks. And given the highly technical nature of the
testimony, that was probably as much as he or anyone else could
handle. No one complained.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While on the bench, he gave the lawyers for both sides great
leeway to conduct their examinations as they chose, usually
overruling objections and only occasionally prodding the lawyers to
hurry up when he thought the examinations were plodding along in a
way that was of little use to him. This was appropriate since he
was hearing the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Jackson sails on the Chesapeake Bay and
reads, both fiction and nonfiction. He has been married three times
and has two grown daughters and two granddaughters. His wife, Pat,
is director of development at Sidwell Friends, a prep school in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial, of course, gave the judge more exposure,
more attention in the press, than he had ever had before. He
plainly was not comfortable with that. In 1997 he wrote a
commentary for a judicial conference that showed his view of the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between a potentially newsworthy case and the
press is roughly comparable to the relationship between a healthy
organism and an infectious disease,'' he wrote, adding: ``The
press, like all infectious diseases, is a predator. It will feed on
whatever it can find, including the host if its appetite is not
sated.''

COATES MAY BE ON SHORT RUN WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   It is only a matter of time for Big Ben. And how much longer he
has to play with the Patriots, or perhaps anyone else in the NFL,
will depend on how well he can beat the clock the rest of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates didn't make anyone in the Patriots organization happy
when he complained after the team beat Arizona last Sunday that he
(1) wasn't getting the ball enough, and (2) wanted to go somewhere
else. If Coates doesn't start blocking better, he might get that
wish sooner than he expects.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots can't trade him now, because it is past the trading
deadline. But it won't cost them anything to get rid of him before
next season, which would be the final one of his present contract.
If you listen to some of the coaches who have played against the
Patriots this year, the message is clear: Coates, one of the best
tight ends ever to play the game, is rapidly nearing the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just can't run anymore, but that's nothing new,'' said an
AFC coach. ``If I was in the same situation as the Patriots, I
would do the same thing. I'd throw to the outside guys, starting
with (Terry) Glenn. Those guys can get open faster and make bigger
plays. Coates is not the focal point of their attack like he was a
few years ago, and he is probably just reacting to that. A lot of
guys don't like it when they've been the No. 1 guy, and then he
starts to slip. It's human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   From one NFC cooordinator on Coates: ``He never had great speed,
but he's having more trouble getting open. I don't know if he is
getting beat up or what. These tight ends take a beating, espcially
the ones that catch a lot of passes. The ones that just mostly
block don't take the hits that a guy like Coates has. Coates has
never been a great blocker. When we played them, we concentrated on
stopping their outside guys. That's their offense now, the
quarterback and the wide receivers. Glenn is the meal ticket. He
can score from anywhere on the field. Make a mistake and he's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates had a ``silent'' issue when Bill Parcells was coaching
here. Parcells didn't like the way Coates was blocking, so the next
week he started John Burke, and ordered the team to run the ball.
On the first drive, with Coates on the bench, the Patriots drove
for a score. However, Burke got hurt in the next series, and
Parcells was forced to let Coates play the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Coates has never been big on conditioning. He always seemed to
find a way not to show up for the offseason conditioning program.
With his age (30), the beating he has taken over the years, and the
lack of conditioning, Coates is coming to the end. Rod Rutledge,
his backup, is a better blocker already, and improving steadily,
running routes and catching the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In this day of the salary cap, teams cannot keep all their top
players. Older ones with a big contract are the most vulnerable.
The Patriots have a dozen free agents to be signed at the end of
this season, and Coates might be shipped to free up money to sign
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   When you don't block and you are not getting any catches, what
good are you at tight end? Tight ends, blocking backs, and strong
safeties don't have long careers. They get banged around more than
anyone else if they are doing their jobs right, and Coates has
taken some hellacious hits hits over the years.
</P>

   In recent years, Major League Baseball has tried to get the fans
more involved in the game as interest in our former national
pastime wanes. Fans vote for the All-Star teams each year. Fans
voted for the team of the century. Now, why doesn't MLB let fans
vote on Pete Rose? The ovation he got in Atlanta, when he was
introduced before Game 2 of the World Series, was so thunderous it
left little doubt that the fans want to see Rose have a chance to
be voted into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig should throw it open to the fans, and let
himself off the hook. Create a ballot where the commissioner
outlines why he should not be allowed into the Hall of Fame, but
also, from Rose, a statement why he should be allowed into the
Hall. Then we all vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Rose carries the day with the general public, all this
does is allow the Baseball Writers' Association of America, who do
the annual voting for induction, to be able vote on his election.
I've got a feeling that it would be much tougher getting the
approval of the writers than it would be getting the nod from the
fans. Most fans, I think, care about what Rose did on the field as
a player, not what he did gambling while he was the manager of the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose the player is a definite Hall of Famer. Pete Rose the
manager is not. Selig can continue to bar him for life from holding
a job in professional baseball, if that is what he wants to do, but
if MLB uses the fan voting in its game, why not for Rose?

   When Bob Kraft gave his state of the Patriots message at the
fall meeting of NFL owners earlier this week, they weren't too
happy with what has been going on in Foxborough. No, it wasn't the
North Street protesters of the trailer park people, it was Kraft
paying more money to the town in a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although cities all over the nation have paid money in recent
years to bring teams to their towns, Foxborough is the only one
that gets paid for a team to use its town. Kraft brought the
stadium and the team with his own money, and no help from
Foxborough. Now the town wants him to ante up more, and some of his
owner friends are telling him not to do it, because it could set a
bad precedent.

   Greg Bednarz, the light heavyweight arm wrestling champion of
the world, is trying to go for an unprecedented double _ win the
world championships in Tokyo with both arms. Right and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never tried if before, but I like the challenge of it,''
said Bednarz.
</P>
<P>
   Bednarz is unique. He is still wrestling for No. 1, even though
he is 42 years old. Most competitors are long gone before they
reach 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like I'm competing against all of these kids half my
age,'' he said with a laugh, ``but I'm not ready to give it up. I'm
still enjoying it, which is why I'm going to try to win with both
arms while I still think I can do it. All of the competitors who go
to the worlds are either way, right or left. There are full
divisions on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Bednarz qualified for the worlds when he won his sixth US title
in Baton Rouge, La., three months ago. In the world of arm
wrestling, even though he is on the official US team, he will have
to pay his own way. Right now he does not have the money to cover
his trip to Tokyo in the first week in December. His friends at the
Weymouth Club are trying to raise the $5,000 he needs to make the
trip. I know this guy. He is a gentle giant and a true gentleman.
He can use your help.

   The Red Sox played to approximately 227,000 empty seats at
Fenway Park in 1999. At $20 average per seat that would amount to
$4,540,000 in additional revenue, if all were sold. That's why Ken
Griffey Jr. doesn't make any sense for the Red Sox right now in
this park. In a new stadium, yes. In Fenway Park, no.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has turned down $17 million a year from Seattle. If the
Sox traded for him and gave him the $17 million, they would lose
more than $10 million a year by doing it, even if by bringing him
there, he sold every seat. In a new park, with another
12,000-15,000 seats, he could pay for himself. Next year, the
baseball free agent market is supposed to be flooded with talented
players. And if they all spread out and go to different teams as
expected, then you have the NBA. Only one or two teams will be able
to sign more than one high-priced star.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, if a team's total take is around $100 million,
how many players can it sign for $20 million a year, which Griffey
is expected to command in the open market. The Sox' payroll for
next year is already $72 million with what they have on their
roster, and the team hasn't made any significant money in the last
five years. And you know, as much as you don't want to hear it, the
agents for Pedro Martinez and Nomar Garciaparra, both on long-term
contracts with five years to run, will be looking to renegotiate.

   The Bruins are quietly researching the possibility of bringing a
lawsuit against the National Hockey League Player Association.
Reports have it that the hockey union was deeply involved behind
the scenes in the Byron Dafoe-Bruins contract dispute. Dafoe
reportedly fired his agent Ron Salcer when Salcer, at the behest of
the union, suggested that Dafoe sell his house and force the Bruins
to trade him. Isn't that collusion? Isn't that tortious
interference with a contract? The Bruins are talking to their legal
counsel to find out.

   This has to be the Patriots' year. They will play the Jets twice
without Vinny Testaverde (he was injured in the first half of the
first game), and most likely the Dolphins twice without Dan Marino,
who left in the first period of their first game. (Marino probably
won't be able to play until Thanksgiving.) When the Patriots played
Denver, the Broncos were without Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe.
And in Arizona, the Cardinals were without Jake Plummer.

   Looks like Frank Chamberlin has found a home, and has the
interest of pro football scouts. At Boston College, Chamberlin
played tight end as a freshman, fullback as a sophomore, outside
linebacker as a junior, and now middle linebacker, where he posted
an astounding 25 tackles against Syracuse last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the (NFL) scouts came around they used to ask about a
couple of our other players,'' said coach Tom O'Brien. ``Now they
are asking about Frank as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Syracuse, the football players have been told for
years to stay out of Sadie's, a local establishment with a bad
reputation. But they don't listen. As a result three Orangemen,
including Duke Pettijohn from Boston, were stabbed after the game
against the Eagles last Saturday night. And two friends from Boston
visiting Pettijohn were stabbed as well, one still in critical
condition. Seems like the local gang, Boot Camp, weren't that
hospitable to the visitors from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When a Syracuse media type asked a player, who was not in
attendance for the brawl, about Sadie's, he said he had been there
twice, and both times someone got shot.

   The NFL is on a pace to set an attendance record. The games, at
the halfway point, are averaging 65,000. The owners were told at
the league meeting that 55 percent of the games are being decided
by 7 points or fewer; and 40 percent, 3 points or fewer. As for
instant replay, just 84 plays have been reviewed in 113 games, or
fewer than one per game. The last time replay was used, the average
game time was 3:11. This year it has been 3:07.

QUIZ FOR CANDIDATE BUSH FUELS MEDIA DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the pop quiz heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush was awash in
embarrassing publicity Friday as networks like CNN and NBC
repeatedly aired footage of his stumbling responses in an interview
Wednesday night with Andy Hiller of WHDH-TV (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Stories also ran in the Globe, The New York Times, and on the
front page of The Washington Post about Bush's inability to name
the heads of India, Pakistan, and Chechnya during the interview.
Some analysts compared it to Senator Edward M. Kennedy's disastrous
interview with Roger Mudd in 1980, when Kennedy couldn't say why he
wanted to be president.
</P>
<P>
   But were the questions a fair test of Bush's fitness to be
president? On that, media ethicists were divided Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Amundson of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public
Affairs said that in an era of tightly orchestrated campaigns, the
questions were not only fair but necessary to learn whether the
candidate is ``attuned to foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions not too remote from many high school
students who may be quizzed on current events,'' said Amundson.
``All four of those countries are very prominent in the news these
days, and Taiwan is a huge trading partner as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Sabato, author of ``Feeding Frenzy: How Attack
Journalism Has Transformed American Politics,'' contended that the
interview was ``gotcha journalism, ambush journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We elect a president for judgment, not for his ability to win
`Jeopardy' or `Trivial Pursuit,' '' said Sabato. ``Ask him some
details about his health plan. That matters. Nobody cares whether
he knows the name of the president of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiller told the Globe Friday that he chose the four countries
``because they are areas where the next president could become
involved in foreign policy issues'' such as nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush expected softball questions from an awestruck local
reporter when he sat down for an interview with Hiller, ``He didn't
do his homework,'' observed Emily Rooney, host of ``Greater
Boston'' on WGBH-TV (Channel 2).
</P>
<P>
   Hiller, the political analyst for Channel 7, who is known for
challenging candidates with tough questions, asked Bush if he could
name the leaders of India, Pakistan, Chechnya, and Taiwan. The
candidate stumbled badly, drawing a blank on the first three, and
mustering only half of the name of Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   For a candidate whose knowledge of foreign affairs was already
in question, it was an awkward episode amplified when Bush's
flummoxed responses were repeatedly rerun Friday on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley refused to answer
similar questions during an interview with Hiller Friday night.
When Hiller asked him to name the president of North Korea, Bradley
replied, ``I'm not going to play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he considered such queries ``pop questions'' that
don't illustrate the qualities needed in a president. Earlier
Friday, in a Boston appearance, Bradley said the questions to Bush
were ``a little bit out of left field.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bush interview ended Wednesday night, Hiller said on
the air: ``While reasonable people could disagree about what George
W. Bush's answers reveal, remember: No one knows everything. No one
is supposed to. So what a test like this may tell us most is how a
candidate reacts when he's surprised and on camera. How did he do?
It's your call.''
</P>
<P>
   As with NBC reporter Jim Gray's confrontational interview with
Pete Rose last month, initial public reaction appeared negative.
Channel 7 got hundreds of phone calls and e-mails, many of them
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Hiller is known for his provocative and tough
questions,'' Channel 7 general manager Michael Carson said in a
statement. ``His interview with Governor George W. Bush was
illustrative of his ability to elicit insightful responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hiller has made waves, and news, with past interviews.
In 1984, while reporting for Bosto's WBZ-TV (Channel 4), he asked
this question of the seven Democrats seeking a US Senate seat:
``Who is Israel's prime minister?'' US Representative Ed Markey
gave the wrong answer, and candidate David Bartley was forced to
admit he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Hiller was at the center of a famous episode in
Boston politics, refereeing a dramatic mini-debate between Raymond
L. Flynn and David Finnegan. Flynn, infuriated by a Finnegan ad
labeling him a political chameleon snapped, ``You called me a
lizard, David!''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush interview is not the first time a Boston TV reporter
has caught a presidential candidate by surprise. In 1996, WLVI-TV
(Channel 56) political analyst Jon Keller asked GOP presidential
candidate Lamar Alexander, who had proclaimed himself a champion of
working families, whether he knew the cost of a quart of milk and a
dozen eggs. Alexander ducked the question but was overheard moments
later saying to an aide, ``I need you to find out the price of milk
and eggs _ right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller said Friday that Hiller asked valid questions. ``To the
extent that campaigns are real and not just TV commercials, they
are real because the candidate is forced to interact with the
media,'' he said. ``Challenges that might pop up in that
interaction provide crucial insight into who are they really are
and are they prepared for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, head of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, said the questions Hiller asked were ``a little too
obscure'' to answer whether Bush has ``an adequate grasp of the
world,'' though he noted that it is a ``good tactic'' to ask
unexpected questions of candidates because ``voters need to know:
Who are these guys? Are they somebody we want to hire for this
job?'' Amundson, of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, said
the interview ``at least adds a substantive point to a campaign
that so far has not been very dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, other media outlets thought so. By late morning Friday,
Hiller had been deluged with around 100 requests for interviews by
radio talk shows and such television programs as ABC's ``This Week
with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' CNBC's ``Rivera Live,'' and
MSNBC's ``The 10 O'Clock News with Brian Williams.'' Even the BBC
called.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller declined their requests. ``This is not a story about
me,'' he said.

CONGRESS TO WEIGH INTERNET VOTING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress will consider testing Internet voting,
following a bill introduced Friday by Democratic Representative
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Three states have experimented with letting citizens vote over
the Internet in order to boost Election Day turnout, and California
is conducting a wide-reaching study of its effects. The ``Digital
Democracy Study Act'' proposed Friday would elevate the debate over
e-voting to the federal level, instructing the president to
determine whether it could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I have been concerned about the lack of voter
participation in America,'' Jackson said. ``At the same time,
technology is increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives. The
goal is to involve more people in the political process through
Internet voting.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the bill, Jackson cited statistics from the
Congressional Research Service statistics showing that 42.1 percent
of US households had a personal computer in 1998 _ a 74.7 percent
increase from 1994, when ownership was 24.1 percent. Internet
access was available in 26.2 percent of US households in 1998,
compared with 18.6 percent in 1997. And in the public schools,
Internet access is 81.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require the federal study to assess the so-called
``digital divide'' between black and white Americans, in which
black voters have significantly less access to the Internet. It
also would examine Internet security standards to determine whether
a secure election could take place, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has bipartisan support and seven cosponsors, including
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island. But
Congress isn't likely to address the matter this year.

 &HT;    TEXAS RACE TRACK BROADCAST BRINGS CHARGES IN WASHINGTON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A TV broadcast at a huge tailgate party at the
Texas Motorplex NASCAR track in rural Ennis is creating static at
the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William E. Kennard was accused Friday of bowing to
political pressure for allowing Motorplex owner Billy Meyer to
operate an unlicensed TV station at his track. Motorplex was
beaming the race action for picnickers in the parking lot last
April.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials temporarily shut down the broadcasts until
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who represents Ennis, asked Kennard to
lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a pragmatic, common sense decision not to disrupt an
ongoing 3-4 day racing event involving a low-power television
broadcast from a stadium into its parking lot,'' Kennard said in
statement on Friday. ``I believe this decision was made in good
faith by all those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennard also called on the agency's inspector general
to review the case after the FCC's chief of compliance, Richard D.
Lee, filed a formal allegation that the chairman violated federal
laws and regulations by failing to shut down the station
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``(U)nlicensed radio transmissions, in general, have the
potential to interfere with vital aircraft, police and fire
communications in a manner that may endanger the safety of life,''
Lee said in a formal complaint to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also accused Kennard of wrongdoing when he instructed the
FCC to issue a license to the Motorplex facility last August.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is black, said that he planned to file a complaint
based on race, gender and age discrimination at the FCC. He offered
no details on those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the Motorplex controversy were expected to come
up on Monday when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairs a Senate
Commerce Committee hearing on Internet broadcasting. Kennard is
scheduled to be the first to testify.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a presidential hopeful, issued a statement Friday saying
the allegations against Kennard were ``very serious and raise much
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I caution, we must not rush to judgment,'' McCain
said, calling for a quick inspector general investigation ``to
resolve whether any wrongdoing occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton defended the FCC's action. A spokeswoman said Friday that
the congressman ``feels certain Chairman Kennard acted
appropriately.''
</P>

NASA TO COMPLETE HUBBLE REPAIRS BEFORE NEW YEAR TO AVOID Y2K
WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To avoid Y2K computer problems, NASA is taking
steps to make sure the shuttle Discovery completes its mission to
repair the Hubble space telescope before the new year, even if it
means flying over the Christmas holiday, a space agency official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program director, said the agency
had tested and adjusted its computers and their programs and did
not anticipate any problems when the year changes to 2000. But NASA
does not intend to take any chances by having a shuttle and crew in
orbit on New Year's Day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided prudently that we're not going to fly past the
end of the year,'' Dittemore said in a telephone interview from
Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``Since we don't have to do it, we
won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the flight software for the shuttle, designed to guide it
from liftoff to landing, and computer programs used by Mission
Control to manage the voyage have been tested and certified as
being Y2K compliant, Dittemore said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA decided last spring to speed up scheduled servicing of
Hubble because some of the gyroscopes that stabilize the $2 billion
telescope had failed. Three of the 12.5 ton observatory's six gyros
have failed and the loss of one more would cause the telescope to
go into a hibernation mode for safekeeping, ending valuable
scientific observations until repairs are made.
</P>
<P>
   The agency decided to split the Hubble service mission scheduled
for June 2000 into two parts and make some modifications and
repairs, including installing new gyroscopes, in a nine-day flight
originally set for mid-October. The second service mission is set
for May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer electrical wiring problems were found in the
four-shuttle fleet requiring extensive inspection and repairs,
pushing Discovery's mission into December, officials said. Shuttle
managers decided this week to replace one of the shuttle's three
main engines, a task that they say could further delay liftoff
several days past the current target date, Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is scheduled to be fitted with its external fuel tank
and solid-fuel booster rockets this weekend and then moved to a
launching pad, where technicians will replace the engine. Managers
expect to set a new launch date next week.
</P>
<P>
   In order to speed preparations for the flight, shuttle managers
decided to use software from a 1997 service mission to Hubble
instead of writing new programs. This raised initial concerns about
Y2K compatibility, but Dittemore said the software had been tested
and cleared.
</P>
<P>
   NASA normally does not fly missions that coincide with major
holidays to give its employees time off and to avoid overtime pay.
However, Dittemore said, the Hubble mission is so important that
the agency decided not to make the Christmas holidays a factor in
its decision to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary driver is the end of the year and not flying then,
so we probably would not consider a launch date past Dec. 14,'' he
said, ``We want to have the shuttle back and done with its initial
post-flight processing by Dec. 28th or 29th.''
</P>
<P>
   During this Hubble service mission, traditionally one of the
most challenging jobs for shuttle crews, pairs of astronauts are to
conduct four space walks to replace all six gyroscopes, exchange
the observatory's main computer with a faster model, replace a data
recorder, add a new fine-guidance sensor and make other
adjustments.

REPORT CITES SECURITY VULNERABILITY AT US EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US embassies lack critical security measures, are
``woefully behind the times'' technologically, and are in very poor
physical condition, according to a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after the fatal bombings of two US embassies in
Africa, foreign posts are still vulnerable to terrorist attacks,
concluded the study by the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel. The
26-member bipartisan committee was set up by the State Department
after the August 1998 bombings at the US embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's most powerful nation does not provide adequate
security to its overseas personnel,'' the study said. Despite
dramatic changes on the global front _ including a rise in
international terrorism, the end of the Cold War, and the spread of
regional conflicts _ ``our overseas presence has not adjusted to
these new economic, social, political and security realities,'' the
panel said.
</P>
<P>
   While the bombings in Africa were the most dramatic attacks on
US installations in the past decade, they were by no means the only
ones.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents from the State Department's Office of
Intelligence and Threat Analysis, there were 235 attacks on US
posts overseas from 1987 to 1997. The assaults ranged from arson to
bombings and even attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Security was stepped up after the 1998 bombings. Some
ambassadors were assigned personal bodyguards, and physical access
to US embassies was tightened up.
</P>
<P>
   But in many posts, the embassies and their staffs are
vulnerable, said the panel's chairman, Lewis B. Kaden, of the New
York law firm of Davis Polk &AMP; Wardell.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the technology available at foreign posts is
embarrassingly outdated, Kaden said, with many embassies left with
no access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy buildings are often decrepit, the panel said. The US
Embassy in Kiev was dubbed ``the folding chair embassy'' because
foreign service officers have to fold up their chairs to get into
their cubicles to work, and some have to work in trailers.
</P>
<P>
   It would take $500 million to $600 million a year beyond current
outlays to bring the nation's 160 embassies up to speed, Kaden
said. The prospects for getting any kind of budget increase,
however, are dim, since Congress and the White House are in the
midst of a big budget fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not optimistic'' about getting additional funding,
admitted one of the panel's members, retired admiral William J.
Crowe Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is perhaps unfortunate, but it's certainly not
linked'' to the State Department's effort to persuade Congress to
up its budget, Kaden said. ``This is not a report that says, `Give
me more money,' '' but a study recommending how to improve US
presence abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright praised the report,
even though it suggested that some foreign posts were overstaffed
and that the State Department's management of its overseas
buildings was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the status quo is not acceptable,'' Albright told
reporters. ``We need more resources to support our people,
operations, and programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Adair, president of the American Foreign Service
Association, which represents career foreign service officers,
called the report ``solid,'' but he said some of the
recommendations were ``a little bit dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the management and upkeep of buildings to a non-State
Department entity would only add to the bureaucracy, Adair said,
and take away cash that should be used for increased security at
foreign posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep trying to say to people, `If you don't protect the
posts, you're not going to just lose people and buildings.' You're
going to undermine the effectiveness of the posts world-wide,''
Adair said.

 &HT;    TEXAS RACE TRACK BROADCAST BRINGS CHARGES IN WASHINGTON
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financeial (f) categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A TV broadcast at a huge tailgate party at the
Texas Motorplex NASCAR track in rural Ennis is creating static at
the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William E. Kennard was accused Friday of bowing to
political pressure for allowing Motorplex owner Billy Meyer to
operate an unlicensed TV station at his track. Motorplex was
beaming the race action for picnickers in the parking lot last
April.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials temporarily shut down the broadcasts until
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who represents Ennis, asked Kennard to
lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a pragmatic, common sense decision not to disrupt an
ongoing 3-4 day racing event involving a low-power television
broadcast from a stadium into its parking lot,'' Kennard said in
statement on Friday. ``I believe this decision was made in good
faith by all those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennard also called on the agency's inspector general
to review the case after the FCC's chief of compliance, Richard D.
Lee, filed a formal allegation that the chairman violated federal
laws and regulations by failing to shut down the station
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``(U)nlicensed radio transmissions, in general, have the
potential to interfere with vital aircraft, police and fire
communications in a manner that may endanger the safety of life,''
Lee said in a formal complaint to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also accused Kennard of wrongdoing when he instructed the
FCC to issue a license to the Motorplex facility last August.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is black, said that he planned to file a complaint
based on race, gender and age discrimination at the FCC. He offered
no details on those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the Motorplex controversy were expected to come
up on Monday when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairs a Senate
Commerce Committee hearing on Internet broadcasting. Kennard is
scheduled to be the first to testify.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a presidential hopeful, issued a statement Friday saying
the allegations against Kennard were ``very serious and raise much
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I caution, we must not rush to judgment,'' McCain
said, calling for a quick inspector general investigation ``to
resolve whether any wrongdoing occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton defended the FCC's action. A spokeswoman said Friday that
the congressman ``feels certain Chairman Kennard acted
appropriately.''

   Taking Shelter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says corporate tax shelters are
spreading out of control. It wants a law to force companies to
disclose shelters, instead of leaving the task of ferreting them
out to the shrinking ranks of Internal Revenue Service auditors.
Congressional Republicans and many companies say such a requirement
would be excessive and unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the policy prescription, the trend in the data is
clear. Growing use of shelters has opened a huge gap between the
profits that companies report to investors and those reported on
corporate income tax returns. The chart shows figures through 1996,
the latest year for which they are available.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in recent years _ in 1992, when recession forced many
companies to raise cash by selling assets _ have companies reported
more income to the IRS than to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.6 million corporations reported $420 billion in profits to
shareholders in 1996, but only $301 billion, or 72 percent as much,
to the IRS. Just 8,200 companies earned 80 percent of those
profits. &QL;

WORLD TRADE CHIEF ISSUES WARNING ON SUMMIT PREPARATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Frustrated by the World Trade Organization's apparent
inability to agree on an agenda for its summit barely three weeks
away, the leader of the group has warned the 134 member countries
that the meeting could end in failure.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprisingly blunt letter released Friday by the office of
Mike Moore, director-general of the trade organization based in
Geneva, Moore said the preparations for the summit in Seattle were
caught in a ``vicious circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Success of the talks in helping to break down resilient barriers
to global commerce is critical to the credibility of Moore, a New
Zealander who took over as the group's top official only two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said in the letter that whatever progress had been made on
an agenda was ``far from sufficient.'' He urged member countries to
give their representatives more flexibility to compromise on
disputes delaying the agenda for the four-day summit that starts on
Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, dated Thursday, was written on the eve of the trade
group's Friday deadline for completing the agenda. That deadline
was not met, and another had not been set by Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very short time remaining before the Seattle conference,
and the magnitude of the continuing divergences in positions, means
the preparatory process is at a critical point,'' Moore wrote to
Ali Said Mchumo, Tanzania's trade ambassador and chairman of the
trade group's decision-making Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have bogged down in serious differences among
countries, particularly on the issue of agricultural subsidies that
protect farmers from foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes over agricultural issues have boiled down to a test
of wills pitting one block composed of the 15-nation European Union
and Japan, Korea, Norway and Switzerland, all of which have highly
subsidized farming, against a second block made up of the big
produce-exporting countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the disagreement over agriculture, the agenda
negotiations are stalled by disputes over whether the fulfillment
of some previous trade agreements should be on the agenda.
Developing nations want delays in carrying these out, contending
that they need more time to fulfill complex agreements like those
on safeguards for intellectual property rights. Developed countries
oppose putting such requests on the agenda, saying they reopen
issues that have already been resolved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the two-page letter, Moore said he ``strongly believed that
unless governments give their delegations in Geneva additional
flexibility necessary to reach acceptable and balanced compromises,
we risk not being able to progress significantly beyond the
existing text by the time of the Ministerial.''
</P>
<P>
   A 32-page draft of the agenda has not been changed since a
high-level meeting of trade group representatives in Lausanne,
Switzerland, last week.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Moore said he was appealing ``through you to
member governments to undertake without delay a review of their
instructions to their negotiators in Geneva in order to break out
of what could otherwise become a vicious circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore released the letter, his spokesman said, because ``once
you hand it over to delegates, it will get around.''

 &HT;    thrashers to tackle hot Bruins
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He has been the president of Boston's NHL team for 11
years, the general manager for 28, a member of the organization for
38. And in a town where the Bruins often stir more passions than
anything (with the exception of the Red Sox and significant tea
parties) it's safe to say Harry Sinden has been central to more
than a few storms.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, then, the target Sinden must have felt on his forehead
the first few weeks of this season. The Bruins went winless in
their first nine games (0-5-4), their worst start since the
pre-Bobby Orr dreg days of 1965-66. Supply the fuel for the fans'
burn in Beantown were two key decisions made by Sinden in the
off-season: 1) To walk away from a $2.85 million arbitration award
to forward Dmitri Khristich, who was the leading goal scorer (29)
on a team that had scored its fewest (214) in a full season in 32
years. (The decision effectively made Khristich free agent.); 2) To
hold the line in negotiations with goalie Byron Dafoe, who was
coming off his best career season (1.99 goals against average, .926
saves percentage).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something going on around here,'' Sinden said
with a chuckle. ``But I guess it was a little unusual. Somehow, I
usually end up in the middle of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Bruins prepare to play host to the Thrashers tonight
at the Fleet Center, Sinden's life on the hotseat has dropped a few
degrees. Boston has won five straight since that horrendous start,
including Thursday's 3-1 win over the New Jersey Devils. Khristich
finally was dealt to Toronto for a No. 2 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Dafoe came to terms on a three-year, $9.45
million contract, significantly lower than the $12 million he was
seeking. It was a double victory for Sinden. Dafoe not only signed
on the GM's terms, the goalie even fired his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe did not play against New Jersey but will make his debut
tonight against the Thrashers. In the words of coach Pat Burns,
``We don't want to prolong this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said Dafoe ``has to play well for us to have a good
season.'' The irony is that his absence actually had little to do
with the Bruins' early-season problems. Graham, who likely will be
spending a third season in Providence (AHL) soon, and Robbie Tallas
and played. ``Byron couldn't have played much better than them,''
Sinden said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem early was goal scoring, or lack thereof, a
common malady on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get off to a slow start because you're losing
but you're really not playing that badly,'' Sinden said. ``That
wasn't the case here. We weren't winning because we looked like a
bad a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The early lack of offense played right into the hands of critics
who felt Sinden botched the Khristich saga. The biggest criticism
was: If Sinden felt the arbitration award was excessive, why not
sign the winger, then trade him instead of becoming the first GM in
league history to exercise ``walk-away'' rights?
</P>
<P>
   Sinden's response: ``I didn't think anybody would take him at
that price. I felt we'd get stuck with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would not have been wise, especially considering Sinden
publicly blasted Khristich after the Bruins were ousted by Buffalo
in the playoffs. Actually, he hasn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made our playoff run in the last 25 games of last season,''
Sinden said. ``But he scored two goals, and that (slump) continued
in the playoffs (three goals in 12 games). So we were really
disenchanted with him at a time when we were playing our best. When
the arbitrator made his decision, it made our decision easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another soap opera canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly: Recently acquired Thrashers goalie Rick Tabaracci
cleared waivers Friday and joined the Orlando Solar Bears (IHL) in
Salt Lake City for a game against Utah.

   ATLANTA _The Hawks came into the season with their youngest team
since the move here from St. Louis in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   They were blasted by Washington in their opening game and then
Milwaukee beat them mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning Stan Kasten took a phone call from Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time he ever called me at home,'' Kasten
recalled. ``It was unbelievable. Ted was worried. We took a risky
course of action, going young like that, and Ted was scared that it
wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said he reassured his boss, although he had some very
small misgivings himself.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1985. ``Turned out pretty good, didn't it?'' Kasten
said rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it did. Trying to find their way, the Hawks started the
season 8-11. They finished 42-21.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the rookies were John Battle, Spud Webb and Jon Koncak.
Antoine Carr, Randy Wittman, Kevin Willis and Cliff Levingston were
young veterans.
</P>
<P>
   After opening with losses to the Wizards and Bucks this week,
it's too early to know if the current Hawks team can duplicate the
success of 14 years ago. But Lenny Wilkens says he is convinced the
talent is there. It's a matter of how long it takes this group to
become cohesive and to adjust to the way the game is played in
today's NBA.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they went to the videotape before Friday's practice.
In an extended session, Wilkens showed his players what they were
doing wrong and the adjustments they must make as they prepare for
Chicago tonight at Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Wilkens said, ``what I like about video is you can
tell a player he did something, and he can deny it, because he
really thinks he's right. Then you show him the tape, and it's
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens mainly wants his players to see that they haven't been
reacting well on the pick and roll, that they are committing
violations that resulted in so many offensive fouls over the first
two games, both losses. He wants them to see that they aren't
moving enough to get open for good shots.
</P>
<P>
   And Dikembe Mutombo might think he's running the floor, but he
hasn't done it every time. He swatted away nine shots in the first
two games, wagging his right forefinger to the crowd, while his
teammates were sprinting the floor and trying to score with
four-on-five numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dikembe can be very effective as the trailer on the break,''
Wilkens said. ``But he's got to get down there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it hasn't all been bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some good things, encouraging things,'' Wilkens
said. ``But I don't want to tell them that. If we're not winning, I
can't be satisfied with anything.''

 &HT;    Chandler: Not a lot to say lately
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like his teammates, Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler
has been more upbeat this week. Nothing boosts morale better than a
win.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday's 27-20 win over the Panthers, however, the
difference is far more obvious in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Life for NFL quarterbacks is perilous, and not just because
300-pound defensive linemen and 250-pound linebackers are trying to
crush them.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in sports gets more criticism than the QB.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get too much credit when you win and too much blame when
you lose,'' Chandler said. ``It's been that way since the very
first guy played quarterback. It's the nature of the position.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't mean Chandler has dealt with it good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when we went to the Super Bowl, we did it as a
team,'' he said. ``For some reason, this year when we weren't doing
so well, (the media has implied) it was because of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who doesn't sleep real good at night when we're
1-5 or 2-6 _ me and my teammates. Not the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have gone 2-6 after last year's Super Bowl
appearance. Chandler has taken more heat than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, he cooled, at least until this week's change of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, even though he rarely is friendly toward the news
media, he would read and hear how well he threw the out pass, how
tough he had become and how essential he was to the team's 14-2
regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   This season, newspaper columnists and sports-talk radio hosts
and callers have ripped him from every angle. ``The quarterback has
always had that (criticism),'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``It's always
going to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks coach Steve DeBerg, who last year finished his 17th
NFL season, knows the drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criticism is going to happen to the quarterback when things
aren't going good,'' DeBerg said. ``It's not fair, but it's the way
it is and everybody knows it. A quarterback has to have thick
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler missed all of three games and parts of two others with
a hamstring injury. When Reeves took him out of the Rams game three
weeks ago because of flu-like symptoms, Chandler said, ``For some
reason, that took on a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems, combined with a record of injuries over his
12-year career, turned him into cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   He decided on his own way to fire back, choosing for the better
part of a few weeks to make it harder on the media to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that he realizes that his approach makes it more
likely the media will attack some more.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler sometimes will be the last player out of the shower or
training room, as if he is trying to out-wait the media and its
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take care of myself first (getting treatment),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, a lot of guys really enjoy, really need, really
like the attention the media provides,'' Chandler said. ``I don't
do a whole lot with the pregame production meetings (with network
TV crews on the Fridays before games). They've seen me play; they
don't need to talk to me. That's what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when Chandler does show up after a game, he might as
well have stayed in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   When asked after Sunday's game to talk about wide receiver Tim
Dwight's first touchdown reception, Chandler said, ``He ran a good
route.''
</P>
<P>
   Next question: What did you see when you looked at the Carolina
secondary?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four pretty good players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And this: ``I don't have too much to say about myself except
when we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   A dig at the media?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was a dig,'' he said. ``I know sometimes I don't
go out of my way to do things for the media. Their reaction is to
make things up and attack you. That's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   At practice Wednesday, a photographer tried to get a shot for
this story. Chandler worked hard to keep his back to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have (pictures),'' he said. ``They don't need any more.
If anything, I go the opposite way when it comes to that stuff. I'd
rather be totally out of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons need Chandler in the picture. They're 18-5 when he
starts and finishes a game since 1997, 5-12 otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Chris gives us the best chance to win,'' Reeves said.
``There's no question that our struggles have paralleled the
struggles that Chris has had.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Chandler sometimes will defend his clipped
answers. Why didn't he give details on Dwight's scoring play?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too long of a deal to try to explain,'' he said. ``You
have a good chance of a lot of people not having any idea what
you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   But at other times, he cooperates and gives answers so clear
that even the newest football fan could gain insight.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reeves nor DeBerg can make Chandler change his ways. But
they can offer a nudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been criticized before and I know some of the better ways
to handle it,'' DeBerg said. ``I did have conversations with Chris.
I always do. Chris is a sensitive guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His approach is different than mine. I tried to explain to him
that Brett Favre, if his team was 1-5, the heat would be on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat has been on Chandler, even though he hasn't played
poorly when he has played. His rating of 87.9 is No. 3 in the NFC
and No. 6 in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, Reeves met with him and stressed the
importance of Chandler being in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   It was meant partly as a reminder of how important Chandler is
to the team. It might have come off like a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   But his play and last week's victory have, at least for now,
changed his mood. Perhaps DeBerg and Reeves have helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question being 6-2 would be a lot more fun than
being 2-6,'' he said. ``(But) I had a nice talk with Dan and
DeBerg, and it did put me in a better frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood what was said (in the meeting with Reeves), what
they were trying to say, (as opposed to) how it came out in the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get some wind in your sails (with a win) and everybody
feels better about themselves, the team and the direction the team
is heading. There's no question it gives everybody a lift.''

O'DONNELL'S `BACHELOR' DESPERATELY UNFUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that's proved to be so Faustian, Goethe's laughing in
his grave: Chris O'Donnell agreed to be Robin in those Joel
Schumacher ``Batman'' sequels in exchange for his production
company. ``The Bachelor'' is the best his George Street Productions
could come up with.
</P>
<P>
   With the plot of a Chris Farley movie and the aimless stupidity
of a Jonathan Silverman, et al. vehicle, ``The Bachelor'' is a
shameless rape of Buster Keaton's frantic 1925 ``Seven Chances''
and an absolute betrayal of the sweet meathead lurking in
O'Donnell's guy next door.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody ought to tell the Boy Wonder his roots are showing, his
good-natured, frat-boy roots.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell seems destined to drift in the same astral limbo as
corny, blunt acting instruments Matthew Modine and Jeff Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   He's an actor whose appeal lies in his apparent innocuous
naivete _ is there another living soul who could've unleashed
Ernest Hemingway's inner Opie as O'Donnell did in ``In Love and
War''?
</P>
<P>
   He's an actor whose appeal also lies in his being surrounded by
people smarter and more experienced than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Scent of a Woman,'' Al Pacino tried to give him a lesson in
over-the-topping that never caught on. Not since Sandra Dee has
adorability been this much of a curse.
</P>
<P>
   So the sight of him playing Jimmie Shannon sprinting around San
Francisco in ``The Bachelor'' trying to persuade one women after
the next to marry him for a $100 million inheritance is painfully
unfunny.
</P>
<P>
   He has to find a bride before his 30th birthday, which happens
to be tomorrow. And his girlfriend (Renee Zellweger, forever pouty)
is upset about a marriage proposal in which he vulgarly compares
the will to marry to doing a No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast includes Peter Ustinov, Hal Holbrook and the
insufferable Artie Lange as O'Donnell's best friend, and they
confirm that if you cut this movie, it would bleed unseen ``man''
sitcom pilots.
</P>
<P>
   And the only moment of mystery comes when O'Donnell pleads with
Mariah Carey, requisitely cast as his opera diva ex-girlfriend, to
be his bride: Are we supposed to believe he could pull her?
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Gary Sinyor as though he'd gotten word that it was
going straight to USA's ``Up All Night'' dreck fest, ``The
Bachelor'' is the kind of disposable ``romantic comedy'' you
wouldn't wish on your least favorite ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Although, any one of those guys would've managed to get you to
crack a smile and any one of them would have had a semblance of
chemistry with Zellweger (hot off ``One True Thing''). With Sarah
Jessica Parker tendrils and none of her bite, she seems like the
ingenue she was before ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   She had me at hello _ now this?
</P>
<P>
   But after three years with her, Jimmie's still locked into his
Must-See TV, sophomore-year notion of marriage, which apparently is
like being a roped steed. (Each of his friends is shown running in
place then lassoed in front of a Western backdrop.) Executive
producer O'Donnell alleged that he wanted to tell this story from a
``distinctly `male' point of view.'' Uh, only if by distinctly he
means Cro-Magnon.

USE OF RESEARCH MONKEYS FUELS ANIMAL RIGHTS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started with two squirrel monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Using their brains, Bertha Madras, professor of psychobiology at
Harvard University, was able to develop a non-invasive imaging
chemical to help in the early detection of Parkinson's disease in
human beings, which is usually far advanced by the time its
symptoms emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Madras, who also experiments with new substances to treat
cocaine addiction, is one of 50-plus researchers who work with
mankind's primate cousins at the Harvard-owned New England Regional
Primate Research Center, which stands on 150 acres in Southborough,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Such research has put Madras on the cutting edge of medical
research, but also on the front lines of an escalating battle
between scientists and animal rights activists out to stop
experimentation on primates and other mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, more than 80 razorblade-laced envelopes with
threatening letters were sent to medical researchers at Harvard and
17 other academic institutions nationwide by an underground group
that opposes animal-based research.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter to the activists groundbreaking work at the
primate center has led to the discovery of an AIDS-like syndrome in
monkeys, the most important model for AIDS vaccine development
worldwide. Research there has also proved AIDS is caused by a
virus, that the herpes virus can cause leukemia, and that nicotine
is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Even animal-rights advocates who reject using violence to stop
the research have reservations about testing with primates.
Princeton University bioethicist Peter Singer, one of the
intellectual founders of the animal rights movement, condemns the
razor letters, but says many current practices of animal testing
cannot be morally defended, whether it involves a dog or a primate.
And he thinks higher-level primates such as chimpanzees, gorillas
and orangutans are particularly deserving of protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very careful studies that (such primates) are
self-aware beings with rich and complex emotional and social lives,
with mental lives equivalent to people two to three years old,''
Singer said. ``On that basis, they should have special status and
not be used for harmful experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer, whose 1975 book ``Animal Liberation'' spurred the
animal-rights movement, said, ``The strength of the movement stands
on a firm moral footing, but this action (the razor letters)
clearly shifts the sentiment towards the researchers because they
are targeted in a manner that virtually no one could support.''
</P>
<P>
   Theo Capaldo, a psychologist and president of the New England
Anti-Vivisection Society, said that her group is not anti-science,
just anti-animal research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animal research is a very big business. But animal research
has hindered better understanding of human health. It's not good
science,'' said Capaldo, who said that veterinarians and former
animal-lab researchers are on the society's board.
</P>
<P>
   Nonhuman primates make up only one-third of 1 percent of all the
animals used in experiments. What makes them so suited to that
small minority of all animal testing is the biological similarity
between humans and their primate cousins, especially in areas such
as neuropsychiatry, said Roger Spealman, the Southborough center's
associate director for scientific affairs. Primates, including
humans, are defined by their relatively large and differentiated
brains and specialized fingers and toes for grasping.
</P>
<P>
   Test tube work is simply not enough, said Madras, chair of the
center's neurochemistry department. ``Proof of principle has to be
done on animals. If you do not prove it beyond cell culture, it may
not work. It could be toxic,'' Madras said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its start in 1966, the primate center, which houses 1,670
animals that nonhuman primates who usually live between 25 and to
30 years, has been the site of studies with rhesus monkeys and
other macaques, squirrel monkeys, common marmosets, and cotton-top
tamarinds. One of seven federally funded regional primate centers
in the country, the facility houses 1,670 animals that usually live
between 25 and 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 500 are assigned to research, with the rest living in
family groups in breeding colonies, said Spealman. About 180 of
them are cotton-top tamarinds, which are endangered, so the center
preserves them and hopes to reintroduce them into their natural
home in northwestern Colombia's rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of animal-rights advocacy, increasingly
stringent regulations have been adopted to protect lab animals'
welfare, particularly primates. The primate center, which has four
veterinarians and staff taking care of the animals, has two
internal oversight committees to ensure the appropriate and humane
use of the animals in research. Monkey research is also regulated
by state, federal and private oversight organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, animal testing has decreased in the last few decades
thanks to greater use of test tubes and tissue cultures and the
advent of high-tech solutions to replace dissections in school labs
and to reduce animal use in product safety testing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no good non-animal substitute has been discovered to
replace much laboratory research, said Peter Theran, a veterinarian
and director of the laboratory animal welfare division of the
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are researchers doing terribly important research that
is justified on primates, because there are no other options,''
Theran said.
</P>
<P>
   Spealman, a neuroscientist, said that because monkeys have
similiar brains and nervous systems they are very useful for
studying cognitive function and other processes, like drug
addiction. Like humans, monkeys will voluntarily take drugs and can
become as compulsive as people in seeking drugs, which makes them
good testing models. He said that rodents will also seek drugs, but
not as strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Once the experiments are over, Spealman said that they are able
to detoxify the monkeys so they do not stay addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Letvin at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who
has worked on a possible AIDS vaccine, justifies the use of
primates with AIDS-related research because only primates get the
disease. He said he and most researchers believe animals should be
used judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one could go from the test tube to clinical efficacy in
man, it would be wonderful for the animals, but one has to test a
vaccine on a living, multi-organ animal,'' Letvin said. ``It is not
unhealthy for people to always question the use of animals when
they will lose their lives.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 7, will move Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ America is doing well by any
material measure, and for the most part is thoroughly enjoying the
experience. But there are also signs amid the prosperity that
people are asking whether this is all there is. Clearly, the
country seems to be grappling genuinely with with the question of
how it can best put its prosperity to use. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ALPHA-MALE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A certain consternation has
greeted the news that Naomi Wolf, a consultant to Vice President Al
Gore, advised him he was a beta male who needed to become an alpha.
What stirred the commotion, of course, is that a feminist was
caught advising a man to play out of the male rulebook. But her
critics miss the point that her remedy was surely sound. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POKEMON-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ For those parents frantically
beating the pavements to find yet another pack of $5.99 Pokemon
cards, take heart: your children are unwittingly demanding a
healthy dose of Japanese values. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   PORTUGAL-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The Portuguese were durable.
They came, they conquered and they stayed. And stayed. The last of
their Asian colonies will finally be relinquished in mid-December,
when Macau, off the coast of China, drops quietly into the pocket
of Beijing. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran) _ It may be years before the world will
know which represents the ``real'' Iran _ the medieval process
initiated by the mullahs against the reformer, or the breezy, late

to an outsider, the sense is that the changes sweeping the rest of

   COLOMBIA-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Bogota) _ The Day of the Dead was
commemorated all over Latin America last week, but probably no
country had a greater need for such solemnities than Colombia. To
the toll of those killed by paramilitary groups and guerrillas in
the region's longest-running civil conflict must be added those
murdered by drug cartels and criminal gangs, as well as a new set
of victims: the 140 young boys kidnapped, tortured, raped and
butchered by a serial killer who confessed his five-year killing
spree to the police on Monday. What makes Colombia so brutal a
society? By Larry Rohter.

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ News highlights of the week.

<P>
   FARMING-REVIEW (Fargo, N.D.) _ With a heavy heart, but a clear
head, growing numbers of American farmers are voluntarily leaving
agriculture rather than lose money year after year. But what has
surprised many of them is that the transition to urban life has
been so easy. Businesses are eager to hire them for the management
skills they developed during the hard years of farming. By Dirk
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   TEENAGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Money doesn't buy happiness _ and
among teen-agers, it may actually make life feel harder. More than
1,000 young people aged 13 to 17 were asked to compare their lives
with what their parents experienced growing up. Over all, 43
percent said they were having a harder time, 33 percent said they
were having an easier time and 23 percent said it was about the
same. At the same time, there was a divide along economic lines,
with the rich children saying they suffered more. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   EMOTION-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ When educators gather next
week in New Orleans for a national conference on teaching young
children, Mother Goose rhymes will make room for lessons in anger
management: aggression prevention, self-regulation and emotion
control. These are the buzzwords of an evolving movement to develop
and offer formal lessons in the ABC's of feelings to children under
5. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at presidential temper
tantrums from Washington to Clinton. By Tom Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   TAXI-BIAS-REVIEW (New York) _ It may be the most blatant form of
racism in New York City: a cab driver refusing to pick up someone
who is black. Actor Danny Glover, who last week went public over a
series of such slights, says he isn't going to take it anymore. By
Thomas J. Lueck.

for Sunday, Nov. 7, will move Saturday:

<P>
   PROSPERITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ America is doing well by any
material measure, and for the most part is thoroughly enjoying the
experience. But there are also signs amid the prosperity that
people are asking whether this is all there is. Clearly, the
country seems to be grappling genuinely with with the question of
how it can best put its prosperity to use. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ALPHA-MALE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A certain consternation has
greeted the news that Naomi Wolf, a consultant to Vice President Al
Gore, advised him he was a beta male who needed to become an alpha.
What stirred the commotion, of course, is that a feminist was
caught advising a man to play out of the male rulebook. But her
critics miss the point that her remedy was surely sound. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POKEMON-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ For those parents frantically
beating the pavements to find yet another pack of $5.99 Pokemon
cards, take heart: your children are unwittingly demanding a
healthy dose of Japanese values. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   PORTUGAL-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The Portuguese were durable.
They came, they conquered and they stayed. And stayed. The last of
their Asian colonies will finally be relinquished in mid-December,
when Macau, off the coast of China, drops quietly into the pocket
of Beijing. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran) _ It may be years before the world will
know which represents the ``real'' Iran _ the medieval process
initiated by the mullahs against the reformer, or the breezy, late
20th-century atmosphere of mobile phones and Internet commerce. But
to an outsider, the sense is that the changes sweeping the rest of
the world cannot be halted at Iran's borders. By John F. Burns.

CHINA SAYS ITS FUTURE DEPENDS ON ROUTING BANNED SPIRITUAL
MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Just when it seemed that official invective against
Falun Gong could grow no harsher, Friday's issue of the People's
Daily has suggested that the very fate of China hangs on the
struggle against the banned spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page commentary in the newspaper, which speaks directly
for the Communist Party, carries the headline ``Totally Expunge
Evil, Pursue It To The End.''
</P>
<P>
   First declaring that the government has achieved a ``decisive
victory'' against Falun Gong, which it banned last July, the
editorial goes on to say that the struggle to defeat the movement
will be a ``long and arduous one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be fully prepared, with powerful countermeasures, for
the bitterness and complexity of struggle against this evil
force,'' the commentary said. ``This is a major political issue
that concerns the future of the country, the future of its people
and the future of the great endeavor of reform and opening up and
of socialist modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's article was the latest in a series of increasingly
fiery official diatribes about the group in the last two weeks. The
stepped-up campaign has coincided with preparations for the trial
of the movement's top leaders but also, more importantly, with
embarrassing evidence that thousands of followers or more _ among
the millions of Chinese who were drawn to Falun Gong in recent
years _ have refused to buckle under.
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, it has become clear, a vigorous struggle
continues as believers defend the movement and continue to practice
its trademark slow-motion exercises, only to face fines, detention,
threats to their jobs and even banishment to labor camps. Thousands
of followers converged on Beijing last week, many of them showing
up in Tiananmen Square only to be shipped back to the police in
their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of the communist government, which brooks no
organized opposition, this defiance in itself is proof of the
group's supposed cultish and subversive nature.
</P>
<P>
   In private, many Chinese express bafflement at the ferocity of
the government reaction, which is turning once solid citizens into
criminals and Falun Gong into an international human rights cause.
One party official suggested that the leadership may fear the
prospect of laid-off workers forming an alliance with such a mass
movement, creating a huge political threat.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the official denunciations and prosecutions do send
an effective warning to most Chinese to keep their distance from
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, founded in 1992 by a former grain clerk named Li
Hongzhi, is an off-shoot of traditional Chinese qigong exercises,
which claim to enhance the body's vital energies, mixed with
elements of Buddhism and Taoism.
</P>
<P>
   As the movement expanded, attracting large numbers of retirees
and laid-off workers as well as some officials and Communist Party
members, it came into occasional conflict with the authorities. Li
had bitter disagreements with other qigong masters and the national
qigong society expelled him, or he quit, in different versions of
the story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Li moved to New York, where, as Falun Gong's revered
spiritual ``master,'' he communicates with followers around the
world on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The banning of the group followed the surprise gathering of
10,000 members around the leadership compound in Beijing in April,
to protest published criticisms and demand official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin later told foreign diplomats that he had
been unaware of the group before then. National leaders were
clearly unnerved by its awesome ability to mobilize so many
supporters so quickly under the noses of the police. Since then, as
the campaign to wipe out Falun Gong has apparently faltered, the
authorities have pulled out all the stops.
</P>
<P>
   In at least two northeastern provinces, Liaoning and Jilin,
special anti-Falun Gong task forces combining the police,
prosecutors and courts have been formed, according to the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   The center in Hong Kong also reported that Wang Zhiguo, a former
policeman who described his faith in Falun Gong at a clandestine
news conference in Beijing last Thursday, was arrested and charged
with cult-related crimes in his home province of Liaoning.

</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER S. GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ You could hear a linchpin drop in the
vast production hall at the Daewoo Group's Avia truck factory on an
old airfield at the edge of this city. In one portion of the hall,
a few dozen workers slowly bolted together updated 1960s-model
three-ton trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The rest lies empty, awaiting the arrival of an assembly line to
build the new Daewoo-designed model on which the factory's future _
if it has one _ depends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a four-year effort, including an ambitious $115 million
investment in improved manufacturing processes and a new paint
line, the Prague factory has yet to turn a profit. And the plant's
spokesman freely acknowledges that only cheap credits from Daewoo's
other divisions, including the South Korean parent and a passenger
car sales network in the Czech Republic, have kept the factory
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Those credits will be hard to get from now on. The finances of
the parent company, Daewoo Group, are in ruins, brought low by
immense debts in the aftermath of South Korea's economic crisis.
The company is expected to be broken up and parts sold to satisfy
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Economic conditions here have not helped the company, either.
Two years of recession and 10 years of post-Communist Western
imports have slaked the Czechs' appetite for new trucks and cut
Avia's production to a projected 4,000 trucks this year. That is
less than a quarter of what it produced in the 1980s, when its
late-'60s Renault design was the Soviet bloc's ubiquitous
small-hauler.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo bought Avia in a multibillion-dollar spending spree in
the mid-1990s, outbidding rivals for decrepit Eastern European
factories newly privatized after communism's fall. The company
hoped to take advantage of the cheap skilled labor of the region's
emerging democracies, just as it once used cheap skilled labor in
Korea to win markets in North America. Some 81 businesses, from car
makers to banks to electronics plants, now fly Daewoo's flag from
Uzbekistan to Prague.
</P>
<P>
   But Daewoo had more enthusiasm than staying power. ``They went
into Eastern Europe in an extremely aggressive way to use it as a
springboard for Western Europe,'' said Tim Armstrong, an auto
industry analyst at DRI McGraw-Hill in Paris, ``but without any
real regard to getting a return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo officials refuse to discuss how the company's troubles at
home will affect its Eastern European operations, but analysts say
the future of the car factories depends on finding a buyer,
probably General Motors. GM and Daewoo have discussed the possible
sale of the European plants and more recently, as Daewoo's problems
came to a head, the rest of Daewoo Motors.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's largest car maker, GM has the management skills,
the global sales experience and the deep pockets necessary to make
most of Daewoo's Eastern European investments pay off, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still examining the complementarity of our operations,''
said Henry Wong, a GM spokesman. ``It's too early to rule anything
in or out.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, said Rodney Joyce, an auto industry analyst at the
Economist Intelligence Unit in London, no one is making money on
cars in Eastern Europe. ``It's all seeding for the future,'' he
said. Citing an ``enormous potential down the line,'' he noted that
GM, with a car plant in Poland and an engine factory in Hungary,
had experience in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting a deal with Daewoo would not only expand GM's reach into
Asia, but also could give GM a low-cost export platform for Western
Europe, just as Volkswagen has with its Czech-made Skoda and
Spanish-made SEAT cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daewoo's companies in Eastern Europe are not bad deals,'' said
Gabor Hunya of the Vienna Institute for International Economic
Studies. ``They do have conditions to produce cheap cars for a
local market and to export to Western Europe.'' But, he added, car
sales are still being hurt by slow growth in many post-communist
countries and by fierce price competition in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo also makes cars and small trucks in Poland, Romania,
Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, where the Daewoo-FSO subsidiary reported its first
operating profit last year, managers say they will seek a listing
on the Warsaw and London stock exchanges to raise capital. Riding
the wave of a booming Polish economy thirsty for new cars,
Daewoo-FSO started a new car assembly line in October and will open
another this month.
</P>
<P>
   It built 91,599 vehicles in the first half of this year,
slightly ahead of its 1998 pace, and hopes to begin exporting soon
to Italy, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But in Romania, Daewoo's Rodae Automobile unit, with 20 percent
of new-car sales in the country, is facing tough competition.
Daewoo has spent $800 million on the plant since 1995, but the cost
of its cars to Romanian consumers has more than doubled as the
country's currency has lost value. The fractious Romanian
government, meanwhile, has had difficulty moving ahead with changes
in economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Worse for Daewoo, its Romanian rival, Dacia, whose $4,000 model
accounts for 65 percent of the country's new-car sales, has just
been sold to Renault of France. Daewoo executives say tax breaks
granted to Renault will make Korean cars 30 percent more expensive
than the comparable Renault models.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has scaled back its plans for Romanian car production
from a goal of 200,000 cars a year. It produced just 16,000 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Farther to the east, Daewoo's factories are in even worse shape.
Its Ukrainian venture put employees on an indefinite furlough
earlier this year, halting production until the local economy picks
up.
</P>
<P>
   And in Uzbekistan, the effects of the Russian economic collapse
last year have brought car production to a virtual standstill; the
government there is scrambling to keep the plant in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce of the Economist Intelligence Unit saw little chance that
GM would keep the weakest of Daewoo's car plants open.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plants are closed, the economic effect may not be
significant. ``The hopes and expectations of a few years ago were
unrealistic in the first place,'' said Charles Robertson, an
economist at ING-Barings in London.
</P>
<P>
   The local view is often more optimistic. At Avia, which has 50
percent of the shrinking Czech market for new medium-sized trucks,
Jiri Kyncl, a company spokesman, acknowledged, ``We are not in very
good shape,'' only to add, ``But with a new model, we hope we can
go west.''
</P>
<P>
   For Avia, that means plans to make and sell 12,000 trucks a year
of the new AD-100 model in markets from Spain to the Ukraine. But
that requires an expensive parts and service network _ now on hold
as Daewoo's reorganization continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avia is not going to be successful unless GM introduces its
own models there,'' Joyce said.

<P>
   For the second time in a decade, Americans are being asked to
think clearly about expanding the health insurance system. First it
was Bill Clinton, now Bill Bradley. There are two big differences
between now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the yawning deficits of the early 1990s, a tidy
surplus is forecast for years to come, some portion of which could
finance a reform.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of Ira Magaziner at the drawing board, it is a
coterie of health care economists, policy experts and clinicians
who have prepared the far more modest plan espoused by the former
New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of them is Alan Garber, a PhD economist (Harvard) and
physician (Stanford.) As much as anyone, he exemplifies how things
have changed in health care economics since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy to call to mind the implausible episode that
unfolded when, five days after his inauguration, Bill Clinton put
his wife in charge of the National Health Care Reform Task Force in
1993 with orders to deliver sweeping legislation to Congress in 100
days.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton promptly hired old family friend
Magaziner as staff coordinator, and he orchestrated a series of
supersecret deliberations in the manner he had learned during his
brief tenure as a corporate consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The escapade ended with the Republican landslide of 1994, when
the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives for the
first time in 40 years. The GOP began its even more implausible
impeachment quest, and Magaziner's 3,000-page plan promptly was
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Until September.
</P>
<P>
   Then, calling access to health-care insurance ``an American
birthright,'' former Sen. Bill Bradley proposed expanding the
system to include most of the 45 million Americans currently
without health insurance _ especially 11 million or so children.
</P>
<P>
   How? Says Alan Garber, ``Sen Bradley asked a group of us last
winter how to go about reducing the number of uninsured right away.
And all of us were thinking the same thing: something like, expand
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).''
</P>
<P>
   What's FEHBP? Nearly half the people in Washington are covered
by its insurance, making it the largest benefit plan of its sort in
the nation. It functions little differently than the medical
benefits office of a large corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The government pays some portion of the premium annual premium _
around 70 percent is the average _ and employees pay the rest,
depending on the depth of benefits and the size of the deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Federal workers around the nation choose among some 300
different plans _ health maintainence organization, preferred
provider organizations and the like _ on the basis of quality and
price. Once a year they are free to shop around. The competition
among the plans for their business makes the system work.
</P>
<P>
   The plan proposed by Bradley would permit currently uninsured
Americans to buy into the existing FEHBP system. It would subsidize
the premiums of those who couldn't otherwide afford it, from a full
ride for the really poor to partial subsidies for children in
houselds earning up to $49,200.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley estimated that the plan would cost about $65 billion a
year by the time it was fully in place, requiring about 70 percent
of the federal surplus not related to Social Security, and
resulting in about 95 percent of all Americans being fuilly
insured.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president Al Gore immediately disparaged Bradley's plan, on
grounds that it would cost too much. ``Costs are never entirely
predicable,'' says Garber, ``but the costs of this plan are much
more predicable than those of any other plan involving more
fundamental change in health care financing.'' It is, above all
else, he says, a pragmatic plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a system that work reasonably well and adding to
it. We're not claiming that it works perfectly. But we're not
talking about inventing something new.'' One worry: whether little
firms will fold their plans once government-sponsored insurance
becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   So who is Alan Garber? He is the currently visible tip of an new
and thriving community of health care economists. As Victor Fuchs
of Stanford University has noted (he is the dean of the field,)
there a world-wide expansion of health economics in the past 35
years. The number of PhDs awarded annually iin the US has increased
12-fold since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Left, right and center, it is now possible to hold a a
disciplined conversation about topics that were barely understood
when the Federal governmemnt lurched into health care in a big way
with the beginnings of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Garber arrived at Harvard College in the fall of 1973. Among his
classmates were Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, who went on to found
Microsoft. Down the street at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
was Lawrence Summers, now secretary of the Treasury. Labor
economist Richard Freeman trained Garber; econometrician Zvi
Griliches persuaded him that he could do the coursework for a PhD
in economics in a single year before entering medical school at
Stanford. (He roomed with Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs.)
</P>
<P>
   So Garber worked as a research assistant for economist Kenneth
Arrow while pursuing his medical studies at Stannford, writing his
dissertaion under the supervision of a committee headed by
Harvard's Martin Feldstein. He met future wife when both were
residents at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, before they
returned to Stanford. (Trained as an ocologist, she now works as
medical director of a hospice.) Two years ago, Garber almost
returned to the Brigham as chief of general medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of room for pure PhDs who never go near a
hospital,'' says Garber, ``but those of us who have M.D.s do see
things a little differently. I don't know what its like to be a
private practice doc, and I don't know what its like to be a
dsurgeon -- I'm a general internist -- but I still get there in the
trenches, in a limited way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still make rounds when ward attending. You to see what it
means what some of these policies mean at the level of the patient
and the practicaing physician: what it means, for instance, to be
limited to ten or twlve minutes for an office visit; what it means
to comply with Medicare documentation requirements. Not every
health care economist needs to be sensitized to these issues, but
somebody should be.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Bradley propound his plan in late September then
Harvard's Martin Feldstein attacked it, though it had been devised
in part by his former student. There were three problems, Feldstein
wrote, in an article on the editorial page of the Wall Street
Journal.It would require a ``massive'' tax increase, do relatively
little to reduce the ranks of the uninsured and significantly
worsen the quality of health care for most Americans. Garber
equally quickly disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein serves as an adviser to Republican candidate George W.
Bush. He advised George Bush the president as well, and Ronald
Reagan before him.. He went out of his way to link the Bradley plan
with the Clinton plan. It``suffers from many of the same defects,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   If fact, could hardly be more different. The fundamental
philosophical difference is that the Bradley plan makes no attempt
to define the components of a basic plan. There is nothing in it
about mammograms and mental health benefits. Those decisions are
left to the marketplace, where individuals remain free make their
own decisions about price and quality, as they do now, with one
plan competing against another.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to oppose Bradley's plan on principled grounds.
Feldstein may think the surplus is not really there. Or he may
prefer medical saving accounts, tax sheltered savings of a sort
favored by some Republicans. Or he may simply think not worth
bothering with those ten million children. ``This big step along
the road to a welfare state is not, to put it mildly, what America
needs,'' he wrote. Let the debate begin!

CENSORSHIP, FREEDOM OF SPEECH OFTEN COLLIDE IN THE PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Nov. 7) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ On Sept. 15, Maher Dasuki, a popular
television talk show host, was sitting in his Ramallah office when
15 members of the Palestinian Preventive Security stormed in and
arrested him on charges of ``incitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The men rummaged through pamphlets and books stacked on shelves
and told him he would also be charged with possession of inciting
material. They took him to a nearby jail for a few hours of
questioning and then to a larger Ramallah prison for 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after his release, Dasuki, 38, went back on the air and
told Palestinian television audiences of the torture he had endured
at the hands of his Palestinian interrogators.
</P>
<P>
   He told of how he was blindfolded and tied to a chair in a
painful position for days, a method of torture Palestinians call
``shabbeh,'' or stretching, that was often used against them by
Israeli interrogators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a problem with my legs, I had a problem with my eyes,''
Dasuki tells an interviewer during a program called ``Room for
Opinion'' that he usually hosts. ``For three days I didn't sleep. I
was tied in shabbeh.''
</P>
<P>
   Dasuki is not the first Palestinian professional arrested by the
Palestinian police. Since the Authority was established in 1994,
newspaper editors, television broadcasters, human rights workers
and a Gaza-based psychiatrist have been arrested for speaking out
against government corruption, police brutality or the general lack
of democracy in their self-rule government.
</P>
<P>
   But Dasuki is the first to go on the air after the ordeal and
describe it, in effect challenging the government to protect his
right to free speech. At the same time, he hesitated to talk to the
foreign media about his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   His actions underscore the peculiar relationship between freedom
of speech and censorship in the Palestinian Authority _ a
relationship forged not by concrete laws but by those unfortunate
Palestinians whose arrests may have taught others the limits of
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Often, their trouble with the authorities began when foreign
media got wind of a particular incident and published it outside
the country. The government, say Palestinians, is sensitive to
negative news that sullies its image abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Dasuki had no qualms about addressing the sensitive issue of his
torture in front of other Palestinians. His interview was broadcast
on a local television station picked up in Ramallah, Jerusalem and
Bethlehem. A copy of the tape was given to other local television
stations to air in other parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority officials maintain Dasuki was not arrested
because of his political opinions, but for ``security reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to talk about a political issue, we have no
problem with that,'' said Samih Kanaan, deputy head of the
Palestinian Preventive Security in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since the show began three years ago, Dasuki has
addressed nearly every topic sensitive to Palestinians, often
bringing representatives from the political opposition, including
the Islamic Hamas organization, to discuss the peace process and
the Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
   His trouble began days after a studio guest named Im Walid, the
mother of a Palestinian prisoner being held in an Israeli jail,
criticized Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. She said he had failed
to secure the release of prisoners from Jerusalem in peace
agreements signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the insult to their leader was too much for security
forces to take. They blamed Dasuki, saying he knew what his guest
was going to say on the air and failed to stop her.
</P>
<P>
   For Dasuki, the fact that Palestinians were torturing
Palestinians remains particularly disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what bothers me,'' he says during his interview.
``We're talking about torture and humiliation (being practiced) by
Palestinians.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt _ This city is trying hard to recapture the
luster it lost 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At its glorious peak, Alexandria was the center of science and
commerce in the ancient world. And at its center _ before fires,
earthquakes and conquest sent this Mediterranean port city into its
long decline _ stood an extraordinary library. It was a center of
scholarship that attracted the likes of Euclid and Archimedes and
may well have achieved its goal of amassing a copy of every known
book under a single roof.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of planning, a spectacular successor is to open
soon, the product in part of a worldwide appeal to ``efface the
disaster'' caused by the old library's loss. Even in the dirt and
decay of modern Alexandria, some see in the new institution a way
that Alexandria may regain its place as a cultural crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its revival will benefit humanity,'' Mohsen Zahran, an
MIT-educated architect who is the project director, said of the new
library. In a bow to the past, the new structure, like the old one,
is to be be christened the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.
</P>
<P>
   The planned opening, expected early next year after more than 10
years of construction, comes at a time when politicians,
businessmen and archaeologists have thrown themselves into efforts
to recapture some of Alexandria's old glory.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-mile road that skirts the Mediterranean has been widened,
horn honking forbidden and dilapidated buildings torn down, all to
open a fresh window to a sea that has always fed Alexandria's
cosmopolitan spirit.
</P>
<P>
   And just offshore, underwater beneath the city's historic
harbor, archaeologists from France and Egypt are uncovering
remnants of much that disappeared long ago, having toppled into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   If the claims are accurate, they include remnants from
Cleopatra's palace, and from the fabled lighthouse that was one of
the seven wonders of the ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of one day transforming the waters into an
underwater park. The highly popular governor, Muhammad Abdel Salam
al-Mahgoud, has taken a big step in that direction by halting
sewage flow that rendered the waters of the city's harbor a kind of
translucent muck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alexandria today is burdened with 4 million people, all
packed into an overcrowded coastal strip. Outside the museums a
visitor sees few signs of the city's ancient harbor, and even the
faded charm that made Alexandria a haven for foreign writers after
World War II now seems encrusted in dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandria is Africa's third-largest city, behind Cairo and
Lagos, Nigeria. But except in the notable case of the Egyptians who
flock to its shores in the summer, it is often bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   That might change, some say, with the opening of the modernistic
$185 million library, designed by a Norwegian firm that won an
international competition and built to emulate the rising sun and
the perpetual dawning of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   With space for 4 million works, a French-designed computerized
catalog and 500 built-in Internet ports, the library, which is to
be open to researchers from around the world as well as the public,
will immediately become by far the largest and most advanced in the
Arab world. More than half of the construction cost has been paid
by the Egyptian government, which has made the project a national
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The rest came from international donors rallied by UNESCO, the
U. N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which
embraced the project in 1988. Without that help, said Muhammad
Kamel Ibrahim, an economist at the Alexandria Business Association,
the dream of reviving a symbol so important to Alexandria would
never have been possible.
</P>
<P>
   The old library had the muscle of an empire behind it, having
been conceived in 306 B.C. by Ptolemy I, the successor to Alexander
the Great, who founded Alexandria just before his death in 322 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the library was entitled to make a copy of every book
that entered the country, and accounts of the time suggest that the
license was taken liberally. Vessels that docked at Alexandria were
subject to search, and their captains often had to settle for a
copy of their documents, with the original kept in a collection
that may at one time have numbered 700,000 papyrus scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the cash-starved Egyptian government has set the
new library's acquisitions budget at just $5 million a year, so for
its resources the institution will have to rely heavily on the
generosity of others.
</P>
<P>
   For now its collection stands at just 350,000 works, a tiny
fraction of capacity, and just one-fourth the size of Egypt's 1.5
million-volume national library in Cairo. Most of the works
collected are from the humanities and social sciences, and huge
gaps remain in the arts and architecture, business management,
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that more support will come after the
inauguration,'' Zahran, the project director, said. But though the
library was scheduled to open last spring, workers have only now
begun the finishing touches, including a granite exterior etched
with characters from a hodgepodge of languages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a planetarium and a conference center adjoining the
library have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure exactly how and when the old Alexandria library
faded from the scene, and the archaeological work that preceded the
construction of its successor uncovered not a single trace of the
old structure.
</P>
<P>
   It was long thought that Cleopatra's lover, Julius Caesar, was
responsible for the demise, through troops who burned part of
Alexandria in 47 B.C. in the prelude to what was ultimately a Roman
conquest. But at least part of that collection is now believed to
have survived that conflagration, only to disappear in the face of
further traumas.
</P>
<P>
   The library may finally have been wiped out in the third century
A.D., some historians say, during fighting under Emperor Aurelian.
But others say some scrolls probably endured until the fourth
century or even the seventh century, only to be burned in the heat
of anti-pagan or anti-Christian strife.
</P>
<P>
   This time, builders have taken no chances. Below the ground, the
foundation is encased in a cylindrical shell as protection from the
sea and earthquakes. And yes, the library does include fire
escapes.

 DESPITE SCANDALS, RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS GETTING BETTER  (ART ADV:

(jw) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Buoyed by high world oil prices and a boost from a
currency devaluation last year, the Russian economy is looking
better than it has in years.
</P>
<P>
   Gross domestic product is up by almost 2 percent over last year.
Tax revenues are well above target, and better yet, they are being
collected in cash. Government pensions are now paid up in full. The
trade surplus for this year is up almost 30 percent over last year,
thanks mostly to a decline in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the figures, and just the figures, Russia this fall
should be receiving high marks from the International Monetary
Fund, the fiscal watchdog and loan agency. And yet the IMF has for
almost two months been sitting on a promised $640 million of
financial relief.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that fiscal criteria simply are not good enough,
not now, not after reports about financial scandals that rocked
Western capitals and put their lending policies to Russia under a
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the fund, at the urging of the leading industrial
nations, raised the barrier for Russia, adding on conditions that
have more to do with reforming its behavior than with fiscal
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF has raised the goal posts,'' said an economist here
who works closely with the government and Western lenders. ``And
why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements include quarterly audits of the central
bank, a schedule to convert the auditing of private and public
banks to international accounting standards and a promise from the
central bank to start shedding its majority shares in five foreign
banks that are an awkward legacy from the Soviet banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm, examined
the books of an offshore company, Fimaco, that was owned by a Paris
bank run by the Russian central bank. The audit produced evidence
that the central bank used the little-known company to camouflage
$1 billion in credits to the Russian government in 1996, in
violation of agreements with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   A second audit, now in its final stages, has so far shown no
evidence of such fiscal sleight-of-hand at the five foreign banks,
said one official who has seen the draft of the second
PriceWaterhouseCoopers audit.
</P>
<P>
   According to economists who have tracked the fund's troubled
history with Russia, the new conditions amount to a new test of
repeated promises to open some of the most closely held books and
to start doing business in accordance with the standards of
free-market economies.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the same question that has dogged the fund and
Russia's Western partners for eight years. ``The big question is
whether Russia wants to reform or not,'' said the economist here,
who insisted on anonymity. ``In other words, can we expect a signal
from the government that the real rules of the game are going to
change in Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   The new negotiator with international lending institutions,
Alexander Livshits, insisted that the answer was yes, at least as
far as the new conditions were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did Russia agree?'' Livshits asked in an interview.
``Because in the long term these conditions are useful for Russia.
Of this I am absolutely convinced. And because the countries that
fund the IMF are under political pressure to require greater
openness from Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The other point, made by Livshits and others, is that Russia
still desperately needs the stamp of approval that only the fund
can give, if Moscow hopes to renegotiate the payment schedule for
$68 billion in Soviet-era debts owed to the so-called London and
Paris clubs. ``The IMF tranche is not only money,'' Livshits said.
``It is a tranche of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The good economic news in 1999 has mostly to do with the bad
news that swept Russia off its feet in August 1998, when the
government reneged on its short-term debt and let the ruble lose
more than two-thirds of its value. A result was a squeeze in
average Russian incomes and a dramatic increase in the number of
people below the official poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   But the improvement also led to a drop in imports and a surge in
domestic production, particularly in food processing, which now
competes successfully against pricey imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   With more rubles flowing through the economy, the role of barter
has also been decreasing, not only in trade between enterprises,
but also in payments to the government for taxes and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in imports was also one reason for the increase in the
improved trade surplus. Another was the rise in world oil prices, a
critical factor for an economy that depends heavily on its energy
sector. The extra oil revenues, combined with inflation, have
helped Russia exceed its revenue targets for 1999 by 30 billion
rubles, or $1.15 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Revenue projections for 2000 are even rosier, but many
economists view them as overly optimistic, even unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the production increase, Russia has not caught up to
production levels of 1997, let alone recovered to the levels of a
decade ago. Critics warn that the oil prices that rose this year
could drop again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a positive unanticipated shock to the Russia
economy,'' one economist said. ``But that has mostly to do with the
balance of trade and devaluation, and not much to do with better
policies and reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russia enters another protracted period of political
uncertainty _ with a war raging on its southern border and a
vicious battle of succession under way here _ some experts wonder
whether Russia has any economic policy at all, let alone one that
would satisfy the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Does Putin have an economic policy,'' asked former Finance
Minister Boris Fyodorov, referring to Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, the Kremlin's favored candidate to succeed President Boris
Yeltsin in an election next year. ``Have you seen it anywhere? Nor
have I.''
</P>
<P>
   An official close to negotiations between Russia and the fund
said the unexpected economic spurt could provide an ideal climate
for the reforms that have moved to the top of the West's list of
demands.
</P>
<P>
   But the opportunity also may be fleeting, economists said,
noting that with elections approaching, new spending, already
included in a preliminary 2000 budget, could prove too much of a
strain kicking off a round of inflation and adding pressure on the
fragile ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Although many experts here and abroad endorse the get-tough
decision of the fund, some wonder whether it is not acting like a
bad parent, who in hopes of curbing bad behavior, mixes reward and
punishment, thus confusing its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a high jumper,'' Livshits said. ``If you put the
barrier too high and he knows it, soon he will stop jumping and
start to run.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview this week, Alexander Shokhin, another
former finance minister, echoed a widely held view here that the
IMF's ever-expanding list of conditions reflected a desire to hold
off new credits for Russia until after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the West is distancing itself from Russia,''
said Shokhin.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of corruption and money laundering scandals
erupted in public in the summer, the view on Russia underwent a sea
change. If in the old days the obvious sins like corruption,
laggard reforms and a heavy reliance on barter instead of money
were forgiven for the sake of economic and political stability, the
tables have turned.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said the real shift in attitudes began after August
1998, when the government defaulted on its ruble debts and devalued
its currency, leaving large and influential Western creditors in
the lurch. That was when a debate started, here and abroad, over
whether the IMF had overemphasized macroeconomic performance,
shunting aside the more difficult issues of reforming the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the lessons of 1998,'' an official close to the
Russia-IMF talks said. ``That macroeconomics are not enough, and
the structural-reform agenda in this country is huge.''

   ROANOKE, Va. _ Not so long ago, most people were wary of leaving
a job. Whatever its faults, they had too much at risk, like their
seniority, security and benefits. But these times of prosperity and
low unemployment have changed all that. Now, for the most part,
people do not lose jobs. The jobs lose them.
</P>
<P>
   For three and a half years, Joya Patsel, 19, worked for a
Hardee's restaurant here. ``They kept me at $5.50 the whole time,''
she said. ``I quit.'' Now, she said, ``I've been at McDonald's
about five weeks. They started me at $6.25 and worked me up to
$6.75.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Marshall, 22, earns $11 an hour, or about $22,000 a year,
installing heating and air-conditioning systems. He wants a higher
wage, a shorter commute and a more empathetic boss. In late
October, he called four companies like his own, and all were
encouraging. ``They all said just come in and fill out an
application.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Skaff, 31, sells hair, nail and makeup supplies to beauty
salons, but her earnings of more than $30,000 a year in commissions
are threatened because her company has switched her to a fixed
lower salary. On Nov. 15, she will start with another company to
sell belts, handbags and jewelry on commission. ``I will be making
$40,000 to $50,000 my first year there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are desperate for workers, and workers know it.
Emboldened by that knowledge, they often bolt for nothing more than
a shorter commute, more flexible hours, a marginal increase in pay
or an employer's latest lure _ the sign-on bonus. At the Roanoke
office of the Virginia Employment Commission, for example,
counselors originally trained to help the unemployed are busiest
now helping fully employed workers find better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The bravest among them create their own jobs, striking out to
start their own businesses, knowing they can still get a job if
they fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers seem fearless, and they ought to,'' said Gary
Burtless, labor economist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this new empowerment is a steadily falling
unemployment rate. Figures released on Friday by the U.S.
Department of Labor show an unemployment rate for October of 4.1
percent, the lowest rate in nearly 30 years, down from 4.2 percent
in September. Employers in virtually every sector of the economy
are experiencing a shortage of workers unlike any in recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity runs through the ranks of the labor force from the
construction trades to service sector jobs to the high-technology
Internet world. Needs that go unmet include those for doctors,
engineers, midlevel managers and even senior executives. But the
severest shortages are in the lower pay ranges, for sales clerks,
short-order cooks, food-store workers and data-entry clerks.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has spread throughout rural areas and big cities and
can be especially vexing in places like Roanoke, where the
unemployment rate is 2 percent, considerably below the national
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the situation here, Beth Doughty, president of the
Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce, said: ``It is most acute at
lower wage levels, in jobs paying $6 to $10 or $11 an hour. But
it's across the board, in all categories.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Carol Day, owner of an employment agency here, said 20 years ago
she would have had 10 applicants for a secretarial job. ``Now we
might be able to come up with one or two people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Boatwright, a principal in the Lucas &AMP; Boatwright
accounting firm, is beating the bushes for accountants with two to
five years of experience, whom he would pay around $35,000 a year,
and newly minted accountants, whom he would pay $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see is what all employers see,'' Boatwright said. Even
in the professions, job seekers no longer look for lifelong careers
with one firm. At the same time, he said, ``the pipeline of
qualified candidates is slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   So Boatwright is looking for ways to break an accountant's work
into discrete tasks that can be done by nonaccountants. ``Maybe we
can widen the gates in terms of people coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This condition of the job market, with such low unemployment,
cannot last, some economists warn. They say it violates the
centuries-old economic cycle. Any day now, they say, employers will
have to respond by raising wages to lure and hold workers.
</P>
<P>
   But other economists suspect that new forces are calming the old
cycle. Once, said Lawrence Chimerine, a consultant and economist at
the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, industry could raise
its prices because it controlled them. With the growth of foreign
trade, particularly, Chimerine said, customers have taken control
of prices. If U.S. prices rise, the customers will shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process these days is backwards,'' Chimerine said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also say technology has raised productivity, letting
workers and industry produce more goods and services for each hour
of work. That gives employers some leeway to raise wages, though
not by very much.

<P>
   With malls, hospitals and businesses that serve rural
communities far beyond it, Roanoke is a sponge of job creation that
soaks up hourly workers. Periodically, manufacturers in the area,
especially fading textile companies, lay people off. But other
businesses are forming far more jobs, enough to absorb laid off
workers and thousands of new workers who pour into the area year by
year and to still leave employers begging.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're telling employers is, you're going to have to steal
people'' from one another, said Jerry Barnett, assistant manager of
the employment commission office.
</P>
<P>
   A help-wanted ad from Cracker Barrell, the family restaurant
chain, asks cooks and dishwashers, ``Are you tired of being
underappreciated and underpaid?'' The chain adds, ``If you are
working in another restaurant, you are not getting all you
deserve!''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said: ``People are very fluid. They will move for a
minimal increase in pay. In this area, instead of talking about
unemployment, we talk about underemployment, people working in jobs
that they feel are beneath them. The majority are looking for
better opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, RKG Associates Inc., a consulting firm in Alexandria,
Va., released the results of a survey it did of the Roanoke area
job market for the employment commission. ``Thirty-three percent of
respondents would quit their current job to take another job that
paid the same but better met their personal needs,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 40 percent would change jobs for less than a 15 percent
increase in pay,'' it said. And ``nearly 20 percent of respondents
were working in jobs with educational requirements that were at
least two levels below their educational attainment level.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unable or reluctant to raise prices for their goods and services
so they can then raise wages, employers are trying everything else.
One device is the bonus, for agreeing to take a job, for staying on
the job or for good performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will match existing pay or exceed,'' a roofing company
advertises. ``$100 sign-up bonus.'' Kentucky Fried Chicken promises
sandwich makers and cooks the ``possibility of three raises within
six months,'' a ``gift certificate program for high performers''
and ``opportunity for employee bonus.'' A company seeking ``carpet
cleaning technicians'' offers $8 to $14 an hour and a $200 sign-on
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Temporary staffing agencies go to extraordinary lengths to
locate and retain workers for their clients, especially those
willing to take low-paying jobs. Adecco, a large agency with more
than 3,200 offices worldwide, is searching for 250 workers to
dispatch to Hanover Direct, a distributor for eight mail-order
catalog companies. The company needs them to work the pre-Christmas
rush, November and December.
</P>
<P>
   But finding them will not be easy. Adecco is combing rural
communities 30 to 40 miles from Roanoke, searching for housewives
who are willing to work but do not have cars, and for the first
time, it has hired a bus company to take them to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   Then to retain the workers, the agency is offering bonuses just
for showing up. In addition to the $6.75 hourly pay for Hanover
Direct's day shift and $7.75 for the night shift, Adecco will pay
$20 extra for each week of perfect attendance and an additional $40
for a month of perfect attendance. So a worker can collect an extra
$120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to head off people from leaving,'' said Beth
Pinson, the agency's senior area manager. ``That's the effect of
the unemployment rate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Besides the boon to workers, the economy's mix of prosperity and
fraying workplace bonds has triggered a burst of entrepreneurship
here. The abundance of jobs means there are enough around for
people who fall behind on their bills to take second jobs. It lets
everyone who wants to work work, and it opens opportunities for
workers to change course.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Kidman, 40, has started a business doing what he did for
someone else for 20 years, fitting out gasoline stations. His wife,
Linda Kidman, 39, was once a nurse. Now, she said, she earns
$50,000 a year selling newly prosperous homeowners decorating
accessories _ figurines, pictures, candles, sconces, mirrors _ as a
door-to-door agent for Home Interiors and Gifts, a company in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want their homes to be beautiful,'' Mrs. Kidman said.
``They want something good to look at when they get up. Even a
child. It likes to look at a picture of a teddy bear on the wall.''
Decorating, she said, ``makes them feel a little more important
about their home and their stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity also created an opportunity for Jeff Miller, 35, who
went no further than high school. He loathes the thought of ``a
job,'' meaning working for someone else. ``You don't get the
residual income if you have a job,'' he said.

   Miller determined that Roanoke's bustling retail stores could
use a package delivery service, so he started one that last year
earned him $62,000. That, in turn, has let him resurrect an
artifact of the era before prosperity, the breadwinner father. His
wife, Susan, stays home with their three children _ her preference,
he said, as well as his.

   To other families, however, the abundance of jobs spells

   His wife, Chris Lambruscati, 50, quadriplegic since a skydiving

at a Kroger's supermarket.

   ``It gives them structure, money, self-esteem,'' White said.
``It teaches them work habits and to be responsible.'' Real work
can be hazardous to homework, he said, ``so we make sure they make
reasonably good grades, or their work is cut back.''

SEARCHERS PINPOINT MISSING EGYPTAIR `BLACK BOXES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Using an advanced submersible robot, searchers
believe they found the black boxes of EgyptAir Flight 990's in an
Atlantic Ocean debris field Friday, raising hopes that the
in-flight recorders will be recovered and yield critical data about
the jetliner's horrific final moments.
</P>
<P>
   Their tell-tale ``pinging'' signals were so strong that
shipboard Navy crewmen charting the course of the deep-sea diving
remote device had to remove their earphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that they're there,'' said Capt. Bert Marsh, Navy
supervisor of salvage. ``It's just a matter of time before they're
able to dig one or both of them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The black boxes _ a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data
recorder _ lay in about 270 feet of water some 60 miles south of
Nantucket, where the Boeing 767-300ER crashed 30 minutes after
takeoff early Sunday, en route from New York City to Cairo. All 217
passengers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The recorders' signals were detected about 14 to 15 feet apart
on a silty, sandy ocean floor strewn with small pieces of airplane
debris, including one of the plane's wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some occasions where the `pingers' and the
boxes have separated,'' said Marsh. ``We don't think that's the
case. But we will continue to dig in those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deep Drone _ a remote-controlled vehicle the size of a
mini-van _ was to search throughout the night for the recorders,
using powerful spotlights to pierce pitch-black waters with
visibility 3 to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But the operation was suspended Friday evening because the
weather had deteriorated. Winds were forecast to reach more than 30
knots, creating 10-to-12-foot seas _ swells that would prevent
divers and equipment from operating safely at the crash site.
Conditions were not expected to improve before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather can still drive us off,'' Marsh told reporters here.
``If the weather picks up and we feel we can't launch and recover
the vehicle safely, then we'll pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Working from the high-tech Navy salvage ship USS Grapple, crews
sent down the remote-controlled robot mounted with cameras in 8
1/2-foot seas two days after search and recovery ships had been
chased into harbor by an angry autumn storm.
</P>
<P>
   Launched at 9 a.m., it cruised within feet of the pingers an
hour later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases _ very rare cases _ we find the black boxes with
the pingers on them, sitting in the open,'' Marsh said. ``In this
case we did not, so we're going to have to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at the National Transportation Safety Board were
set to begin work retrieving the data within hours after recovery
of the titanium-protected boxes, which will be placed in coolers of
protective sea water and airlifted to Quonset Point Naval Base and
then to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There have been cases where black boxes have been so badly
damaged by impact or fire that information on them was very
difficult to retreive and of limited value.
</P>
<P>
   The recorders from TWA Flight 800, a jumbo jet which crashed in
1996 off Long Island, N.Y., and Swissair Flight 111, which went
down off Nova Scotia 14 months ago, failed to supply crucial
information because the devices had lost electrical power in
minutes before the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple, with its 30-member dive crew, was also deployed to
Atlantic Ocean crash sites after both tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were hopeful the EgyptAir devices would contain solid
information because the plane's transponder, which is also
electrically powered, worked throughout the first calamitous dive
from 33,000 feet to 16,700 feet in 40 seconds. That indicates the
data recorders, on the same power system, were probably working,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The black boxes _ actually painted orange for easier detection _
contain recordings of the last 30 minutes of cockpit conversations
and precise details from dozens of monitors on the jet's mechanical
functions, such as altitude, airspeed, heading and acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder is among the most sensitive pieces of
evidence for air crash investigators because it essentially
provides electronic eavesdropping on the pilots' conversations
minutes before their deaths. The tape is closely held by federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB team assigned to listen to them works in a room with
sophisticated audio equipment at the agency's Washington's
headquarters, repeatedly listening to the tape and compiling a
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators waited for retrieval of the recorders, some 200
FBI agents continued to methodically investigate whether the plane
was doomed by sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, assistant FBI director, said agents are working
to match each piece of luggage on the plane with passengers on the
flight's manifest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to everybody who has had access to the plane _
the food people, the cleaning crews, the baggage handlers,'' said
Schiliro.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI official said there are about 10 bomb technicians here
who will examine debris collected from the crash site and determine
whether those pieces warrant more intensive analysis at FBI
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Schiliro said, none has.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents are cataloging each piece of the Boeing jetliner
collected by Coast Guard and Navy crews, and maintaining a detailed
record on who has handled them. NTSB investigators said the plane
carried computer parts, telephone and medical equipment and
diplomatic pouches in its cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's been a tedious process to go through, but we have
every hope that we will come to a resolution with our partners at
the NTSB,'' Schiliro said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the NTSB continue to analyze voluminous
maintenance logs, radar data and tape recordings to try determine
what might have sent the jet into a death plunge.
</P>
<P>
   As it fell from the early morning sky, the jet's transponder _
on-board equipment that provides flight information and
identification to air traffic control radar _ stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   Using Air Force radar from two sites, an NTSB preliminary
analysis showed that the plane then climbed to 24,000 feet before
diving yet again, and broke up at near-supersonic speed before
smashing into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, the NTSB chairman, said engineers have conducted
preliminary studies to determine whether a Boeing 767 could perform
those maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that a 767 can fly that altitude profile,'' Hall
said. ``We have a high degree of confidence in the radar data.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation slowly moved forward, a Muslim memorial
service in a hotel ballroom Friday marked what was, for some
victims' relatives, a final day near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that answers won't come soon, a few relatives have
made plans to leave Rhode Island, said Nihad Awad, executive
director of the Council of American-Islamic Relations. But others
have said they are determined to stay longer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remain will be allowed to view debris from the jet
that has already been retrieved from salvage ships and stored in a
military hangar at the Quonset Point Naval Base, NTSB officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, mourners will take part in an interfaith memorial
service at Brenton Point State Park in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim service drew about 150 mourners _ including a few
community members _ to a hotel ballroom that had been converted to
a prayer room, with white sheets laid over the carpet in the place
of traditional rugs.
</P>
<P>
   Tears ran down several cheeks as mourners, speaking in Arabic,
repeated a ritual chant about the greatness of Allah, and recited
special prayers for the dead, used when the body of the deceased is
far away.
</P>
<P>
   Awad, who served as the prayer leader or ``imam,'' offered a
sermon in both Arabic and English, and told mourners that death, no
matter how far from home, is God's decision and God's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``What befalls us has been already determined, already
destined,'' he told mourners. ``And we have no choice but to
submit.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslims believe that death is a temporary state, Awad said after
the service. On Judgment Day, the Koran says, the dead will be
resurrected, and God will determine who enters paradise and who is
condemned. Muslim teachings say that people who die by drowning are
considered martyrs, and granted immediate entry into heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse said he will
file a court petition in Providence on Monday, seeking for
permission to issue certificates of ``presumption of death,'' for
the flight's passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Victims' relatives have sought those legal papers ``so we can go
home and get the legal process going.''

COMMENTARY: HAS JERRY FALWELL SEEN THE LIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By chance, the verdict in the Matthew Shepard murder trial was
handed down in Laramie, Wyo., on Wednesday just before my interview
with the Rev. Jerry Falwell. He hadn't heard the news, so I told
him of Aaron McKinney's conviction and asked his response.
Falwell's reply was instantaneous. After saying that the ``horrific
crime'' deserved ``the severest of punishments allowed by law,'' he
volunteered: ``I could never accept `gay panic' or any other excuse
as grounds for what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   What in God's name has gotten into Jerry Falwell? With this
statement, he sided with the gay activists who had reviled
McKinney's defense argument that Shepard invited his own slaughter
by allegedly making sexual advances to his assailants. ``Gay
panic'' is a hateful courtroom strategy _ last seen famously in the
``Jenny Jones'' murder trial _ but it's trotted out nonetheless by
lawyers hoping to sway a homophobic juror or two. And Falwell, like
the judge in Laramie, would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same preacher who has reaped millions of dollars
with fund-raising letters and Web site screeds decrying
``deviants'' who ``will stop at nothing, including violence''? Who
has warned tirelessly of ``the radical homosexual onslaught of
America''? Who pushed an advertising boycott of ``Ellen'' and outed
a gay Teletubby?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. ``I have been strident in my language,'' says
Falwell of his record on the subject of homosexuality, but referred
me to a Brill's Content article that had at least cleared him of
outing the Teletubby. ``I'd never heard of Tinky Winky,'' he
protested.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Falwell now does own up to other, more serious fanning of
anti-gay fires, and it was this seeming change of heart that led to
our conversation. Two weekends ago his Thomas Road Baptist Church
in Lynchburg, Va., was the setting for an anti-violence meeting
between 200 of his flock and 200 gay civil rights advocates
recruited nationwide by Soulforce, an ecumenical group based in
Laguna Beach, Calif. The meeting came about thanks to one of those
only-in-America stories that make this country eternally
unpredictable. The founder of Soulforce, the Rev. Mel White, was
the favorite ghostwriter of the religious right _ he wrote
Falwell's autobiography as well as books for Pat Robertson and
speeches for Oliver North _ until he declared his previously
closeted homosexuality in 1991. Since then, White has become a
campaigner for gay rights and has engaged in loud public battles
with his former allies. But Falwell never entirely tuned his old
friend out, and their continued contacts, however acrimonious at
times, led to the conference in Lynchburg.
</P>
<P>
   To make it happen, the two men agreed to disagree about
Falwell's rock-ribbed conviction that homosexuality is a sin akin
to alcoholism or drug addiction that can be reversed with spiritual
treatment. While that view is regarded as repugnant by White and
most gay Americans, Soulforce's delegation turned up in Lynchburg
nonetheless with the hope that Falwell might tone down his most
incendiary demagogy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   No gay civil rights group I can find has officially applauded
the conclave, and neither has any organization of religious
conservatives. When I asked White if his former boss' olive branch
might be opportunistic political positioning at a moment when the
hard right is being disowned by the Republican front-runner, George
W. Bush, he replied: ``I'm skeptical. How could you not be?'' But
he believes that Falwell, ``for whatever reason, good or bad,'' is
``doing the right thing.'' He adds: ``I know this guy, and this guy
is sincere, though he will blather about stupid things.'' Even
during the Lynchburg weekend, Falwell couldn't resist offending his
guests by endorsing a proselytizer for the ``ex-gay'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be wrong to dismiss the conference as mere
posturing. Falwell did break sharply with many religious-right
ideologues, who had closed ranks after the Shepard murder to deny
any link between the shrill gay-baiting pronouncements by their
``family'' organizations and a national rise in gay-bashing
violence at a time when most violent crime is down. ``We
acknowledge that words can lead to actions,'' Falwell said flatly
to the Lynchburg gathering, speaking of the potential fallout of
``reckless and dangerous language.'' He vowed that he and his staff
would vigilantly examine their ``characterizations and criticisms
of the homosexual community'' to avoid any ``statements that can be
construed as sanctioning hate or antagonism against homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He even put some distance between himself and a favorite
semantic dodge of the religious right: ``Many of us pastors like to
talk about loving the sinner but hating the sin,'' he said, but
``unfortunately, that statement has often become a meaningless
cliche'' because ``we too often fall short of the mark of ... truly
loving the sinner.'' Expanding on this point in our conversation,
Falwell said: ``Admittedly, evangelicals have not exhibited an
ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian
community. We've said go somewhere else, we don't need you here
(at) our churches.''
</P>
<P>
   What, I wondered, brought on this change in attitude besides the
prodding of Mel White? ``Matt Shepard and Billy Jack Gaither,'' he
said, referring to the gay Alabama man beaten with an ax handle and
then set on fire in February. ``And Columbine.'' Convinced that
Christians were targeted by the assailants in Littleton _ a view
that has yet to be confirmed by official investigators _ Falwell
found himself with a new perspective on the victims of hate crimes:
``You don't know what it means to be targeted until you've been
targeted yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected going in that we could change the world with a
meeting,'' he says, and he's not sure where it will all lead. His
congregants reacted enthusiastically to the weekend; of some 5,000
messages and letters he's received, ``well over 90 percent are
positive,'' including those from fellow evangelicals and some 300
Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   Distressed by this week's shooting incidents in Honolulu and
Seattle, Falwell is thinking of organizing a larger anti-violence
conference of not just ``gays and evangelicals, but believers and
non-believers ... everyone from people of color to Aryan Nations.''
Though repeatedly reiterating his opposition to gun control, he
opened the door a crack on that once-closed subject too: ``I'm
opposed, but we've got to do something,'' even ``getting us hard
heads on the right to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those heads _ and hearts _ can be pretty hard. Right on the eve
of the Lynchburg weekend, the most effective gay-baiting
organization in the country, The Family Research Council, helped
spur on a new campaign _ this one to dramatize the rape and murder
of a teenage boy allegedly committed by two gay men in Arkansas.
Why? According to its electronic newsletter of Oct. 20 the council
believes the gay-infested national media are suppressing the story
even as they overcovered the Shepard case. This specious argument,
rabble-rousing in the guise of media criticism, has since been
taken up by a right-wing amen chorus: David Duke, The Washington
Times, a columnist in The New York Post and Bill Horn, a notorious
anti-gay propagandist who turned up last week on ABC's
``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what: Sometimes gay people commit murder, just like
any other people, and if the press is engaged in a conspiracy to
cover up that reality, it's sure done a poor job of keeping Jeffrey
Dahmer and Andrew Cunanan, among others, a secret. The fact is that
plenty of murders don't make the national news, including most of
the 31 gay-bashing killings that the National Coalition of
Anti-Violence Programs has documented since Shepard's death.
</P>
<P>
   A nother little-publicized story: How Benjamin Matthew Williams,
who has admitted participating in 2 of those 31, the July shooting
of a gay couple in Redding, Calif., has rationalized his act. ``I'm
not guilty of murder,'' he told The Sacramento Bee this week in a
jailhouse interview. ``I'm guilty of obeying the laws of the
Creator ... So many people claim to be Christians and complain
about all these things their religion says are a sin, but they're
not willing to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, a determined Jerry Falwell, speaking out in the
media soup of Larry King and Geraldo, might make a difference.
Instead of worrying about his motives, we should cheer on his
embryonic conversion, even as we remind him that his work has just
begun.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Webvan Group, an online grocer that has overcome
several financial and regulatory obstacles, rolled ahead Friday in
its first day of public trading to achieve a market value of $7.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Webvan, at the request of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, agreed to postpone its scheduled stock
offering because the company had disclosed financial information
not included in public documents to select investors in a
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The company was expected to post a loss of $65 million this year
_ high even by Internet startup standards _ and has forecast
operating losses for the ``foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither problems with the SEC nor loss projections have sunk
Webvan, which has been the darling of an investment community
intrigued by the promise of moving the massive grocery market to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Goldman, Sachs, the lead underwriter of the
stock offering, raised the estimated price range to $13 to $15 a
share, from $11 to $13. At $15 a share, Webvan would receive a
capital infusion of $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when public trading started, the stock rose as high
as $34 and ended 65 percent above the offering price at $24.875.
Percentage-wise, the first-day increase pales in comparison with
recent Internet offerings, including Cobalt Networks, which makes
specialized computer servers and whose shares rose to $128.50 from
$22 Friday on its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry analysts pointed out that Webvan's offering
should be considered a success because investors were willing to
pay a high price for an offering of slightly less than 8 percent of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good day for a company of this size,'' said
Brian C. Oakes, Internet industry analyst with Lehman Brothers.
``Now, they need to follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Webvan, whose prospectus is rife with comments about
potential competition from other fledgling online grocers and the
challenges of operating an Internet business, has made it clear
that it faces a difficult task. The company must condition
consumers to buy groceries online, rather than in person, overcome
technological and logistical challenges in delivering fresh food
and rely on the adoption of the Internet as a ubiquitous medium.
</P>
<P>
   The company now operates its online grocery in a single market,
the San Francisco Bay Area, from a 330,000-square-foot, largely
automated warehouse in Oakland. After the grocery orders come in
via the Internet, computer-drive conveyer belts sort individual
orders and bring the food to human baggers for packing.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it generated $4.2 million in Internet sales
from June 2, when the warehouse opened, through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   One Webvan selling point is that its warehouses will enable it
to cut costs from the traditional grocery business while offering
the convenience of shopping online. Still, the initial investment
is heavy. Webvan plans to open distribution centers next year in
Atlanta, Chicago and Seattle, at a cost of $25 million to $35
million each, and to add seven more in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was a healthy payday for Webvan officers, including
Louis Borders, company founder and chairman, whose 28 percent stake
in the company is now worth more than $2 billion. The
second-largest shareholder, Softbank America, a subsidiary of
Softbank Corporation of Japan, owns 15 percent of Webvan.
</P>
<P>
   George Shaheen, who left Andersen Consulting in September to
become chief executive and president, holds 1.25 million shares,
now worth more than $30 million, and options to buy 15 million
additional shares at $8 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Webvan's strategy say that to the victor, go
tremendous spoils. Groceries are a $450 billion market in the
United States, according to Jupiter Communications, a New York
market research firm. Jupiter projects that only $7.5 billion in
groceries will be ordered online by 2003, and that growth will be
slow.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan might ``pave the last mile'' for consumer acceptance of
the Internet as a way to buy necessities, like food and clothing,
said Evie Dykema, an analyst who follows consumer e-commerce at
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``They are pushing forward
the entire e-commerce model.''

ABUSES BY PALESTINIAN POLICE RESULTING IN DEATHS, LAWLESSNESS, SAY
CRITICS

By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ One warm evening recently, five men
speeding in a car through the center of town opened fire on a
20-year-old Palestinian policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, it turns out, also were policemen, members of Force
17, an elite Palestinian unit charged with guarding Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. The five, apparently under the influence of
alcohol, had been pulled over and asked to show their
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they sped away, shooting policeman Ayman Ashouqiya in
the stomach and spine as they fled.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, say Palestinians, is not isolated.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years after the Palestinian Authority first set
foot in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho in August 1994, a
half dozen rival police organizations still operate in a legal
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The result, say critics, has been a string of accidental
killings committed by police misusing their weapons and a thriving
black gun market allegedly run by members of the security forces.
Since the beginning of the year, 12 Palestinians have died in
accidents at the hands of police. Scuffles between various police
factions are all too common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day and everywhere,'' said Hosam Khader, an outspoken
member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, or parliament, who
has pushed for years for police reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we don't have law,'' Khader said. ``Every
security branch works according to his (own) laws and by himself.
And every security branch thinks he's the owner of the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Arafat has done little to address the problem,
preferring to maintain rival security forces with nothing in common
except allegiance to him, human rights organizations allege.
Attempts by some members of parliament to exact laws to curb police
abuses and provide structure to the various security forces have
been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of law has been a constant concern among
Palestinians since the first signs of lawlessness appeared shortly
after the self-rule government was set up. But several incidents in
the past few weeks have created a new sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, undercover police stormed the offices of Maher
Dasuki, a popular Palestinian television talk-show host, arrested
him on charges of ``incitement'' and tortured him for 15 days
before releasing him without trial.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the military prosecutor in Nablus ordered the
arrest of 30 men, many from various security branches, on suspicion
of selling weapons after a butcher in Nablus was shot in the legs
by masked gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the incident in which Ashouqiya, the Ramallah
policeman, was shot in the stomach and survived to point a finger
at members of Force 17.
</P>
<P>
   Police leaders say they need time to organize and train their
men. Under constant pressure to safeguard Israel's security, they
point to successes in that realm _ such as the recent capture of
two wanted Islamic Jihad men who had escaped from a Palestinian
prison _ to buttress criticisms of their domestic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't anyone mention that?'' asked Col. Samih Kanaan,
deputy head of the Preventive Security in the West Bank. ``We admit
there are mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in the beginning,'' Kanaan added. ``The laws and
regulations (governing the police) are still not approved yet.''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years of Israeli occupation and eight years of
``intifada,'' the violent uprising against Israeli rule,
Palestinian young men have been conditioned to lawlessness and
vigilantism, Kanaan said. Police trainers have had to try slowly to
change these attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Preventive Security in Nablus, Kanaan said, he
once sent his men out to make an arrest, only to discover that they
had put on masks and climbed in through a window of the suspect's
house, in typical intifada style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time to change this mentality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian human rights workers scoff at pleas by the security
forces that they need time to train. The real problem, they say,
lies with a Palestinian government that has so far refused to act
to curb weapons abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not taking any serious measures to reduce misuse,''
said Khader Shkirat, a lawyer who directs the Palestinian Society
for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are simply not addressing it,'' he said. ``There's no
political will.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a feud between rival clans in Nablus to find some
political will.
</P>
<P>
   The feud began Sept. 15, when activists from the Balata refugee
camp near Nablus belonging to Arafat's mainstream Fatah party
attended a wedding and were accused of harassing female guests. A
fistfight ensued between the Balata boys and members of the Abu
Sulhiehs, a prominent merchant family from the city.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, three masked men from Balata sprayed semiautomatic
weapons fire at a butcher shop owned by the Abu Sulhieh family,
injuring Bashar Abu Sulhieh in the legs. Abu Sulhieh family
members, also Fatah members, then took to the streets in a show of
force, intimidating people with guns and forcing shops to close.
</P>
<P>
   With a gun problem out of control, Palestinian officials quietly
say, Arafat was forced to act. The military prosecutor and the
mayor, Ghassan Shakaa, ordered the arrest of several Balata camp
leaders and accused them of selling weapons. Most of those arrested
belonged to one of the security branches.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted Arafat finally to do what peace agreements
with Israel require, namely to confiscate illegal weapons. Security
forces deployed in the camp seized unregistered guns during a broad
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   But they admit few illegal weapons were found.
</P>
<P>
   Until the incident happened, buying weapons on the black market
in Nablus was easy. Sellers openly sold pistols and assault rifles
in the narrow alleyways of the casbah, smuggled in from Egypt and
Jordan or purchased from Israeli criminals. Prices ranged from $500
for a small pistol to $3,500 for a Kalashnikov.
</P>
<P>
   Khader, the parliament member, alleges much of the smuggling was
being done by security men and other VIPs, who are issued permits
by Israel that allow them to travel more freely and with less
stringent security checks than ordinary Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pass through Israeli checkpoints in your Range Rover
or your Peugeot and the Israelis cover their eyes,'' Khader said.
``Those who have VIP (cards) can bring guns, gold and even drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Without laws governing the functions of the different security
branches, some Palestinians worry there will always be police
rivalries that lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   And smuggling, which was driven temporarily underground by the
Nablus incident, is quietly thriving. Allegedly in the hands of
some political heavyweights, finding prolonged political will to
stop it may prove difficult, Palestinians say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late,'' said Khader. ``The Authority should register
all the weapons. They should be strong with the dealers. But they
won't. Most dealers are from the Authority.''
</P>

SKEPTICS SEE GOVERNMENT HAND IN US-STYLE MEXICAN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ His country was only days away from a historic
political event, but Guillermo Villalobos wasn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   As he carefully hung Dallas Cowboys jackets next to those
bearing Green Bay Packers logos in his cramped kiosk at a bustling
downtown market called La Merced, the portly 54-year-old vendor
compared this Sunday's presidential primary _ the first in Mexico's
history _ to a professional wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear masks, they pretend to hit each other, and then they
pound their chests to show how strong they are,'' Villalobos said,
mocking the gestures of the real wrestlers. ``But in the end, it's
all a show. And we're supposed to believe it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of authoritarian rule, Mexico's Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) is about to choose its presidential
candidate by directly consulting the public. It's a dramatic change
from the party's usual practice of having the sitting president
choose the candidate, a tradition known as the ``dedazo,'' the big
finger.
</P>
<P>
   While the PRI primary has been one of Mexico's most open and
combative political campaigns, many voters here still can't help
but lapse into the usual skepticism and see this year's warm-up to
the 2000 elections as simply the PRI's greatest hoax.
</P>
<P>
   But this hardly looks like the old Mexico. Since the campaigns
began in August, the candidates have used a variety of US-style
tactics. They've hired US pollsters and political consultants,
slung mud at each other through slick direct mail ads and slick
television commercials, and made cameo appearances on comic variety
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the attention has focused on the two front-runners,
former Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who quit his
post in June to run, and Roberto Madrazo Pintado, the former
governor of Tabasco state, who has used his maverick rhetoric to
repeatedly tweak his rival as ``the official candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has directed most of his advertising venom at Labastida
and the PRI machine, using the slogan, ``Dale un Madrazo al
Dedazo,'' which loosely translated means, ``Give the system a
blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, meanwhile, has repeatedly called Madrazo a liar. Both
have tried to link the other to former President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, whose legacy among Mexicans is sullied by suspicions of
corruption and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials and political experts insist this year's primary
is the real deal, even if the process has been shrouded in
accusations that party leaders have already backed a former
presidential cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real fight, even if it's a little vanilla,'' said
Jaime Gonzalez Graff, a sociologist at the Mexican Institute of
Political Studies. ``But you can be sure the state apparatus is
also working in this.''
</P>
<P>
   History is at the root of many voters' doubts about the
campaign's authenticity. The world's longest-ruling political party
has been better known for its backroom deals and corrupt machine
politics than for championing reform and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the PRI has tried to change that image, partly because
of the growing competition from liberal and conservative opposition
parties, but also in response to President Ernesto Zedillo's
political reform efforts, including his decision last spring to
abandon the finger-pointing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, 57, a thin and graying man with the wooden bearing of
a Mexican Walter Mondale, appears to be most closely aligned with
Zedillo's technocratic approach to economic and political
policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing in most polls through most of the summer,
Labastida has surged forward over the last several weeks, proof,
critics say, that the party's massive machinery is firmly backing
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who have created economic stability, but
they've also created more poverty in our country,'' said Manuel
Bartlett Diaz, the former governor of Puebla state and another of
Labastida's primary opponents. ``If we have a party which is run by
the government rather than by the people, we are going to lose our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the doubt among voters is that all four
candidates are products of the old PRI system and each one carries
significant party baggage, from charges of corruption and links to
drug cartels to election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Labastida served as governor of the northern
state of Sinaloa, one of the country's most notorious drug-infested
areas. Although he was never linked to the cartels, critics say he
did little to stop the state's burgeoning illegal narcotics
business.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected governor of Tabasco in 1994, Madrazo was
fined by Mexico's Federal Electoral Institute for spending $37
million on his campaign, 10 times the legal limit. Zedillo tried to
oust Madrazo, who had also been accused of extensive ballot fraud,
but the confrontation eventually died down and Madrazo stayed in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as interior minister in 1988, Bartlett, 63,
supervised that year's presidential elections between Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and Cuahtemoc Cardenas, a former PRI member who
defected to form the left-center Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD). Those elections became the most controversial in modern
Mexican history after an hours-long computer ``crash'' during the
vote counting handed Salinas the victory.
</P>
<P>
   And Humberto Roque Villanueva, who has trailed all the
candidates in opinion polls, is a former PRI president whose
9-month tenure atop the party was one of the shortest and most
tumultuous in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike US-style primaries, where the winner is determined by the
number of party delegates collected in state elections, Sunday's
primary will be open to all 55 million registered voters, and the
candidate who wins the greatest number of Mexico's 300 voting
districts will carry the party's flag into the general elections
next July.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, nearly everyone agrees that the primary
process, with its stump speeches and appeals to women voters, has
brought the PRI closer to its original populist roots. And
ironically, it is now the PRI which, for the moment, looks more
open and democratic than its major opposition parties, all of which
selected their candidates through internal processes.
</P>
<P>
   But major questions loom for the PRI. The biggest mystery is how
heavy voter turnout will be on Sunday. A poll published in Friday's
Mexico City daily Reforma showed that about half the voters are
unaware of Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   That will likely put more pressure on the country's powerful
unions _ most of which are backing Labastida _ to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But will this new, open process backfire by exposing and
deepening the divisions among the PRI's ideological factions? Will
Madrazo take his rebellious camp and leave the PRI if he is not
pleased with Sunday's outcome?
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been a US-style primary, but it has been the most
open election in Mexico,'' said Juan Enriquez, a Mexico expert at
the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, he said, ``is not a process which has generated a
lot of support for the party. That could create the opposite effect
and it might help the opposition parties.''

L.A. SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT AGREES TO LEAVE POST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After weeks of paralyzing struggles and with a
series of tough decisions looming, the Los Angeles Board of
Education announced Friday that its embattled superintendent had
abandoned his fight to stay on in return for a rich severance
package, and that Ramon Cortines would become his interim
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Zacarias will formally remain superintendent until Jan.
15, but at a news conference here Cortines, 67, the strong-willed
former head of the school systems in New York, San Jose, Pasadena
and San Francisco, left little doubt who was really in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing like a headmaster, he answered questions for Zacarias,
interrupted him at times and, while insisting that he would just be
an adviser for the next few months, said he was there to create a
blueprint for major changes in one of the nation's largest and most
troubled school systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make some changes that need to be made,'' he
said, but added that results would take perhaps five to eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, as the battle to oust Zacarias became more
heated and byzantine, Cortines had seemingly lost patience with the
process and had called the school system here ``the most
dysfunctional district in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that Friday, Cortines said he was referring to what
he termed the disconnect between political demands for swift change
and the realities of trying to alter a huge school system quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Genethia Hayes, the president of the board, which voted 4-3 last
week to try to buy out Zacarias' contract, said in an interview
Friday that while the search for a new superintendent would move
quickly the board expected Cortines to begin to transform the
system as he saw fit, in part because it did not have the luxury of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have another decade to lose,'' said Ms. Hayes, who
took office on July 1. ``If he wanted to be a caretaker I wouldn't
have backed him. We're expecting him to introduce real reform.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the coming months, the school district, with roughly 700,000
students, nearly 70 percent of them Hispanic, must decide whether
to complete construction of a $200 million high school built on a
toxic former oil field, negotiate wage agreements with its unions,
tackle the problem of asbestos in the schools _ one high school was
hastily shut down Friday _ and begin building scores of new schools
that are desperately needed because of overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Hayes said she would consider transforming the
school board's headquarters, on the outskirts of downtown Los
Angeles, into a high school if the troubled Belmont project on the
former oil field is abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   All those comments seemed subtle criticisms of Zacarias' tenure.
Indeed, last month the board of education set in motion the events
that led to his ouster when they hired Howard Miller, a real estate
lawyer, to serve as his chief operating officer, a move that
effectively stripped Zacarias of much of his power.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias had threatened to sue the board, saying it broke state
law and violated his contract when it hired Miller. Zacarias said
Friday that he was not happy about these developments, but that he
finally agreed it was time to move forward. He also said he had
received a severance package totaling about $750,000. Zacarias, who
was named superintendent in 1997, had 18 months left on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best of worlds, I would prefer to stay,'' he said.
``But at the same time we have to consider the best interests of
the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his priorities, Cortines said, would be introducing
courses at middle schools that begin to prepare students for
college, ensure that students receive four years of science
instruction in high school and offer teachers more support and
training.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hayes said that while those were important long-term goals,
the school system had to tackle the immediate problems of
overcrowding and safety, and that the board would actively lead the
way.
</P>
<P>
   She added that another priority was the search for a new
superintendent. In recent years, political realities have dictated
that that person be a Hispanic. She said that would not necessarily
be the case this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of pressure to put a Latino in place, but
what we need is someone who can push the agenda forward,'' she
said, adding, ``We've had two Latino superintendents and, quite
frankly, conditions have not changed.''

   NEW YORK _ What a week it was for true believers in technology
stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average almost doubled its
weighting in technology shares last Monday when it added Microsoft,
Intel and SBC Communications to its 30-company list.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, white-hot technology shares propelled the
NASDAQ composite above the 3,000 mark for the first time. At
Friday's close, the NASDAQ composite was up a blazing 41.48 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, investors are flocking to mutual funds that
invest in technology stocks. For the week that ended on Nov. 3,
almost $700 million went into technology funds, roughly double the
amount that migrated there in other recent weeks. According to AMG
Data Services, assets in equity and technology mutual funds grew
more in that week than they have since the week that ended on Oct.
21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, thinks that this
reflects investors' recognition that the large technology companies
have been the force behind the rising stock indexes. People are
simply putting their money where the movers are.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, given that 25 percent of the value of the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index is made up of technology stocks, the millions of
investors who own index stocks are betting big on the sector.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, the case for technology stocks is compelling.
Everyone knows that the Internet, ever-faster computing
capabilities and connectivity have changed the world.
</P>
<P>
   But some market strategists fear that investors are going
overboard. Valuations of technology stocks are so stretched that
shareholders should consider reducing their exposure to the sector.
</P>
<P>
   And there is another factor to worry about _ the wild card that
is the Microsoft antitrust case. Whatever remedies, if any, are
proposed by the judge in the case will add uncertainty to this
technology bellwether.
</P>
<P>
   L. Keith Mullins, head of emerging-growth research at Salomon
Smith Barney, said: ``My concern is not so much that valuations are
high; my concerns center around whether the expectations near term
can be met. If not, then people will start to re-evaluate the
valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   We have been this way before, Mullins pointed out. Over
different periods, investor euphoria has pushed biotechnology
stocks, shares of semiconductor companies and, more recently,
Internet stocks, to levels that were not sustainable. In all three
cases, the falls from grace were painful.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has not been this hot since 1981, according to
Mullins, who compares the price-to-earnings ratios of technology
stocks to their nontechnology counterparts in Salomon Smith
Barney's Emerging Growth index.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the P/Es of technology stocks are 80 percent higher
than those of nontechnology shares. Only three years ago,
technology stocks traded at a discount of 19 percent to
nontechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors who are concerned about near-term performance ought
to be more careful in putting new money to work,'' Mullins said.
``You're within a rock's throw of a top in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Mullins is wrong and technology continues to shine,
investors should monitor their holdings' reliance on it. ``You
definitely want to own technology, but that's not the only place
you want to be,'' said Doug Cliggott, chief United States equity
strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Cliggott suggested that investors put money in large consumer
companies doing business overseas. Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Colgate-Palmolive are two stocks he favors. With global growth
rebounding, Cliggott said, these companies will benefit.

MICROSOFT VERDICT EXPECTED IN JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(lh) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publication of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings of
fact Friday began a rolling series of filings, hearings and
decisions that could bring the case to a close by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Jackson will ask Microsoft and the Justice Department to
file conclusions of law. These are the legal arguments and
precedents that give the ruling its legal basis. Assuming Microsoft
and the government do not settle the case in the meantime, these
filings will probably be due by early December.
</P>
<P>
   By publishing his findings of fact ahead of the two sides'
conclusions of law _ the reverse of the normal schedule _ Jackson
may find that he is given documents that are more useful for his
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the filings are likely to be aimed directly at
the conclusions in Jackson's findings of fact. Normally, the
litigant's conclusions of law are simply legal elaborations of the
cases they have advocated in court.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Jackson receives these filings, he will issue his
final verdict, probably in January. It will include his own
conclusions of law and his decision on whether Microsoft is guilty
_ or ``liable,'' in antitrust terms _ on some or all of the counts
in the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is found liable, proceedings will be scheduled to
establish the penalty, or ``remedy,'' perhaps as soon as February.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is expected to request briefs and hold a hearing. At the
hearing, the government will advocate its proposed remedy, and
Microsoft will counter with its own proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has not said whether the two sides will be allowed to
call witnesses. But in the end he will decide the remedy, and he is
not bound by the proposals the litigants offer him.
</P>
<P>
   In this circumstance, Microsoft is almost certain to appeal to
the U.S. Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court _ a process that
could take two years.

TEXAS EDUCATION BOARD TELLS PUBLISHERS TO REDO TEXTBOOKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State education leaders officially sent
publishers back to square one Friday, ordering them to produce
additional first-grade story books with high levels of phonics by
Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-5 vote came after two days of bickering that sometimes
turned into personal sniping and two years after publishers were
contracted to develop the first-grade readers under different
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Geraldine Miller of Dallas, who spearheaded the move
to require the higher level of phonics, insisted the new
requirements are ``reasonable'' and would produce better reading
teachers and better students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was incumbent on us to stop and fix the problem,''
Miller said, defending her last-minute changes in the book orders.
</P>
<P>
   Many school districts are already reviewing which first-grade
reading materials they will buy next year, although the publishers
will have to change the materials.
</P>
<P>
   The new first-grade reading textbooks constitute about $34
million of the $235 million in new books in several subjects and
grade levels the board adopted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller succeeded in fending off an effort by Democrat Joe Bernal
of San Antonio to soften the blow to publishers by insisting they
remain on the list of publishers from which local school districts
select books _ even if they do not meet the new requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, however, insisted the publishers have already
voluntarily agreed to make whatever changes the board deems
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not particularly voluntary,'' said Austin Attorney Joe
Bill Watkins, who represents the Association of American
Publishers. ``It is do it our way or commit financial suicide. ...
This is as voluntary as (fictional Mafioso) Don Corleone saying,
`I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse.'''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said publishers are still considering their legal
options.
</P>
<P>
   The board's bickering spilled over Friday into another
oft-contentious area _ the millions of dollars in public school
funds the board turns over to private investment firms to manage.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted 10-5 to strip $300 million in investments that
Houston-based Davis, Hamilton, Jackson &AMP; Associates manages,
despite the board's investment consultant admitting that the
company had the best track record of the 13 firms the state has
hired to manage school investments.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bob Offutt of San Antonio recommended the move,
saying that Permanent School Fund money represented far too much of
the Hamilton, Jackson's client base. He estimated later that the
school trust funds represent about half of all money the company
manages.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats Alma Allen of Houston and Mary Helen Berlanga of
Corpus Christi accused Offutt and fellow social conservative David
Bradley of Beaumont of being racist and vindictive in their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the firm's partners, Alfred Jackson, is black. Jackson
was arrested following the board's September meeting after
Bradley's close ally and informal investment adviser, Brian
Barowski, accused Jackson of assaulting him in the lobby of a state
office. The charges against Jackson, however, were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hamilton, a principal partner in the firm, said Friday's
move was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and five other board members last year also filed formal
fraud complaints against the company with federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn this week advised Board Chairman
Chase Untermeyer of Houston that his office's investigation of
Hamilton Davis found ``no credible evidence of civil fraud on the
part of any investment manager, staff member or consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn also said much of the controversy with the company ``may
be the result of the board not adopting and following sound
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the board accepted a financially troubled
company's decision to resign the four charters it had been granted
to operate schools in Houston and Dallas. Life's Beautiful
Educational Centers notified the board last month that it was
giving up its charters.
</P>
<P>
   LBEC operated one school in Houston, two in the Dallas area and
was scheduled to open another in Carollton. The schools were in
financial trouble and facing state sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The board also agreed to allow another Houston charter school,
West Houston Charter Alliance Inc., to open satellite campuses in
six sports facilities in the Houston area, including two ice
skating rinks and four gymnastics facilities.

FOR EMPLOYERS PITFALLS IN TREATING WORKPLACE DEPRESSION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Va., Ill.)   (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask an experienced manager about the ``reasonable
accommodation'' that employers must provide under the Americans
With Disabilities Act, and you are likely to hear about wheelchair
ramps, Braille signs in the elevator and other physical changes to
assist workers with physical handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   But what does ``accommodation'' mean for workers suffering from
depression? The question nettles employers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Depression, of course, is not simply the blues. It is a
clinically defined mental disorder that is estimated to affect
roughly 1 in 10 Americans over the age of 18, sapping their energy,
impairing their concentration and making them prone to mood swings
and unexplained absences. Add up the work time lost to the illness
and the medical bills for treating it, and by some estimates
depression costs American employers $36.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many a workplace, depression is regarded as a character
flaw rather than a treatable illness, and some employers follow
what amounts to a don't ask, don't tell policy, implicitly
expecting workers to soldier on in silence or be stigmatized as
``not up to the job,'' said Thomas W. Croghan, a research physician
with Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and an associate professor at Indiana
University.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes are part of the reason that the government gets
more disability-act complaints from workers with emotional or
psychiatric impairments than from workers with any other kind of
disability. In preliminary figures for the federal fiscal year
ended Sept. 30, 2,681 of the 17,014 complaints filed with the Labor
Department concerned emotional or psychiatric impairments, and
almost half of those _ 1,278 _ involved depression.
</P>
<P>
   For managers, failure to grapple with the problems of depressed
employees is economically shortsighted, experts say. Several
academic and corporate studies have found that getting depressed
workers into treatment is cost-effective because the workers'
restored productivity, even if not 100 percent, still outweighs the
cost of treatment. ``It'll probably cost you more if you don't
address it,'' said Thomas J. O'Connor, director of PRS Disability
Management, a Falls Church, Va., consulting firm that provides
return-to-work assistance for professionals with depression.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel J. Conti, director of the employee assistance program
at Bank One in Chicago, related an example at his company: An
information systems manager whose job kept him on the road almost
constantly went on disability leave because of depression. When he
wanted to return to work, he was told by his doctor that he would
not be able to travel.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, there seems to be no solution, Conti said. But
a disability coordinator in the program had been monitoring the
manager's treatment during his leave and had kept in touch with
both his physician and his work supervisor. The case manager was
able to win agreement from both on a reduced-travel schedule for
the employee, with an eye toward a gradual increase back to the
pre-leave level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the person back to work earlier in an accommodated
fashion'' than would otherwise have been possible, Conti said,
``and my bet right now is that this person will be able to stay at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a tight labor market, retaining workers, disabled or not, is
a high priority. ``People can't afford, given their investment, to
throw someone away and get someone new,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to depression, he said, the disabilities act
has led employers to focus too much on the risks they face.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are walking on eggshells, so they look toward the safest
way to deal with it, risk management and compliance,'' he said.
``We want employers to embrace employee management.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bank One's case, integration of the employee assistance
program with the company's human resources and benefits departments
makes it easier for the program staff to help managers cope with
difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of privacy protection, though, some companies prefer
to keep more distance between employee assistance programs and
other departments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, applying the law to depression remains a problem for
employers and employees alike. Attempts by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission to clarify how depression fits in under the
law have failed to resolve some important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it is now applied, the ADA only partially accommodates the
needs of depressed workers,'' researchers concluded in a recent
study published in the September-October issue of Health Affairs, a
journal of health policy.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that a growing number of employers believe that
they should encourage a worker with depression to seek treatment,
but that they often hesitate because of concerns about how to
approach the employee. And they are not sure what the law requires,
an uncertainty that employees share. Especially blurry is whether
the act applies in cases where medication can keep symptoms of
depression in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is unclear as to where the need to accommodate ends,''
said Croghan, the Lilly research physician, who was an author of
the Health Affairs article.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point to a recent United States Supreme Court decision
in which two airline workers whose impaired vision was correctable
were found not to be protected under the law. The courts might
apply the same reasoning, the experts say, to depressed workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression is extremely treatable,'' said Peggy R.
Mastroianni, associate legal counsel for the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. ``To the extent that these cases give them
less protection, it is a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Mastroianni said, depressed workers may find that they
still have protection under the ADA if they have a record of
disability or if their medication creates side effects that hamper
their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Chai Feldblum, a law professor at Georgetown University Law
Center who helped write the disabilities act, said the Supreme
Court ruling meant that ``greater attention will be given to the
absurd Catch-22 created by this law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mastroianni said the commission expected to issue more
guidelines on depression soon. Whether or not they turn out to be
helpful _ some consultants say the commission's past efforts have
only muddied the waters _ they are further evidence of heightened
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many companies are still struggling with the how-to of
dealing with depression in a proactive way,'' said Gregg O. Lehman,
president of the National Business Coalition, which provides
information to employers on how to buy health care coverage for
workers. ``But increasingly, companies are embracing the fact that
we have to do something.''

BIDDING WAR IS LIKELY TO UNCORK DRUG STOCKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Questions may be italicized) 
(af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Redd Foxx, the comedian, once observed that health nuts were
going to feel stupid someday, lying in the hospital dying of
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to call a business with more than $130 billion
in sales worldwide dead, but until the end of September drug stocks
did not have much life: as measured by the Amex Pharmaceuticals
Index, from the start of the year through Sept. 29 the group was
down more than 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks started to wake up in October. Last week, investors
became even more interested when Pfizer made an $82.4 billion bid
for Warner-Lambert, casting doubt on Warner's friendly merger
agreement, worth more than $70 billion, with American Home
Products.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Larry N. Feinberg, managing partner of Oracle
Investment Management, which manages about $600 million in hedge
funds and private equity exclusively in health care companies, was
not buying drug stocks. He is now. Feinberg took some time last
week to talk about the industry's problems and prospects. Here are
excerpts from the conversation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the mid-1990s drug stocks were crushed by fears about the
Clinton health plan and then roared back. What has ailed them this
year? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Drug stocks have lagged this year because of economics,
politics and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   From an economic point of view, fears of rising inflation have
not helped, because if interest rates are backing up, then
price-earnings multiples are suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A political issue is the biggest cloud over the industry, and
one of the keys there is the Medicare prescription drug benefit.
There is a big political push to get the elderly covered for
prescription drugs. This fear of government regulation implies
possible price controls by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has caused concerns about drug utilization and
benefit management. Historically, the thing that has been really
striking about the health care industry is the lack of information
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are entering a period where a number of companies are
hooking up health information systems with doctors. The net impact
of that is that drug utilization will get controlled more, and
cheaper drugs, where applicable, will be used more often. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It seems these are real concerns. Yet you are positive on
drug stocks. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We are past the bottom and are beginning to turn up. For
demographic and technological reasons, the health care industry
will be the world's great growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we have entered a tremendous new product cycle. At the
moment we have new drug categories like osteoporosis, breakthrough
drugs for certain cancers. The first two flu drugs have just been
approved. These are huge new markets that are opening up, and we
are just at the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   The next big wave will be based on genomics, as we get more
answers to what genes turn on and off and why that happens. That
will lead to customized drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the effort to curb costs intensifies, expensive drugs
are not going to go away. If they are better than generics, paying
for them is still better than putting people in the hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your sense of the struggle for Warner-Lambert? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Both Pfizer and American Home Products are good fits with
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products has a great drug pipeline. Warner-Lambert
doesn't have much of a pipeline, but it has good products. The
Pfizer bid, which will be hard for American Home Products to match,
is more of a strategic combination in that it gives Pfizer a better
position in the cardiovascular business.
</P>
<P>
   But the real key to this is that this is the trigger that will
open the floodgate to further mergers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which companies are more likely to combine than others?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Anybody who wants to get bigger is a candidate, so you could
include everybody in the industry. There are tremendous cost
savings to be realized.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious merger candidates are those that need help, a
list that includes Novartis, SmithKline Beecham and Pharmacia
Upjohn. I wouldn't put it past Merck to do a deal. In the next five
years there will be fewer, bigger players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So which stocks do you like? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We own Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has a great drug pipeline,
American Home Products and biotechnology companies like Amgen,
which is selling at a multiple comparable to the drug companies but
is spending twice as much on research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the drug companies, the big opportunity for investors
is business-to-business commerce in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in this area include Medical Manager, CareInsite,
which has the former management team from Medco Containment;
Healtheon; and IDX Corp.

HELMS BACK, POLARIZING AND POWERFUL AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He has ejected Democrats from his office, run over
a reporter with his electric wheelchair, and rekindled a
controversy over racism on Capitol Hill. And that's just in the
last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Jesse the Body. This is Senator Jesse Helms. And not
since 1997, when he blocked William F. Weld's nomination to become
ambassador to Mexico, has Helms caused this much excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after forcing the former governor of Massachusetts to
withdraw his ambassadorial bid, Helms last month trained his sights
on another target, former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, an Illinois
Democrat, threatening to block her nomination to become ambassador
to New Zealand unless ``at the very minimum, she apologized for
criticizing the Confederate flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms ultimately allowed Moseley-Braun to plead her case Friday
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he heads. And
after her appearance before the panel Friday, with Helms absent, it
appeared her nomination would go through.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process, Helms, a North Carolina Republican, caused
an uproar among female and minority representatives, reviving old
debates over race and gender. He also proved, at age 78, what few
in the last decades have doubted: that he was still a polarizing,
and powerful, force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was arrogant, and petty, and small,'' said Representative
Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, one of nine women from the
House of Representatives who held a demonstration march Friday to
the Senate hearing room. ``He proceeded in a very personal
fashion...It was a personal grudge. And thankfully, he finally got
past that.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms did not explicitly rescind his request to have
Moseley-Braun apologize for her 1993 speech on the Senate floor
attacking Helms's request to renew a patent to a private group, the
United Daughters of the Confederacy, in order for the group to use
the Confederate flag in its logo.
</P>
<P>
   But neither did Helms repeat his initial demand, reported in the
Roll Call newspaper on Oct. 18. Later that week, Helms said he was
troubled by the ``ethical cloud'' hanging over Moseley-Braun,
following an investigation into her personal use of campaign funds
and her trips to Nigeria when she was a senator.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter from the Chicago Tribune repeated the question
about the Confederate flag, Helms told him he was ``not worth a
damn as a journalist.'' Helms, who has used an electric scooter
since having knee surgery, then ran over the foot of a reporter
from the Raleigh News &AMP; Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, he refused to meet with a group of House
Democrats when they showed up at his office to demand a hearing on
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Helms had stalled the nomination process for weeks, suggesting
he might not move it forward, and demanded that the White House
turn over paperwork connected to a 1995 IRS request for a grand
jury investigation into Moseley-Braun's personal use of campaign
funds. That grand jury investigation never took place, and
Moseley-Braun said Friday that any inconsistencies in her
bookkeeping from the 1992 Senate race was due to the disorganized
nature of her grass-roots campaign. The total of unreconciled
funds, she testified, was $311.28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it takes to put a stake in the heart of a
nasty rumor,'' Moseley-Braun told the Foreign Relations Committee
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, Helms and other Republicans also raised
questions about trips Moseley-Braun made to Nigeria as a senator.
Because she had visited then-dictator Sani Abacha, ruffling some
feathers among State Department officials, critics suggested the
senator acted in opposition to US foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But she rebutted those accusations, too. Responding to a
question from Senator Paul Coverdell, Republican of Georgia,
Moseley-Braun said she ``meant no harm to anyone.'' No one on the
committee suggested otherwise, and the 1 1/2-hour hearing ended in
accolades from the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, however, did not attend Friday's hearing, instead turning
it over to the appropriate subcommittee chairman, as is his normal
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues took his consent to hold a hearing as a sign the
confirmation would move forward. But most speculated Helms's
silence Friday was only out of concern for election-year politics,
as GOP leaders worried his opposition to the first black woman
senator would taint other senators' campaigns. And even Democrats
were careful to not to describe Helms's apparent change of heart as
a victory for Moseley-Braun _ apparently conscious that he retains
the power to put a hold on the nomination before the full Senate
can vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Helms had every right to hold a hearing as the
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,'' said Representative
Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas. ``I'm just grateful he did
that.''

THE EDUCATION OF GEORGE W. BUSH, AND THE VOTER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One afternoon last week, flying high above
northern Texas, Gov. George W. Bush eagerly displayed the tome he
was reading, ``Titan,'' a 774-page biography of John D.
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pronounced himself a serious history buff as he toyed with
the ribbonlike marker that tracked his progress _ a souvenir, he
said, from one of his favorite events, the annual book fair here.
</P>
<P>
   But a day later, standing with his wife, Laura, near the front
porch of the governor's mansion, he hit a decidedly different note.
Someone congratulated Mrs. Bush for an award that she had just been
given by her alma mater, Southern Methodist University, and asked
the couple if Bush had ever received a similar distinction from one
of the schools that he attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they honored me,'' Bush said, with a touch of mischievous
pride, ``the teachers might boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerebral or simply sensible? Intellectual or visceral? Closet
bibliophile or class clown? As Bush, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, presents himself ever more
fully to American voters, he often seems uncertain about which
image to underscore, which card to play.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, more than any other, Bush comes across as a
work in progress, a balancing act that has yet to find its
equilibrium. Perhaps that reflects his own genuinely split
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it anticipates the ambivalence of American voters and
their appetite for candidates who stake some vague middle ground
between uncommon erudition and common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely where on that spectrum Bush falls _ a determination
with potentially important consequences for his candidacy _ was the
subject of considerable attention this week.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the New Yorker magazine published Bush's academic
transcript from his undergraduate years at Yale University, a
document that Bush and his advisers had previously declined to
release. The report card showed him to be a solid C student.
</P>
<P>
   Then a Boston television reporter surprised Bush during an
interview on Wednesday with a pop quiz on foreign leaders. Bush got
just one of four questions right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shrugged it off Friday. ``People can trick me with, trip me
up with questions,'' he said in an interview with ABC News, adding
that the American people simply ``want somebody who they trust to
lead the world to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pretty much echoed that sentiment and, in
remarks that seemed at least somewhat sympathetic to Bush, said
that the Texas governor would probably learn the names he should
know soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said that most voters would probably see the
situation that way as well, but that Bush ran a serious risk if he
seemed too cavalier about what he did and did not know. And if
questions about the seriousness of his engagement with substantive
matters became a theme so dominant in discussions of him that they
eclipsed his affability and his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Packaged by the right opponents, repeated the right number of
times and the right ways, that issue might take on real momentum,''
said Bruce Buchanan, a professor of presidential politics at the
University of Texas who has closely monitored Bush's political
ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that while Bush's performance on the pop quiz
itself seemed irrelevant, and the quiz itself was arguably
inappropriate, ``I think there are some legitimate questions about
whether Bush is truly up to speed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan added: ``Can he get sufficiently well prepared to
be ready for a Bush inauguration? In principal, I think yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's refrain in the past has been that there are blind spots
in his experience and familiarity with some issues, but that those
could be corrected by the right advice from the right advisers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Bush and his aides have been quick to show that he is
catching up, filling in the blanks, cramming for the exam. They
have been forthcoming about the parade of out-of-town experts _
from former Secretary of State George Shultz to Condoleezza Rice,
the former provost of Stanford University _ who have traveled to
the governor's mansion, where Bush gets private tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments, particularly in regard to foreign policy,
Bush has zestfully volunteered long answers to voters' questions,
taking his audience around the world in 80 phrases that strenuously
assert his geopolitical command.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to, love to,'' he said to man in Meredith, N.H., this
week who asked him if he would care to share any of his thoughts on
foreign policy. Bush started with China: ``As opposed to being a
strategic partner, China is a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded to Russia: ``We should not be putting good money
after bad into the country of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   He landed briefly in Israel: ``It is important for us to honor
our commitment to the sole democracy in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he dwelled for a while in Mexico, saying that a way to stem
illegal immigration was to foster economic development there.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we've got to do a better job of enforcing our border,''
Bush said, ``it's important for people in this country to
understand that people come here to work, to put food on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush takes this kind of thing only so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a defiant streak in him, and I think he still has
contradictory impulses,'' said Buchanan. ``He knows he needs to
study, but there's something in him that doesn't care for the
earnestness or fussiness of that expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Buchanan and other political scientists said, may be
one of his most appealing attributes to American voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want somebody who can understand the issues, but they
also want somebody who can relate to them,'' said Darryl West,
chairman of the political science department at Brown University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While there are times when Bush conspicuously bucks any
perception that he lacks intellectual curiosity, there are at least
as many times when he acknowledges, and indulges, any impression
that he is more salesman than scholar, and engaged in details only
to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the governor's mansion last week, he was asked if he was
ready for an education speech that he was scheduled to deliver four
days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have to write it,'' Bush said with a twinkle, a smile
and the clear implication that he was not the one holding the pen.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of a moment on the campaign trail months
earlier when Bush jokingly told reporters that he was lingering
with them to avoid another policy briefing from his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Those advisers send their own mixed signals. Frequently, they
portray Bush as someone who is intricately involved in the
operation of his campaign and even an unheralded policy maven. But
they conversely praise him as someone smart and trusting enough to
carve out a general vision and let others sweat the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And in this regard, unlike most others, they are not always on
the same page. After one adviser said that Bush can frequently be
found with his nose deep in a book, another quipped, ``Maybe the
Bible.''

`PROFESSOR' BRADLEY MEETS MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``What is love,'' Bill Bradley, the presidential
contender, asked Friday, ``in a larger context?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic Bradley moment _ a politician posing a
professor's question, an enigmatic close to his discussion of how
important it is to live up to the expectations of the people who
care _ your teachers, parents and friends.
</P>
<P>
   His audience of middle-school students, however, didn't know
quite what to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   They also seemed a little surprised at the copiously detailed
answer he offered to a smart question from a student: ``If you're
giving free health care, are taxes going to rise up?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's reply went on for several minutes, culminating in the
hope that internet technology would ultimately yield huge savings
in health care administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the students at Roxbury's Nativity Preparatory School seemed
entranced when Bradley stuck to their concerns _ and his life
story.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley decided to visit the school during his campaign swing
through Boston Friday because its stress on values, service and
rigorous academics impressed him. The 63 boys, in grades 5 through
8, have a school day which begins at 7 a.m., when they clean the
small Roxbury schoolhouse, and ends at 9 p.m., after a supervised
two-hour study session.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Alfred J. Hicks asked the boys to welcome Bradley
despite his playing for ``the dreaded Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley then launched into a parable about a hermit and stories
about sports, including this one: ``Michael Jordan got cut from his
high school team...but he made himself a great player by
practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also stories about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the adults listened attentively, as if this were a
Sunday sermon or their grandfather retelling a story about his
childhood. The students leaned forward in their chairs and looked
up at him. One asked for his autograph, provoking a crush of little
signature seekers at the end of the hour-long event. Bradley
obliged.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a student asked who his role models were.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recalled his father, who was immobilized by spinal
arthritis, and his mother, who tied the patriarch's tie and made
sure her son studied; there were also some teachers who sparked his
interest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bradley held a press conference to introduce
his volunteer state committee leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he chose Harvard professor Cornel West, his
campaign advisor on race for his ``depth of understanding''; his
former on-court competitor, Celtics star John Havlicek, who ``still
feels my fingerprints on his back''; former Congressman James
Shannon, ``a valuable counselor'' who served on the US House Ways
and Means Committee with Bradley; and Nikki Tsongas, widow of the
late US Senator Paul Tsongas, whose low-key, cerebral 1992
presidential bid is often compared to Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lived through what I'm living through,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsongas said it's Bradley's ``willingness to be very
honest...that is very compelling. That's what I valued in my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither West nor Havlicek attended the announcement.

A MUTUAL FUND RIVAL ON THE TRADING FLOOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7)

purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

<P>
   Anemic cash flows. Competition from electronic brokers. Flagging
share prices for asset management firms. All in all, it is not a
happy time for the mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   And now, fund companies are facing increased rivalry from a
relatively new type of investment product _ exchange-traded funds,
or ETFs, which invest in a variety of indexes and provide ordinary
investors with a level of flexibility typically available only to
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The new investments feature low annual expenses and _ most
important _ an efficient tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ETFs may just be the kind of better mousetraps that
could spell trouble for traditional fund families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mutual fund companies need to respond to this,'' said Jim
Novakoff, a partner with Levitt, Novakoff &AMP; Co., an investment firm
in Boca Raton, Fla. ``They cannot ignore exchange-traded funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Assets in ETFs listed on the American Stock Exchange, where
almost all of them are traded, have risen from $2.40 billion three
years ago to $23.38 billion as of Oct. 31. And new offerings have
grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that the ETFs are attractive to short-term
investors. Unlike mutual funds, which can usually be bought only at
the end of the trading day, ETFs can be traded throughout the day,
sold short or bought on margin or with a limit order.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts argue that they also offer advantages to the
long-term investor. They say the exchange funds are beginning to
erode the market share of traditional index funds, among the
fastest-growing fund categories. The shares of Amex's ETF that
track the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, called SPDRs and
pronounced ``spiders,'' now have well over $14 billion in assets,
which would rank the fund among the top 30 domestic stock mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to construct a model portfolio for you,'' said Geoff
Bobroff, an industry consultant in East Greenwich, R.I., ``I'd say
that for domestic equity I'd be foolish not to propose a SPDR or a
`Diamond,''' which tracks the Dow Jones industrials.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, big financial firms have been dabbling in these
funds. Merrill Lynch helped develop Select Sector SPDRs, which
track industries, and recently introduced a tradable fund called
Internet HOLDR's, which, technically, is not an ETF because its
portfolio is fixed, not indexed. Salomon Smith Barney has applied
to the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer an Internet ETF
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global Investors, the world's largest institutional
manager, already manages 17 country-specific ETFs known as WEBs. It
plans to offer a staggering array of such funds early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The best sign that ETFs are packing a punch is that the Vanguard
Group, the index fund giant, is considering offering them. `We've
been looking at them for a few months,' said Brian Mattes, a
spokesman. ``They seem to have a lot of potential and therefore
warrant more study.''
</P>
<P>
   Novakoff said his investment firm has been directing long-term
investors toward these funds primarily because of their tax
efficiency. In contrast to conventional mutual funds, institutions
buy and sell ETFs by exchanging their shares for the stocks of the
underlying index. The swapping process eliminates the generation of
capital gains for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   SPDRs, for example, do not make capital gains distributions. By
contrast, the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which tracks the S&AMP;P 500,
has billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains. Its annual
distributions have been quite small, but are often taxable.
</P>
<P>
   But ETFs have associated costs that traditional funds like
Vanguard's do not. One is a small amount of cash drag on the
portfolio because dividends are reinvested quarterly or monthly
rather than daily, as they are with most mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting performance difference is small, but it gives an
edge to traditional funds for long-term investments in tax-deferred
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Because they must be bought and sold through a broker, investors
in ETFs also have to pay commissions. This means that for an
investor who uses dollar cost averaging _ say, investing a fixed
dollar amount each month _ the brokerage costs of ETFs may outweigh
the tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Novakoff says, is that investors storing a
taxable lump sum will do a bit better with an ETF than with
Vanguard's extra-low-cost funds, while those using dollar-cost
averaging or having tax-deferred accounts will get better returns
in Vanguard's funds. But he noted that very few index funds matched
Vanguard's low costs or tax efficiency. ETFs handily beat most
other index funds, which are almost always more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   George U. Sauter, who oversees Vanguard's index funds, concedes
that SPDRs perform more or less in line with the Index 500 for
taxable investments. But he said that Vanguard still had an edge
and that he did not expect major competition from ETFs for
Vanguard's base of long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at them as having a distinct marketplace,'' Sauter
said, referring to the ETFs. ``We recommend them to short-term
investors.''

 &HT;    A gift to the world's kids
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ The organization administering Atlanta
businessman Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to U.N. programs on Friday
announced its largest round of grants yet _ $51 million dollars
dedicated primarily to improving the health of children around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The list of grants by the United Nations Foundation was released
in Maputo, the Mozambique capital, where the foundation's board,
which Turner chairs, finished a meeting it began earlier in the
week in Cape Town, South Africa. The board, which has an
international membership, came to Mozambique to view U.N. projects
in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our fifth round of funding and we are delighted with
the growing quality and focus of project proposals from the U.N.,''
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth, the foundation's president, said
this round of grants was the largest for several reasons: The
board, working with the U.N., identified children's health as one
of a few strategic areas in which the foundation could make a
difference, and the board wanted to designate a significant amount
of money at one time to that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Wirth said, the $51 million means the foundation has
disbursed $200 million so far, in line with Turner's desire to
donate $100 million a year. And the proposals the foundation is
receiving, Wirth said, are more in line with the foundation's
desire that they be innovative and promote cooperation between
different U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our programing is getting sharper and better,'' Wirth said.
``Everybody is learning as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   The grants announced Friday, all of which go to one or more U.N.
agencies, fall into three broad areas _ children's health,
environmental protection, and helping women and controlling
population.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health grants were:
</P>
<P>
   _ A total of $8.2 million to five interrelated projects to
prevent the leading causes of death for children younger than 5 in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ $5 million over three years to strengthen monitoring of
vaccine-preventable diseases, primarily in West Africa. The board
also made three other grants totaling $3.1 million to strengthen
delivery of vaccinations in African countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ $4.4 million to three projects to supplement the diet of
children in Africa with micronutrients, including vitamin A, iron
and zinc.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.3 million to two programs to fight HIV infection and AIDS
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2.7 million to two programs to protect young people from
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.5 million to help eradicate Guinea worm in Africa. The
grant is to UNICEF, but the U.N. organization will work in ``close
partnership'' with the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which has led
the global fight against Guinea worm.
</P>
<P>
   The grants related to the environment were:
</P>
<P>
   _ $2.9 million to help protect the biodiversity _ different
species of plant and animal life _ from the ravages of war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

AIR CANADA TAKEOVER BID ENDS AFTER COURT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Onex Corp. scrapped its hostile takeover effort for
Air Canada late Friday after a Quebec judge ruled earlier in the
day that the conglomerate's proposal would violate ownership limits
on the country's dominant airline.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Justice Andre Wery of Quebec Superior Court ended
an intense 10-week brawl and came hours after Onex had sweetened
the price it was offering Air Canada shareholders for the second
time since it had made the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Onex said it was withdrawing the takeover bid because of the
judge's ruling, which concluded that the proposal would violate a
law that limits a single shareholder's voting stake in Air Canada
to 10 percent. Onex's chairman, Gerald Schwartz, had said that if
Onex lost the court decision, ``it's all over for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Onex had proposed buying Air Canada and the carrier's smaller
rival Canadian Airlines and merging them in a deal valued at 2.2
billion Canadian dollars (about $1.5 billion). Air Canada had
counter with a proposed $1.1 billion Canadian dollar buyback of 36
percent of its shares and the purchase of Canadian Airlines, which
it would run as a separate airline. Either proposal would reshape
Canada's aviation industry, putting management of the two major
airlines under one corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Milton, president and chief executive of Air Canada,
called the judge's ruling a victory and said its own proposal to
shareholders still stood. But at a news conference with reporters
at Air Canada's headquarters in Montreal, Milton said the brawl
with Onex had been a wasteful ordeal that should never have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected suggestions that the Onex bid had benefited Air
Canada shareholders by contributing to a 25 percent gain in the
value of the shares since the takeover effort began Aug. 24. Milton
said that the company's share price had been rising anyway and that
now ``our management group is going to get on with what we had been
incredibly sidetracked from.''
</P>
<P>
   Onex had first proposed buying the airline at 8.25 Canadian
dollars ($5.61) a share, which it had subsequently sweetened to
17.50 Canadian dollars (about $11.90) a share. Air Canada's share
buyback is valued at 16 Canadian dollars a share.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada shares closed on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 10.90
Canadian dollars a share Friday, up 5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Onex's proposal had sought Air Canada shareholder
approval to change the airline's common stock into a new class of
restricted voting shares. Temporarily removing certain voting
rights of the stock would have allowed Onex to skirt the 1988
Canadian law that limits ownership in the airline.
</P>
<P>
   That law was enacted by the Canadian Parliament when it
privatized Air Canada. Lawyers for the airline had argued that the
purpose of the law was to ensure that ownership was not
concentrated in the hands of a few shareholders after the
government sold it.

CLINTON, HASTERT AGREE TO SEEK BILL TO AID POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton's national campaign to help
struggling communities, a journey that began on a scorching July
afternoon in the hills of Appalachia, ended on a hopeful note on a
chilly autumn evening in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare appearance with House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an
Illinois Republican, Clinton said they had agreed to enact
legislation to spur economic development in urban and rural
communities that have been left behind in the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The two men vowed Friday to ``put aside politics and ideological
constraints'' in the interest of bringing new equity capital, tax
incentives, and other tools to impoverished areas, according to a
joint statement that left the details for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we ought to do together,'' Clinton told an
assembly at Englewood High School on Chicago's South Side. ``We all
have a stake in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said, ``This isn't politics. This is about
people...There are some things that politics can transcend.''
</P>
<P>
   Their appearance brought down the curtain on Clinton's second
anti-poverty tour, a two-day swing that took him to Newark;
Hartford, Conn.; Hermitage, Ark.; and Chicago. His tour last summer
covered seven cities in four days, stretching from Appalachia to
the Mississippi Delta to a South Dakota Indian reservation to the
Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton used the first tour to lead a delegation of
corporate and government leaders to show them the investment
potential that exists, the second was intended to highlight
examples of partnerships between government and corporations that
are helping revitalize poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   His argument is that it's in the self-interest of American
businesses ``from Wall Street to Silicon Valley'' to invest in poor
communities to foster an inflation-free economic expansion, and
that government should provide them with incentives to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Back in July, in his closing speech, Clinton said: ``The real
test of the success is not whether I have got a great legislative
idea, but whether Congress will set aside its partisan difference
and put that idea into law so we can have more investments in these
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a political atmosphere in which America's wealth has
allowed the issue of poverty to creep back on the national agenda,
including the presidential campaigns of both Republicans and
Democrats, the White House and the GOP-controlled Congress have
offered ideas to help rebuild urban and rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will combine elements from Clinton's ``New
Markets'' initiative and the American Community Renewal Act
supported by Hastert and sponsored by Republican Representatives
Jim Talent of Missouri and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what we call it,'' Hastert said. ``I don't care
what label we put on it. If it's going to help people and help
communities, that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House plan is intended to spur $15 billion in new
investments in poor communities through a series of tax credits and
loan guarantees. The Republican proposal would provide nearly $1
billion in tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Democrats and Republicans do fight a lot,'' Hastert
said. ``And when there is a time to agree and a cause to agree
about, we can come together and make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``We have decided to seek common ground and higher
ground because it's the right ground for these children's future to
stand on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Clinton were joined on stage by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who has accompanied the president on every stop of both
tours, a gesture Clinton returned by ending his second tour in
Jackson's adopted home city of Chicago and stopping by a small
business in the congressional district of Jackson's son, Jesse
Jackson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Englewood neighborhood, which Hastert toured four months ago
with Representative Bobby Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, has a
14.8 percent unemployment rate _ more than three times the national
average _ and half the people are on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton visited Hermitage, a rural community
of 644 people in his home state of Arkansas, where he saluted a
partnership involving 18 farmers who formed a cooperative that
provides tomatoes to Burger King restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the cooperative produced sales of nearly $4 million
on 570,000 cartons of tomatoes, including 88,000 that were sold to
the fast food chain. The US Department of Agriculture guaranteed
the cooperative's loan for processing and packaging equipment.

 &HT;    Atlanta-bound Delta jet lands in Knoxville
 &HT;    By Andrew Meadows
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Delta Air Lines flight from Columbus, Ohio, to
Atlanta made an unscheduled landing near Knoxville, Tenn., after
the plane's cabin failed to pressurize correctly Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing 757 carrying 177 passengers landed at McGhee Tyson
Airport outside Knoxville around 6 p.m., said Mark Neuhart, a
spokesman for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhart said one passenger from Flight 323 was taken to a
hospital complaining of a sinus problem and was later released.
</P>
<P>
   Although oxygen masks were deployed during the descent, Delta
spokesman John Kennedy said he wouldn't call it an emergency
landing.
</P>
<P>
   He said emergency fire crews in Knoxville were not called to the
scene of the landing.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhart categorized the Delta passengers as ``unnerved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were unnerved both because of the rapid descent and the
deployment of the oxygen masks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said a different Delta jet carried the passengers to
Atlanta after a three-hour delay. He said the airline probably
would compensate the passengers, but could not say what form the
compensation would take.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot could have flown the plane to Atlanta, Kennedy said,
but regulations mandate landing at the nearest jet airport.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plane had been serviced and was flying again Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he did not know the source of the pressurization
problem, but that neither the Federal Aviation Administration nor
the National Transportation Safety Board planned to investigate.

MEDICAL SOCIETY CHIEF CHALLENGES CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Long-festering resentments between academic doctors and
private practitioners emerged with rare candor Friday as the
Massachusetts Medical Society launched into public debate over
governance of its New England Journal of Medicine, the publication
that produces most of the medical group's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack T. Evjy, the medical society's president, threw down a
gauntlet to critics in academic medicine who argue that the medical
society may jeopardize the good name of the New England Journal in
its drive to launch new publishing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Demanding more ``accountability'' from journal editors, Evjy
told medical society members that efforts to guarantee more
autonomy for the journal's next editor emanate from ``a small
number of your editorial staff and some members of the academic
community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a struggle for the very control of the New England
Journal of Medicine _ your New England Journal,'' Evjy told
applauding members of the medical society's rank and file, who are
largely private practitioners rather than academicians.
</P>
<P>
   Later in an interview Evjy said that the journal's financial
success was largely ``an accident of history'' rather than due to
the efforts of its editors.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, speaker after speaker opposed several
measures to guarantee the independence of the journal's next
permanent editor, erect a buffer committee of medical and public
health deans to adjudicate future disputes between the journal
editor and the medical society, and de-emphasize the organization's
drive to expand its publishing arm.
</P>
<P>
   The medical society's House of Delegates will vote on the
proposals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The only concession to recent criticism over the New England
Journal came at the start of Friday's sessions, when Dr. Barry
Manuel resigned from the committee charged with finding a permanent
replacement for Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, who was fired last summer
as the New England Journal's chief editor.
</P>
<P>
   The medical society's ethics committee announced Friday that it
had unanimously cleared Manuel of any conflict of interest stemming
from his position on medical society councils at a time when the
society granted exclusive rights to New England Journal content to
HealthGate, an Internet company in which Manuel owns a considerable
amount of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said Manuel did nothing improper because he did
not participate in the decision to contract with HealthGate, but it
advised him to recuse himself from future deliberations involving
HealthGate or its competitors. Manuel resigned from the search
committee anyway, saying his presence was becoming ``a
distraction'' to the panel's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Evjy and others said that power struggles and personal
resentments have been mounting for years between medical society
officials, based in Waltham, and New England Journal editors, whose
office is perched atop Harvard's Countway Library of Medicine in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Many within the group alluded to the ``dysfunctional''
relationship between the medical society's officers and top
executives and Kassirer.
</P>
<P>
   Evjy said confidentiality restrictions prevent him from
discussing the real reasons why Kassirer was fired, but he said ``I
can tell you what it was not about.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer's departure was not about ``branding,'' the use of the
journal's ``brand name'' to enhance other products, Evjy told the
delegates. ``It was not about commercialism . . . and it's not
about profits. It is a struggle to justify taking control of the
journal away from you _ to move control away from the broad
profession of medicine to the will of a few.''
</P>
<P>
   House of Delegates members applauded when Evjy said the New
England Journal's position as the world's pre-eminent and most
profitable medical journal is ``in substantial measure because of
you, and not in spite of you.'' At his conclusion, the delegates
gave Evjy a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, the interim New England Journal editor in
chief, and Dr. Arnold S. Relman, Kassirer's predecessor, pleaded
throughout the day for support of the resolutions to safeguard the
next editor's independence and preserve the editor's traditional
prerogative to veto commercial use of the journal's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking to see if we reaffirm our standards or if
we're caving . . . to financial pressures,'' said Dr. Allan Gorrell
of Massachusetts General Hospital, defending a resolution to give
the next New England Journal editor the same authority over the use
of the journal's name that Angell negotiated last summer as a
condition of taking the job.
</P>
<P>
   Others expressed resentment over the implication that they are
seeking commercial gain at the expense of the New England Journal's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to review this resolution without some degree
of outrage,'' said Dr. James Kenealy of Framingham, referring to a
proposal to pull back on new publishing ventures. ``We do not
profit from this. We do not seek ever-increasing income. This is
not a discussion about entrepreneurialism but about our educational
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Kenealy noted, however, that the medical society has
recently had to draw on its investment income to support
operations, for the first time in recent memory. ``This looks like
it may be the case for some time,'' Kenealy said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an atmosphere of conviviality, Carol
Moseley-Braun, the former senator from Illinois, appeared before a
Senate committee Friday in her quest to become ambassador to New
Zealand and helped push aside allegations of impropriety that have
shadowed her for years.
</P>
<P>
   Politely prodded by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., who said, almost
apologetically, that he wanted to give her a chance to clear the
air, Ms. Moseley-Braun addressed criticisms about her meetings with
a former Nigerian dictator and pointed to reports discounting
accusations that she had misappropriated 1992 campaign money for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, the first black woman elected to the Senate,
fielded the questions from senators on the Foreign Relations
Committee so handily that her confirmation seemed all but assured.
A committee vote could come as early as Monday, followed by a vote
in the full Senate later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators on the panel were quick to bolster Ms.
Moseley-Braun's assertions with Federal Election Commission audit
reports and other evidence turned over to the committee at the
request of its chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. In its audit, the
commission concluded that it had unearthed evidence of sloppy
bookkeeping and an unreconciled credit card amount of $311.28 for
personal expenses, far short of the thousands of dollars in the
original accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also showed that the Justice Department chose not
to prosecute the charges, despite two requests by the Internal
Revenue Service, because the IRS was relying on uncorroborated
reports to make its case, the senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it takes to put a stake in the heart of that
kind of nasty rumor,'' said Ms. Moseley-Braun, who seemed to
delight in her return to the Capitol, where a group of supporters
awaited her. ``It wasn't true when it was first said, and it isn't
true now.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign accusations and the criticism surrounding Ms.
Moseley-Braun's trips to Nigeria contributed to her 1998 election
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. of Delaware, the senior
Democrat on the committee, who helped steer Ms. Moseley-Braun's
nomination, said he was confident that the hearing had addressed
all concerns about possible ethical lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I hoped we established today is the integrity of
this nominee is beyond question,'' Biden said after the hearing.
``The bottom line is it is a $311 difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing took place after three weeks of theatrics that
pitted the powerful chairman of the committee, Helms, against Ms.
Moseley-Braun, who in 1993 delivered a rousing Senate speech
against his amendment concerning a Confederate emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, and the ensuing rejection of the amendment, were not
forgotten by Helms, whose cantankerousness and procedural prowess
are legendary. At first, Helms threatened to stall the nomination
and suggested in a Capitol Hill newspaper that he wanted an apology
from Ms. Moseley-Braun for what he called in 1993 a ``political
ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   His reaction triggered numerous protestations from Democrats,
including President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Many of Ms.
Moseley-Braun's friends in the House and Senate began casting the
episode as a racist maneuver by a man who held a personal grudge
against the former senator. Ms. Moseley-Braun, they said, was due
the same considerable courtesies extended other former senators.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' Republican colleagues, eager to avoid a cavalcade of
criticism, made it clear that they wanted the nomination to go
forward. After requesting and receiving a series of documents about
the accusations, Helms scheduled a hearing. He did not preside over
the hearing Friday, choosing instead to attend to other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Democrats took pains to compliment Republicans for their
swift attention to the matter. At one point, the hearing grew so
frothy with mutual declarations of respect and affection, the
amused chairman, Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said, ``We're getting
out of hand here.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties were so eager to dispense with the
nomination that the hearing lasted little more than an hour. When
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., alluded to an IRS memorandum,
which, according to a Democratic aide, contained a racist reference
to African-Americans, Biden quickly cut him short and said, ``I'd
like to get her confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   After a smattering of questions about lamb quotas and defense
issues regarding New Zealand, it was left to Coverdell to ask the
thorny questions _ ``sticky wickets,'' as he called them _ about
her campaign money and visits to Nigeria, for which she was
criticized by the State Department and a number of prominent
African-American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun replied that she made two trips to Nigeria as
a senator at her own expense, and met with an array of government
and religious officials, including the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
Saying she has always fought for human rights, Ms. Moseley-Braun
cast her visits as an attempt to foster greater democracy in that
country since she knew many of the leaders personally.
</P>
<P>
   She said other lawmakers had ``traveled to less than p.c.
countries and the controversy and the problems never rose to this
level,'' to which Dodd pointed out that Helms once met with the
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. ``I meant no harm to anyone,''
Ms. Moseley-Braun said. &QL;

<P>
   It was a case in which 26 witnesses put forth a bewildering
number of contradictory viewpoints as fact, in which a videotape
sullied the legendary brilliance of the world's wealthiest man, in
which thousands of e-mail messages offered in evidence at times
made various figures in the case look greedy, ruthless, egomaniacal
or just plain dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   All this was handed not to a jury but to a single federal judge
whose job it was to determine what was fact and what was not.
Friday he made his calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp. in
the landmark antitrust suit produced witnesses that portrayed the
software giant as an overreaching monopolist, wielding its market
power to thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the government said, prodded industry partners and
rivals to favor its products over competing software and bundled
its free Internet browser into its industry-dominating Windows
operating system in a predatory scheme that threatened the
long-term welfare of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft produced witnesses who portrayed the company as a
tough but legal competitor whose innovations had fueled the
nation's technology boom, to the benefit of the economy and
consumers. Where the government alleged illegal arm-twisting,
Microsoft saw hard bargaining and commonplace business deals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a courtroom duel that Justice Department lawyers
dominated from the opening day of testimony, on Oct. 19, 1998, when
they showed the first of several installments of a taped deposition
of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates that was taken the previous
summer. The video, projected bigger than life on courtroom
monitors, was a disaster for the defense, depicting one of the
world's most respected businessmen as a surly, combative,
uncooperative witness who often said he had forgotten writing the
memos, e-mail and directives being shown to him.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did things improve much for Microsoft as the trial went
forth. The government presented as witnesses top executives of the
nation's most successful computer companies, each of whom in turn
told a different tale of the playground bully.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Barksdale, president of Netscape Communications Corp.,
testified that Microsoft had offered to divide the browser market
and that when Netscape refused, Microsoft withheld technology and
muscled PC makers and Internet service providers into deals that
hobbled Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Colburn, senior vice president of America Online, told
the judge that Microsoft had made his company an offer it could not
refuse: a featured place on the Windows desktop _ the most valuable
real estate in cyberspace _ in return for making Microsoft's
browser the default choice for its millions of subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Avadis Tevanian, senior vice president of Apple Computer,
testified that Microsoft had threatened to stop developing
productivity software for the Macintosh unless Apple favored
Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Steven McGeady, vice president of Intel, Microsoft's longtime
partner in the so-called Wintel duopoly that dominates the personal
computer market, said Microsoft threatened to strongly support
rival chipmakers if Intel developed multimedia and Internet
software.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft's turn came in December, it produced witnesses _
most of them its own executives _ to counter those claims with more
positive portrayals of the events in question.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rosen, the company's general manager, called Netscape's
assertion that Microsoft had tried to divide the browser market
``'either fabrications or the products of a fundamental
misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, said his company's deal
with America Online did not require its subscribers to choose
Microsoft's browser. He also testified that America Online's recent
purchase of Netscape created a new and potent competitor to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Engstrom, Microsoft's general manager, said the company had
tried to persuade Apple to use Microsoft's technology. But he said
this had been an effort at technological cooperation and not an
attempt to hinder competition or divide markets.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, a group vice president, said Intel had pulled back
from its multimedia software efforts because the software was
designed for a previous version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But the most memorable thing about the testimony of Microsoft's
witnesses was not what they said to counter the government's
witnesses as much as how they often withered under
cross-examination by the government's lead trail lawyer, David
Boies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 12 very powerful witnesses to tell our side of the
story,'' William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for
law and corporate affairs, had declared on the courthouse steps as
the defense opened its case.
</P>
<P>
   A silver-haired, patrician lawyer, he stood ramrod straight in
front of the courthouse, an air of absolute certainty in his voice.
And, like every member of the Microsoft team, Neukom portrayed
unwavering confidence throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the merits of the case, it's going very well,'' he insisted
immediately after several of Microsoft's darkest moments in court.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious example was an attempt to counter government
testimony from Edward W. Felten, a Princeton University computer
scientist, who had demonstrated a program that he said stripped the
Internet Explorer browser from Windows. This suggested that Windows
and the browser were separate programs and not one, as Microsoft
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   James Allchin, a senior vice president, came to the stand armed
with a videotape that was supposed to prove that the browser had
been so tightly integrated into the Windows 98 operating system
that it was impossible to remove.
</P>
<P>
   But under questioning by Boies, Allchin was forced to concede
that, unknown to him, the video had been pieced together from shots
of programs running on several different computers and thus did not
really show the impact of deleting the browser.
</P>
<P>
   Allchin returned to court several days later with a new tape,
but by then his credibility had been seriously damaged.

 &HT;    Cubs get cozy at Atlanta Zoo
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They sniffed. They frolicked. They napped. They sipped
some water. They munched on bamboo and apples.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly every move they made was cheered by Zoo Atlanta staff
members who spent the better part of Friday celebrating and
watching the long-awaited giant panda cubs, Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen cameras are mounted in the cubs' $7 million habitat,
allowing the staffers a constant view. There were lots of ``oohs''
and ``aahs'' _ like sounds people make when watching fireworks _
when the pandas moved, nuzzled, ate and drank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, they're going through a gate side by side,'' said Zoo
Atlanta marketing director Gail Eaton, and the crowd burst into
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The pandas arrived Friday morning on a special ``Panda Express''
United Parcel Service flight from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of dignitaries, zoo officials and reporters cheered,
smiled and hugged when the UPS B-767 Panda Express jet touched down
at 9:33 a.m., then pulled up to a cargo hangar under the spray from
two huge water cannons. More cheers came when the plane stopped.
More when a cargo hauler was raised to the cargo bay. More when the
pandas tried to glimpse the crowd through steel mesh at the top of
their cages. And still more when the cubs, Lun-Lun first, then
Yang-Yang, were slowly loaded into separate UPS Panda Express
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The two trucks, followed by two backups, went by motorcade to
the zoo, led by an escort of Fulton County police on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarian Rita McManamon, who accompanied the pandas from
China, was pleasantly surprised at the bears' behavior at their new
home. The solitary creatures had been expected to retreat to their
own cubbies, but their shyness wore off, and they soon were
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem very, very comfortable,'' said an exhausted
McManamon. ``If they have jet lag, it doesn't show. I'm more tired
than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   She was gleeful that the cubs were spending so much time
together. The zoo hopes the cubs will one day mate, and pandas must
learn to play before making hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are friends. They like each other. That bodes well for
the success of breeding,'' McManamon said.
</P>
<P>
   The pandas will be kept in their indoor habitat until they get
used to it. That could take a day, or a week. Nobody knows for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   A few people may get an early look, however. Parties for zoo
donors are planned Nov. 15 and 16, and reporters will visit Nov.
18. Even then, if the pandas are being shy, the guests and
reporters will see them only on closed-circuit TV monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo plans to open its panda exhibit to zoo-goers Nov. 20.

MOBIL CHIEF: OIL PRICES TOO HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ The chairman of Mobil Oil suggested Friday that
current oil prices are unrealistically high, called talk of any
future global oil shortage ``inane,'' and said Vice President Al
Gore wants to drive Mobil out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In a freewheeling hourlong session with cadets of the
Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Mobil chief executive Lucio A. Noto
took an unusually strong shot at Gore, who Noto said has ``a
philosophical belief that the world would be better off if we
didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore and some of the people around him would like to
legislate us out of business,'' Noto said. ``They think we are sort
of endemically bad people, and we have no respect for our customers
and no respect for our environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been a leading voice of concern about possible ``global
warming'' because of air pollution from petroleum use and
industrial activity. He has been pushing for the United States to
sign the Kyoto compact ordering the US and other countries to
reduce their production of so-called greenhouse gases by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore presidential campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, attributed
Noto's hostility to those positions and also Gore's proposal two
weeks ago to ban all future offshore oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this completely expecting some big oil interests to
attack us,'' Lehane said, adding that Gore makes no apologies for
helping create ``the cleanest environment in a generation while
also creating 19 million new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto, a 37-year Mobil veteran and son of Italian immigrants from
Brooklyn, is set to step down after Mobil's pending $82 billion
merger with Exxon. He indicated he thinks Gore has plenty of
company in disliking his firm, saying, ``We're known as polluters,
we're known as price gougers, we're known as tough monopolists, but
at the end of the day, you couldn't live without us,'' said Noto.
</P>
<P>
   Noto had little comment on the companies' progress reaching a
deal with Federal Trade Commission antitrust regulators. The FTC
reportedly wants the number one and number two US oil giants to
divest 1,600 service stations _ including all Exxon stations in New
England _ so the combined company cannot monopolize the
northeastern market. A combined Exxon-Mobil would control about 22
percent of US gasoline sales, and up to 40 percent in states such
as Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with the FTC ``are continuing,'' Noto said in a brief
interview after his speech. ``We've given them about as much
information as we can. We hope the process will be coming to an end
soon. We're looking forward to putting the two companies together''
but will continue to use both brand names.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to cadets as part of a new program bringing top
corporate CEOs to campus, Noto put in a plug for the Exxon deal.
``By allowing Mobil and Exxon to get together, we can create the
kind of technical and financial powerhouse that can go develop more
resources out of the OPEC'' areas, referring to Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries nations, such as Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, the US consumer is best served by having
OPEC's power reduced,'' Noto said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the waterfront academy's Admirals Hall, Noto had
many other observations on everything from the price and supply of
oil to the likelihood of Y2K panic triggering 1970s-style gas lines
next month.
</P>
<P>
   As recent oil prices have edged up to $15 to $18 a barrel, Noto
said, ``I think the price of oil has gotten ahead of itself. . . .
I think it's anticipating a very cold winter. I think it is
anticipating a lot of discipline on the part of the oil producers''
to keep prices high.
</P>
<P>
   Noto said he fears ``some media hype'' about the possibility of
Y2K computer problems could cause severe problems if panicked car
owners try to fill up on New Year's Eve and hoard extra gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody in the United States decides to fill up their
tanks . . . we're going to have lines, we're going to have
shortages, and we're going to have runouts. The fuel distribution
system in the United States cannot serve 100 percent of the
customer base in 24 hours. It has nothing to do with Y2K.'' Noto
said Mobil has spent $500 million in the last 12 months to get
systems Y2K-ready.
</P>
<P>
   On issues of future supply, Noto declared, ``You should never
make a decision based on the idea the world is going to run out of
oil. It's an inane proposition, an inane proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   In most wellfields barely 30 to 40 percent of the barrels have
been extracted, because the rest ``are not considered to be
produce-able because of cost and because of technology,'' Noto
said. But he predicted that in the next 20 years cost-effective
technologies will emerge to pull up stranded supplies, saying, ``I
don't have any doubt that we can go out and harvest'' them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every facet of my industry, there is a lot more capacity
than is needed,'' from oil reserves and refineries to pipelines and
service stations, Noto said. ``The only time you're going to get a
short-term shock is because of war or catastrophe.''

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1970

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American economy demonstrated once again last month its
remarkable ability to absorb nearly all the people seeking a job
and yet not pay much more to get them.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in
nearly 30 years, the Labor Department reported Friday. But the
average wages of workers below the rank of supervisor went up just
one cent an hour last month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a strong economy and nearly full employment, the
inflationary pressures that usually foreshadow the end of an
economic expansion have not yet emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American economy is turning out to be more flexible and
dynamic than anyone had thought possible,'' said James Glassman, a
senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices rose in response to the employment news. The Dow
Jones industrial average closed at 10,704.48, up 64.91 points. The
mild wage number and an equally mild inflation report earlier this
week suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve's
policy-makers may be less inclined to raise interest rates at their
next meeting, on Nov. 16, and more likely to be restrained in the
future even if they push up rates modestly this month in an attempt
to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hailed the latest employment figures
as evidence of the success of administration policies. ``We are
drawing more and more people into jobs by making work pay,'' said
the secretary of labor, Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Labor Department report suggested that the economy
may be slowing gradually. The nation's employers added 310,000 jobs
to their payrolls in October, the most for a single month since
July. But employment growth averaged only 160,000 a month for
August through October, down from 210,000 in the first half of the
year. In recent weeks, retailers and auto dealers have reported
that sales gains are slowing. Home sales and new construction have
fallen from their summer peaks. And the consumer confidence polls
show a gradual drop since midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No forecaster sees a recession ahead, but most do see more
modest growth in the year 2000 than in 1999,'' said Gary Thayer,
chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, an investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth was strongest last month among temporary workers, who
accounted for 45,000 of the 215,000 service sector jobs added to
the rolls. Government employment, particularly in education, also
grew strongly, while jobs disappeared in retailing and, once again,
in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many companies scrambled to recruit enough workers from
among the 5.8 million people who seek work. They represented an
unemployment rate of 4.1 percent, down from 4.2 percent in
September and the lowest since January 1970, when it was 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The steady decline in unemployment over the last five years has
spread across every group, bringing jobless levels to their lowest
levels in years for Hispanics, whites, blacks, adult men and
teen-agers. The unemployment rate for adult women fell to 3.5
percent in October from 3.7 percent the month before _ the lowest
level since 1953, the Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   What is amazing in all these numbers is the failure of wages to
rise, flatly contradicting established economic theory. Most
economists expected, as unemployment fell below 5 percent, that the
scramble to find enough workers would force employers to bid up
wages at an accelerating rate. But the 5 percent line was breached
in mid-1997 and nothing has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is perplexing that the economy can persist at such low
unemployment without wage inflation,'' said Robert Gordon, a
Northwestern University economist.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists argue that American corporations, through new
technologies that improve efficiency, have managed to obtain a lot
more output from employees for the same number of hours worked. The
additional revenue from this output of merchandise and services
helps to explain how companies have managed to remain profitable
without raising prices. And indeed, the Commerce Department
reported on Tuesday that as the economy expanded briskly in the
third quarter, its inflation index rose at an annual rate of only
1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But productivity fails to explain why companies don't find
themselves forced to raise wage scales to attract enough workers.
And they have resisted doing so, according to Labor Department
data. The average wage for production workers _ now $13.37 an hour
_ was up only 3.6 percent for the last 12 months, a pace that is
actually slower than earlier in the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A broader measure, covering benefits as well as wages, has been
similarly mild. Only when income from stock options and recruiting
bonuses are included does compensation begin to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are nascent indications that we will see
stronger wage gains going forward,'' said Mark Zandi, chief
economist for RFA Dismal Sciences, a consulting firm in West
Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that wages no longer respond as they once did
to a scarce supply of workers. The work force, for example, is
aging and unemployment among older, settled workers is always lower
than among young people. Then, too, the rising number of temporary
workers give jobs quickly to the unemployed and give employers a
pool of people to draw from without having to bid for permanent
hires.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting this demand, temporary workers now total 3.1 million,
or 2.4 percent of the 129.3 million people employed in October. Few
other groups of workers have grown as rapidly in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in union membership and bargaining power has
softened wage demands. So has the decline in the inflation rate,
which has made workers more willing to accept smaller raises, many
economists say. Then, too, immigrants are feeding many more people
into the work force than the government's numbers now capture,
Gordon says. And the failure of the minimum wage to rise in step
with inflation has taken pressure off wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely do we have a single explanation for a major change in
the economy,'' Gordon said. ``We never came up with one bullet to
explain the productivity slowdown that came upon us in the 1970s,
or the Great Depression.''

YUGOSLAVS REJECT U.S. PROPOSAL FOR LIFTING SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav government has dismissed a
new American proposal for a partial suspension of sanctions in
return for early elections. It says the offer would not be honored
if the government of President Slobodan Milosevic was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on the conditional nature of the American offer and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's insistence that Milosevic
could not possibly win a fair election, government spokesmen and
media outlets asserted that the Americans would recognize only a
vote that the government lost.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting some of Yugoslavia's democratic opposition
leaders, Albright announced in Washington on Wednesday that the
United States would suspend embargoes on oil deliveries and flights
to Belgrade if Milosevic held early, free and fair elections.
Clinton administration officials previously said that all sanctions
would continue as long as Milosevic remained in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it really, really, really hard to believe that
Milosevic might win a free and fair election,'' she said. ``If my
grandmother had wheels she would be a bicycle.'' Senior American
officials said that if an election was not free and fair _
essentially, one that the Milosevic coalition won _ then the
sanctions would not be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic himself is not at risk in any possible election. He
was elected by the Yugoslav Parliament for a four-year term that
expires in 2001, though it is possible that a new Parliament might
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Americans, the only free and fair elections are those won
by their lackeys,'' said the Yugoslav deputy prime minister,
Vojislav Seselj. Ivica Dacic, the spokesman for Milosevic's
Socialist Party, said, ``Those who went to see the murderers of our
children should know that they could not win here, not even if
Madeleine Albright counted the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Milosevic himself referred contemptuously to the
opposition leaders, praising the unity of ``all citizens'' in the
struggle to rebuild the country. ``The exceptions are so minor they
are not worth mentioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the American policy shift was intended to boost the
flagging opposition to Milosevic and keep it united behind the idea
of early elections, Washington managed to create new tensions
between opposition leaders, some of them said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington praised the unity of Milosevic's opponents, but the
opposition is not united and is actually continuing to splinter.
</P>
<P>
   And some European diplomats suggested that Washington's new
strategy was also intended to keep the oil and flight embargoes,
which most members of the European Union want to lift immediately.
These sanctions were tied to the Kosovo conflict, which is over,
the Europeans say. By tying their suspension to fair elections,
Washington has tried to force the Europeans to keep the sanctions
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   While the opposition wants early elections on all levels _
local, Serbian and federal _ the Milosevic government is likely to
legislate early voting next year only for local elections. Such a
move could undermine and further split the opposition if some
parties boycott an election and others take part.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The State Department welcomed leaders of the Alliance for
Change, led by the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, in a
visit arranged by Freedom House, a human rights organization. But
no one invited Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal
Movement, the largest opposition party, and the man whose strategy
of early elections Washington has now embraced after rejecting it
for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, who faces criticism from colleagues who believe his
strategy of daily rallies has hurt their party and nearly
bankrupted it, went to Washington to shore up his credibility at
home, party officials acknowledge. Djindjic is pressing the
alliance members to run a single slate of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But his efforts have caused the Alliance for Change to splinter.
Some parties, like the Social Democracy Party, led by former Gen.
Vuk Obradovic, and Democratic Alternative, led by Nebojsa Covic,
have left the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   By granting this policy shift to Djindjic and Dragoslav
Avramovic _ the 80-year-old candidate for prime minister for a
transitional government that no one expects to be named _
Washington badly offended Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and Djindjic already despise each other. In an
important local battle, Draskovic, who controls Belgrade and the
city television station, Studio B, feels that Djindjic has been
trying to embarrass him in the Belgrade City Council and even
arrange for the Serbian Parliament to take over the city on an
emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj, the deputy prime minister, and Milosevic's party have
previously threatened Draskovic with criminal investigations of
city business to keep him from organizing street protests calling
for Milosevic's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is putting great stock in an opinion poll done for
the National Democratic Institute, an American organization, that
many local pollsters think is wrong about the likely vote that the
Alliance for Change would garner. Srdjan Bogasavljevic of the
Strategic Marketing Media Research Institute here, one of the
country's most reliable polling groups, says that his figures show
Milosevic's party with about 20 percent of the likely Serbian vote,
the Alliance for Change with about 16 percent (half what the
American poll indicates), Draskovic's party with about 7 percent
and Seselj's party with 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial figure, Bogasavljevic said, is the ``don't knows,''
who represent 33 percent of the electorate, while another 14
percent say they won't vote at all. Of the ``don't knows,''
Bogasavljevic said, most match the profile of Milosevic voters, and
71 percent of them watch the state television news.

DRUG MAKER'S RIVALS REAFFIRM BIDDING PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While it remains the highest offer, Pfizer Inc.'s bid
for Warner-Lambert Co. lost some of its appeal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's stock slipped 6.7 percent, and so did the value of its
proposed stock swap. By the end of the day, Pfizer's offer was
worth $86.875 a share, while American Home Products Corp.'s
proposed merger with Warner-Lambert was valued at $81.95 a share.
Warner-Lambert's shareholders indicated that they expected more, as
the stock ended the tumultuous week at $89.938.
</P>
<P>
   The rival bidders for Warner-Lambert hardened their stances,
reaffirming their commitments to complete a deal and taking steps
to wage proxy and legal fights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors focused on the prospect of a sweetened
offer from one or more of the companies in this struggle or from
another drug industry titan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a boardroom in this industry where people are not
looking at what merger or acquisition they could make,'' said
Joseph Zammit-Lucia, the chief executive officer of Cambridge
Pharma Consultancy. ``The question, though, is which ones could
they actually make happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, the Swiss drug giant, is widely expected to consider a
combination with American Home Products, but analysts said they
could not eliminate any company as a target. Shares of most major
U.S. drug makers _ notably Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Schering-Plough and
Eli Lilly _ rose sharply on the week. Shareholders reveled in the
gains in drug stocks, which have languished this year after a
turbocharged performance in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts and industry executives say it is difficult to
handicap the likely victor in the race for Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer faces several problems, including the lawsuit it filed
Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court against Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products. The lawsuit seeks to dissolve certain
antitakeover provisions, including a breakup fee of $2 billion and
Warner's right to issue more stock to block an outsider from using
a favorable accounting method for an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race to the courthouse is not for a legal edge,'' said one
large investor who asked not to be identified. ``It is for a media
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Warner-Lambert said the company's board ``is
quite disappointed with the mischaracterization by Pfizer of its
dealings with Warner-Lambert.'' The company said it believed the
lawsuit was ``totally without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's letter of interest said it was prepared to offer 2.5
shares for each Warner-Lambert share, but it stopped short of
actually making the offer, a move investors questioned. But people
close to the companies said Pfizer had hired two proxy solicitation
firms Friday, a first step in waging a battle for Warner. In
response, Warner and American Home are considering hiring firms of
their own. And many investors are bracing for a protracted fight.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise is still possible, but Pfizer might have to sweeten
its offer, including some price protection to offset any decline in
its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would raise complex
questions about their joint agreement to develop and market
Warner's key cholesterol drug, Lipitor. It is hard to value the
agreement because the companies do not disclose how they divide
profits. Second, it is not known whether the hostile bid from
Pfizer could disrupt the marketing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions are being asked at Warner-Lambert, people
close to the talks said. The company is reviewing whether Pfizer
has violated their agreement with its proposed offer.
</P>
<P>
   But critics and advocates of the proposed merger agree that if
Warner-Lambert shareholders had to vote immediately on a
combination with American Home Products, the answer would mostly
likely be no, putting some pressure on Warner-Lambert's management
and board. Warner-Lambert's chief executive would have the leader's
role in the combined company, something highly unlikely if the
company were swallowed by the much larger Pfizer. Wall Street's
opinion of the choice was summed up in a joke making the rounds
among traders Friday: While a combined American Home Products and
Warner-Lambert would be jointly named AmericanWarner, a combined
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would be jointly named Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products also seems to be vulnerable. The company
would be a good fit with Novartis, stock analysts say. The two both
have enormous holdings in pharmaceuticals, consumer products and
agricultural businesses.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products had become leery about an offer from
Novartis, people close to the company said, and adopted a poison
pill last month to ward off unfriendly bids. Novartis executives
have repeatedly denied that they have any interest in American Home
Products.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Novartis is the world's second-largest drug maker
behind AstraZeneca, it has little presence in the United States.
Novartis had $10.6 billion in worldwide drug sales last year,
according to the industry consultant IMS Health, but only $3.9
billion in the United States, the most profitable market. In U.S.
sales, it ranks ninth, behind far smaller companies like
Schering-Plough and Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this merger activity, and the drug stocks rising, the
market is expecting some takeovers or mergers of equals,'' said
Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with Ryan, Beck, Southeast
Research. ``Some of these companies may run and get together with
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug executives flinch at the prospect of the giant research and
development budget that would be created by Warner-Lambert merging
with either of its current suitors. A combination with American
Home would raise Warner-Lambert's research budget to $3 billion
from $877 million last year and a deal with Pfizer would bump it up
to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are enormous, considering that Merck, one of the
industry's most successful companies, spent $1.8 billion last year
on research and development. With increasing pressure to develop
new drugs that can dominate a market, pharmaceutical companies may
be forced to merge just to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   The likely targets are several. Shares of Lilly rose 11.8
percent last week. The stock closed on Friday at $77, up 87.5
cents. Schering-Plough's shares increased 14.5 percent last week.
The stock rose $1.6875 on Friday, to $56.6875, a 52-week high.
Shares of Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn jumped 10.3 percent last week. The
stock rose 50 cents on Friday, to $59.50, also a 52-week high.

CHALLENGING THAT CHEESEBURGER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Va.)   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine that you're a trial lawyer. You've noticed that
Americans are getting fatter, and that the government blames
obesity and inactivity for more than 300,000 premature deaths every
year. You've also noticed that scientists believe fatty foods kill
people, and that fast-food outlets are selling cheeseburgers with
both hands.
</P>
<P>
   You pilot your late-model Mercedes into the drive-through lane,
risking grease stains on the leather upholstery. You make a
purchase and discover that fast-food packaging is mute as to a more
important risk. Nowhere does it say that eating a bucket of hot
wings could result in serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   So you sue, hoping to win millions on behalf of heart patients _
as well as potential heart patients, who claim compensation for the
worry that all those cheeseburgers may someday give them heart
disease. Better yet, perhaps the states, unwilling to regulate
cheeseburgers, will retain you to sue on behalf of the taxpayers,
who have had to foot the public health bill for all the
cheeseburgers they can't stop eating.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched? Why? The same line of reasoning underlies the
litigation that has succeeded so spectacularly against the tobacco
companies; similar suits are pending against manufacturers of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connection between cigarettes and guns,'' says Richard
Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University who founded the
Tobacco Products Liability Project to spur lawsuits against the
industry, ``is that both used political influence to escape safety
regulation, and eventually people got tired of that and turned to
the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right, and at first it is easy to applaud the plaintiffs'
lawyers who brought the suits. But are guns and cigarettes really
the same? For better or worse, Americans have the right to bear
arms, the government already regulates guns, and it's at least
debatable whether guns, unlike cigarettes, really do more harm than
good. Besides, our experiences with outright prohibition of
dangerous products like alcohol and drugs have been terrible.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not the merits of gun control (which I advocate) or
smoking (which I abhor). The point is, who decides? Despite the
role of money in politics, government can regulate harmful products
whenever there is the political will to do so. So it is puzzling to
find governments as plaintiffs in product liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre to go to court and ask for relief from the fact
that you have the wrong laws,'' said Daniel Polsby, a law professor
at George Mason University.
</P>
<P>
   Consider global warming. When coastal cities find themselves
building dikes to keep the waves at bay, why not sue Exxon and
General Motors over their role in changing the world's climate? And
why wait until the waters start rising? The science on global
warming is already substantial, but having good science on your
side is no prerequisite for suing, as the makers of silicone breast
implants (and their unfortunate shareholders) well know.
</P>
<P>
   By the lights of modern jurisprudence, it would make perfect
sense for ``victims'' of fast food and climate change to sue, and
the sooner the better: they might even succeed at deterring
substantial harm. One claim against gun makers is that they failed
to take the steps they should have to make sure that weapons aren't
used improperly.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, 15,935 Americans died in alcohol-related car
accidents, and the auto industry for years has known how to install
devices that could make it more difficult for someone impaired by
alcohol to start a car. Why isn't the plaintiff's bar assaulting
Detroit on that point?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is just that they haven't gotten to it yet. At the
moment, another target is in their sights: HMOs. The lawyers see
themselves as protectors of innocent patients against profit-hungry
corporations bent on rationing care. If the lawyers succeed (their
first case is against Aetna), HMOs may indeed change the way they
do business. But premiums will inevitably rise, forcing more
Americans to join the 44 million who already lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That's the trouble with letting lawyers and juries tackle social
problems that elected officials can't seem to solve: when the buck
is passed to the courts, the outcome may never suit anyone but the
lawyers. Consider the Supreme Court's record. It upheld slavery
until the Civil War made its decisions moot. It tried to paper over
racial segregation with the ``separate but equal'' fiction, and
when that failed, ordered public schools integrated, yet de facto
school segregation persists. Roe v. Wade has hardly laid the
abortion debate to rest.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that lawyers, judges and juries can do any
better with guns or global warming (or gluttony). But if the
political system remains paralyzed by money and cynicism, it
shouldn't be surprising if the courts try. &QL;

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
__ Time: 6:05 p.m., Civic Stadium (capacity, 30,000). 
__ TV/Radio: No TV; KCSN-FM (88.5). 
__ Records: CSUN 5-3, 4-2; Portland State 7-2, 5-1. 
__ Series: Portland leads 11-7. CSUN won last year 32-28 at North
Campus Stadium. 
__ Injury update: CSUN: QB Marcus Brady (ankle), RB Jaumal Bradley
(foot), WR Aaron Arnold (shoulder), OL Julio Alcala (ankle) are all
probable. Ol Javier Ortiz (knee, ankle) is questionable. OL Joe
Bergman (knee), DB Kwasi English (hamstring) are out. Portland
State: OL Maurice Horton (concussion), DB Ron Granderson (leg) are
questionable. 
__ Keep an eye on: CSUN cornerbacks Chazz Moore and Mel Miller.
These two seniors feel they have the capability to play in the NFL
and they will be put to their strongest test of the season. The
Vikings feature the Big Sky's leading receiver in Terry Charles,
who has 1,142 yards and 10 TDs, and an all-conference pick last
year in Orshawante Bryant (49 catches, 659 yards in '99). PSU QB
Jimmy Blanchard hasn't had an interception in 278 attempts _ a
Division I-AA record and two away from tying the Division I mark
held by Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer. 
__ Portland State update: The Vikings are second in the Big Sky,
one-half game behind Montana (6-1) and one game ahead of CSUN,
which is in a two-way tie for third. PSU, which is is 4-0 at home
and ranked 15th in I-AA, rallied from a 21-0 deficit last week to
beat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 42-28.

STOCKS AND BONDS IN STRONG RESPONSE TO JOBS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Financial markets applauded a government report
released Friday that portrayed a slowing economy with no
discernible increase in inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that the unemployment rate for October fell to 4.1
percent, the lowest level in nearly 30 years, traders pushed bond
yields, which had been falling all week, even lower. And stock
prices, especially technology and financial service company shares,
registered a broad advance.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the jobs report provided another piece of evidence
that the economy, which barreled ahead in the summer, is slowing
down, thereby reducing the need for the Federal Reserve Board to
raise short-term interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds have certainly tilted against any action'' by the
Fed, said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International. ``There is not a very compelling case to do anything
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond yields moved lower within minutes after the employment
report was released, continuing a dramatic downward spiral that
began less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on of the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.05 percent
from 6.10 percent Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite
direction from the yield, rose 19/32, to 101 1/32.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices moved sharply higher early in the session, but gave
up some of the gains later in the day. Despite the selling, the
closing numbers remained impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index rose rising 46.34 points, or 1.5
percent, to 3,102.29. It was the sixth consecutive record high for
the NASDAQ, which closed above the 3,000 level for the first time
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gains of more than 2 points in American Express and J.P. Morgan
helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average by 64.84 points, or
0.61 percent, to 10,704.48. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
gained 7.59, or 0.56 percent, to 1,370.23. And the Russell 2000
index of smaller company stocks gained 2.51, or 0.57 percent, to
442.41.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the bond market rally on Oct. 26, the Dow
average has gained just under 4 percent; the S&AMP;P 500 is up nearly 7
percent; and the NASDAQ has risen 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The gains were recorded on heavy trading. Just over a billion
shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the
NASDAQ was 1.33 billion shares, the sixth-busiest session in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in interest rates has measurably improved the mood
of investors in the stock market. For the week, the NASDAQ
composite index rose 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the S&AMP;P 500 managed only a half-percent increase. And
the Dow Jones industrial average, which added four new stocks this
week, lost ground, falling 25.38 points, or two-tenths of a
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The data released this week appear to make it less likely that
Fed policy-makers will vote to raise short-term interest rates at a
meeting scheduled for Nov. 16. But some economists said there is
still a real chance the central bank could tighten monetary policy.
And traders said that at this juncture stocks could be vulnerable
to a further increase in rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a case that with the weakening in housing
indicators, the decline in car sales and the October employment
data, things are slowing down,'' said Stephen Slifer, chief
economist at Lehman Brothers. ``But we are still looking for a
tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co., said that
if the stock market ``gets the news we expect, which is that the
Fed is standing pat, we are poised to go back through 11,000'' on
the Dow industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we get too far ahead of ourselves and get a
disappointment in the form of a rate hike,'' Hogan added, ``we have
set ourselves up for a fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications equipment makers, financial service companies
and retailers were among the biggest winners in the stock market.
But it was a bad day for big oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Few stocks had a more spectacular week than Qualcomm. The cell
phone technology developer saw its stock jump 30 7/16 Friday, to a
record 294 3/8. For the week, the stock gained 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola rose 7 3/4, to 114 1/4, after telling analysts in a
conference call it will be cutting costs over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Among retailers, Wal-Mart and Home Depot, two Dow components,
were particularly strong. Wal-Mart gained 2 1/16, to 58 1/16, and
Home Depot was up 2, at 78.
</P>
<P>
   A negative report on oil companies from Goldman, Sachs sent oil
stocks lower. Exxon fell 2 3/8, to 70 5/8; Royal Dutch Shell shed 1
3/8, to 55 5/8; and BP Amoco dropped 1 1/4, to 52 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about the damaging finding by the presiding judge in the
government's antitrust case against Microsoft were not evident in
the company's stock price Friday. Microsoft closed at 91 9/16, down
3/16.

 &HT;    CONSUMER BENEFITS ARE MURKY IN MICROSOFT CASE
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Software giant Microsoft Corp. ``harmed consumers''
by stifling innovation and crushing competition, U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Friday in the Microsoft
antitrust case. But whether those injured consumers soon will see
lower software prices appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see anything change in the short term because we've
still got a long ways to go in this case,'' said Carl Howe, who
follows antitrust issues for Forrester Research in Boston. The
judge still has to decide whether Microsoft broke the law and, if
so, how it can make amends. Appeals will follow any court-imposed
remedy, possibly dragging the case out for several years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the court's decision may not bring immediate changes,
the trial itself may have already helped consumers. Two years of
intense and often harsh scrutiny by government officials and
reporters may have restrained Microsoft during a time when the
Internet-based economy was exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft, in the absence of this trial, would have been much
more aggressive in the Internet business,'' said Art Russell, a
technology analyst with Edward Jones, a St. Louis-based securities
company.
</P>
<P>
   While no one can know for sure, some people believe that ``if
not for this case, (Microsoft executives) would have bought up all
the start-ups'' that have come into existence since 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing the case, the Justice Department not only pressured
Microsoft into showing restraint in its competitive tactics, but it
may also have encouraged other companies to show more restraint as
they try to bind consumers to their products and services, said
Edward Segal, president of Internetlobby.org, a Washington-based
group that represents Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case sent a very important message to companies of the
future,'' Segal said. ``All companies should read the judge's
ruling very carefully so that they won't make the same mistakes as
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the foundations of the new Internet-based economy are
just being laid, the trial's timing was particularly important, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a seminal event, just as the breakup of Standard
Oil Co. was at the start of this century,'' Segal said. ``We were
about to enter a new millennium and the court wants to be sure that
consumers have as much freedom of choice as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But while consumers may have been helped by the judge's ruling,
it's likely that Microsoft shareholders will be harmed by it, at
least in a next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the potential for a sell-off (of Microsoft stock) in
the short term,'' Russell said. ``But it's still early in the
game.'' If Microsoft decides to settle the case quickly, and comes
up with remedies that are not very drastic, the stock price may
recover quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given how rapidly products and services are changing in the
wired world, predicting what will happen with either consumers or
Microsoft is difficult, said Julie Bick, a former Microsoft group
manager and author of the best seller ``All I Really Need to Know
in Business I Learned at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many young companies now looking for ways to outsmart
Microsoft, the marketplace might be very different by the time the
company and the court can figure out a remedy, she predicted. ``By
the time it's settled, the whole thing will be moot,'' she said.

 &HT;    Piecing together monopoly puzzle
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and the
antitrust case against Microsoft had already changed the course of
technology, even before the judge made his ruling Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The glare of publicity generated by the trial prompted Microsoft
to soften some strong-arm tactics and has emboldened its
competitors to speak out and challenge the industry leader, say
many industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the trial, developers had to knuckle under to
Microsoft,'' says Phil Lemmon, editorial director of PC World
magazine. ``Now developers can be successful without giving
Microsoft their code (the building blocks for a computer program)
or cutting the company into the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Microsoft says the trial has changed nothing in
terms of its strategy and business practices. Chairman Bill Gates
said Friday's ruling was ``part of a long process and that the
company as a whole is very focused on continuing to build great
software products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can find a way to resolve this and put it behind
us,'' he said in a videotaped statement. ``We think that there's
certainly got to be a way to resolve this that's fair to Microsoft,
fair to the government and most of all fair to consumers who
benefit from ongoing innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' said company spokesman Jim Cullinan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the last year has shown is just how competitive and
dynamic this industry is,'' says Cullinan. ``Our competitors say,
with the advent of the Internet, Windows is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if we don't keep trying to improve Windows, it will be
obsolete,'' says Cullinan.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. Neither changing market conditions nor the
trial have hobbled Microsoft. It remains the dominant software
company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this. While the trial dragged on, Microsoft won the Web
browser war, driving the once dominant Netscape Navigator into the
arms of suitor America Online.
</P>
<P>
   What promoted the Justice Department to file antitrust charges
against Microsoft two years ago were fears that the company would
dominate the Internet the way it does personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since then. Two years ago, Netscape controlled
62 percent of the market for Web browsers. Today it's Microsoft
that controls 64 percent of that market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has behaved differently than IBM, AT&AMP;T and other big
companies that have been sued by the Justice Department,'' says Raj
Srivatava, a senior associate dean and marketing professor at Emory
University's business school. ``Those companies pulled back under
the government's assault. But Microsoft has adopted the attitude
that it would rather be a trillion-dollar company than a
multibillion one if it is to be broken up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trial, many industry observers believe, has stopped the
company from using its Internet Explorer browser to dominate the
Internet as it had originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for the trial, you'd see Microsoft software
controlling all desktop screens and selling access to them,'' says
Lemmon. ``The case against Microsoft made it pull back from its
aggressive tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened in the trial was that scores of top industry
executives testified that they had been strong-armed into accepting
Microsoft software on the company's terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a lie out of Microsoft's longtime successful publicity
campaign that the company was innocent of bad tactics,'' said
Lemmon. ``And that emboldened more people to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   Srivatava, though, thinks the changing marketplace presents a
greater challenge to Microsoft than the government's suit. He
points out that Microsoft's Windows operating system still controls
90 percent of all PCs. And the company's Office suite product
represents a similar amount of the market for such programs as word
processors and spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of Microsoft is driven by the value of its
network,'' said Srivatava. ``The company can say to developers,
`what would you rather do, write software for a platform that has
200 million users, such as Windows, or for one like Linux with
several million users?' The answer is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, though, has made some big companies feel freer to try
alternatives to Microsoft products. For example, Dell Computer, one
of the largest PC manufacturers, has announced it will now include
a Linux operating system on some of its products.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Dell executives testified that at times they felt
pressured to install only Microsoft products on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway, another big PC maker long dependent on Microsoft
software, recently announced a long-term strategic alliance with
America Online. The two are expected to collaborate in producing
new computers that can browse the Web without Microsoft browsers or
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves would have been unheard of two years ago. The
executives of these companies said as much at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET CHALLENGES
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the trial that's encouraging Microsoft's
challengers. First, Microsoft has shown that it is indeed human.
The company has failed, despite great effort, to extend its Windows
operating systems to the increasingly popular market for hand-held
computers. Palm Pilot dominates that market, outselling competitors
running Microsoft software three to one.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the company cornered electronic commerce. Indeed, the
company has retreated somewhat, selling off some Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has provided a new platform, not yet dominated by
any one player, for software developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing here is a breath of fresh air in the
computer business,'' says Lemmon. ``Developers and PC makers don't
like being under Microsoft's thumb. The rise of the Internet and
pressure from the government has lessened Microsoft's dominance a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Srivatava agrees. ``Microsoft's greatest challenge is whether it
can extend its dominance to these new markets such as high
definition television, hand-held computers and cable TV set top
boxes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-RUNNING BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's current suit against Microsoft is only
the latest battle line in a decade-long struggle between the
company and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The war began in 1990, when the Federal Trade Commission opened
an antitrust investigation of Microsoft. The commission was
considering whether the company was driving out competitors through
low pricing and other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the FTC deadlocked on whether to press charges against
Microsoft, and the Justice Department announced it would take up
the case.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Microsoft and the department reached a settlement,
with the company agreeing to change key aspects of the way it
licensed software to PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   The peace didn't last. First U.S. District Court Judge Stanley
Sporkin rejected the settlement, arguing that it didn't go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department appealed and finally won court approval
of its settlement with Microsoft. It let Microsoft buy WebTV and
launch its biggest product ever, Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But still peace didn't prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Justice Department began a new, bigger
investigation of Microsoft. This time the government wanted to know
if Microsoft was using its vast marketing power in personal
computing to dominate the fledgling Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's that investigation that led to the current suit, filed on
Oct. 21, 1997. The suit charged that Microsoft violated its earlier
settlement, requiring computer makers to install its Web browser if
they wanted to license Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial that lasted five months, more than a hundred
witnesses testified or were deposed. Tens of thousands of pages of
exhibits were admitted as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of many observers, much of the testimony and
exhibits proved an embarrassment for the company. But few of them
believe the government will prevail on appeal in the end.
</P>
<P>
   And, through it all, Microsoft has continued to grow as a
company. It has posted record revenues and profits in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Says PC World's Lemmon, ``There has been no dent in Microsoft's
hegemony of the PC world.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN LOSING IS FAMILIAR BUT DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Two months ago, Keyshawn Johnson stood in the
New York Jets' locker room, anticipating the beginning of a
triumphant season. This was Sept. 11, as the Jets prepared for
their season opener against New England.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Johnson, with no inkling that a spate of injuries
would puncture the Jets' championship dreams, looked back on the
dreadful 1-15 season in 1996. He remembered how the Jets were 0-7
and defeated the Arizona Cardinals. He recalled how jubilant the
Jets' locker room was after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought we had won the Super Bowl or something,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets face lowly Arizona again Sunday; once again they are
looking for a sorely needed victory. In many ways, the Jets are in
familiar territory: 1-6, sitting in last place in the American
Football Conference East, already long shots for a wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   If there is frustration, the symptoms are difficult to detect;
if there is futility, the evidence is difficult to see. Johnson
said the difference between 1996 and 1999 was night and day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're not as bad as our record indicates,'' he said
Friday. ``In 1996, we were sorry as a team; this year, our record
is worse than our talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, they weren't trying to do anything to win. They knew
their days were numbered. The reason we celebrated so much when we
won that game against Arizona was that we really didn't think we'd
win another game. We needed a win to satisfy a need, but I think a
lot of guys wanted to lose the rest of the games just to get those
coaches out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Anderson, the Jets' seventh-year running back, was on the
miserable '96 team. The difference between being 0-7 then and 1-6
now, he said, is attitude, the sense that a Jets turnaround is one
game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between then and now is that now we know we can
win every game,'' Anderson said. ``We're confident; we know what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets just haven't done it. The numbers speak for themselves:
1-6, last place. Numbers don't describe the sudden injuries, the
hard luck. Just the fact that the team has played seven games and
lost six.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the slump, Bill Parcells, the Jets' head coach, has
not exploded, though he became irritated Friday as he answered a
question about the mental lapses that have plagued his team. On
Oct. 24, just before their bye week, the Jets blew a 20-3 lead and
lost to the Oakland Raiders, 24-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them in fourth down,'' Parcells said. ``We had them in
third-and-18.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Jets leading 23-17 on the crucial third-and-18 play,
Marcus Coleman, their fourth-year defensive back, blew a coverage
that led to a 23-yard completion on Oakland's game-winning drive.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Parcells hasn't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to know what you're doing in a game; third-and-18, do
you know what to do?'' Parcells said, putting the question to
reporters. ``Would you think you have an idea of what to do as a
writer. What do you think? Try to keep it under 17 yards, right?
How hard is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you react to a guy who's 5 yards down the field when
you're trying to stop a third-and-18 play? Would you start chasing
some guy down the field. I wouldn't. But that's what happened.
Those are the kind of things that get me mad. When I have a player
who seems to have no consciousness of what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you feel like a failure as a coach When one of
your players does something as totally stupid as that, that's when
you start looking at yourself. It's so obvious to you, you can't
fathom. There are guys playing who are like that. You got to try to
get them off your team. You've seen guys playing _ something
happens to them all the time. You've seen it in a hundred sports.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone cracked that Jets fans had seen that slapstick play
six years in a row before Parcells' arrival, the coach shook his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know about that, but you're seeing a little of
it again,'' Parcells said. ``I'm not used to looking at it that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   There were hopes in September that the Jets would join the
winning atmosphere in New York: join the Yankees, the Mets, the
Knicks. With nine games left this season, and six losses already,
the Jets have put themselves in such a deep hole that only a
miracle can pull them out. For all the brave talk about a permanent
Jets turnaround, the haunting question is whether this season is an
aberration or whether last season was a mirage.

 &HT;    Piecing together monopoly puzzle

<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and the
antitrust case against Microsoft had already changed the course of
technology, even before the judge made his ruling Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The glare of publicity generated by the trial prompted Microsoft
to soften some strong-arm tactics and has emboldened its
competitors to speak out and challenge the industry leader, say
many industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the trial, developers had to knuckle under to
Microsoft,'' says Phil Lemmon, editorial director of PC World
magazine. ``Now developers can be successful without giving
Microsoft their code (the building blocks for a computer program)
or cutting the company into the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Microsoft says the trial has changed nothing in
terms of its strategy and business practices. Chairman Bill Gates
said Friday's ruling was ``part of a long process and that the
company as a whole is very focused on continuing to build great
software products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can find a way to resolve this and put it behind
us,'' he said in a videotaped statement. ``We think that there's
certainly got to be a way to resolve this that's fair to Microsoft,
fair to the government and most of all fair to consumers who
benefit from ongoing innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' said company spokesman Jim Cullinan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the last year has shown is just how competitive and
dynamic this industry is,'' says Cullinan. ``Our competitors say,
with the advent of the Internet, Windows is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if we don't keep trying to improve Windows, it will be
obsolete,'' says Cullinan.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. Neither changing market conditions nor the
trial have hobbled Microsoft. It remains the dominant software
company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this. While the trial dragged on, Microsoft won the Web
browser war, driving the once dominant Netscape Navigator into the
arms of suitor America Online.
</P>
<P>
   What promoted the Justice Department to file antitrust charges
against Microsoft two years ago were fears that the company would
dominate the Internet the way it does personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since then. Two years ago, Netscape controlled
62 percent of the market for Web browsers. Today it's Microsoft
that controls 64 percent of that market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has behaved differently than IBM, AT&AMP;T and other big
companies that have been sued by the Justice Department,'' says Raj
Srivatava, a senior associate dean and marketing professor at Emory
University's business school. ``Those companies pulled back under
the government's assault. But Microsoft has adopted the attitude
that it would rather be a trillion-dollar company than a
multibillion one if it is to be broken up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trial, many industry observers believe, has stopped the
company from using its Internet Explorer browser to dominate the
Internet as it had originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for the trial, you'd see Microsoft software
controlling all desktop screens and selling access to them,'' says
Lemmon. ``The case against Microsoft made it pull back from its
aggressive tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened in the trial was that scores of top industry
executives testified that they had been strong-armed into accepting
Microsoft software on the company's terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a lie out of Microsoft's longtime successful publicity
campaign that the company was innocent of bad tactics,'' said
Lemmon. ``And that emboldened more people to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   Srivatava, though, thinks the changing marketplace presents a
greater challenge to Microsoft than the government's suit. He
points out that Microsoft's Windows operating system still controls
90 percent of all PCs. And the company's Office suite product
represents a similar amount of the market for such programs as word
processors and spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of Microsoft is driven by the value of its
network,'' said Srivatava. ``The company can say to developers,
`what would you rather do, write software for a platform that has
200 million users, such as Windows, or for one like Linux with
several million users?' The answer is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, though, has made some big companies feel freer to try
alternatives to Microsoft products. For example, Dell Computer, one
of the largest PC manufacturers, has announced it will now include
a Linux operating system on some of its products.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Dell executives testified that at times they felt
pressured to install only Microsoft products on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway, another big PC maker long dependent on Microsoft
software, recently announced a long-term strategic alliance with
America Online. The two are expected to collaborate in producing
new computers that can browse the Web without Microsoft browsers or
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves would have been unheard of two years ago. The
executives of these companies said as much at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET CHALLENGES
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the trial that's encouraging Microsoft's
challengers. First, Microsoft has shown that it is indeed human.
The company has failed, despite great effort, to extend its Windows
operating systems to the increasingly popular market for hand-held
computers. Palm Pilot dominates that market, outselling competitors
running Microsoft software three to one.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the company cornered electronic commerce. Indeed, the
company has retreated somewhat, selling off some Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has provided a new platform, not yet dominated by
any one player, for software developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing here is a breath of fresh air in the
computer business,'' says Lemmon. ``Developers and PC makers don't
like being under Microsoft's thumb. The rise of the Internet and
pressure from the government has lessened Microsoft's dominance a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Srivatava agrees. ``Microsoft's greatest challenge is whether it
can extend its dominance to these new markets such as high
definition television, hand-held computers and cable TV set top
boxes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-RUNNING BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's current suit against Microsoft is only
the latest battle line in a decade-long struggle between the
company and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The war began in 1990, when the Federal Trade Commission opened
an antitrust investigation of Microsoft. The commission was
considering whether the company was driving out competitors through
low pricing and other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the FTC deadlocked on whether to press charges against
Microsoft, and the Justice Department announced it would take up
the case.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Microsoft and the department reached a settlement,
with the company agreeing to change key aspects of the way it
licensed software to PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   The peace didn't last. First U.S. District Court Judge Stanley
Sporkin rejected the settlement, arguing that it didn't go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department appealed and finally won court approval
of its settlement with Microsoft. It let Microsoft buy WebTV and
launch its biggest product ever, Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But still peace didn't prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Justice Department began a new, bigger
investigation of Microsoft. This time the government wanted to know
if Microsoft was using its vast marketing power in personal
computing to dominate the fledgling Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's that investigation that led to the current suit, filed on
Oct. 21, 1997. The suit charged that Microsoft violated its earlier
settlement, requiring computer makers to install its Web browser if
they wanted to license Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial that lasted five months, more than a hundred
witnesses testified or were deposed. Tens of thousands of pages of
exhibits were admitted as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of many observers, much of the testimony and
exhibits proved an embarrassment for the company. But few of them
believe the government will prevail on appeal in the end.
</P>
<P>
   And, through it all, Microsoft has continued to grow as a
company. It has posted record revenues and profits in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Says PC World's Lemmon, ``There has been no dent in Microsoft's
hegemony of the PC world.''

COACHING ENTREPRENEURS FOR PROFIT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for BIZ-PROFILE-SCHWARZ)  
 (af)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his years in Congress and in his career as a professional
football player, Jack Kemp gained fame but little fortune. Now,
Washington's champion of entrepreneurship and the free market is
turning his preaching into practice, embracing capitalism in a more
personal way: He owns high-technology stocks worth millions, he's
on the boards of nine public companies, he's an adviser to two
Silicon Valley venture capital firms and he's raised capital for
fledgling Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a NASDAQ kind of guy,'' said Kemp, co-director of Empower
America, a Washington nonprofit corporation he helped found to
promote the free market. ``I want to see the little guy grow up to
be a big guy _ and take me with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a ride it is for Kemp, who at 64 is being rewarded
handsomely for connecting Washington with Silicon Valley. For
starters, his Empower America board is filled with top names in
private equity: The Forstmann brothers, Ted and Nicholas; Julian H.
Robertson Jr., chairman of Tiger Management; and West Coast venture
players like Thomas W. Weisel, who heads his own firm, and E. Floyd
Kvamme, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &AMP; Byers.
</P>
<P>
   With such gold-plated connections, Kemp has become a strategic
adviser, an indefatigable networker and a man who can meld ideas,
people and money. ``Jack really sees the value of entrepreneurial
capital and now he's in it up to his waist,'' said Kvamme of
Kleiner Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kemp introduced Kvamme to the management of
SeeItFirst.Com, an Internet streaming video company that plans to
go public one day. Kleiner Perkins backed the company, and Kemp is
a board member and investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played football when there was no money in it, and I was in
Congress when there was not a great deal of income from it,'' Kemp
said in a telephone interview. ``I believe in capitalism and I paid
my dues. Now I'm doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at his diversified portfolio of corporate board
memberships shows how well: Carson Inc., an ethnic hair care
company; JumpMusic.Com, an Internet music retailer; Proxicom, an
Internet networker; Oracle, the software giant; ZapMe, an
educational networking company; the Hawk Corp &UR; . &LR; , an industrial
components maker; Realmed, a health care company; Speedway
Motorsports, car racing sponsors; and Sports Authority Inc., a
sporting goods retailer. The latter two seats came about through
his friendship with Nick Buoniconti, the former Miami Dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp is also on the advisory boards of two venture capital
firms, Thayer Capital Partners in Washington and Thomas Weisel
partners in San Francisco. He is also a professional speaker and is
on the board of nonprofits like Howard University, Habitat for
Humanity and Opportunity Industrial Centers, an urban business
development group, pursuing his belief that entrepreneurism can
help minorities and the poor, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I introduce companies to people who have access to capital,''
said Kemp, the vice-presidential candidate on the 1996 Republican
ticket. ``I introduced Proxicom to Tom Weisel and he did the
secondary stock offering. I'm involved in start-ups, in speed-ups.
While I don't consider myself an expert, I can open doors and make
introductions.''
</P>
<P>
   Financiers say Kemp's advice is invaluable. ``Only recently has
Silicon Valley realized government exercises a big role,'' said
Joseph G. Fogg III, a venture capitalist and Empower America board
member.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of these companies generally pay Kemp an annual
retainer of $10,000 to $30,000, plus around $1,000 for each meeting
he attends, along with fees for other activities. And he can buy
stock at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   While Kemp will not say how much he earns, Securities and
Exchange Commission filings indicate he owns around $2.3 million in
Proxicom shares and has 63,000 options in Oracle, a company whose
stock closed last week at $58.6875.
</P>
<P>
   He met Lawrence J. Ellison, the Oracle chief executive, through
a leading Bush administration economic adviser, Michael Boskin.
``Sixty-three thousand Oracle options,'' Kemp said. ``I got a lot
more than that. It's a great company. I jumped at the opportunity
to be on that board because it's one of the most dynamic software
companies on the face of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   How Kemp ended up making millions from Proxicom, based in
Reston, Va., is a tale of politics paying off in unexpected ways.
Proxicom's chief executive, Raul Fernandez, 33, with a net worth of
at least $287 million, once worked for Kemp on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul's a brilliant guy, did all my computer work for me when
he was 19 years old,'' Kemp said. ``He's just a neat, neat guy and
he came to me one day and said ` Kemp, I think I want to start my
own business.' And, here I am the champion of capitalism and I say
to him `stay with me and I can get you a $10,000 raise in the Bush
administration.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now he put me on his board,'' Kemp said, ``and I put him
in touch with some venture capital guys and he went public five
months ago and today the stock hits 83 and Raul's worth like a
half-billion dollars.''

   WASHINGTON _ The administration said Friday that it could go
ahead with a national missile defense system, even if it meant
withdrawing from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty over
Russian objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not permit any other country to have a veto on actions
that may be needed for the defense of our nation,'' Walter
Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy, said Friday in a
speech at the Center for Strategic International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The first deployment _ 200 missile interceptors and a radar
station in Alaska _ would break the ABM treaty, which strictly
limits the number, type and placement of defensive missiles in
Russia and the United States. That would require renegotiating the
treaty, which Moscow has been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Russia won support for keeping the treaty intact from
many of Washington's allies and friends in a largely symbolic vote
at the United Nations. A Russia-sponsored resolution opposing any
new missile defense system that ``attempts to undermine or
circumvent the ABM Treaty'' won a lopsided committee vote of 54-7,
with all of the members of the European Union either voting with
Russia or abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer Clinton will decide whether to begin deploying a $10
billion missile system. This revamped ``star wars'' network, which
is designed to knock down incoming enemy missiles, is not large
enough to be aimed at Russia or any other major nuclear power.
Instead, it is meant to protect all 50 states from small missile
attacks from countries like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Slocombe said that in the next 15 years,
North Korea, Iran and possibly Iraq were ``likely to be able to
field intercontinental-range missiles that could deliver chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons against the territory of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocombe said the administration believed that Moscow would
eventually agree to modify the treaty, clearing the way for the
United States to deploy the missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past month, since the U.S. military successfully
tested a crucial element of the missile network, Moscow has
repeatedly demanded that the treaty be preserved, even taking its
campaign to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that the administration remains committed to the
treaty, Slocombe argued that Russia shares some responsibility for
recognizing that rapid technological changes and new political
realities require changes in the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Several European countries have raised questions privately and
publicly about the wisdom of threatening to withdraw from the
treaty, which has been the basis for nearly every nonproliferation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany said in Washington
on Thursday that he believed the administration's willingness to
consider abandoning the ABM treaty was based on political
calculations in the upcoming presidential elections. Otherwise, he
said, it could mean a change in the U.S. policy of promoting
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should think very carefully about the results of
scrapping the treaty,'' he said. ``Is it better to have Russia in
the framework and under the control of international treaties or
not? Yes or no?''
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty bars the United States and Russia from building
nationwide systems, allowing each only one site for limited
defenses. Until recently the United States had its small, limited
system in North Dakota, but tore it down in anticipation of
deploying a new nationwide system in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has retained its anti-ballistic missile system of radars
and missiles built around Moscow during the Soviet era. On
Wednesday, Russia announced that it had tested a short-range
interceptor missile for that system, an act several Pentagon
officials interpreted as a warning against further American testing
of its new system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon has scheduled two more tests of the system for the
spring, before the president makes his decision in June. Though
those are to be followed by 16 more tests, weapons experts doubt
that the first three tests will provide enough information to make
a sound judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``By next summer we will have no technical basis on which to
make a very serious decision about whether this system is ready to
go,'' said Tom Collina, director of arms control at the Union of
Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that such a decision should not be made in the heat of
the political campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are too high,'' he said. ``If we pull out of the
ABM, the administration is inviting the collapse of other treaties.
Both sides still refer to ABM as the cornerstone for stability and
arms control.''

BETTORS WILL HAVE A FIELD DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Breeders' Cup week's most often quoted
statistic will be rendered invalid, the heaviest favorite of the
afternoon will be beaten, and the nation's top-ranked thoroughbred
will be upset.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, I have no strong opinions about today's races
at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Breeders' Cup is unpopular with the sort of fans who go
to the races to watch great horses record still-greater
accomplishments. There are no Personal Ensigns, Miesques,
Alyshebas, Sunday Silences or Cigars in the eight races today. But
this edition of racing's biggest day is a potential delight for
bettors. It promises that firm and accurate opinions will be
rewarded at substantial odds.
</P>
<P>
   Where else but Breeders' Cup races as contentious as these would
you find 6-1 morning-line odds on the winner of the world's richest
race and 50-1 on the holder of the course record at the precise
distance of his race today?
</P>
<P>
   __ Distaff, 1 1/8 miles: 1. Silverbulletday; 2. Beautiful
Pleasure; 3. Keeper Hill. Long shot: Heritage of Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday ran near the rail, seemingly the worst part of
the sloppy Belmont Park track, when Beautiful Pleasure scampered
away from her last time out. Give the great 3-year-old filly the
benefit of the doubt for that one. Banshee Breeze (4-1 on the
morning line) is said to be training poorly.
</P>
<P>
   __ Juvenile Fillies, 1 1/16 miles: 1. Surfside; 2. Darling My
Darling; 3. Chilukki. Long shot: Cash Run.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Derby experience taught me to trust knowledgeable
horsemen when they doubt a young horse's stamina pedigree, and
those guys don't like undefeated Chilukki, the 8-5 favorite trying
1 1/16 miles. The top two ran heads apart through the stretch in
New York. D. Wayne Lukas (Surfside, Cash Run), who plans to affix
nasal strips to his horses, got more circumstantial evidence of the
breathing aids' effectiveness Friday when Bobby Frankel-trained
Bouccaneer won the Fraise Stakes at 7-1 while wearing one.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mile, on grass: 1. Jim and Tonic; 2. Silic; 3. Hawksley Hill.
Long shot: Docksider.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream's morning-line maker was more confused than anyone by
the wide-open race that opens the $5 million pick-six. He made
Brave Act the favorite off a moderately troubled third behind the
sharp Silic in their Santa Anita prep. Jim and Tonic appears to
have the fewest negatives in terms of running style and footing
preference among the higher-rated horses. The waterlogged turf is
expected to rate no worse than ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sprint, 6 furlongs: 1. Kona Gold; 2. Big Jag; 3. Forestry.
Long shot: Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold, freshened before a perfect prep at Santa Anita, has
shown he can withstand pressure if he gets the early lead or apply
it if he doesn't. How about Belmont Park record setter Artax?
Breeders' Cup Sprint favorites who prepped in the New York area are
2 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   __ Filly and Mare Turf, 1 3/8 miles on grass: 1. Soaring Softly;
2. Coretta; 3. Zomaradah. Long shot: Insight.
</P>
<P>
   The outside post position is less of a problem for Soaring
Softly (Jerry Bailey) than for Coretta (Jose Santos). The top pick
can drop in behind the leaders; the second pick could get parked
outside them.
</P>
<P>
   __ Juvenile, 1 1/16 miles: 1. Forest Camp; 2. Dixie Union; 3.
Chief Seattle. Long shot: Brahms.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Camp, brilliant in the Del Mar Futurity, pulled David
Flores to the lead too fast at Santa Anita and was beaten by the
more professional Dixie Union. With the benefit of that experience
Forest Camp is the better colt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Turf, 1 1/2 miles on grass: 1. Daylami; 2. Royal Anthem; 3.
Val's Prince. Long shot: Unite's Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Europe-prepped horses are winless in 28 starts in Florida
Breeders' Cups. But consider a French 93-1 shot ran third and a
French mutuel-field horse fourth in the 1989 Mile; French horses
ran a close 2-3-4 to Prized at 25-1, 51-1 and 7-2 odds in the 1989
Turf; and a 3-year-old French filly (Jolypha) was third as part of
a 15-1 entry in the 1992 Classic. Hardly evidence of
underachievement. Unite's Big Red, at 50-1 the longest shot on the
Breeders' Cup morning line, set the Gulfstream record (2:23) for
this distance in March.
</P>
<P>
   __ Classic, 1 1/4 miles: 1. Almutawakel; 2. General Challenge;
3. Behrens. Long shot: Ecton Park.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe everybody's picking against Behrens just because we can't
believe !ital!this is the Horse of the Year front-runner. Talented
but none-too-game General Challenge could win by five lengths but
probably not by a nose. Almutawakel won the Dubai World Cup in
March, making him the rare Classic runner who's proven at the
class, and at 6-1 would be worth a shot. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presiding judge in the government's antitrust
trial against Microsoft Corp. issued a broad denunciation of the
software giant Friday evening as the first part of his verdict in
the landmark case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court said that
Microsoft had used its monopoly power to stifle innovation, reduce
competition and hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions
have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in
the computer industry,'' Jackson wrote in his 207-page findings of
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through its conduct,'' he added, ``Microsoft has demonstrated
that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to
harm any firm'' that gets in its way.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact are not a final statement of
liability or innocence. But they show that he has accepted almost
every element of the government's case against Microsoft and has
rejected as ``specious'' virtually all the arguments Microsoft put
up in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are the judge's conclusions about who presented the
most compelling and believable case during the year-long trial that
opened in his courtroom on Oct. 19, 1998. As such, they serve as a
clear, almost certain, indication of how he will rule in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government both reacted quickly after
receiving the much-anticipated findings Friday evening. The judge,
who in years past wrote his decisions longhand, transmitted the
document to both sides by e-mail Friday afternoon. It was made
public at 6:30 p.m., after the stock markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department was jubilant. ``This is a great day for
American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``This case
is about the protection of innovation, competition and the
consumers' right to choose the products they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, quickly issued a terse statement
indicating that the company was already formulating its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we disagree with many of the findings,'' the statement
said, ``we are still confident that the law supports us on these
points and that the American legal system will ultimately rule that
Microsoft's actions were fair, legal and good for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's leaders are almost certain to appeal, should
Jackson eventually rule against them, the judge's findings of fact
are likely to stand, because they are virtually impervious to
appeal. Under federal court rules, appeals courts must give great
weight to the conclusions the trial judge draws from hearing the
testimony and studying the witnesses as they offer their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, appeals courts are allowed to challenge findings of
fact only if they are ``clearly erroneous.'' And if the judge's
verdict is largely based on the questions of witness credibility he
raised in his findings, the verdict stands a better chance of
withstanding appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of his findings, Jackson declared that Microsoft
``enjoys monopoly power in the relevant market'' _ a threshold
assertion that potentially makes other actions illegal. He noted
that Microsoft can charge whatever it wants for its Windows
operating system without fear that price increases would reduce
demand, a key test for monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft expended considerable energy in court arguing that it
was not a monopoly, asserting that a host of small competitors _
from the Be operating system to Palm Pilot personal organizers _
were long-term threats. But Jackson dismissed every one of those
arguments, saying that competition from these competitors was at
least a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day has not arrived, nor does it seem imminent,'' he
wrote in once case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's monopoly power,'' he concluded, ``is also
evidenced by the fact that, over the course of several years,
Microsoft took actions that only could have been advantageous if
they operated to reinforce monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Jackson ran through each of the charges raised by
the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general that
joined the federal government in the suit. In each case, he
endorsed the government's charge while rejecting Microsoft's
rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   He found that Microsoft attempted to divide the market for
Internet browsing software with Netscape Communications Corp. in
1995 _ a key charge in the government's case and a clearly illegal
activity under antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that other companies had similar encounters with
Microsoft, and ``these interactions demonstrate that it is
Microsoft's corporate practice to pressure other firms to halt
software development'' that threatens Microsoft's dominance ``or
competes directly with Microsoft's most cherished software
products.''

ALL-WHITE JURY PICKED TO HEAR LAST JASPER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Lawyers picked an all-white jury Friday to
decide the fate of Shawn Berry, the third white man accused in the
brutal racial slaying of James Byrd Jr., a disabled black man who
was dragged for three miles behind a pickup last year.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's attorney, Joseph ``Lum'' Hawthorn of Beaumont, also
filed a surprise motion asking state District Judge Joe Bob Golden
to move the trial out of Jasper County because of pretrial
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a CBS producer was allowed to post a $2,000 bond
Friday evening and avoid going to jail on a contempt of court
citation Golden issued after she refused to produce transcripts and
video outtakes of an interview of Berry that aired on ``60 Minutes
II`` last month. Prosecutors want to compare those outtakes with
other statements Berry has made to investigators since the June 7,
1998, killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important case, not only for Mary Mapes, but for
you guys,'' the producer's attorney, Charles Babcock, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals will revisit the issue
Monday, while lawyers in Jasper argue whether the capital murder
trial should be moved out of Jasper County.
</P>
<P>
   To help him decide the change of venue question, Golden has
ordered five Southeast Texas television and radio stations to turn
over all their broadcasts on the case since March 1. The stations
are Beaumont-Port Arthur television stations KFDM, KBTV, KBMT; and
Jasper radio stations KJAS and KWYX.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in Berry's trial is to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn has said many times over the past year that he wanted
Berry's trial to remain in Jasper County because many people know
the 24-year-old former theater manager, who Hawthorn claims is
neither violent nor racist.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday though, Hawthorn said in his motion that during the
past two weeks of jury selection it has become evident that there
is so much prejudice against Berry that he can't get a fair trial
here.
</P>
<P>
   Juries in Jasper and Bryan earlier this year sentenced Berry's
co-defendants, John William ``Bill'' King, 25, and Lawrence Russell
Brewer Jr., 32, to death by injection. If convicted, Berry would
either join them on death row or receive a life prison sentence,
which would require him to serve at least 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said the ongoing dispute between the Jasper County
district attorney's office and CBS also has added to pretrial
publicity that could hurt his client.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Texas 9th Court of Appeals in Beaumont lifted a
stay of the contempt of court citation against Mapes, who has been
ordered to turn over transcripts and tapes of unaired parts of the
interview conducted by Dan Rather. The court said the appeal should
instead have been filed in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   As Mapes' attorneys raced to file the appeal in Austin, Golden
ordered the producer to turn over the transcripts by 4 p.m. CDT
Friday or report to the Jasper County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that deadline, however, the Austin court ordered
Mapes released on $2,000 bond _ at least until next week.
</P>
<P>
   The court directed Golden to file a written response by 5 p.m.
Monday, explaining his reasons for demanding the outtakes from
Mapes. It also asked Mapes' attorney to provide transcripts of
court hearings in Jasper related to the videotape dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in New York, Rather and his attorneys went before a
judge to fight a subpoena demanding that he appear to testify in
the Jasper trial. The judge did not issue a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said his client's right to a fair trial also could be
compromised by prosecutors' filing with the Jasper court a list of
18 ``extraneous offenses'' allegedly committed by Berry. The
alleged offenses, some of which supposedly occurred when Berry was
a juvenile, could be used in the punishment phase of Berry's trial,
if he is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   They include truancy, burglary, assault and tampering with
evidence by washing human remains off of his truck and washing the
logging chain used to drag Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has not been charged with most of the offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that the state's principal purpose in filing
these documents was to prejudice the defendant on the eve of
trial,'' Hawthorn said in his motion to move the trial. He said
prosecutors knew local news media would report the alleged offenses
and that prosecutors should have just delivered the list to him
rather than file them in the court record.
</P>
<P>
   All of the potential jurors questioned agreed that Berry's case
is the most publicized criminal case in the county's history,
Hawthorn said, and many potential jurors said that most of the
opinions they'd heard about Berry were that he is guilty.
</P>
<P>
   He said five of the 50 people qualified to be jurors have
expressed the opinion that they think Berry is guilty, even though
they said they could put their feelings aside and judge the case on
the evidence. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The jury of seven women and five men, plus two alternates,
would have been more representative of Jasper County if it had some
black members, said Jasper County prosecutor Guy James Gray. He
said Hawthorn struck 10 blacks from the panel, and the judge
excused an 11th black prospective juror for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he's not concerned that the jury is completely white.
A jury with no black members convicted Brewer in Bryan earlier this
year, and King's fate was decided last February by a jury that
included only one black member.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CELEBRATES MICROSOFT DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding
victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory
that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to
the simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General
Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had
agreed with the government. ``This case is about the protection of
innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the
products they want,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the
antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for
the government on virtually every important point.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors
during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always
interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial. I think
this case was about the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead
lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most
highly regarded litigators in the country. At first, Boies shied
away from the microphone. ``I had my shot in the courtroom,'' Boies
said, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general for Connecticut who
worked closely with the Justice Department, encouraged Boies to say
something. ``You're the man,'' Blumenthal said. ``Go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less
to do with strategy and more to do with facts. ``In some senses,
this is not a surprise,'' he said. ``In a lot of ways, this is
exactly what the evidence showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision,
Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is
above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft,
asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was
furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal
e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly
determined to remain a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to
D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications. ``Today, we
have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to
break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry. But Klein
deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to
another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the
nationwide telephone system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly two weeks have passed since
photographer-entrepreneur Ron Harris posted a ``models' eggs
auction'' on the Internet (www.ronsangels.com).
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the ``auction'' so far has turned out to be little
more than a naughty curiosity _ possibly a hoax, probably a
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface, the turbulence the Web site created is
still swirling. With deft marketing instinct, Harris positioned his
venture at the intersection of two fast-moving cultural streams:
fertility medicine and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He drew attention to the wide and little-known market in human
eggs and sperm, and to the discomfort that keeps the market from
being discussed and regulated. Simultaneously, he spotlighted the
Internet's ability to create markets in any commodity, often before
there is time to question whether the market should even exist.
</P>
<P>
   To the frustration of critics of both Internet market trends and
infertility treatment, he managed to hide those difficult issues
behind an easy target: sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so revealing that this guy used these enormous issues to
hook people into what is basically a sex site,'' said Jon Katz, a
critic who writes for and about the Internet. ``We have nightmare
ethical quandaries about families, genetic engineering, fertility,
and no one is paying attention to them because we're all just
talking about sex on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the exposure of Harris' site is a case study in how
rapidly stories now move back and forth between media. News of the
Web site broke in the New York Times, which accepted it at face
value and relayed the ``horror and disgust of mainstream
infertility groups'' that such an auction could take place.
</P>
<P>
   Within 48 hours, the site was debunked _ first in the electronic
world of e-zines and then in more traditional print media, which
pointed out that Harris is unknown to infertility practitioners,
and well-known among photographers and Webmasters specializing in
erotic images.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Harris's site's began to morph. Pictures of potential
egg donors appeared and disappeared _ some, apparently, because
they had been identified as erotic models already featured on other
sites owned by Harris. On Friday, four models' eggs, and one male
model's sperm, were still theoretically for sale, though writers at
several media outlets contended that they had placed bids that had
not been acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   As the cyberdust settles, voices are rising. A few of them ask,
somewhat sardonically, just what the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commerce has always been a key part of the infertility
industry _ it's been a Wild West business almost since (the first
test-tube baby) was born,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bioethics at University of Pennsylvania. ``We have women
selling their eggs in newspapers at elite colleges, so many in fact
that you could replace the top-50 college rankings with egg-price
rankings and they would almost match.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the sale of human organs is banned in the United States,
Caplan pointed out, the sale of eggs and sperm is not. The prices
placed on them originated as compensation for the time and expenses
of the donors; egg donation in particular requires donors to spend
more than a month taking uncomfortable and potentially risky drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands paying expenses,'' he said. ``But no one
could doubt that when you're paying $25,000, $50,000 for gametes,
you are paying for more than expenses. When we got to the point
where bidding broke out for eggs or sperm with certain qualities or
traits, we opened up a commercial market in reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet plays a key role in that market. Entering ``egg
donation'' into any major search engine will yield lists of
agencies who advertise to recruit donors and offer to match donors
to recipients for a fee. The array of choices offered encourages
the impression that eggs can be shopped for.
</P>
<P>
   One site, Creating Families Inc.
(http://www.eggdonorfertilitybank.com/profiles/search.html), offers
prospective parents the ability to choose egg donors not just by
age, appearance and ethnicity, but also by tanning ability, right-
or left-handedness, hair texture and grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   Internet matches draw scorn from traditional fertility
specialists, who see ronsangels.com as the nadir of a negative
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to refuse to allow any of our patients to use such
matching services,'' said Dr. Joe Massey of Reproductive Biology
Associates Inc., an Atlanta infertility practice nationally known
for groundbreaking research. ``To select a person on one single
physical attribute is totally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   RBA finds egg donors through advertising in sports and fitness
magazines and in nursing schools, Massey said. The donors attend a
class where a nurse explains the tedious and painful procedures.
Usually, half the class ditches the plan at that point, he said.
The rest go through a physical and mental screening process _ and,
Massey admitted, a subjective check for attractiveness and
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of applying judgment pops up frequently in
discussions of finding fertility medicine, or any medical
knowledge, online. With so much health data on the Net _ according
to one online survey, health and medical information is as popular
a category as music _ consumers who want to use the Internet as a
resource are forced to make sophisticated decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual involvement will mean two things,'' said Clay
Shirky, a professor of media at Hunter College who raised early
questions about the egg-auction site. ``(Consumers) will be more
interested in learning and acting in what they perceive as their
own best interest, but without the guidance of experts, some will
experience disastrous results.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased scrutiny directed at the net in the Ron's Angels
aftermath irks people already operating comfortably online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are folks hornswoggled by stuff they read on the Internet, and
are they all too believing of what they read online? Absolutely,''
said Bruce Maxwell, author of ``How to Find Health Information on
the Internet'' (Congressional Quarterly Books, 1998). ``But that's
also true for stuff they get from TV, newspapers, magazines, books,
etc. People aren't taught to assess the quality of information from
any source; they take everything at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Crispen, an author who monitors the Internet's ability
to spread urban legends at www.netsquirrel.com, agreed. ``We're
going to have to remember that with good information, we're going
to get the bad,'' he said. ``A Latin saying that I believe is
helpful for Internet consumers (is) Cui bono? Which roughly
translates to, Who benefits from my believing this?''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the impression that every computer monitor should
come with another saying engraved over its screen: Caveat emptor
(Buyer beware). The argument over Harris' intentions _ is he a
pornographer, a marketer, or an entrepreneur whose commercial
venture is wrapped in a mischievous taste for controversy? _
recalls a New Yorker cartoon whose caption has passed into Net
culture: ``On the Internet, no one knows you're a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Identity on the Net possesses a through-the-looking-glass
uncertainty; things can be both true and not true at once. A
popular site can boast stratospheric stock prices and yet be losing
millions on its balance sheet. Someone called LOOKINFRLUV in a chat
room may be a teen-ager, or a police officer in a pedophile sting.
And Harris may be only a clever peddler of soft porn _ but he could
be an human egg broker as well, if anyone takes him up on the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reactions generated by the egg auction were calls for
Internet regulation, an idea already floated in Congress this year
as a way of protecting consumers against unsafe online drug
prescriptions. To netizens, the thought of regulating the Internet
goes against its bedrock cultural assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net is not regulable,'' Katz said flatly. ``It's not a
question of should you, or shouldn't you. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for
the Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, disagrees. Pressure
to make the online world more hospitable to commercial transactions
has already changed the Net's nature, he pointed out. And the Net's
newest iteration _ Internet 2, under construction now _ promises
greater changes to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet that people are hard at work building for
tomorrow will be regulatable,'' he said. ``You will be much more
identifiable, every click you send will be traceable, and
government will have points of intervention it didn't have before.
It's commerce that's making this happen: Domino's Pizza wants to
hold you responsible for the click you order with.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts have already begun to self-regulate medical areas of the
Web. Both the Internet Healthcare Coalition, a U.S. group, and the
Switzerland-based Health on the Net Foundation have proposed
voluntary codes of conduct; the IHC called for an ``Internet ethics
summit'' at the same time the Ron's Angels site became public.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime users of the Net question whether regulation _ from
within or enforced from outside _ can withstand the market forces
that fuel e-commerce to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Though it jostled a whole row of cultural touchstones _ from
beauty, status and envy to distrust of technology and fear of
eugenics _ the controversy generated by Harris' egg auction may
already be fading. With millions of pages now posted to the Web,
perhaps no one site can command a strong enough reaction to prompt
action in either the medical or cyber world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the answer is to the Internet run amok, but
I know what the answer is to reproductive technology run amok, and
that would be: Anything,'' Caplan said. ``Because we don't have
anything now, and so we have odd case after odd case, scandal after
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz agreed. ``There urgently needs to be a big national
discussion about all the ways technology and the Net are changing
medicine, society, the law,'' he said. ``We need rational public
consideration of what is available, ethical and safe.''

IN AIR CRASH INVESTIGATIONS, FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE USUALLY WRONG

<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ When an almost new Boeing 737
plunged to the earth on the Indonesian island of Sumatra in
December 1997, the cause seemed to jump out of its wreckage: rivets
that should have held the plane's metal skin to the skeleton were
missing.
</P>
<P>
   There was the horror of a plane crash but relief that the cause
was in hand and the crash did not represent an imponderable mystery
in a workhorse airplane used around the world. Boeing pledged its
cooperation, and the Federal Aviation Administration sent
inspectors to Boeing's factory floor to check on planes under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that the planes in the factories were
perfect, and so were the planes in the field. The rivets on the
plane that crashed, experts decided later, had probably popped out
in the course of the accident, and what the Indonesian
investigators had observed was a result, not a cause. Their
supposition had been quick, simple and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   With the world now focused on the EgyptAir 767 that crashed
early on Sunday morning off the coast here, and pondering an
assortment of early explanations _ chiefly the possible role of a
disabled thrust reverser on one of the plane's engines _ veteran
aviation experts can point to half a dozen other crashes where
tantalizing details captured public attention but turned out to be
irrelevant. With the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder apparently located by a robot submarine and likely to be
raised soon, useful data may be at hand.
</P>
<P>
   But until investigators complete their work, there is space for
supposition that seems sensible but could later turn out to be
wrongheaded or worse.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in September 1994, when a Boeing 737 fell out of
the sky near Pittsburgh, attention quickly turned to the drug
informant who was on board, who seemed to be an obvious target for
assassination. Initial reports were that the man was in the witness
protection program. He was not.
</P>
<P>
   But the plane, USAir Flight 427, crashed because of a
complicated, hidden flaw in a hydraulic valve in the tail,
investigators concluded. The crash was solved after three years of
dogged work that included extensive computer and laboratory
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Another case, five years to the day before the EgyptAir crash,
was an American Eagle commuter plane wreck in Roselawn, Ind. The
plane, an ATR-72, was suspect, because it was partly made of new
lightweight materials made of fibers and binders rather than the
standard aluminum. James E. Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, attributed the almost shredded
condition of the wreckage to the use of the composites. But the
reason was the design of the wing and its susceptibility to ice
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was teased out of the information gathered by the
flight data recorder and wind tunnel tests.
</P>
<P>
   When the cause of the crash of Valujet 592 in the spring of 1996
was still a mystery, the obvious reason seemed to be that the
plane, a DC-9, was 25 years old. Public speculation _ fed in part
by some expert speculation _ was that no plane that was almost as
old as its pilots could be reliable.
</P>
<P>
   That was before investigators found cargo manifests on the
ground showing that the plane carried oxygen generators, small
chemical devices that generate heat as well as oxygen, and then
found the generators in the wreckage, minus their safety caps. The
flight data recorder on that plane, though it was primitive,
confirmed indirectly that the plane had been brought down because
the oxygen devices had become activated, a fire had started and a
tire exploded.
</P>
<P>
   When an Air Force plane carrying Ron Brown, the commerce
secretary, crashed into a mountain near Dubrovnik in Croatia, many
people thought it had been shot down and a few suspected that
someone on the ground had set up a counterfeit radio navigation
beacon to lure the pilots to their deaths. An investigation showed
that there was no damage to the plane indicating that it had been
shot down and that the plane's equipment and the crews' training
were both inadequate to successfully complete the approach.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1979, the cause of the crash of a DC-10 in Chicago was
immediately obvious; an under-wing engine broke off. Speculation at
the time was that a design problem was to blame, but investigation
concluded a maintenance error had caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases never get properly resolved. Indonesian investigators
suspect now that the 737 crashed in Sumatra because the pilot
wanted to commit suicide, but they have had difficulty proving the
thesis.
</P>
<P>
   The clues that solve crashes sometimes come from obscure cases.
In December 1994, an American Airlines jet traveling from Miami to
Cali, Colombia, crashed into a mountainside near its destination.
The cockpit voice recorder showed that the crew was confused, but
did not reveal what happened; that answer came from a computer in
the cockpit. The computer was smashed but its microchips, rewired
into circuit boards, revealed that the crew had entered the wrong
information into the navigation system. That investigative method
could be relevant in this crash, because the American Airlines
plane was a Boeing 757, which has a cockpit nearly identical to
that of the 767.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes discovering the cause of an accident takes longer, and
the smoking gun is tinier. For example, in October 1996, an MD-88
flown by Delta Airlines was too low as it approached New York's La
Guardia Airport, to Runway 13, which begins on a pier in the East
River. The main landing gear was sheared off by the end of the
pier, and the fuselage cleared the concrete runway by 16 inches; a
few feet lower, investigators noted, and the 58 passengers on board
could have come in under the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators eventually blamed the problem on one of the
pilot's contact lenses. He was wearing a contact-lens equivalent of
bifocals, one optimized for distance seeing and the other for close
work. But the combination reduces depth perception, and that is
what caused the accident, the Safety Board found.

BUSH'S FAILURE IN QUIZ POINTS TO WEAKNESS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is not the first
presidential candidate to struggle with foreign policy, but his
failure in a reporter's hot-spot trivia quiz this week
re-emphasized the greatest potential weakness of the Republican
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who plans to outline his foreign policy proposals later
this month, has fumbled in the past over what to call the natives
of various countries. But in a televised interview this week, he
had trouble naming the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, Pakistan and
India, suggested the military takeover of Pakistan was ``good
news'' and was obviously irritated at the questions.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of his opponents was quick to seize on Bush's
knowledge gap as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is not whether presidential candidates can pass
a pop quiz, but whether they have the basic foreign policy
knowledge necessary to protect America's interests and security
around the world,'' said Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, without specifically naming Bush, criticized his
description of the military take-over of Pakistan from its
democratic government as ``good news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our
country _ the world's oldest democracy _ would characterize this
military take-over as `good news,''' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign quickly responded by claiming Gore
misrepresented Bush's position, which they said was identical to
that of the Clinton administration. Bush had said the ``good news''
was that the military coup had reduced tensions between Pakistan
and India, a pair of nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Governor Bush nor the United States government condone
coups, but both Governor Bush and the Clinton administration, with
the apparent exception of Vice President Gore, welcome the easing
of tensions in the region,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy broke out after a reporter for WHDH-TV asked
Bush to name the heads of state in four international hot spots.
Bush could only give part of the name of the Taiwanese leader.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was less critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Bush were President, he would soon enough learn their
names,'' Clinton said. ``The real, the most important thing is, do
you have a clear idea of what the world ought to look like, and
what America's policy ought to be in these areas. So, that's what I
would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is Bush's closest challenger in
New Hampshire, defended Bush and echoed the concerns of media
watchers and others that the questions were designed to embarrass
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a fair question. This isn't `Jeopardy.' It's a
presidential campaign,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer said the answers
underscore a lack of vision by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's staff begs us to ignore the issue of whether he
knows the names of foreign heads of state and focus instead on his
foreign policy vision,'' Bauer said. ``But it is that vision which
is so badly out of focus.''
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's experience in foreign policy has been a point of
debate in past presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat John F. Kennedy scored a victory in his 1960 debate
against Republican Richard Nixon by holding his own against Nixon's
reputation as a foreign policy expert.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1976 presidential election, Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter
scored against Republican President Gerald Ford when Ford said the
Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's father _ former President George Bush _ did not
persuade Republican primary voters in 1980 when he launched a
series of attacks on Ronald Reagan's foreign policy positions as
``simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan also survived factual errors in his domestic policies,
claiming the negative stories were the result of ``journalistic
incest.''

LOROUPE MIGHT ENTER MARATHON AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sept. 26, Tegla Loroupe won the Berlin Marathon in
2 hours 20 minutes 43 seconds. That was the fastest time in history
by a woman, 4 seconds faster than her previous world best and
enough to earn at least a few months off from racing.
</P>
<P>
   Some vacation. The following Sunday, in Palmero, Italy, she won
the world half-marathon championship. The Sunday after that, in the
Great North run, another half-marathon in Gateshead, England, she
ran second to her training partner, Joyce Chepchumba.
</P>
<P>
   After those three races in 15 days, the New York City Marathon,
which she won in 1994 and 1995, was obviously not in her plans. So
it was surprising when Loroupe, a 26-year-old Kenyan, said Friday
that there was a 50-50 chance she would run the 26.2 miles in New
York Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She promised to decide Saturday. She said that she was not being
coy, that there was a conflict between logic and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come to New York thinking I would run,'' she said
Friday night on her way to a dinner for the elite runners. ``But I
always like to run in New York, and when you get here and see the
other athletes, you get more with it. If they are running, you want
to run. I just love running. So I don't know yet what I will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe (pronounced loh-ROOP-ay) has been here all week, making
promotional appearances. At 8 a.m. Friday at the United Nations,
she is receiving the Abebe Bikila Award for contributions to
distance running and humanity, an award founded by Fred Lebow, the
impresario of the New York City Marathon until his death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no public speculation that Loroupe was even
thinking about running here. But Anne Roberts, the race's
elite-athlete coordinator, said Loroupe raised the possibility
three weeks ago, and it came up again this week.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy race schedule of recent weeks may have taken a toll on
Loroupe, who at 4 feet 11 inches and 83 pounds does not exactly
have fat to burn. But the very smallness of that body, Roberts said
Friday, would make it easier for Loroupe to run a marathon here so
soon after the other races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a competitor,'' Roberts said. ``If she didn't feel good,
she wouldn't consider it. She said if she hadn't run that race in
England, there would be no question about running here. Her ability
to recover is astounding. She is so light. She may weigh between 78
and 82 pounds when she competes, and that's 20 or 25 pounds lighter
than the others. She doesn't hit the ground very hard. She runs
like a feather, and her feet barely touch the road, so she doesn't
take the punishment other runners do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only she knows how she feels. I think she's struggling whether
it would be fair to the others if she runs when she was not
scheduled to run from the beginning. On the other hand, she
considers this race coming home. I know it would hurt her not to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe has been a New York favorite since her victory in 1994
at 21, the youngest person to win this race. She won the next year
despite record low temperatures. In 1996, she finished seventh, a
victim of cold temperatures, and in 1997 she was seventh again
after bouts with cramps. Last year, when Franca Fiacconi of Italy
won in 2:25:17, Loroupe was third, struggling with stomach cramps.
</P>
<P>
   She is a celebrity in this city, the most popular runner in the
marathon for the last five years. When she walks on the street or
goes on a training run in Central Park, people who would not
recognize a computer billionaire or world-champion sprinter stop
her to wish her well.
</P>
<P>
   Heads turned in the park when Loroupe went on one-hour training
runs this week. On Thursday, she ran 11 kilometers slowly. Friday,
she ran much faster in a speed workout that will serve her well if
she runs the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi will run again this year, but she wonders whether a
freakish injury will slow her. On a training run four days before
the world championships in Seville, Spain, in August, she tripped
over debris in the road and fell. She broke her right elbow and for
40 days wore a cast from her wrist to her shoulder. When that cast
came off, a lighter one replaced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to run Seville with the cast,'' Fiacconi said, ``but
it was not possible because the pain was very strong and the
fracture was very bad. It wasn't a simple fracture, so running
would be very risky and the fracture would become worse and I
couldn't run anyway because of the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten days after the injury, I began running again because I
wanted to run New York and had to get ready. So I trained with the
cast, and it was very difficult. It's still difficult now because
I'm not completely recovered. I hope I have no problems during the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 29, Fiacconi ran a 10-kilometer road race to see if
everything was all right. It was not quite all right. She finished
fourth and found that her arm motion had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The muscle lost power,'' she said. ``It is not as strong as
before. I have had good training, but after 10 or 25 kilometers I
have pain in the arm from tendinitis. But I am still optimistic
about the race. Will I win? I hope.''

   CHICAGO _ Near the end of a bitterly partisan congressional
session, President Clinton and Speaker Dennis Hastert appeared
together here Friday night to celebrate a rare moment of accord: a
pledge to merge their plans to alleviate inner-city poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the second and last day of Clinton's
latest anti-poverty tour, which began Friday morning on a tomato
farm in a rural Arkansas town of 700 and ended in one of Chicago's
most blighted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement they announced amounted to a set of goals
rather than any specific legislation, the accord reflected a
concern by Republican leaders that they not let Clinton dominate
the debate over how to spread a remarkable era of prosperity to
corners of the country where unemployment remains high and incomes
far below average.
</P>
<P>
   The accord announced Friday pledges that the two parties will
``work in a spirit of good faith to develop a bipartisan effort''
to bring capital to impoverished areas of the country. But all the
hard bargaining _ over what kind of tax incentives will be
established, what kind of equity and loan guarantees to extend to
small businesses and entrepreneurs _ are put off until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``America can't ignore the people who have been left behind,''
Hastert said. Acknowledging that he was somewhat out of place in a
staunchly Democratic neighborhood, he said, ``I don't think I'm
going to make Republicans out of anyone'' in the audience. ``But
this isn't about politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton and Hastert both used the event, in a technical
preparatory school in the struggling Englewood neighborhood, to
make the case that partisanship must stop at the inner-city's edge.
``They are used to writing in Washington about how we all fight all
the time,'' Clinton said, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and several
politicians behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Rev. Jackson's famous phrase, we have decided to reach
common ground and higher ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who introduced Jackson at the end of his comments,
sounded much like Clinton in describing his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Democrats and Republicans do agree,'' Hastert said.
``And it's time to come together and make things happen.'' Noting
that the Democratic and Republican proposals even went by different
names, he said, ``I don't care what we call it.''
</P>
<P>
   The written principles released by Hastert and the White House
say there are ``significant untapped new markets'' in rural and
urban poor areas. They said their goal was to empower communities
``with new equity capital, tax incentives and other tools'' and to
provide ``private sector and government resources'' to empower
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan that Hastert alluded to was sponsored by
Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., and James Talent, R-Mo., for up to 100
``renewal communities.'' It is essentially a tax reduction plan
under which there is no capital gains tax on the sale of a business
or partnership inside a renewal community, a proposal the White
House opposes; a wage credit for companies hiring workers from the
community, and a commercial revitalization credit for those who
renovate nonresidential buildings in such communities.
</P>
<P>
   The second day of Clinton's ``new markets'' tour began in
familiar territory for him: a tomato farming cooperative in
Hermitage, Ark., a town of 700 not far from the area where Clinton
grew up as a young boy. Clinton's first encounter with the town
came more than 20 years ago, when as the attorney general of
Arkansas he arrived in the town to deal with labor problems
stemming from the arrival of farm workers from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came down here one night and sat and listened for three
or four hours and learned more about tomato farmers than I had ever
known in my life _ and than I've ever heard since.''
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been a more welcoming crowd: In state
elections, Clinton won overwhelming victories in the area, and
Friday he stayed to shake hands with the crowds for more than half
an hour. It resembled a campaign rally more than a celebration of
the opening of new economic markets, and it was laced with the
announcement of some old-fashioned road projects by Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater. Another member of the cabinet, Agriculture
Secretary Daniel Glickman, couldn't resist noting that Slater's
tenure had been marked by ``perhaps a disproportionate share of
roads to Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible purpose of the visit was to see the Hermitage
Tomato Cooperative Association, founded by 15 farmers who were
barely surviving and could not afford the kind of processing
equipment needed to become a major supplier of tomatoes. Now, they
sell to Burger King and the Kroger Company, but they did so with
existing government aid programs _ rather than what Clinton and
Hastert were pressing on Friday.

CLINTON ORDERS FEDERAL PROTECTION FOR STRETCH OF COLUMBIA RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Friday ordered federal protection
of slopes above the swift waters of Washington state's Hanford
Reach, the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River and home
to the most productive salmon run remaining in the United States
outside Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's order comes in light of congressional inaction on
legislation that would prevent development and protect salmon in
one of the most scenic and unspoiled parts of the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to persuade Congress to declare the Hanford Reach a Wild
and Scenic River, the administration instead chose to order that
57,000 key acres along the Reach be managed as part of the existing
Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The president's declaration triples the size of the refuge,
which is now 30,000 acres. Grant County officials had wanted part
of the area, known as the Wahluke Slope, turned over to
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge. The impact is that there will not be any farming
that will add to erosion into the river,'' said Richard Steele of
Richland.
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear technician on the Hanford Reservation, Steele has
spent 30 years fighting proposals to dam, dredge and develop
agriculture along the 47-mile stretch of river. ``Why would I want
to turn this land over to farming when I, as an American, own it?''
added Steele.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who has floated the Hanford
Reach, described the Wahluke Slope as ``a very special place that
well deserves the extra protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the protection is less permanent than legislation by
Congress, the Clinton administration is calculating that even a
Republican administration will be unwilling to face the political
criticism for undoing an action that protects land considered key
to salmon habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I announced the expansion of a wildlife refuge to
protect the prime salmon habitat along the Columbia River,''
Clinton said. ``This supports our treaty with Canada to protect
Pacific Coast salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   The action had been hinted at by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, who is overseeing cleanup of the 560-square-mile
Hanford Reservation after more than 40 years of producing plutonium
for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Due in part to nuclear reactors built on its south banks, the
Hanford Reach has remained the only segment of the Columbia River
between Bonneville Dam and the Canadian border that doesn't have a
dam or a reservoir. While most of the river system's salmon are
endangered, the fall chinook run in the Hanford Reach remains
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's action was criticized by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
and decried by property rights groups who believe some of the land
should be used for agricultural or light industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have chosen to lock up this area, strangle the chance for
any productive use and ignore local officials. A lot of people will
be hurt by this,'' said Chuck Cushman, executive director of the
American Land Rights Assn.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton saw the issue in terms of who gets to control the Hanford
Reach and its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that these lands should be protected and they
will continue to be protected,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, any
hopes of local input or management of these lands has been dashed
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision process on the Wahluke Slope was spurred by concern
for a scenic 31-mile stretch of bluffs above the north and east
banks of the river. North of Richland, the White Bluffs have begun
to slough as a result of irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salmon spawn in the Hanford Reach, beneath the White
Bluffs. If the Wahluke Slope were to be farmed, the slopes would
collapse. By protecting land around the bluffs, the president has
protected the river's ability to produce fish,'' said Rick Leaumont
of the Lower Columbia Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials, as well as their advocates in Congress, opposed
federal protection of the Hanford Reach and adjoining lands. They
prefer letting officials of counties adjoining the river decide how
best to protect the Reach, and what land should be made available
for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken Friday transfers management of 57,000 acres
from the Department of Energy, which held it as part of a buffer
around the Hanford Reservation, to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, which manages wildlife refuges. As a wildlife refuge, the
land can not be developed, except perhaps some for some low-impact
recreational purposes.

 &HT;    Jackets' offense hottest in nation
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ When Georgia Tech's buzz-saw offense
takes the field today, Virginia should be apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 7-ranked Yellow Jackets, behind do-it-all quarterback
Joe Hamilton and catch-them-if-you-can receivers Dez White and
Kelly Campbell, are cranking out an NCAA-best 516 yards and 42
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Tech aligns in more formations than ``Riverdance,'' and the
Jackets move just as smoothly. One-back. Wishbone. No-back.
Three-wide. Four-wide. Double tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Razzle-dazzle isn't just a term to these guys. From those
alignments, Tech has rolled up two 300-yard rushing games and two
300-yard passing games.
</P>
<P>
   And opponents aren't the only ones concerned. Even the
architect, offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen, finds himself on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply worried before every game that we're not going to
perform well,'' Friedgen concedes.
</P>
<P>
   No problem so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the mentality that every time we touch the ball, we're
going to get it into the end zone,'' Hamilton says. He has been
backing up those words by leading the nation in passing efficiency
and the Jackets in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   In 88 possessions, Tech has scored 51 percent of the time. The
number rises to 54 percent without five drives ended by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Without failed fourth-down attempts and three missed field
goals, the scoring average jumps to 57 percent. And it would be 70
percent without the Jackets' 15 turnovers. As good as the Yellow
Jackets are, they keep changing the game plan, even copying
opponents. If Navy comes out in an inverted wishbone, with
receivers lined up in the slots as halfbacks, they notice. The next
week, Tech is using that alignment to help roll up 501 yards
against top-ranked Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to always give a new wrinkle,'' Friedgen says, ``I
don't want (opponents) to just sit back and say, `We can do this or
we can do that,' to stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke sends the flanker in motion against Tech, slips him the
handoff and picks up a nice gain. The next time out, the Jackets
unleash their version of the play, and Campbell blazes untouched
for a 17-yard TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is,'' Friedgen says, ``is to do all of that stuff
and not confuse your own guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Georgia Tech foes are the only ones bedazzled.
</P>
<P>
   Coach George O'Leary's forte is stopping defenses. He designed
the defense that helped Tech claim a share of the 1990 national
championship and served a two-year stint as an NFL assistant.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary says he wouldn't know where to start to slow down
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ever been around a team that scored that many points
and pretty much has been consistent,'' O'Leary says. ``If there's
some (offensive coordinator) in the country better, I don't know
who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the best-in-the-business list of offensive wizards in
college football begins with the name of Ralph Harry Friedgen, a
52-year-old native New Yorker. Friedgen coordinated Tech's
national-title offense in '90. Then he followed Bobby Ross to the
San Diego Chargers and helped take them to the Super Bowl after the
1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   Few coaches have enjoyed such college and pro success. But
``super coach'' is a mantle Friedgen would rather not wear.
</P>
<P>
   He considers himself, above all else, a teacher. This season, no
one is doing it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching is teaching,'' Friedgen says, ``Not only about
football, but about life. I probably appreciate that more coming
back to college football. You have more of an impact on kids. How
they react in critical situations. How they react under stress. How
they react under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that carry over into life.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Hamilton as an honor student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, playing for coach Friedgen can be frustrating,''
Hamilton says, ``because you can run a play, and it works, but you
didn't make the right read, and he'll get on you. He's a
perfectionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our confidence comes from everybody believing in what he's
doing,'' the quarterback says. ``They'll put out extra effort
knowing what's going to be the end result: We're in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's invaluable,'' Friedgen says, ``not only because he makes
plays, but he's checking off and putting us into plays where we
have a chance to be successful. The decision comes down to Joe, and
he's so smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next season, I've got to start all over with a new
quarterback. I'll be a lot dumber next year.''

CLINTON, HASTERT COOPERATE ON INCENTIVE PACKAGE FOR NATION'S POOR
AREAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Setting aside partisan wrangling, President Clinton
and House Speaker Dennis Hastert agreed Friday to work together to
develop an incentive package to help the nation's impoverished
regions.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement capped Clinton's two-day, four-city New Markets
tour that ended in the southside Chicago community of Englewood, an
area long marked by crushing poverty, but working to revive its
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Hastert, R-Ill., appeared together at Englewood High
School, providing a stark contrast to the partisan rancor that has
marked Washington politics of late, especially as Democrats and
Republicans fight over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we ought to do together,'' Clinton said.
``Today, the speaker and I are here to commit to you and to the
American people to work in good faith to merge our proposals into a
historic bipartisan effort to renew our communities, to open new
markets and new doors of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in July unveiled his New Markets Initiative which the
administration claims would spur $15 billion in new private
investment through loan guarantees and tax credits. Clinton
proposes the same incentives to businesses that invest in depressed
American markets as they receive for investing in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Republicans, led by Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma,
also announced their American Community Renewal Act. It would
provide $1 billion in tax incentives to 20 target communities. It
is aimed at neighborhood and religious organizations doing
charitable work. It also provides tax credits for investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what we call it. I don't care what label we put
on it. If it's going to help people and help communities that's
what it's all about,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to do today is try to create a climate that
encourages people to help themselves. Sometimes some communities
need a little extra help from outside. It's not always the
government that comes in and says I'm going to do this. Sometimes
it's just our neighbors,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said Clinton and Hastert briefly
discussed the budget impasse after the session. They agreed that
their negotiators would meet again Sunday. The aide, however,
declined to speculate whether the new thaw would led to a break in
the budget Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some very tough issues to work through,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good will on display there were no specifics on how
the two plans will be merged. They agreed to a set of principles
for the legislation: The two sides should work in good faith; they
should set aside ideology; the legislation should empower
individuals to renew their own communities; and economic incentives
should be a complement to other efforts to bolster education and
housing and to fight crime and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton said, the Republican measure ``has a lot of the
same goals'' as his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Watts said, ``I am encouraged to see that the
president is willing to work with us to find common ground. It is
my hope that he will continue down the path of abandoning the old
mantra of throwing more money at the problem and adopt more
pragmatic approaches that free up communities, build self reliance
and give people more of a stake in their own community.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants Congress to act while the country is experiencing
prosperity. He says that expanding business opportunities and jobs
to traditionally poor areas will help maintain economic growth
without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we have an opportunity now, with all this good
fortune, to deal with our obligation to bring the American dream to
those people and places,'' Clinton said. ``And I believe that the
only way we can keep this economic recovery going is to find new
customers, new jobs and new businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton four months ago launched his first New Markets tour, a
seven-city, four-day trek from Appalachia to Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert toured the Englewood neighborhood four months ago with
its local congressman, Rep. Bobby Rush, a liberal Democrat, who
showed him abandoned buildings that mark past failed revitalization
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert drew praise from Jesse Jackson, who traveled with
Clinton on his two-day tour. Jackson complimented Hastert, a former
school teacher and wrestling coach, for returning to Washington ``a
sense of civility.''
</P>
<P>
   The president began his day in his homestate of Arkansas where
he flew by helicopter to the hilly hamlet of Hermitage, which
boasts 639 residents. Clinton toured the Hermitage Tomato
Cooperative which was formed several years ago by area farmers. The
cooperative now sells its produce to the fast-food chain Burger
King.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the event to tout Burger King's announcement that
it would buy 3.2 million pounds of cucumbers from a nearby
cooperative. And, he announced the government was guaranteeing a $5
million loan from Farmer's Bank to the Hermitage Tomato Cooperative
so it can expand repackaging facilities and build a farm supply
store.

BOND BETTING ON BEHRENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ If you ask most people about Saturday's $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park, they will tell
you that the race is extremely competitive. But Jim Bond is not
most people.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought the Classic was wide open, Bond, who
trains Behrens, replied: ``Not really. If Behrens runs his race,
he's the one to beat. He's been one of the best horses all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, a 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony, has run eight
times this year, all in graded stakes, and he has won four and been
second in the other four. Without question, if he wins the Classic
he will be Horse of the Year. If he loses, the chase is on, and it
will depend on what happens throughout the course of the
eight-race, $13 million Breeders' Cup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title is for him to lose,'' said Bond. ``He's the
frontrunner. We're going to take our best shot. We made our plans
the first week of February. We agreed to do what we could to win
the Breeders' Cup. We've stuck with our plan, and now it's time for
him to do what he's ready to do. We did what was best for him all
year. We were offered a lot of places to go that we turned down.
So, it's time for him to be good to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, 42, trains Behrens for William Clifton, who owns an
investment firm in Waco, Texas, and the Rudlein Stable of Donald
and Ann Rudder, who are from Avon, Conn., and are in the oil and
gas exploration business. They bought Behrens at the 1995 Keeneland
July yerling sale for $225,000, and he has earned $2.8 million in
his careeer, with a record of 19-8-5-1. Jorge Chavez, who regularly
rides Behrens, rounds out `Team Behrens.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jorge and I have a great relationship,'' said Bond. ``The more
you communicate together, the better chance you have to really
learn about your horse. If a jockey feels threatened every time he
rides a horse, you won't get a true report of what happened in a
race. As for the owners, I've said it a million times and I'll say
it again, they are the greatest in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens finished second in both the Broward Handicap and the
Donn Handicap at Gulfstream in January, then ripped off four
victories, taking the Gulfstream Park Handicap in February; the
Oaklawn Handicap in April; the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk
Downs in May, and Suburban Handicap at Belmont in July. Behrens and
Victory Gallop, vying to be top handicap horse at the time, had a
showdown in the Whitney at Saratoga Aug. 1, with Victory Gallop
prevailing by a nose after a bitter stretch duel. When Victory
Gallop came out of the race injured, and was retired, it left
Behrens standing alone.
</P>
<P>
   However, Behrens then lost to River Keen, also a Classic
contender, over a sloppy track in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at
Belmont Oct. 10. He has been listed as the 3-1 choice for the
Classic, but 3-1 is about as lukewarm as a favorite can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Victory Gallop had made the Classic, he probably would have
been the favorite,'' said Bond. ``But Behrens is the last one left
standing, and I think he is the best. Forget his last race in the
mud. He broke his maiden at Gulfsteam, and he likes this track. He
likes to hear his feet rattle. He likes a fast track. He didn't
like the track at Belmont, he didn't handle the glop. The fact that
he was confronted with mud was another adversity of life. If he
danced around in the Gold Cup, all this about who is best would be
a moot point. I'm not going to fault him for losing in the mud, he
didn't make it rain, There is only one way he is going to bounce
off that race, forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens may have an edge in his training. He is stabled at
Payson Park, a training center 90 miles north of Gulfstream, and
both Bond and Behrens love it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't come down untill the day of the race,'' said Bond.
``There is no noise there, no planes, no loudspeakers, no fire
alarms. It resembles the atmosphere that a horse is brought up in
on the farm. We have a 1-mile track there, very similar to the
Oaklahoma training track at Saratoga. It's just a much quieter
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at Payson, Behrens has worked three times, most
recently going six furlongs in 1:15 1/5 Oct. 23 over the deep
surface. ``That work was spectacular,'' said Bond. ``When you work
in 1:15 and a tick at Payson, you've really got your running shoes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best measure of the confidence that Team Behrens has
going into the Classic is that they are already making big plans
for next year, as Behrens will return at the relatively advanced
age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am biased, but he is a great horse to watch on the days he
runs,'' said Bond. ``Next year, we may go to Dubai, and we may go
to California. The MassCap is a nice trip. I love racing there, and
it would be on top of the agenda. I really feel racing needs a
hero. Maybe this horse can come through for everybody. I'd like to
see him get the respect he deserves.''

   NEW YORK _ A large majority of New York City eighth-graders have
failed to meet tough new state standards on tests in mathematics
and English, raising questions about the quality and content of the
curriculum in middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   A 77 percent failure rate in mathematics, announced by state
officials Friday, combined with a 65 percent failure rate in
English, cast doubt on whether many students in years to come will
be able to earn a high school diploma under equally rigorous
statewide Regents tests required for graduation, educators said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight percent of New York City eighth-graders scored in
the bottom of the four categories in math, meaning that they had
barely moved beyond elementary addition and subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   The new tests caused dismay even in affluent suburbs and rural
areas outside New York City, where 54 percent of eight-graders
failed to meet state standards in mathematics and 46 percent failed
to do so in reading.
</P>
<P>
   From Kentucky to Massachusetts, more and more states are in the
middle of a drive to set and enforce standards that are based on
more rigorous and objective tests of hard knowledge. New York is
being closely watched as a laboratory for the most demanding
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The tests whose results were announced Friday were designed
exclusively for New York and the scores were based not on a
comparison to how a national average of students perform _ the way
New York City's own reading and math tests have been _ but on a
judgment about what children should know, such as elementary
algebra, the Pythagorean theorem, finding means and medians, and
calculating probabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some Board of Education officials in New York City, stunned by
the low scores, suggested Friday that they could only have come
from unrealistically difficult tests or a flawed scoring system.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state tests show the pitfalls of dropping the
national comparison, because it is problematic to evaluate the
significance of unique tests when standards may be higher in one
state and lower in another. Texas, for example, gives its students
statewide tests regarded as easier than New York's.
</P>
<P>
   In states like Massachusetts and Maryland, large numbers of
students failed new, more rigorous tests. A number of experts have
warned that the growing use of difficult tests will backfire
politically when large number of students fail and officials must
consider whether to hold those students back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, state officials defended the test, saying that it allowed
districts within New York state to make valid comparisons and that
it would force even the state's most affluent communities to
reassess how well their schools were performing.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates said the dismal scores would alert education
officials to pay more attention to the long-neglected middle and
junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle school is still a problem in New York City and
everybody knows it,'' said Noreen Connell, executive director of
the Educational Priorities Panel, a nonprofit education advocacy
group. ``People are still taking their kids out after elementary
school and moving to the suburbs or to private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In future years, New York City will use the new state tests to
determine whether students are promoted to the next grade, but city
officials said they would also weigh other factors like classroom
work and attendance.

HANDICAPPING THIS YEAR'S BREEDERS NOT FOR THE TIMID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Andre Fabre, the crusty French trainer, has
two horses entered in Saturday's Breeders' Cup whose names could
symbolize the sheer danger of the eight Cup races to the unwary
handicapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louve'' is entered in The Turf. ``Louve'' is the French word
for ``She-wolf.'' In the opening Breeders' Cup race, the Distaff,
the taciturn Fabre has entered, ``Louve Mysterieuse,'' which is
French for ``Mysterious She-wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the innocent can be gobbled up in this race by wolves
dressed in brilliant silks.
</P>
<P>
   No Breeders' Cup has ever been like this. Gulfstream Park has
guaranteed $5 million for any brave and hardy soul who can pick the
winners of the final six Cup races; $50 million might be a fairer
payoff for divining six races with full fields of 14 horses in
each. If a bettor wanted to cover all the possibilities, he or she
would have to open a satchel (or two or three) and deposit more
than $15 million with the mutuel clerk to cover all the $2 bets to
guarantee a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The innocent look at Bob Baffert and ponder if America's best
trainer will win as many as four races. Baffert himself worries,
``I don't want to go out of here looking like that French golfer
(Jean Van de Velde) in the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Baffert of seven years ago, the unknown
ex-quarterhorse trainer who brought a relatively unknown horse from
California to Gulfstream for Baffert's first Breeders' Cup race,
that should be a hint of what is more likely to happen. Search for
the unheralded.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's Thirty Slews exploded in the 1992 Sprint, blistered
six furlongs in 1:08 1/5 and burned the mutuel windows to the tune
of $39.40. Baffert (who didn't know how to find the winner's
circle) knew how to find the mutuel windows as he and part-owner
Mike Pegram cashed bets on Thirty Slews worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (A hint for the Sprint: Look west, because the Sprint winner
lately has usually come from California, and most certainly not
from New York. Horses from California, where speed is all, have won
the last four Sprints and six of seven. A second hint for the
Sprint: Bet on the favorite only if you want ``Foolish'' tattooed
on your forehead.)
</P>
<P>
   There are trends and trends and trends. A mini-trend is that
perennial Cup winner D. Wayne Lukas has yet to win a Breeders' Cup
race at Gulfstream, going 0-for-14 in the 1989 and 1992 Cup races.
``(Gulfstream) has nothing to do with that,'' said Lukas, whose
horses are usually over-bet. ``It just happened the horses we had
just were not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas may have to replay those remarks late Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Always, but always, there is a trend that is overlooked until
the final numbers are posted on the tote board. And this trend is
that horses based where the Breeders' Cup races are held often hold
a significant home-field advantage, an advantage that belies their
odds. The horse that most fits that bill this year is Kiss A
Native, who will be overlooked in the Juvenile even though he is
Florida-based across town at Calder Race Course. ``He's training
super,'' said trainer Bill White.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Kiss A Native's chances might be compromised by yet
another trend, the post position trend. In dirt races at 1 1/16
miles (the distance for both juvenile races), horses on the outside
posts at Gulfstream are at a huge disadvantage because of the short
run to the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great concern because of Post 11,'' said White, Kiss A
Native's trainer. ``I race at Gulfstream every winter and I realize
what a disadvantage that can be. If you try to go from there, you
can end up in the seventh path on the first turn, or if you take
back, you can be out of the race early.''
</P>
<P>
   In the turf races, post position also is huge. It is also
extraordinarily difficult to win from the outside posts on the
grass because Gulfstream's turf course is tiny (only seven-eighths
of a mile) and its turns are tighter than tight. Some of the
European horses have tried to get a feel for what they so seldom
see _ the extreme tightness of the turns _ by training at
Newmarket's ``Gulfstream turn,'' the English training facility's
specially-built replica of Gulfstream's turns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another quirk will be seen in the two longer turf races _
The Turf at 1 1/2 miles and the Filly and Mare Turf at 1 3/8 miles
_ when horses will have to do what they so seldom do, make three
turns. Three tight turns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, as Baffert himself put it when discussing his
Forestry's chances in the Sprint, luck may decide so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see them going 21 2/5ths (for the first quarter-mile)
and Forestry can go 21 2/5ths,'' said Baffert. ``The Sprint is the
easiest to train for but it is also the one that requires the most
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   With six of the races holding those full and crowded fields of
14, luck will be the paramount factor.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to this ``She-wolf'' of a Breeders Cup card is that there
are none of the usual ``gimmes,'' where favorites _ often in the
Juvenile, the Juvenile Fillies, and the Distaff _ loom over their
opponents. Far from it because The Distaff _ unlike The Classic _
has the five best ladies in the world making it to their final race
of the year. And any one of the five can win. Much the same can be
said in the Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   The only horse who seems to loom over his opponents is Daylami,
the European champion, who will be racing for the last time in his
career in The Turf. But even there, bettors can remember that
Daylami was scratched the morning of the race in last year's
Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs, and also that Daylami ran a
terrible race in his last, the Arc de Triomphe in Paris a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
   No trainer is overly confident. No horse is a sure thing. There
is no way to approach this ``She-wolf'' of a racing day than to dig
deeply, avoid favorites (except for Daylami) and look for long and
longer odds. The task is difficult; the reward should be plentiful
for finding the gem of a winner.

 NEW YORK: and attendance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills said the standards
had been pitched high on purpose, as a way of exposing years of
watered-down curriculum in many, though not all, of the state's
public schools. He said New York state's standards and the
questions on the tests had been developed by committees of teachers
and field-tested on thousands of students.
</P>
<P>
   They are based in part, he said, on findings from the 1996 Third
International Mathematics and Science Study, which showed that
American middle-school students are getting a less demanding
curriculum than those in 20 other countries, including France,
Japan and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a very great mistake to step back from the
standards,'' Mills said at an Albany news conference. ``If teachers
do that kind of work, you can learn it. But if you're not taught
it, it's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, declined
comment but issued a subdued written statement saying that Mills
was ``correct when he raised standards and introduced more rigorous
tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew boasted that 16 New York City's schools ranked in the top
100 statewide but did not mention that New York City has about 37
percent of the state's students. Robert Tobias, the board's testing
director, said some city schools were larger on average than those
in the rest of the state; even so, the city still lags.
</P>
<P>
   Crew also pointed out that New York City placed ahead of the
other four large urban school districts in the state, with 23
percent of its eighth-graders passing the math test, compared with
22 percent in Buffalo, 19 percent in Syracuse, 13 percent in
Yonkers and 10 percent in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   While New York City has many poor students, it also has large
tracts of middle-class families in parts of Queens and Manhattan.
Schools in those areas outperform even the best schools in the rest
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 60 percent of eighth-graders in District 26 in
Bayside, Queens, passed the math test, and 20 percent were in the
top or ``advanced'' category, well above generally affluent Nassau
County, where 52 percent passed and 12 percent scored in the
advanced category. In Manhattan's District 2, covering TriBeCa to
the Upper East Side, 52 percent passed the math test and 14 percent
were advanced.
</P>
<P>
   The state also released test scores in fourth-grade math, where
50 percent of New York City students failed to meet state
standards, compared with 23 percent in the rest of the state. The
state previously released fourth-grade English results, showing
that 67 percent failed to meet standards.
</P>
<P>
   The new test scores could add fuel to a class-action lawsuit,
supported by the Board of Education, charging that the state
underfinances New York City schools. But Mills said he also
expected the scores to drive badly needed changes, whether state
aid increased or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tests do matter,'' said Seymour Fliegel, president of the
Center for Educational Innovation, a nonprofit research group. ``If
this is a terrible test, why should the rest of the state do twice
as well as we do?''
</P>
<P>
   But Marc F. Bernstein, superintendent of Long Island's
Bellmore-Merrick district, said many schools had not had a chance
to match their curriculums to the new tests, leading to an
exaggerated sense of failure. ``It's really doubtful whether those
youngsters need interventions in order to do well on the Regents
tests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
said the low scores in New York City pointed up the chronic
shortage of teachers trained in mathematics. ``New York City has
almost all the uncertified teachers in the state,'' Dr. Ravitch
said. ``It also has much more turnover than the rest of the
state.''

EDITORIAL: THE MICROSOFT FINDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's long-awaited conclusions in the
Microsoft antitrust case were labeled as simple ``findings of
fact.'' But by declaring that the software giant built by Bill
Gates had ruthlessly stifled competition and harmed consumers,
Jackson went further than most experts expected in declaring
Microsoft guilty of misconduct as a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and his stunned aides said they intended to appeal the
decision. But the sweeping nature of the document suggests that
Jackson wants to provoke settlement talks between Microsoft and the
government on possible remedies. A settlement would let the court
avoid ordering a breakup of a company that has helped drive the
growth of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The long Microsoft trial yielded some riveting moments. But
nothing in the trial was as dramatic as Jackson's 207-page finding
of fact. The case began as a Justice Department accusation that
Microsoft's tying of its own browser to its Windows operating
system software was an attempt to stifle the rival browser produced
by Netscape. Then Justice broadened the case by bringing in what it
said was misconduct by Microsoft against other rivals and
competitors. The most striking aspect of Jackson's findings was
that he accepted these other examples, declaring that the company
had, as a factual matter, engaged in anti-competitive conduct
against Netscape, IBM, Compaq and other giants in the computer and
software business.
</P>
<P>
   It remains now for Jackson to lay out his findings as to
possible violations of the law by Microsoft. These particulars
should suggest whether the misconduct found by the judge requires a
limited remedy of sanctions against the company, requirements that
it stop certain of its business practices, a much more radical
restructuring or even breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the task of drawing a sensible road map
toward achieving a fully competitive playing field in the computer
software business, one that encourages fair competition and rewards
innovation, requires the cooperation of the best minds from
Microsoft itself. That is why Gates must now ponder whether it is
in the interest of his shareholders to fight the Justice Department
with more appeals or enter into discussions that achieve these
goals and also enhance the owners' investment in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft should fight for its rights under the law, but it
should also recognize the sweeping nature of the government's
victory. Certain facts about its behavior have now been
established, and it is in everyone's best interest to achieve a
solution.

ROBOT FINDS FLIGHT 990 BLACK BOXES, WILL TRY TO RECOVER SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ A high-tech robot Friday attempted
unsuccessfully to recover two orange-colored boxes that could
explain why EgyptAir Flight 990 took a wild roller-coaster ride
above the Atlantic last Sunday before diving into the ocean,
killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery operations for the Boeing jet's cockpit voice and
flight data recorders were suspended about 7 p.m. EST because of
weather, said a spokesman for the National Transpiration Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   USS Grapple, the Navy's mother ship for the robotic submersible
Deep Drone, remained at the crash site overnight. But it was not
certain if conditions would allow the drone to resume its difficult
work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the strength of electronic pinging signals from each
box, the drone passed over them during the day-long search but was
unable to see them, said Navy Capt. Bert Marsh, who is supervising
the salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to dig for them,'' he said at a late-afternoon
briefing for the hundreds of print, radio and broadcast media who
have been here throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Without data from the boxes, safety board investigators have had
to rely on preliminary analysis by the Air Force of radar tapes to
tell them the final path of Flight 990. That analysis has been
questioned by unnamed experts in some media reports, most notably
CNN. The television network quoted an unnamed government official
as saying the Boeing 767 could not possibly have done what the
radar analysis indicates, and thus the analysis must be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Friday the board's top radar expert and the Air Force
have gone over the data again and stand behind their preliminary
findings: the Boeing jet, flying at 33,000 feet, entered a steep
and perhaps supersonic dive to 16,000 feet, where it then climbed
back to 24,000 feet before diving again. The plane broke apart
about 10,000 feet above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron, based at Hill
Air Force Base north of Salt Lake City, has provided assistance to
the NTSB in previous high-profile incidents, including the crashes
of golfer Payne Stewart's plane, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane, and
TWA flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said safety board investigators did computer
simulations that showed the Boeing 767-300 is capable of flying the
roller-coaster path indicated by the radar analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But with so little information about what happened to Flight 990
_ a situation that has fueled the speculation about the cause of
the crash in media reports _ investigators have expressed growing
frustration with the delays in getting the data- and
voice-recording boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said his investigators want to get the two so-called
``black boxes'' to labs in Washington, D.C., as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The plan Friday was to have a helicopter fly the boxes, stored
in water-filled ice chests to protect them, from the Grapple to an
FAA airplane waiting at Quonset Point. From there, it would be a
short flight to Washington, D.C., and the labs of the NTSB, where
the boxes will be carefully opened and technicians can begin
analyzing the data.
</P>
<P>
   But getting those boxes now depends on the cooperation of Mother
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has said it needs seas of less than 9 feet to safely
conduct its recovery operation with Deep Drone. Until Friday, high
winds had churned up seas of more than 20 feet at the crash site
for two days, but the Grapple and two other ships set sail from
Newport through the heavy seas Thursday afternoon after the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted calmer
weather for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Grapple was on the scene before daylight and dropped Deep Drone
into the water about 9 a.m. Within an hour, the robot had zeroed in
on electronic signals that are being emitted from each of the two
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   These so-called black boxes, which are actually painted high
visibility orange and are located in a plane's tail, may be hidden
in mud, silt or under wreckage of the Boeing 767, which is in
thousands of pieces in water about 250 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said the boxes are about 15 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   The robot, called a Remote Operating Vehicle, is about the size
of a mini-van. It is equipped with sonar, still and television
cameras, and small gripping tools that can be used to move
wreckage, dig in the mud and, investigators hope, retrieve the
recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The drone has lights, but in the deep black waters the
television can only see objects a few feet away. There are many
small bits of wreckage. The biggest seen by the drone was one of
the plane's wheels, Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   If the boxes are stuck in debris too heavy for the robot to
lift, Deep Drone can place rigging on the wreckage. It would then
be lifted to the surface with one of two cranes on Grapple, the
Navy's rescue and salvage ship that played a key role in retrieving
up wreckage from the TWA Flight 800 and SwissAir Flight 111 air
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are not the only ones who want to know what clues
the boxes will provide in helping them solve the mystery of Flight
990. Hall, who has held daily briefings with family members of the
victims, said they need to know what happened to their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've explained to them how essential the information on these
recorders is,'' Hall said.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In these flush economic times when many
states have budget surpluses, Gov. Don Sundquist has had to grapple
with revenue problems so severe that he has proposed Tennessee's
first income tax despite a lack of support from many of his
Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an uphill battle for the second-term governor, who
has opposed an income tax for years. And on Thursday, as the
Tennessee Legislature ended the first week of a special session
here to consider tax reform but did not act on the governor's plan,
the Republican leader in the Senate declared the income tax
proposal all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is some bipartisan support for addressing a revenue
shortfall that the governor's office has estimated will be about
$383 million in the fiscal year that begins in July, unless new
revenue sources can be found. That shortfall constitutes about 5
percent of the total revenue the state must raise.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are set to hold more hearings next week on the
governor's proposal, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of eight states that do not have an income tax.
The state relies heavily on revenue from its 6 percent sales tax.
That rate together with local sales taxes gives Tennessee a higher
combined sales tax rate than that of any of its eight neighboring
states.
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts, including the governor's advisers, say that
because of changes in consumer spending in recent years the state
has not been able to benefit as much as it once did from its sales
tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales taxes have not kept pace with economic growth,'' said
William Fox, professor of economics at the University of Tennessee
and an adviser to the governor. The tax is on goods, but not
services, and spending on services has overtaken spending on goods
since the 1970s. To keep up, Fox said, the state has increased the
sales tax rate 61 times since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has created a tax structure that is not
competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Perez, a senior policy specialist at the fiscal affairs
program of the National Conference for State Legislatures, said:
``Tennessee has not been in a position to capture its share of the
great economic growth in the last decade. Perhaps that indicates
that Tennessee's current tax structure is out of kilter with
today's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist's proposal would add a 3.5 percent tax on income,
reduce the state's general sales tax rate to 3.75 percent from 6
percent and eliminate the sales tax on groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of our tax structure occurred on my watch,''
Sundquist said Friday in an interview. ``So I feel a responsibility
to fix the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Legislature this week, the governor said the
kind of long-term solution he had proposed was necessary to finance
education and health care for the next generation, even if that
meant the state would abandon its ranking among states with the
very lowest tax levels in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell our citizens that it is so important
that we remain 50th in taxes that we're prepared to settle for 50th
in everything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in Tennessee is convinced that there is even a
problem, much less that an income tax is the way to solve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wolf is not at the door,'' said Michael Williams, a
Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fully funded through July of next year,'' Williams said.
``And I have not seen anything so far that would make me support
the governor's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   One radio talk show host here, Dave Ramsey, has encouraged his
listeners to send tea bags to Tennessee legislators in protest of
an income tax. And a conservative research organization, the
Tennessee Family Institute, has campaigned against the income tax
as well, publicizing a report by the Cato Institute critical of a
Tennessee income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leader in the Senate, Ben Atchley of Knoxville,
is against the income tax, as are some Democrats. Atchley said he
did not believe there were enough votes in the Senate to pass the
governor's bill. He agreed that Tennessee's tax system had a
structural problem but said many taxpayers did not perceive it as
an immediate problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In last year's election, everything was rosy,'' he said. ``And
then all of a sudden we've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Atchley and others are looking for alternatives to an income
tax, and ideas about taxes on services and personal property as
well as spending cuts are beginning to be floated. The state's
Medicaid replacement program, Tenncare, is a likely target when
cuts are proposed. But no comprehensive alternatives to an income
tax have yet been presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of sweeping reform that Tennessee is considering is
rare, especially in recent years,'' said Perez of the state
legislatures group. ``It is always very difficult to enact any
significant tax changes in the states. It usually does not always
happen in the first year.''

JUSTICES RESTORE CLEVELAND'S SCHOOL VOUCHER PROGRAM, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court on Friday issued an
unusual order permitting Cleveland to operate its disputed school
voucher program at full strength until a federal appeals court
rules on the program's constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland program, which has been the subject of legal
challenges since its creation by the Ohio Legislature in 1995, is
being closely monitored by both sides in the debate over school
vouchers as offering a potentially crucial Supreme Court test of
the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Under a federal district judge's order issued the day before the
start of school in August and then revised three days later, some
3,000 students who are attending parochial schools in Cleveland at
public expense faced being forced to leave the program at the end
of the fall semester. In addition, 800 students who wanted to begin
using vouchers in religious schools were barred from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The justices set aside that order Friday, in language that was
not completely clear but that suggested that they planned to keep
the program operating until choosing whether to decide the case on
its merits. The justices will probably not determine until sometime
next year whether to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   The action at least suggests that the court, after turning down
a similar case from Milwaukee a year ago, may have concluded that
the time to decide the voucher issue is approaching. But it offers
no guarantee of that, let alone a firm indication of how the
justices would rule if they did eventually take the case.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the court's intervention, Betty Montgomery, the Ohio
attorney general, said that dozens of families who are now
receiving the tuition vouchers, of up to $2,250, were pulling their
children out of private school because of uncertainty over whether
the program would last the school year. That assertion may have
persuaded the justices to preserve the status quo, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Friday was 5-4 to grant the Ohio attorney general's
request for a stay of the preliminary injunction issued by the
federal district judge, Solomon Oliver. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist was in the majority along with Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. The
dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Neither side issued an opinion,
the dissenters noting only that they ``would deny the application
for stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual nature of the court's intervention lay in the fact
that the case remains in a preliminary stage, with no ruling yet by
the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has appealed Oliver's preliminary injunction to that court,
which sits in Cincinnati, but the 6th Circuit has given no
indication of when it might rule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oliver has scheduled a trial for Dec. 13 on whether
to convert his earlier ruling into a permanent injunction. Since
the judge has clearly indicated his belief that the voucher program
violates the constitutional separation of church and state, a
permanent injunction is considered highly likely. That in turn
would generate a renewed appeal to the 6th Circuit.

   JUDGE CONTENDS MICROSOFT STIFLED TECH INNOVATION
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge in the government's antitrust trial against
Microsoft issued a broad attack of the software giant as the first
part of his verdict in the case. The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson
of U.S. District Court, said that the company used its monopoly
power to stifle innovation, reduce competition and hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions
have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in
the computer industry,'' Judge Jackson wrote in his 207-page
findings of fact. ``Through its conduct,'' he added, ``Microsoft
has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and
immense profits to harm any firm'' that gets in its way.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ INDEX CONTINUES ITS CLIMB
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index closed above the 3,000 level for the
first time on Wednesday and recorded its sixth consecutive record
high yesterday. It ended the week up 46.34 points, or 1.5 percent,
at 3,102.29, and is up 41.48 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 16.59 percent so far
this year. It closed up 64.84 points, or 0.61 percent, to
10,704.48. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 7.59,
or 0.56 percent, to 1,370.23.
</P>
<P>
   EMPLOYERS FIND IT HARD TO FILL JOBS
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's unemployment rate at the lowest level in
nearly 30 years, employees are no longer afraid to go job hunting
in search of better benefits, more flexible hours and other perks,
while employers are having a hard time attracting candidates to
fill openings.
</P>
<P>
   SHARES OF COBALT SOAR ON FIRST DAY
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cobalt Networks, a maker of no-frills network
computers, soared in their first day of trading, to $128.50 from
their initial price of $22, as investors bestowed yet another
staggering valuation on a small, money-losing Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   APPEALS COURT HANDS INTEL A VICTORY
</P>
<P>
   Intel won a key victory in an antitrust case when a federal
appeals court lifted an order that required the computer chip maker
to share patented microprocessor technology with another company,
Intergraph.
</P>
<P>
   LATIN AMERICAN STOCKS RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's biggest stock markets are booming, as investors
from other countries take advantage of lower borrowing costs in the
United States to gain a stake in what they expect will be a region
of growing economies next year. In the last few weeks, indexes such
as the Bovespa on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, Latin America's
largest stock market, have soared to a six-month high. Healthy
gains were also registered by the exchanges in Mexico, Argentina,
Chile and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   DISPUTES THREATEN TRADE SUMMIT

members agree to compromise on disputes, notably one over
agricultural subsidies, standing in the way of setting the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   WEBVAN SHARES MAKE FAST START
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    JUDGE BRANDS MICROSOFT AS HARMFUL MONOPOLY
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-REACT, MICROSOFT-HIGHLIGHTS, MICROSOFT-PLAYERS
and MICROSOFT-TIMELINE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. holds monopoly power, stifles
competition and harms consumers, the judge who presided over the
landmark antitrust trial ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While not a final verdict, the long-awaited ``findings of fact''
by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson were a stunning
setback for the world's largest software company in one of most
watched antitrust cases of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's blistering 207-page ruling raised the prospect for
wide-ranging sanctions against the software empire built by Bill
Gates, now the world's richest man. Through Windows, the company's
flagship product, Microsoft currently controls about 90 percent of
the worldwide market for operating systems that run personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions
have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in
the computer industry,'' Jackson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found that by its conduct toward such competitors as
``Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and others, Microsoft has
demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and
immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing
initiatives that could intensify competition against one of
Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who brought the sweeping antitrust
case against Microsoft 18 months ago, hailed Jackson's opinion as
marking ``a great day for the American consumer.'' She said it
fully supports the Justice Department's view ``that this case is
about the protection of innovation, competition and the consumer's
right to choose the products they want.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from the company's Redmond, Wash., campus, Gates
suggested that the adverse ruling has whetted his appetite for a
negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gates: ``We remain committed to resolving these issues in a
fair and responsible manner as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We understand that Microsoft has a
responsibility to provide leadership on behalf of consumers and the
industry. As part of that, we have a responsibility to protect the
principle that has made America a leader in technology _ the
freedom to innovate on behalf of our consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a press conference about a possible deal, Joel Klein,
head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, noted, ``We
have always said that we are prepared to discuss settlement so long
as the important competitive issues are fully addressed. These
concerns about consumer choice and innovation are critical to this
nation and any settlement would have to fully and properly address
those'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision focused on the facts brought out by the trial,
which began Oct. 19 and ended in June. It will be followed by
another ruling that will deal with the direct legal issues of
whether Microsoft actually broke the antitrust laws. Finally, if
and when Microsoft is found to have done so, Jackson will convene
the penalty phase of trial.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares fell about 4 percent in after-hours trading
Friday night. However the stock market reacts to Jackson's ruling
when it reopens on Monday, his ``findings of fact'' do not actually
frame Microsoft as guilty of breaking antitrust laws, although they
certainly point in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they amount to a detailed analysis of the widely
divergent narratives provided by both sides during the 76 days of
testimony. As Jackson saw it, the government narrative was
believable; Microsoft's was not.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the 19 states that had joined the Justice
Department in filing suit against Microsoft case in May, 1998,
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal cited ``three core
findings'' of fact:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Microsoft has a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It has abused that monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It has harmed consumers ... in an immediate and easily
discernible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Blumenthal: ``Those are serious and far-reaching
violations that should lead to serious and far-reaching remedies.
And we do not rule out any of the remedies that may be available.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when the full legal process draws to a close will Jackson
be free to advance his own set of remedies. These could include
everything from breaking up Microsoft into two or more ``Baby
Bills,'' to requiring the company to make public more of its
Windows code, to monitoring its contracts with vendors, to
requiring court approval of any further acquisitions by a company
whose stock value currently exceeds that of any other corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In clearly siding with the government's view of events, Jackson
wrote that Microsoft has ``demonstrated that it will use its
prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that
insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition
against one of Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   The harm to consumer interests which stemmed from Microsoft's
predatory behavior, the judge said, was ``immediate and easily
discernible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson held that some innovations in the fast-paced hi-tech
world ``that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole
reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the depth and breadth of Jackson's findings, the
government now seems has a reduced incentive to enter into
settlement talks and avoiding a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final outcome of a possible lengthy appeal, this
antitrust trial will be long remembered as a titanic struggle
between the federal government and the corporate Goliath of the
Information Age.

and demand will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of one automaker said he no longer bothered
to pay attention to GM. And John P. Wolkonowicz, an industry
consultant at Buhlin Group, summed it up this way: ``They've fallen
and they can't get up.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors may be the world's biggest company, and it may be
enjoying record sales and profits, but it still doesn't get much
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, GM took the first step toward an expected
management reshuffling that would be its biggest in seven years.
But while its current leaders can point proudly to vast
improvements in the balance sheet, there are doubts throughout the
industry about whether a new team can solve the company's giant,
persistent problem: a failure to plug a steady leak in market
share. If the economy sours, the company _ as well as its work
force _ faces enormous problems.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough now. In October, GM's market share, 28 percent,
was smaller than the combined share of Asian automakers, 28.4
percent. In some ways, that marks the end of an era. While GM's
market power has been eroding for three decades, sinking below the
Asians was inconceivable a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, when GM built more than half the cars on the road,
when designers expressed America's postwar exuberance with soaring
tail fins, when marketers captured the imagination of millions by
telling them to ``see the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet,'' GM was held
in awe. But for years it has built take-no-chances vehicles,
usually a step behind the competition. GM's design triumphs are now
found not in garages but in museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company continues to run behind the curve,'' said Gerald
C. Meyers, a former American Motors chairman who is now a professor
of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan. ``They
have got to get out and lead the market in design.''
</P>
<P>
   GM knows it needs flashier cars, and is attacking that problem.
``To get market share you need great products,'' said John F. Smith
Jr., 61, GM's chairman and chief executive. He is expected to
retire in May, along with the director who helped install him in a
palace coup in 1992, John G. Smale. ``We've got a lot of strength
coming in the marketplace,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard is likely to amount to different men
wearing the same uniforms and marching with the same methodical
steps, according to interviews with directors, executives and
others close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the expected succession, several executives close to Smith
would simply move up the ladder. Harry J. Pearce, 57, now vice
chairman, would become chairman, while G. Richard Wagoner Jr., 46,
now president and chief operating officer, would become chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said in a recent interview that he had no plans to retire
soon, but people close to the company said that he is ready to step
down and that the board planned to announce those changes in
January, effective in May, when Smale retires.
</P>
<P>
   GM's leaders said in a series of interviews that the company
would be hitting on all cylinders within a few years _ that it had
redefined each brand and was developing cars and trucks that meet
its sharpened marketing goals. In an effort to win back buyers, GM
plans to introduce 20 new car models and 40 light-truck models
worldwide in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, GM will have a sizable edge over its rivals. As
other automakers scramble to become big enough to sell cars
worldwide _ in the last year, Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler, Ford
bought Volvo and Renault took a big stake in Nissan _ GM is already
global in a way that they only dream of being.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said great designs could indeed jump-start GM.
``You can't expect to get much change in market share when you are
just me-tooing,'' said David E. Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. He
noted that Chrysler _ the poster child of car company turnarounds _
``was very damaged and they turned it around remarkably fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's retired president and vice chairman,
agreed: ``If they really came up with blockbuster cars and trucks
as opposed to me-too vehicles or OK vehicles, they could turn
things around in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has a long way to go. Because its market-share decline has
been so steady, it is hard to grasp its severity. At its peak, in
1962, GM sold 51 percent of the nation's sets of wheels _ with its
Chevrolet division alone selling 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 model year, the whole company sold just 29.7 percent
in an industry where executives claw like alley cats for every
tenth of a point. GM's market share even ticked down a tenth of a
point from the 1998 model year, when a strike shut down production
and essentially erased a month's worth of sales. In the 1997 model
year, a fairer comparison, GM's share stood at 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The October 1999 number was GM's lowest ever, with the exception
of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The global picture is also grim: At its postwar peak in 1950,
GM, which peddles cars and trucks in 170 countries, sold 39.6
percent of the world's vehicles. By 1992, when Smith took over,
that was down to 17.6 percent. In the first nine months of this
year, it was 15.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the board will add worldwide market share to
the criteria that determine executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to grow market share; there is no question about it,''
Pearce said. ``Our necks are on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Car companies in trouble typically focus first on fixing what is
closest to the consumer _ their cars and trucks. That is what
Nissan is trying to do now, and what Chrysler already has done.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Chrysler was best known for its boxy K-cars. But
in 1989, it unveiled the Dodge Viper, a flashy muscle car. ``An
automobile company doesn't even have to be very good to look great
if they have blockbuster products,'' said Lutz, now chief executive
of Exide, the world's largest battery maker. ``The Viper was the
key to revitalizing the whole Dodge brand and possibly the whole
Chrysler Corporation.''

RED SOX SURGICAL NEWS NOT GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The news that Red Sox reliever Tom Gordon has been told
by another doctor that he will require Tommy John tendon transfer
surgery in his right elbow is not surprising. He was told of that
possibility as early as June by team doctor Arthur Pappas, and
later by orthopedist James Andrews, the surgeon he consulted for a
second opinion this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the finding this week by orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum, whom
Gordon saw with the club's permission, that he will need the
procedure raises questions why Gordon persisted in his
rehabilitation through the end of the season, delaying an operation
that will cause him to miss all of next season and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Red Sox righthander Bret Saberhagen, who made three
visits to the disabled list last season, underwent surgery Tuesday
to repair a tear in his rotator cuff. That's a disquieting
development for Saberhagen, who said in September that the rotator
cuff was frayed and would not require a significant procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, team spokesman Kevin Shea said Friday that according to
Pappas, Saberhagen will not be 100 percent for the start of spring
training and will need to follow a more modified program than that
of the other pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Altchek, the Mets' surgeon who also did Saberhagen's
radical shoulder reconstruction in 1997, performed the arthroscopic
procedure. Altchek's office referred all queries to the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas could not be reached for a comment.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said a decision is still pending on whether Gordon will
undergo the Tommy John procedure to repair the ligament damage.
Pappas and Yocum have been in contact, and it appears likely that
Yocum, the surgeon for the Anaheim Angels, would end up performing
the operation. The Red Sox took exception to Gordon seeing Andrews,
who is the medical director of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, with Sox
general manager Dan Duquette raising conflict-of-interest issues.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette's suggestion that Andrews's involvement with the Devil
Rays would compromise his advice to Gordon is curious, inasmuch as
players from one team routinely see doctors on the staffs of other
clubs. Many pitchers requiring elbow procedures, for example, have
seen Yocum, Andrews, or Dr. Frank Jobe, the long-time team
physician for the Dodgers who pioneered the Tommy John procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's condition has become a source of conflict with the
club. Upon returning to the team in late September after making a
series of rehabilitation appearances in the minor leagues, Gordon
said that he thought there was a breach of trust between the club
and himself, and he would prefer a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas has maintained that Gordon knew all along _ from the time
a tear was discovered in his ulnar ligament back in June _ that the
Tommy John procedure was a possibility. But Gordon preferred to
see, Pappas said, if more conservative treatment _ rest and
medication _ would prove beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tom Gordon had come to me in October last year or early
this year and said, `This is my problem, here are the findings,
then I am sure the discussion would be, `I think you should have
this done,' and it would have been done,'' Pappas said this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to give all opportunities to the resolution of the
problem before you say, `OK, your season is over, it can't work.'
And I think that's the frustration that . . . it gets to the point
where if something didn't resolve, then you go back and say, `Well,
why didn't you do something sooner?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon said he was told in late July by Andrews that the
Tommy John procedure was likely, teammates, including Nomar
Garciaparra, were critical of the team's medical staff, questioning
the delay in having the procedure done.

 DETROIT: Chrysler Corporation.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that hasn't been GM's way. It lost $2 billion in 1990 and
$4.5 billion in 1991. Since Smith took over in 1992, GM has made
money every year _ and has fixed everything but its cars.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cars, of course, are better than yesteryear's, but the
improvements haven't been enough to pass the competition. However,
executives have managed to lift profits by improving productivity,
quality, time to market, manufacturing, operating efficiency and,
most recently, labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have systematically changed most things at General
Motors,'' Smith said. ``We're not a troubled company.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has set quarterly earnings records for four quarters in a
row. Its high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickups are so
popular that it cannot build them fast enough. Most analysts urge
clients to buy GM stock. And despite its shrinking market share, GM
is poised to set sales records this year because overall sales
levels are so high.
</P>
<P>
   But these achievements, to some extent, are the products of a
sizzling economy. On closer inspection, GM's financial picture is
mixed. On the upside, it has already surpassed next year's goal of
an average 12.5 percent return on net assets for four quarters in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Smith had set a quarterly 5 percent net
profit margin goal. But in the third quarter, GM missed that by a
mile, managing just 2 percent, with its Latin American and Asia
operations losing money. For the first nine months of the year, the
overall margin was 3.4 percent. By comparison, Ford's margin was
6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while GM has vastly improved its manufacturing efficiency,
so have its competitors. Two decades ago, the Japanese could build
cars for about $1,000 less than America's Big Three, according to
Harbour &AMP; Associates, an auto industry research firm. Its latest
study showed that GM, along with DaimlerChrysler, still operates
with roughly the same gap, while Ford has cut it in half.
</P>
<P>
   GM has gone to great lengths, meanwhile, to impress
shareholders. Between January 1997 and Oct. 13 of this year, it
spent $7.5 billion to buy back 15.6 percent of its shares. It has
sold or spun off to shareholders its Electronic Data Systems,
Hughes Defense and Delphi Automotive Systems subsidiaries. And it
is evaluating whether to spin off part of Hughes Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   GM stock, having started the year at $58, ran up to a high of
about $77 in April, but has since dropped to about $68.875,
following the general trading pattern of Ford's stock. Most
analysts rate the stock a buy, in part because it trades at just
8.12 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But many rate it a buy for another reason. As John A. Casesa, an
auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, put it in a recent report, the
possibility of a Hughes Electronics spinoff ``is the key
attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   And while outsiders applaud GM's efforts to improve its lineup,
many are skeptical about the ability of GM executives to predict
which cars and trucks will attract customers, given the company's
track record of turning out dull designs. GM's rivals are rushing
out new models, too.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, a former GM executive who is now co-chairman of
DaimlerChrysler, said the thought of competing with GM's future
offerings didn't exactly make his knees knock. GM has not proved a
force to worry about for some time and, he said, ``I don't expect
it will in the future either.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald L. Zarrella, president of GM's North American
operations and its marketing chief, countered: ``I hope our
competitors are writing us off. I think they are making a huge
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Others hope so, too. GM stock can be found in the portfolios or
pension plans of at least 1.2 million Americans, and nearly 400,000
workers around the world depend on GM for a livelihood. So while
``What's good for GM is good for America'' may be an outdated
saying, the company remains awesome in size and impact.
</P>
<P>
   The market share question is important not only because it
symbolizes the decline of a once-great American company. Its answer
may also be essential to the well-being of GM's 143,200 factory
workers in the United States. Zarrella said one reason the
company's share had not increased this year was that GM is already
building as many cars and trucks as it can. But in a weaker
economy, workers now pulling overtime would probably face layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lower market, we've got to increase our market share,''
Pearce said. ``You would have excess capacity, and excess capacity
means higher costs and less profitability and that's not the way we
are going.''
</P>
<P>
   GM executives can explain their market share problems. ``When we
had the difficulties in the early '90s, we had to stop a lot of
product programs,'' Smith said. ``That hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   When GM started making money again, it concentrated on replacing
its biggest sellers with fresh products _ primarily midsized cars
and minivans in a market craving sport utility vehicles and
pickups. And because the money those cars brought in was keeping
the rest of the company afloat, managers were loath to take design
chances.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer the case. By 2004, GM wants half of its lineup
to be made up of innovative products _ cars and trucks that are
daringly designed, that do something other auto makers haven't
thought of or that sharply improve on what others have done. The
bulk would be vehicles that mix and match attributes of cars,
pickups and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   That is a big change. Three years ago, GM looked five years into
the future and classified fewer than 5 percent of its products as
innovative, said Lawrence D. Burns, GM's vice president for
research and development and planning.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner added: ``I think people would like to see a little more
spice in the mix _ maybe products, frankly, that may not be that
critical from our volume and pricing and profitability perspective,
but might liven up the overall car portfolio. And I think that's a
fair criticism, and I think you are going to see more of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether GM can pull it off. Industry leaders say
top GM executives are not ``car guys'' but financial wizards who
seem out of place at car races, where many industry executives seem
at home. As a result, those leaders said, they do not trust their
gut instincts for what will prove popular with buyers, and instead
rely heavily on research.
</P>
<P>
   Smale, retired chairman of Procter &AMP; Gamble, is as happy selling
soap as cars, and so are many of the marketers GM has hired in
recent years to sharpen the image of its vehicles. Pearce is a
lawyer.

 DETROIT: a lawyer.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``GM is betting its future on getting the science of predicting
what will work versus what won't work to levels which nobody has
achieved before,'' said Lutz, the retired Chrysler executive. ``It
is possible that the science will prevail, but it would be the only
area of creative expression where a scientific formula will
determine the hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 10 separate interviews, GM executives mentioned the
``RDBs'' of various cars and trucks _ the ``relative differentiated
benefits'' they give customers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the research effort is awesome in scope. GM has 40
full-time people who search the world for social, economic,
environmental and political trends that might influence buyers. The
sophisticated, ambitious forecasting and planning projects are
intended to ensure that GM can be ready for whatever the future
holds.
</P>
<P>
   One ``what if'' situation is that people will someday travel in
flying cars, just as portrayed on ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite GM's Herculean research efforts, outsiders are
skeptical. Just three years ago, GM introduced 15 cars and trucks
that executives insisted would end the company's slide in market
share. But those models only increased share slightly in some
segments, while the overall decline continued.
</P>
<P>
   As for GM's latest assertions, ``we've heard that song before,''
said Nissan's president of North American design, Gerald P.
Hirshberg.
</P>
<P>
   But GM's rivals are hardly standing still. DaimlerChrysler is
investing about $47 billion to develop 64 new cars and commercial
vehicles by 2004. Toyota plans to introduce 11 models in the United
States in the next 18 months. The much smaller BMW plans about a
dozen in the United States in the next two years. And all auto
makers are rushing to add new crossover products _ vehicles that
combine car and truck attributes _ to the American market.
</P>
<P>
   While GM said it had been focusing intensely on styling for the
last 18 months _ and vehicles take up to five years to develop _
the company's latest styling attempts have been mere evolutions of
existing designs. A year ago, GM replaced its full-sized pickups _
the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra _ and in January it will
bring out sport utility vehicles based on those designs, new
versions of the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives argue that customers who are likely to buy those
vehicles don't want radical styling changes. And they point out
that the new trucks are handily outselling the old ones. `
</P>
<P>
   `The new truck, some would say, is in terms of its styling,
incremental,'' Pearce said. ``That's what our marketing research
said was warranted.'' While other companies are rushing out
expressive designs for their sport utility vehicles, GM's will look
much like those that have been on the street for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   GM's newest design efforts _ the Chevrolet Impala and its
two-door cousin, the Monte Carlo _ have also turned out bland,
according to competing designers. But Pearce said ``an Impala is
very exciting in its own market segment,'' arguing that buyers of
midsized sedans are more concerned about safety features and
interior space than styling.
</P>
<P>
   While some reviewers have given the cars high marks for
handling, others are less generous in their praise. Automobile
Magazine called the Monte Carlo ``inoffensive but hardly exciting''
and wrote, ``We hope that by the next redesign, Chevrolet might
wake up and make the Monte Carlo great as opposed to just OK''
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner shrugged. ``Beauty is a little bit in the eye of
beholder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, styling isn't the most important attribute for some
buyers. Legions of baby boomers have grown to trust Consumer
Reports, but GM vehicles seldom excel there either. ``Generally,
the GM products have not done well,'' said David A. Champion, the
magazine's director of auto testing. ``In terms of reliability,
they've always been below average, so we haven't been able to
recommend them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting better,'' Champion said. But he could only
think of two the magazine had recommended in recent years: the
Chevrolet Lumina, which he said was reliable but had sloppy
handling, and the Oldsmobile Intrigue, which recently was dropped
from the recommended list because of reliability problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the skeptics are wrong and customers fall in love with
the cars and trucks that flow out of GM's new efforts, it will be
years before most make it from designers' drawing boards to
dealers' lots. Zarrella said market share should gradually increase
because of new models like the Saturn LS and the Chevrolet
Silverado and Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth will be told over the next five years,'' Wagoner
said. ``I don't deny there are a lot of challenges for us, but I
would have to say I like our deck of cards.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wagoner and Pearce prepare to take the reins at GM, and as
Smith and Smale prepare to retire, there is another striking change
from 1992. The board is no longer clamoring for anyone's head. In
fact, Smale is defending current management against outside critics
instead of leading the charge to throw it out. ``This is a cup half
full, not half empty,'' Smale said.
</P>
<P>
   And while market share is so important that it is now discussed
at every board meeting, it is not done in a scolding manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the board shaking its finger at a complacent
management, saying, `Why don't you get your market share up?'''
Smale said in a recent interview in his Cincinnati office. ``The
board agrees with management that the market share ought to be
higher.''

ANALYSIS: JUDGE'S FINDINGS SHAKE MICROSOFT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For list of sidebars, see MICROSOFT-ADVISORY-NYT; the text of
Penfield's finding is available on The New York Times web site,
www.nytimes.com.) 
(th) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a 207-page legal document, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
has fashioned a club and wielded it against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In findings of fact that echo almost every one of the
government's allegations in its sweeping antitrust suit against the
big software maker, Jackson has concluded that Microsoft is a
monopolist that time and again bullied other companies in the
computer industry, harming consumers and hindering innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad day for Microsoft,'' observed William Kovacic, a
professor at the George Washington University law school. ``The
judge relentlessly accepted the government's story of what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Jackson used carefully calibrated legal prose, but at
the end of his findings he shifted to uncommonly blunt language.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's actions, he said, conveyed the message that the
company would use ``its prodigious market power and immense profits
to harm any firm'' that chooses to compete with the company's
mainstay products _ especially its corporate crown jewel, the
Windows operating system, which acts as the equivalent of the
central nervous system in more than 85 percent of personal
computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   Before the findings of fact were released Friday evening, legal
experts had expected that Jackson would generally favor the
government but also nod on occasion in Microsoft's direction. He
had suggested in the past that he would prefer to broker an
out-of-court settlement between Microsoft and the government. Such
an outcome would relieve the federal courts of the burden of having
to make fine-tuned decisions about products and business practices
in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement is still a possibility _ but only, it seems, if
Bill Gates, the company chairman, and his top lieutenants decide
that Jackson has done what no industry competitor ever
accomplished: brought Microsoft to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with these findings, antitrust experts say it is more likely
that Microsoft will persevere, hoping that Jackson's final ruling
is not such a one-sided rout as Friday's document might seem to
portend. The company's next step might then be to appeal his
decision to a federal appeals court and then perhaps the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge's goal was settlement, he would have to leave
enough ambiguity in the findings of fact so that neither side sees
it as in its self interest to fight this to the bitter end,''
observed Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa
law school, who is a leading antitrust scholar and who is advising
the government.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little that is ambiguous in Jackson's document.
``Having gone this far, I don't see Microsoft settling,'' said
Andrew Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's findings of fact are a preliminary step and not a
final ruling. But they form the all-but-unshakable foundation and
framework for the outcome of the case _ either a legal judgment or
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A court's legal judgment can be routinely overruled by a higher
court on appeal. But findings of fact can be overturned only in the
rare instance when the higher court finds a ``blatant
contradiction'' between the written record of the case and a
judge's finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson has poured a lot of concrete here,'' said
Kovacic of George Washington University.

HOUSE APPROVES AID BILL BUT SOME CALL IT INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SPEND-CONGRESS) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House overwhelmingly approved a compromise
foreign aid bill on Friday, but some allied governments and
international aid workers expressed disappointment at the debt
relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 316-100, lawmakers agreed to an aid package
negotiated by the White House and Congress on Thursday that added
$799 million more than Republicans wanted to spend on matters like
peacekeeping in Kosovo, nuclear security in Russia and cancellation
of poor nations' debts, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The $13.5 billion measure will advance next week to the Senate,
where approval is expected.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the bill ``meets our commitments'' in key
policy areas. But some European diplomats here and international
aid workers were more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   In debt relief, the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed in
Cologne, Germany, in June to cut the debt burden of the poorest
countries to ease poverty. To help pay the American share, Clinton
requested $370 million this year to help the 41 countries
identified by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as
``heavily indebted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, who included $33 million in their spending
bill, agreed to only $123 million in the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   They said that to spend more would raid the Social Security
surplus, which both parties vow to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger today is not American hegemony, but American
disengagement,'' said one diplomat from a European country involved
in the debt fund set up at Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said America could well afford to cancel loans to
let poor countries focus their resources on needed services like
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think a farmer in Mali should be selling some of his
crop to go into the U.S. Treasury, when they need to get children
into school,'' said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam, a worldwide
anti-poverty agency.
</P>
<P>
   The initial foreign aid bill passed by the Republican Congress
last month contained $12.7 billion, and was vetoed by Clinton as
inadequate. The administration had asked for $14.4 billion, but
compromised on $13.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise restored some administration priorities,
including an additional $170 million in economic support funds and
$150 million for development aid.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed earlier to spend $1.8 billion over three
years to underwrite the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Of that
amount, providing Clinton's full request, $1.2 billion is for
military support to Israel, $400 million in economic aid for the
West Bank and Gaza, and $200 million for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also restored $104 million for nuclear-security
programs and other aid in the former Soviet Union, but the $839
million total fell far short of the administration's request for
$1.32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has worked hard to prevent nuclear material in
Russia from falling into the hands of terrorists. Even some
proponents of these safeguards have grown frustrated as Russian
authorities have restricted access to some sensitive nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Luongo, the head of the Russian-American Nuclear
Security Advisory Council, a private group, said: ``Given the
problems in Russia, the thought that devoting less money is going
to give them incentive to be more cooperative, or solve the problem
faster, is inaccurate.''

MOST DRASTIC MICROSOFT REMEDY, BREAKUP, WOULD BE DRAMATIC ON LOCAL
ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A decision is still months away as to what remedy, if
any, is appropriate to punish Microsoft for its allegedly
monopolistic activities and prevent their recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly everyone agrees the worst case _ a court-ordered
breakup or restructuring of the company _ is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But what if such a remedy were to be imposed?
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the Puget Sound region would be disastrous,
experts say. Or they'd be terrific. One thing is certain: they'd be
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is the most important company in the most influential
industry in King County, said Dennis Fusco, chief economist for the
Washington Employment Security Department, who rates its impact
even ahead of the region's biggest employer, aerospace giant The
Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the aircraft industry employ nearly four times more
people than the prepackaged software industry. But software
generates more wages, $6.8 billion vs. aircraft's $5.6 billion,
Fusco said. So any significant interference with it would have
major implications for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is the star here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond software giant leads the prepackaged software
industry in King County, where employment in software has jumped 40
percent over the past three years, adding 7,000 jobs. The software
industry's growth rate is three times greater than the rest of King
County's economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the average statewide wage in prepackaged software was
$283,000. For all other segments it was $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   All that money has a huge effect on the Puget Sound region,
fueling the purchase of homes, automobiles, clothing and other
goods and services. Every job at Microsoft supports 3.4 jobs
elsewhere in the economy, according to a Microsoft-sponsored study
by Seattle economist Dick Conway in 1996. Microsoft was the
single-largest factor in preventing the area from sliding into a
recession in the early 1990s, Conway concluded.
</P>
<P>
   If the company were to be broken up, ``that would diminish the
single identity of the company that's recognized not only within
the region but all over the world,'' Fusco said. ``We'd lose our
single biggest high-tech company, which has undoubtedly been a
major attraction for spinoffs and related companies that have
provided Seattle with a huge complex of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even lesser sanctions, such as government regulation of some
contractual relationships, could be harmful, said Tony Audino, a
former Microsoft executive who's now managing director of Voyager
Capital, a Seattle venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large environment, with nearly 30,000 employees, is already
hard to deal with,'' Audino said. ``When you add restrictions on
how the company can do business, some talented people will say, `I
don't need to work in this environment.'''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees a breakup would be bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history of breakups, the long-term always
brings increased business, even though there's disruption in the
short term,'' said University of Washington Geography Professor
Richard Morrill.
</P>
<P>
   Several observers pointed to the success of SBC, the former Baby
Bell that was cut loose from Ma Bell in the 1984 court-ordered
breakup of AT&AMP;T and grew so large and strong that it was added to
the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the company were actually split into separate entities,
that's when I think Microsoft's critics might have to watch what
they wish for,'' said Warren Wilson, an analyst with Summit
Strategies in Kirkland, Wash. ``The result would be two or three or
more competitive entities, each with top-notch people and products.
The effect on stockholders would likely be very positive, because
the separate valuations of those companies would probably rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's take it a step further. What if Microsoft, fed up by
regulation, were to relocate the company outside the United States
_ say, to the Cayman Islands, where corporate livin' is easy? It's
unlikely but not impossible, some observers said.
</P>
<P>
   If it did happen, ``it would obviously be a huge loss,''
stripping the area of a critically important economic resource,
Fusco said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that between 7,500 and 10,000 Microsoft
employees have become millionaires, and many of them have remained
in the Seattle area, where their spending stimulates the economy.
</P>
<P>
   And the dozen or so Microsoft's millionaires who have gone their
own way in the past two years, starting their own ``Baby Bill''
companies, are doing even more to boost the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   There are no exact figures on how many Baby Bills are in the
Puget Sound region. But Audino, who founded Microsoft AlumNet (a
non-profit organization that supports the entrepreneurial and
philanthropic causes of Microsoft alumni), said the number is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Since Microsoft AlumNet was created in 1995, membership has
swelled to nearly 3,000, growing by about 100 people a month, he
said. Audino estimated that about 30 percent to 40 percent of those
members have created their own companies or consulting practices or
joined smaller startups.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Audino himself, have become venture capitalists or
``angel investors,'' high-wealth individuals who make early
investments in technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Audino believes the Baby Bill boom is just beginning in Seattle.
The recent success of companies such as Rob Glaser's RealNetworks,
Naveen Jain's InfoSpace.com and Brent Frei's Onyx Software are
tempting others to venture out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Audino calls this the ``lighthouse effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like having peers like Rob Glaser and Brent
Frei go out with public companies and then people (at Microsoft)
start to say, `Wow, I can do something like that,''' said Audino.

 &HT;    Despite legal issues, online betting booming
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Frankie is like a lot of guys who will
bet on today's Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park. He's in his
40s, makes six figures and spends too much of it on the horses.
</P>
<P>
   But while 50,000 of Frankie's betting colleagues will be
battling traffic and the crowd today at the track, the only line
he's worried about is the one that attaches his computer to his
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie won't have to leave his living room to make a bet _
he'll use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I want to go through all the hassles, spend a bunch of
money before I make a bet, and then maybe get shut out at the
windows?'' Frankie said. ``I can sit here in my underwear if I want
and make bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankie doesn't want his last name revealed for reasons other
than his choice of fashion: What he's doing is popular, but
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits bets on sports ``by phone or wire,'' which
some interpret to include the Internet. Problem is, in some states
there are archaic laws attempting to govern technology that changes
by the day.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) would update federal
law by specifically prohibiting all forms of gambling on the
Internet _ with the notable exception of horse racing. A similar
bill was introduced in the U.S. House by Reps. Bob Goodlatte
(R-Va.) and Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   Track owners and operators are hoping Internet gambling is
legalized for horse racing. They know the latest technological
advances can offset a generation of declining interest in racing
brought about in large part by a lack of vision and marketing from
within their industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived through the start of television when horse racing
chose not to get involved, and we missed out on a whole generation
of fans,'' said Stan Bernstein, executive vice president of the
Harness Tracks of America. ``I don't want to see that happen again
with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't. A federal commission recently reported that online
gambling revenue more than doubled from $300 million in 1997 to
$650 million last year. That number is certain to surpass $1
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers don't include the annual $2 billion in
telephone-wagering accounts bet legally in eight states and
illegally just about everywhere else. The telephone wagering is
akin to cyber-betting because both require only a phone line and a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it goes on here in Florida,'' said Doug
Donn, president of Gulfstream Park. ``Now, are we going to share in
this growth or allow other states to cash in?''
</P>
<P>
   A recent FBI survey found more than 500 Internet sites offering
gambling services around the world. Many online services attempt to
skirt the legal question by basing their operation overseas. They
attract about 15 million gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   While these numbers involve all types of gambling _ such as
blackjack, roulette, craps and slots _ horse racing enthusiasts
believe they offer one distinct advantage over other types of cyber
wagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is an actual event,'' said Ken Kirchner, the Breeders'
Cup simulcast director. ``We're not some wheel spinning around
somewhere. There's no question horse racing is going to be huge on
the Internet because it's such a data-driven sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The pie is big enough to be sliced a few ways. More than $13.1
billion was bet at tracks and through simulcast wagering last year,
according to figures compiled by the Jockey Club in New York. But
there's that little matter of legality.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, police raided the Los Angeles offices of Youbet.com
Inc., which claims to be the nation's ``first interactive on-line
horse racing service.''
</P>
<P>
   Youbet.com, which is offering a $250,000 handicapping contest on
the Breeders' Cup, has more than 12,000 subscribers who pay a $5.95
monthly fee to view races at more than 30 tracks across the
country. Ron Luniewski, president of Youbet.com, would not be
interviewed for this article because of the ongoing investigation,
but he has maintained his company is operating legally.
</P>
<P>
   Some deep-pocketed companies are gambling that the government
will allow bettors to wager at home. Youbet.com raised more than
$70 million after it went public, which some stock analysts
questioned because of the legality issue. The Television Games
Network is being bankrolled by TV Guide Inc. and Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. _ somewhere between $30 million and $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   There's also The Racing Network, which has its customers pay
about $250 for a 30-inch satellite dish plus about $15 a month in
subscriber fees. TRN's betting partner is the Pennsylvania-based
Ladbroke Racing Corp., whose parent company is internationally
involved in racetracks and gambling ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving into an era where racing fans will be able to bet
on races wherever and whenever they want,'' said FXC Investors
President Frank Curzio, a New York-based analyst who watches the
racing industry. ``I don't think you can stop it because everyone's
going to have their hands in the till.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers see the recent acquisitions of tracks by the
Churchill Downs company (it recently bought Calder Race Course in
Miami) and Canadian industrialist Frank Stronach (he recently
purchased Gulfstream) as attempts to position themselves for this
new era of betting. The belief is they will have their own
TV/online network to offer at-home bettors, either by telephone or
the Internet.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS ENGAGE PRESIDENT IN BUDGET TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss., N.J., Fla., Alaska, Del., S.D.)  (See also AID-CONGRESS, filed in `i' category) 
(lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in Congress, eager to adjourn
with a spending deal that allows them to claim a partial political
victory, are bargaining directly with President Clinton, White
House and congressional officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said a compromise was discussed on Wednesday and
Thursday in telephone calls among Clinton, Speaker Dennis Hastert
of Illinois and Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority
leader. Clinton and Hastert also met privately in Chicago Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much remains to be done. The two sides are still
billions apart on spending. And there are significant policy
disputes, like the Republicans' refusal to agree to pay $1 billion
in dues that the United States owes to the United Nations. As a
result, neither side expects a grand bargain before Congress
reconvenes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No deal has been struck. ``We feel that the only way to conduct
these kind of negotiations is detail by detail and line by line,''
Gene Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal Republicans are seeking would require the White House
to pay for new spending it wants by cutting other programs, cuts
called offsets. These real cuts would stop the creative accounting
that has masked tens of billions of dollars in the Republican
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Friday night that they had a long
list of offsets in their pocket. They have not shown Republicans
that list.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also want Clinton to agree to a small
across-the-board cut in federal spending, significantly smaller
than the 1 percent cut that he denounced as ``mindless'' and that
he vetoed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert raised the question directly, but ``the president
indicated opposition and said offsets were a far better solution,''
a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal would be aimed at allowing both sides to claim that
this year's budget will not dip into Social Security surpluses to
finance federal spending. This would defuse accusations that the
Republican spending bills, or White House demands for spending
increases, would require tapping into the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Republicans would have to agree on using
bookkeeping devices that make the spending look as low as possible.
``I have no objection to that,'' Clinton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already signaled his willingness to compromise with
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to sit down like grownups, go out and tell the
American people the truth, and work through this,'' he said on
Monday, two days before he vetoed the bill that included the
across-the-board cuts. ``We can find the offsets. We don't have to
spend the Social Security surplus. We can do this. And I hope they
will work with me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If a deal with the president falls through, senior Republican
aides said, their leaders would prepare a package of billions of
dollars in mandatory spending reductions that Clinton could not
easily block.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans desperately want to complete the year's four
remaining spending bills before Wednesday, the deadline set by the
year's fourth continuing resolution, passed by Congress on Thursday
night, that allows the government to keep operating without a real
budget. That budget was due 35 days ago, on Oct. 1, the beginning
of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress are tired and grumpy, and they want to
go home, said the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, Bill Young of Florida. More than any struggle over
principle, power or penny-pinching, the desire to leave town seems
likely to push them to the finish line next week, in what most of
them hope will be the last days of a desultory year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is the mood and the hopes of all the members,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hastert and other Republican leaders emerged from his
office on Thursday night, after a marathon bargaining session with
the White House over spending on foreign aid, they looked spent.
Hastert wore a mask of exhaustion. He had just been beaten by the
White House into spending about $800 million more on foreign aid
than his conservative colleagues wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was just plain beat. ``The days have been long,''
he said. ``The hours have been long. Lots of 15-, 16-hour days.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to wrap up a deal is that nearly two dozen
senators have planned official trips in the coming three weeks.
They include Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, which governs spending; William Roth,
R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance Committee, which governs
taxes, and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must accomplish a great deal if it truly wants to leave
town on Wednesday _ the end of the fourth overtime period in what
has thus far been a game with few stars and fewer highlights.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the $15.2 billion foreign aid bill by a 316-100
vote Friday, with 84 Republicans in dissent. Four spending bills
remain to be negotiated between the White House and Congress, since
President Clinton has either vetoed or refused to sign each one
over issues of spending and policy.
</P>
<P>
   The bill covering the Interior Department is being held up by
two disagreements. One is President Clinton's request for $550
million more to buy wilderness areas to protect them from
developers. The Republicans are willing to offer $300 million, but
want to spend it in different ways, Young said. The second
disagreement is over Republican riders benefiting the oil, gas,
mining and ranching industries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill covering the Commerce, Justice and State Departments
has two problems, as well. One is the demand by Rep. Christopher
Smith, R-N.J., that the United States refuse to pay $1 billion in
back dues to the United Nations until the White House agrees that
no federal money can go to groups trying to liberalize abortion
abroad. The other is Clinton's demand that Congress fully finance
his program to add 50,000 officers to local police forces.
</P>
<P>
   The bill covering the Education Department is stymied by a
dispute involving Clinton's $1.4 billion program to reduce class
sizes in public schools by hiring 100,000 new teachers. And the
bill providing federal funds for the District of Columbia has been
hamstrung by Republican refusals to finance an AIDS program and
other local measures.

   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ Searching through water so deep
and murky that no sunlight reaches the sea floor, operators of Deep
Drone, a remote-controlled submarine tethered to a Navy salvage
ship, closed in on Friday on two pinging sounds that they hope will
lead them to the two flight recorders from EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds, made by devices called pingers, are located in
roughly 250 to 270 feet of water, among small pieces of the
aircraft's wreckage, and may be covered by the sea floor's fine
silt. Investigators said the pingers appear to be tantalizingly
close together _ as near as 15 feet apart _ and that their signals
were remarkably strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer I got back from the guys on board, the level of
sound from the pingers was so loud they had to take their earphones
off,'' said Capt. Bert Marsh, supervisor of salvage for the U.S.
Navy, speaking at a briefing here. ``So we know they are there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, because the Deep Drone's cameras could not see the
pingers, officials said they could not be certain that they are
still attached to the Boeing 767's flight recorders. The devices,
known as black boxes even through they are bright orange, contain
crucial data that could help the National Transportation Safety
Board determine why the aircraft fell from the sky early on Sunday
morning while en route to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, Marsh and James E. Hall, chairman of the NTSB, said
the crew of the USS Grapple, a Navy salvage ship, would work as
long as the weather would allow them to operate the Deep Drone
safely. A storm, the second this week, was expected for Saturday,
and investigators hoped to have the black boxes on the Grapple's
deck before the sea state deteriorates again.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours, investigators suffered another disappointment,
saying they had postponed the search once more because of building
seas.
</P>
<P>
   Once the flight recorders are retrieved, they will be flown by
helicopter from the ship's deck to the landing strip at Quonset
Point Air National Guard Station in Rhode Island, loaded onto a
waiting airplane and taken to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recorders will then be taken into labs,'' said Gregory
Phillips, the investigator in charge of the recovery effort. ``We
have two separate labs, and they will be operating
simultaneously.'' One will listen to tape from the Cockpit Voice
Recorder tape, and the other will analyze the Flight Data Recorder,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials said they did not know how long it might take to
extract preliminary data from the recorders. Their condition,
precisely how much information they were designed to record, and
whether they functioned until impact, was not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   The pingers' strong signals were emanating from a debris field
where the current was a half-knot to one-knot, allowing the
civilian contractors aboard the vessel who are operating the Deep
Drone to manipulate the submarine with relative ease. The water at
the sea floor was pitch black, however, even though the day was
cloudless and bright.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said visibility around the drone, which lights its own
way, was limited to 3 to 6 feet as it maneuvered through a debris
field. Hall said the submarine had not located any large pieces of
the airplane _ the largest identifiable piece of debris was a tire
_ and that the operators were not yet looking for any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have focused on is the recorders
themselves,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also showed a reluctance to deploy any divers to
the crash site, which is more than twice as deep as the scene of
the 1996 crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800. Marsh said the
Navy planned to use the submarine alone to recover the boxes, even
for such tasks as attaching a cable to them to winch them aboard.
Divers would remain on deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than likely it will be a Deep Drone recovery,'' he said,
and if the weather cooperates, the investigation's most important
evidence to date could be brought aboard quickly.

BALLROOM BECOMES MOSQUE FOR FAMILIES OF CRASH VICTIMS

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ It is called the Salat al-Ghaib, and it is the
Muslim prayer for the dead whose bodies are absent.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer was recited here Friday by mourning relatives of some
of the 217 people who died aboard EgyptAir Flight 990. Their mosque
was Grand Ballroom B of the Doubletree Islander Hotel, where many
of them have been staying since Monday. White sheets served as
prayer rugs, stretched over the ballroom's brightly patterned
carpet, and the worshipers had to turn slightly to the left of the
room's center to face due east.
</P>
<P>
   For many it was a bittersweet service, offering comfort but also
serving as a reminder that they may never get what they came here
for: the bodies of their relatives who perished when the
Cairo-bound plane crashed into the sea early Sunday morning. So
far, no bodies have been recovered intact, and investigators say
they do not know if any will be.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives looked worn as they removed their shoes and
entered the makeshift mosque barefoot. Most were men, who sat in
front, some in suits and ties, some in jeans and leather jackets, a
few in white flowing robes and skullcaps. About a dozen women, all
wearing head scarves, sat on sheets in the back. Headsets were
passed around for simultaneous translation, but when some failed,
the service went on in English and Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   The imam who led the service, Nihad Awad, recited a verse from
the Koran: ``No soul knows what it will earn tomorrow, nor anyone
knows in what land they may die.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the regular Friday prayer service, the prayer for
the absent dead began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allahu akbar,'' God is great, Awad, began. The mourners stood
in straight lines facing east, and silently recited the first
chapter of the Koran. Then they said prayers for the Muslim
community, for the forgiveness of the dead and for the living and
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, some walked out of the hotel, which stands on
an island in the middle of Newport Harbor, and dropped flowers into
the white-capped waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best kind of effort they could make to comfort
us,'' said Esam Ali Soliman, 39, of Cairo, who lost his brother, an
Egyptian army colonel, in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the counselors who have catered to the families.
``They have made things easier for us, but not in the most
important respects,'' he said in Arabic, through a translator. ``We
came here to get a body, and they haven't found bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   And he spoke of his frustration at the difficulty in obtaining a
death certificate for his brother, whose remains have not been
found. On Friday, the Rhode Island attorney general, Sheldon
Whitehouse, announced his intention to petition the courts to
create a new document, a Certificate of Presumption of Death.
</P>
<P>
   To aid in the identification, the state medical examiner's
office began collecting blood samples from some of the relatives of
victims so a DNA comparison could be made with whatever remains are
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed el-Alfy, 48, a geologist from Cairo, said he gave a
blood sample on Friday in the hopes that the authorities could
identify the remains of his brother, Ahmed, 50, an engineer. But
el-Alfy said he knew it would be a long process and planned to join
some of the families that have already left Newport to return home.
``We have to go back,'' he said, ``and live our lives.''

JUDGE SAYS MICROSOFT IS A MONOPOLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first major ruling in the government's epic antitrust
lawsuit against Microsoft Corp., a federal judge found Friday that
the global software giant founded by Bill Gates is a monopoly that
repeatedly punished corporate foes and thwarted innovative products
from reaching consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing almost down the line with government prosecutors,
federal district judge Thomas Penfield Jackson laid out a ``finding
of facts'' that could push Microsoft to seek a settlement to avoid
huge fines or a government-ordered breakup along the lines of
Standard Oil or AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're enormously pleased by the court's decision,'' said Joel
Klein, the top antitrust lawyer with the US Justice Department.
``The judge found what the department charged: Microsoft is a
monopolist, and it engaged in massive anticompetitive practices.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, in a news conference from his Redmond, Wash.,
headquarters broadcast live throughout the world, insisted that
``Microsoft is a company that operates within the law. Microsoft
competes vigorously and fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling was released at 6:30 p.m., after the stock
market closed for the week, to give investors considerable time to
digest it before exchanges reopen Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The judge will follow up the findings with rulings on whether
Microsoft broke laws and, if so, how it should be punished.
</P>
<P>
   While any sanctions Microsoft faces are likely to be appealed
for years, legal experts said Jackson's determination of facts
severely undercuts Microsoft's efforts, because appeals courts
virtually never challenge a trial judge's version of what happened
in a case unless it can be proven ``clearly erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings were stark, filled with descriptions of
Microsoft threatening, berating, quashing, and punishing rivals.
``Some innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur
for the sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self
interest,'' Jackson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, it is not illegal for a company like Microsoft
to be a monopoly if it attains that position by selling popular
products, but it is illegal for a monopoly firm to use its power to
thwart rivals from competing.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, filed in May 1998, makes three general
charges: Microsoft illegally maintained its dominance of the market
for computer operating systems; it tried to monopolize the market
for Internet browsers and block computer makers from installing
Netscape Communications Corp.'s competing product, known as
Navigator; and it signed other exclusive deals with computer makers
to choke out software competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a 207-page ruling, the judge recounted numerous run-ins
between Microsoft and rivals such as Apple, IBM, Intel, Netscape,
and Sun Microsystems. ``These interactions demonstrate that it is
Microsoft's corporate practice to pressure other firms to halt
software development that either shows the potential to weaken''
barriers to companies competing with Microsoft ``or competes
directly with Microsoft's most cherished software products.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the ruling, Jackson wrote, ``Microsoft has
demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and
immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing
initiatives that could intensify competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the daunting picture the judge paints of Microsoft's
conduct, many observers suggested the company should escalate
efforts to settle the case before it goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft president Bob Herbold said, ``As we've stated right
from the beginning, there's nothing that we would like more than to
settle this case and get on with things.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, speaking for a
group of 19 states that joined the Justice Department in the suit,
said, ``We do not rule out any of the remedies that may be
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein added that ``we have always said we are prepared to
discuss settlement, so long as the important competition issues are
fully addressed.'' Several earlier settlement efforts have failed.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson is still weeks away from ruling on whether
Microsoft broke the law _ and if so, probably months away from
ruling on what punishment it should face _ Klein and Attorney
General Janet Reno portrayed Friday's ruling as a victory in its
own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Reno said, with
Klein adding that the judge's finding ``shows once again in America
that no person _ and no company _ is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing reaction such as that, Thane D. Scott, a top antitrust
lawyer with the Boston firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge, said, ``This makes it
way more difficult to settle (Saturday than it was Friday. This is
a very severe ruling, and the Justice Department has got to be
emboldened by this. A slap on the wrist is not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is the most noteworthy about it is that it
reject virtually every factual position advanced by Microsoft,''
Scott said. ``The judge puts them through the wringer, pulls them
back, and puts them through the wringer again.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, have seemingly shrugged at the prospect
Microsoft could face huge fines or a breakup at the hands of the
government. Microsoft's share price has risen 72 percent in the
last 12 months and more than doubled since the day the federal suit
was filed, boosting Gates' wealth to some $85 billion. At current
stock prices the company is worth $472 billion, making it the most
highly valued public corporation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares began to drop by more than 2 1/2 in the first
60 minutes of after-hours trading following the issuance of
Jackson's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson rules that the company violated antitrust laws, it
could face penalties ranging from large fines to an order it
license its Windows operating system to competitors all the way up
to a breakup of the company into multiple units. Jackson's findings
could also serve as a blueprint for dozens of companies that want
to file their own private civil antitrust cases against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Windows, now estimated to power more than 90 percent of the
world's personal computers, provides more than 40 percent of
Microsoft's $19 billion in yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Without directly commenting on whether the company agrees with
Jackson's findings, Gates said what they describe are chiefly
efforts by the company to make its products ``more useful to
consumers'' by adding features such as Internet-browsing
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The central question of the case, Gates said, is: ``Can a
successful American company continue to improve its products for
the benefit of the consumer?'' He insisted that ``the popularity of
our products is completely driven by the benefits these products
bring to people,'' not efforts by Microsoft to force computer
makers to install only Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respectfully disagree with a number of the court's findings
and believe the American legal system . . . will affirm that
Microsoft's actions and innovations were fair and legal and have
brought tremendous benefits to millions of consumers,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   But in evaluating 76 days of testimony, including thousands of
pages of internal Microsoft electronic mail subpoenaed by
prosecutors, Judge Jackson, who was named to the federal bench in
1982 by President Ronald Reagan, concluded that Microsoft
repeatedly engaged in anticompetitive practices. He cited examples
such as Gates directly pressuring Intel not to make competing
software and company officials threatening IBM with higher software
prices if it did not stop installing Netscape's Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Former Netscape chief executive officer James Barksdale, whose
company was portrayed as one of Microsoft's leading victims, said
of Jackson's strong language: ``I would think it would make
Microsoft feel compelled to find some settlement before a remedy
comes from this judge, because he seems determined to stop this
kind of behavior.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Ann Ronga's heart began to pound as she rubbed
the boxes on The Daily News ``Scratch 'N' Match'' game Friday. One,
two, then three boxes matched, indicating that the Staten Island
housewife had won $100,000. ``I sat there looking at it for 25
minutes,'' she recalled. ``I couldn't believe my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Lasoff, a secretary at Local 1199 of the Health and
Hospital Workers Union in Manhattan, also scratched off the game
boxes and discovered she had won $100,000. Visions of that mink
coat danced in her brain. ``I had people in the office look at it
to make sure I wasn't hallucinating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Winegrad, a retired telephone worker, scratched off the
boxes at home in Brooklyn. He stared at them, flabbergasted, and
recalled: ``I said to my wife, maybe I'm not looking at this right.
You read the numbers. It was incredible. We had won $100,000! She
began talking about getting the downstairs finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other dreamers Friday, Mrs. Ronga, Ms. Lasoff
and Winegrad called the game's hot line to validate their winnings
_ but found the number busy. That was the first sign that something
was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, word began to get around: The Daily News had printed
the wrong numbers. Sorry. A production error. Instead of champagne
and shiny new cars and trips to Hawaii, it was to be pork and beans
again for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   While the Daily News, citing the fine print in the game rules,
said it would not honor what a spokeswoman called ``false
winners,'' it said it would award the day's regular sum of $192,500
in prizes _ sums ranging from $25 to $100,000 _ by holding a
drawing next month among all who claim to hold winning game cards.
</P>
<P>
   But as fantasies of fortunes big and small evaporated for
unlucky winners Friday, frustration and anger flooded into the
Scratch 'N' Match hot line and the Daily News' telephone system,
which were swamped with 15,000 calls _ triple the normal volume _
and even into the lobby of the Daily News building on West 33rd
Street, where haggard employees explained the gaffe to disbelieving
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing into the lobby, elated winners turned into crushed and
sometimes furious losers, there were moans and groans, an elderly
security guard was punched and suffered a black eye, irate
game-players threatened lawsuits and mayhem, the police were
called, and television film crews caught the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a lawsuit to me,'' said Mark Hall, whose friend,
Evelyn Parrilla, held a card she had thought was worth $375,075.
``Someone needs to be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The volume of calls to the Daily News switchboard was so heavy
that its 144 lines were overwhelmed for most of the day. Calls to
the news, business and other departments usually drew busy signals,
and some reporters said they could not even reach their editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been hilarious,'' one Daily News reporter said.
``It's been basically an episode out of a sitcom. It was a joke for
all of us, but all the reporters were saying don't walk out there
and smile or provoke a reaction. Everybody felt terrible for these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a joke for the Daily News. ``We had over 15,000
calls between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m., and it's slowly letting up
now,'' Frank Schilero, the Daily News' vice president for
technology,'' said late in the afternoon. ``Bell Atlantic has been
in communications with us all day. The amount of incoming calls was
affecting other customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilero said that Bell Atlantic officials decided to impose a
limit on the number of calls to the game hot line and to the Daily
News because they feared that the overload would overwhelm a
central switching office that serves the area from midtown to Wall
Street.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Adrienne Rhodes, vice president and director of communications
for the Daily News, said that the Scratch 'N' Match game, which is
a popular feature as well as a circulation-booster, has been
published by the Daily News at intervals in the last five years,
during which time the Daily News has given away $2.5 million a year
in prizes.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: Each Sunday, the Daily News publishes eight
scratch-off cards, two for use on Sunday, and one each for Monday
through Saturday. Each card has 15 numbered boxes printed in three
rows, and underneath the boxes are amounts of potential prizes:
$25, $100, $250, $1,000, $2,500, $5,000 and $100,000. The numbers
of 10 boxes to be scratched off are printed in each day's issue of
The News, and three matching prizes create a winner in that
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The game is structured so that there is only one $100,000 winner
a day. The daily prize pool also includes one winner each of $5,000
and $2,500, and 1,360 smaller prizes of $1,000 to $25, according to
Marie DeParis, senior vice president of marketing for the Daily
News, who oversees the contest.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, because of what Ms. DeParis called a production
error, the numbers of the 10 boxes to be scratched off were wrong
in some editions. Instead of box numbers for Nov. 5, the box
numbers for Oct. 29 _ the previous Friday _ were printed, leaving
readers playing the day's card with week-old numbers. Editions that
contained the wrong numbers clearly designated them as to Oct. 29
game cards, Ms. DeParis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParis did not explain the production error, but an editor,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a computer crash in the
advertising department had led to the mistake. There was no way to
estimate how many false prizes were generated by the mischief, but
it was clear that many, and not the usual one, had hit the $100,000
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News, Ms. DeParis said, would award the usual prizes
to the holders of all game cards that were legitimate winners
Friday. In addition, she said, there will be a second pool of
prizes for the day, to be awarded next month in a random drawing
among those who had claims based on Friday's incorrect winning
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Those claiming prizes based on the incorrect numbers were told
to send their game cards, along with their names, addresses, Social
Security numbers and telephone numbers, by Dec. 3, to The Daily
News Special Prize Drawing, P.O. Box 4691, Blair, Neb. 68009-4691.
</P>
<P>
   For those contemplating lawsuits, there appeared to be little
hope, legal experts said. ``I don't know what recourse I have,''
said Weingrad. ``But I'm going to consult a lawyer. It's money I
don't have, so I'm never going to miss it. But you know, it's like
somebody sticking a pin in your balloon.''

GATES EMPHASIZES MICROSOFT'S BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The nation's richest man, minutes after being
chided as an example that no one is above consumer protection laws,
declared his company is guided by the ``most basic American values:
innovation, integrity, serving customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates sought to portray his
company as a friend to consumers after US District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, in a devastating ruling Friday, said
something far different: that the company used monopoly powers to
harm computer-users.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft ``brings incredible benefits to millions of
consumers,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the software industry creates ``great value for
consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Gates, during a brief television appearance from a
studio at his corporate headquarters near Seattle, he had spent the
weekend thinking about ``how we can make the Internet even better;
how we can make our user interfaces more approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Microsoft's harm or benefit to consumers was the key
public relations battleground as the company and the Justice
Department sought to put the best face on Jackson's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, said the
ruling would benefit computer and software users in future years,
influencing the variety of products available and their price.
Microsoft's ``anticompetitive practices harmed consumers and
limited consumers' choice,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stood as an example, Klein said, ``that in America,
no person and no company is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling is the first of several he will make in the
case. He has not said what restrictions or restructuring, if any,
will be imposed on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Klein spoke in Washington, Gates responded from
Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash.: ``Certainly, Microsoft is
a company that operates within the law, and operates in a way that
is great for the people we develop software for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates during his appearance was smiling and forceful, in
contrast to the hunched and dour businessman that the nation saw in
a videotaped deposition during the antitrust trial. He said he was
open to settling the case _ as long as Microsoft did not have to
trade away the principle that it had the right to make product
innovations on behalf of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The government had argued during the trial that some of those
innovations were actually meant to undermine Microsoft's rivals and
to protect the giant company's commanding presence in the software
market.
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said during the TV
appearance that the company continues to be confident in its legal
position. ``We believe that at the end of the judicial process . .
. we will have shown that Microsoft's creation and its broad
distribution of an enormous amount of very innovative software
provides great benefit to consumers around the world.''

BLAZERS BATHED IN HOOPLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They're called the most talented team in the
league. The one that spent all that money. The one favored to win
the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Only this year the hype has not gone to your annual postseason
failures who used to hang out in the Forum but up the Great
Northwest way.
</P>
<P>
   This year it was the Portland Trail Blazers who were everyone's
exhibition-season darlings. They shipped out perennial bad boy J.R.
Rider for Steve Smith, added Detlef Schrempf, and then capped it
off _ much to Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson's chagrin _ by
adding Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best team money can buy in the NBA,'' Jackson
said. ``Whatever they've done to manufacture that roster, my
congratulations goes out to them, whether it was the owner who was
willing to spend that kind of money or the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know there's a limitation, a window there, and they've
taken full advantage of it. I think they had great moves in the
offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are talented, large and extremely deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they've restocked their team and with their obvious
depth, they're probably the most talented team in the league right
now,'' Lakers forward Rick Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight is another early showdown for the still-developing
Lakers at the Rose Garden. They started their season with an
impressive opening-night victory at Utah, then were businesslike in
winning their home opener against Vancouver before 19,000 cardboard
figures borrowed from MGM to masquerade as fans at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the high expectations surrounding the Blazers,
tonight offers the Lakers another early indication of how good they
are, or might become, and what to expect in the Western Conference
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can beat them even though they're the best team in
the West,'' Jackson said. ``To do that, we're going to have to be a
very clever, intelligent basketball club, which I don't know if
we're capable of doing for 48 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Depite the praise, Jackson said he's uncertain if the Blazers
are truly improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they'll be better or not,'' he said. ``They're
going to miss the 3-point shooting of (Walt) Williams. They got
(Stacey) Augmon back in some mysterious way, however that works.
They lost J.R. Rider. They lost some youth and speed. Of course,
Pippen's speed and quickness makes up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Augmon went to Houston in the Pippen deal, was released and then
went back to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   They may ooze talent, but the same thing was said about the
Lakers the past two years. Talent doesn't always equate to success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely,'' Fox said. ``I can speak from experience.
We've been the most talented team for two years in a row and got
beat by the most mature team. We like to think that equation would
fall true to form again for them, but I think they have enough
experience.''

IBF'S LEE HAS FACED PROBLEMS BEFORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert W. Lee Sr. created the International Boxing Federation in
1983, pledging that it would objectively rank the world's top
fighters, legitimize championship titles and generally help clean
up a sport long sullied by suspicion and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, however, the IBF appears to have done more
to reinforce boxing's negative image than to counter it.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and three other members of his sanctioning organization were
indicted Thursday. They were accused of accepting bribes from
promoters and managers over a 13-year period in exchange for
favorable rankings that led to lucrative bouts.
</P>
<P>
   After a bail hearing, Lee, the president of the IBF called the
charges outrageous and proclaimed his innocence. But federal
prosecutors, in a 32-count indictment handed up by a federal grand
jury in Newark, N.J., accused Lee and his three colleagues of a
pattern of corruption that, if proved at trial, could spell the end
of the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that Lee, who has a background in law
enforcement, has faced charges of wrongdoing in his 20-year career
in boxing. But it is the first time he has faced criminal charges
stemming from his involvement with the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Lee was a homicide investigator for the
Union County prosecutor's office and later worked as the chief
investigator for the New Jersey State Division of Consumer Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he was appointed deputy commissioner of the New Jersey
State Athletic Commission. It was during his tenure with the
commission that Lee became ensnarled in an FBI investigation into
boxing corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 he was caught on audiotape accepting a bribe from an
undercover FBI agent, who was posing as a boxing promoter with a
criminal background who was having trouble getting a promoter's
license in New Jersey. The FBI turned its evidence over to the
state attorney general, but nothing came of the matter and Lee
denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, in 1983, the New Jersey state Commission of
Investigations found that Lee had a conflict of interest, because
he was simultaneously president of the IBF and a deputy state
commissioner overseeing boxing in New Jersey. He was suspended as
deputy commissioner, and while he was on suspension his job was
abolished. That was when he became the full-time president of the
IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's indictment might provide impetus for the passage of a bill
now before Congress that would clean up business practices in the
boxing industry. The bill, called the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform
Act, comes up for a vote in the House of Representatives next week.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF is one of the major opponents of the bill, which among
other things seeks to have all financial dealings among promoters,
managers and sanctioning organizations specifically outlined in
contracts. The bill would also require sanctioning organizations to
develop written criteria for ranking boxers.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview at his office in April, Lee said he was
aware of the FBI investigation and denied he had done anything
wrong. He said he believed the federal investigation of him and the
promoter Don King was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   King's offices in Deerfield Beach, Fla., were raided by the FBI
in June. King was not indicted by the grand jury Thursday, nor were
any of the seven promoters and managers and 23 boxers who federal
prosecutors said were involved in the kickback scheme with the IBF.
The investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The world titles that boxing organizations offer have an
intrinsic value to boxers and boxing fans. But they have great
economic value to promoters and managers, who have to make matches
and sell them to television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said in April that he had never manipulated ratings. ``Our
ratings committee decides who should be rated based on their
activity, their record and how they've looked against certain
opponents and whatever information is pumped into the ratings
committee,'' he said. ``When we determine who the No. 1 contender
is, the champion must fight him once every nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to prevent is champions and their managers,
and more specifically, the television industry, from cherry-picking
around a guy who doesn't have the marquee value, but has earned the
right to fight for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the IBF settled a lawsuit by Michael Moorer, a
heavyweight who contended the organization had broken its own rules
in moving Axel Schulz ahead of him for a championship bout against
George Foreman. Moorer's lawsuit triggered the FBI investigation
into Lee and the IBF.

ROBOT FINDS FLIGHT 990 BLACK BOXES, WILL TRY TO RECOVER SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ A high-tech robot Friday attempted
unsuccessfully to recover two orange-colored boxes that could
explain why EgyptAir Flight 990 took a wild roller-coaster ride
above the Atlantic last Sunday before diving into the ocean,
killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery operations for the Boeing jet's cockpit voice and
flight data recorders were suspended about 7 p.m. EST because of
weather, said a spokesman for the National Transpiration Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   USS Grapple, the Navy's mother ship for the robotic submersible
Deep Drone, remained at the crash site overnight. But it was not
certain if conditions would allow the drone to resume its difficult
work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the strength of electronic pinging signals from each
box, the drone passed over them during the day-long search but was
unable to see them, said Navy Capt. Bert Marsh, who is supervising
the salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to dig for them,'' he said at a late-afternoon
briefing for the hundreds of print, radio and broadcast media who
have been here throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Without data from the boxes, safety board investigators have had
to rely on preliminary analysis by the Air Force of radar tapes to
tell them the final path of Flight 990. That analysis has been
questioned by unnamed experts in some media reports, most notably
CNN. The television network quoted an unnamed government official
as saying the Boeing 767 could not possibly have done what the
radar analysis indicates, and thus the analysis must be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Friday the board's top radar expert and the Air Force
have gone over the data again and stand behind their preliminary
findings: the Boeing jet, flying at 33,000 feet, entered a steep
and perhaps supersonic dive to 16,000 feet, where it then climbed
back to 24,000 feet before diving again. The plane broke apart
about 10,000 feet above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron, based at Hill
Air Force Base north of Salt Lake City, has provided assistance to
the NTSB in previous high-profile incidents, including the crashes
of golfer Payne Stewart's plane, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane, and
TWA flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said safety board investigators did computer
simulations that showed the Boeing 767-300 is capable of flying the
roller-coaster path indicated by the radar analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But with so little information about what happened to Flight 990
_ a situation that has fueled the speculation about the cause of
the crash in media reports _ investigators have expressed growing
frustration with the delays in getting the data- and
voice-recording boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said his investigators want to get the two so-called
``black boxes'' to labs in Washington, D.C., as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The plan Friday was to have a helicopter fly the boxes, stored
in water-filled ice chests to protect them, from the Grapple to an
FAA airplane waiting at Quonset Point. From there, it would be a
short flight to Washington, D.C., and the labs of the NTSB, where
the boxes will be carefully opened and technicians can begin
analyzing the data.
</P>
<P>
   But getting those boxes now depends on the cooperation of Mother
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has said it needs seas of less than 9 feet to safely
conduct its recovery operation with Deep Drone. Until Friday, high
winds had churned up seas of more than 20 feet at the crash site
for two days, but the Grapple and two other ships set sail from
Newport through the heavy seas Thursday afternoon after the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted calmer
weather for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Grapple was on the scene before daylight and dropped Deep Drone
into the water about 9 a.m. Within an hour, the robot had zeroed in
on electronic signals that are being emitted from each of the two
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   These so-called black boxes, which are actually painted high
visibility orange and are located in a plane's tail, may be hidden
in mud, silt or under wreckage of the Boeing 767, which is in
thousands of pieces in water about 250 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said the boxes are about 15 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   The robot, called a Remote Operating Vehicle, is about the size
of a mini-van. It is equipped with sonar, still and television
cameras, and small gripping tools that can be used to move
wreckage, dig in the mud and, investigators hope, retrieve the
recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The drone has lights, but in the deep black waters the
television can only see objects a few feet away. There are many
small bits of wreckage. The biggest seen by the drone was one of
the plane's wheels, Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   If the boxes are stuck in debris too heavy for the robot to
lift, Deep Drone can place rigging on the wreckage. It would then
be lifted to the surface with one of two cranes on Grapple, the
Navy's rescue and salvage ship that played a key role in retrieving
up wreckage from the TWA Flight 800 and SwissAir Flight 111 air
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are not the only ones who want to know what clues
the boxes will provide in helping them solve the mystery of Flight
990. Hall, who has held daily briefings with family members of the
victims, said they need to know what happened to their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've explained to them how essential the information on these
recorders is,'' Hall said.

GATES, IN RESPONSE, YIELDS NO GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Smiling stiffly, conceding no predatory
behavior whatsoever and insisting that Microsoft's actions had in
fact ``brought tremendous benefits to millions of consumers,'' Bill
Gates defiantly took issue Friday evening with a federal judge's
finding that the company had engaged in monopolistic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   With the company he co-founded in 1975 under siege from the
government, Gates appeared at a news conference at Microsoft
headquarters here barely an hour after Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson issued his finding.
</P>
<P>
   While repeating assertions that Microsoft has always ``wanted
nothing more than to resolve this case,'' Gates yielded no apparent
ground on which a settlement might be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft competes vigorously and fairly,'' Gates said.
``Americans should wish that every business was as competitive as
the personal computer business.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no attempt by any company officials to put a good face
on the judge's findings, which Justice Department officials in
Washington were hailing as a smashing victory for their side and
for consumers across the country and even around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the word throughout the company was that this was
simply a step in a process that is far from being resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to pick a winner, I think, is a dangerous business in
any lawsuit, just like it is in a nine-inning ballgame or a
12-round championship fight,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's
general counsel and the architect of the company's legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with even glancing knowledge of what the judge found
would have the sense, here on the Microsoft campus, that Gates and
other officials were looking at the same situation and seeing it in
almost diametrically opposite terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of our products is completely driven by the
benefits that those products bring,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's response to the findings was part of the prolonged
and sometimes controversial public-relations offensive that the
company has been conducting since the Justice Department started
pursuing an antitrust action.
</P>
<P>
   The company has repeatedly defended its actions and did so again
Friday. While government lawyers have portrayed the software maker
as a rapacious monopolist, charging among other things that
Microsoft has bundled its Internet browser to the Windows operating
system as part of a predatory pricing scheme, the company said it
was simply trying to make its products as user-friendly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a central principle in this lawsuit, and we have stood
up for our ability to integrate new functionality, new capability
into our products,'' Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, said Friday.
``We care deeply about our ability to improve our products.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has moved aggressively in advertising and lobbying
blitzes, and even on its Web site, to rebut the government's case.
The home page of the Web site has a description of its ``Freedom to
Innovate Network,'' described as a ``nonpartisan, grass-roots
network of citizens and business who have a stake in the success of
Microsoft and the high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft has been lobbying Congress to enact laws
that could protect the company in some of the very areas in which
it is being sued. In its annual report issued in September, sent to
2 million shareholders, the company's chief operating officer,
Robert Herbold, urged shareholders to join the lobbying effort. The
Web page also urges visitors to contact their congressional
representative.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said recently that more than 100,000 people
have used the Web page to send messages to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's findings amount to another step in what is expected to
be a protracted fight that could wind up before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   For Gates, the battle has taken no small personal toll, as he
has watched his reputation as an innovator and business icon become
sullied by charges that he is a bully and corporate predator, bent
on destroying his competition.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Gates has been fairly restrained, parsing out all the
ways in which he believes the government's case is legally
unwarranted and, in fact, most of the message he has tried to
project was an optimistic one. At a hearing in June before the
Congressional Joint Economic Committee in Washington, he waxed
enthusiastic about the company's role in wireless networks and
electronic commerce, which he said would turn ``consumers into big
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the country's antitrust statutes, he said at the
hearing that ``the laws as they are currently written are fine,''
but he passed up the opportunity to blast the government, only
stating his belief that ``things like integration of new features
are one of the freedoms companies have'' under those laws.
</P>
<P>
   And he has stepped up other activities that have put him in a
favorable public light, including huge philanthropic donations for
scholarships, libraries and international medical assistance and
even an appearance late last year on the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show,''
in which he discussed the intricacies of his then 2 1/2 year-old
daughter's experience with potty training.
</P>
<P>
   In private, friends said, Gates is deeply angry about the
government's antitrust action and has portrayed himself as the
victim of a vendetta by disgruntled competitors who could not keep
up with him and his company.

   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ Searching through water so deep
and murky that no sunlight reaches the sea floor, operators of Deep
Drone, a remote-controlled submarine tethered to a Navy salvage
ship, closed in on Friday on two pinging sounds that they hope will
lead them to the two flight recorders from EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds, made by devices called pingers, are located in
roughly 250 to 270 feet of water, among small pieces of the
aircraft's wreckage, and may be covered by the sea floor's fine
silt. Investigators said the pingers appear to be tantalizingly
close together _ as near as 15 feet apart _ and that their signals
were remarkably strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer I got back from the guys on board, the level of
sound from the pingers was so loud they had to take their earphones
off,'' said Capt. Bert Marsh, supervisor of salvage for the U.S.
Navy, speaking at a briefing here. ``So we know they are there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, because the Deep Drone's cameras could not see the
pingers, officials said they could not be certain that they are
still attached to the Boeing 767's flight recorders. The devices,
known as black boxes even through they are bright orange, contain
crucial data that could help the National Transportation Safety
Board determine why the aircraft fell from the sky early on Sunday
morning while en route to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, Marsh and James E. Hall, chairman of the NTSB, said
the crew of the USS Grapple, a Navy salvage ship, would work as
long as the weather would allow them to operate the Deep Drone
safely. A storm, the second this week, was expected for Saturday,
and investigators hoped to have the black boxes on the Grapple's
deck before the sea state deteriorates again.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours, investigators suffered another disappointment,
saying they had postponed the search once more because of building
seas.
</P>
<P>
   Once the flight recorders are retrieved, they will be flown by
helicopter from the ship's deck to the landing strip at Quonset
Point Air National Guard Station in Rhode Island, loaded onto a
waiting airplane and taken to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recorders will then be taken into labs,'' said Gregory
Phillips, the investigator in charge of the recovery effort. ``We
have two separate labs, and they will be operating
simultaneously.'' One will listen to tape from the Cockpit Voice
Recorder tape, and the other will analyze the Flight Data Recorder,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials said they did not know how long it might take to
extract preliminary data from the recorders. Their condition,
precisely how much information they were designed to record, and
whether they functioned until impact, was not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   The pingers' strong signals were emanating from a debris field
where the current was a half-knot to one-knot, allowing the
civilian contractors aboard the vessel who are operating the Deep
Drone to manipulate the submarine with relative ease. The water at
the sea floor was pitch black, however, even though the day was
cloudless and bright.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said visibility around the drone, which lights its own
way, was limited to 3 to 6 feet as it maneuvered through a debris
field. Hall said the submarine had not located any large pieces of
the airplane _ the largest identifiable piece of debris was a tire
_ and that the operators were not yet looking for any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have focused on is the recorders
themselves,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also showed a reluctance to deploy any divers to
the crash site, which is more than twice as deep as the scene of
the 1996 crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800. Marsh said the
Navy planned to use the submarine alone to recover the boxes, even
for such tasks as attaching a cable to them to winch them aboard.
Divers would remain on deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than likely it will be a Deep Drone recovery,'' he said,
and if the weather cooperates, the investigation's most important
evidence to date could be brought aboard quickly.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presiding judge in the government's antitrust
trial against Microsoft Corp. issued a broad denunciation of the
software giant Friday evening as the first part of his verdict in
the landmark case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court said that
Microsoft had used its monopoly power to stifle innovation, reduce
competition and hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions
have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in
the computer industry,'' Jackson wrote in his 207-page findings of
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through its conduct,'' he added, ``Microsoft has demonstrated
that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to
harm any firm'' that gets in its way.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact are not a final statement of
liability or innocence. But they show that he has accepted almost
every element of the government's case against Microsoft and has
rejected as ``specious'' virtually all the arguments Microsoft put
up in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are the judge's conclusions about who presented the
most compelling and believable case during the year-long trial that
opened in his courtroom on Oct. 19, 1998. As such, they serve as a
clear, almost certain, indication of how he will rule in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government both reacted quickly after
receiving the much-anticipated findings Friday evening. The judge,
who in years past wrote his decisions longhand, transmitted the
document to both sides by e-mail Friday afternoon. It was made
public at 6:30 p.m., after the stock markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department was jubilant. ``This is a great day for
American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``This case
is about the protection of innovation, competition and the
consumers' right to choose the products they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, quickly issued a terse statement
indicating that the company was already formulating its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we disagree with many of the findings,'' the statement
said, ``we are still confident that the law supports us on these
points and that the American legal system will ultimately rule that
Microsoft's actions were fair, legal and good for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's leaders are almost certain to appeal, should
Jackson eventually rule against them, the judge's findings of fact
are likely to stand, because they are virtually impervious to
appeal. Under federal court rules, appeals courts must give great
weight to the conclusions the trial judge draws from hearing the
testimony and studying the witnesses as they offer their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, appeals courts are allowed to challenge findings of
fact only if they are ``clearly erroneous.'' And if the judge's
verdict is largely based on the questions of witness credibility he
raised in his findings, the verdict stands a better chance of
withstanding appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of his findings, Jackson declared that Microsoft
``enjoys monopoly power in the relevant market'' _ a threshold
assertion that potentially makes other actions illegal. He noted
that Microsoft can charge whatever it wants for its Windows
operating system without fear that price increases would reduce
demand, a key test for monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft expended considerable energy in court arguing that it
was not a monopoly, asserting that a host of small competitors _
from the Be operating system to Palm Pilot personal organizers _
were long-term threats. But Jackson dismissed every one of those
arguments, saying that competition from these competitors was at
least a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day has not arrived, nor does it seem imminent,'' he
wrote in once case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's monopoly power,'' he concluded, ``is also
evidenced by the fact that, over the course of several years,
Microsoft took actions that only could have been advantageous if
they operated to reinforce monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Jackson ran through each of the charges raised by
the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general that
joined the federal government in the suit. In each case, he
endorsed the government's charge while rejecting Microsoft's
rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   He found that Microsoft attempted to divide the market for
Internet browsing software with Netscape Communications Corp. in
1995 _ a key charge in the government's case and a clearly illegal
activity under antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that other companies had similar encounters with
Microsoft, and ``these interactions demonstrate that it is
Microsoft's corporate practice to pressure other firms to halt
software development'' that threatens Microsoft's dominance ``or
competes directly with Microsoft's most cherished software
products.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jackson found that Microsoft's decision to bundle its Web
browser with Windows and give it away was not, as Microsoft
asserted in court, simply an effort to add a desirable feature to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior executives at Microsoft decided Microsoft needed to
give its browser away in furtherance of the larger strategic goal
of gaining market share,'' he wrote. Microsoft, he added, ``viewed
browser market share as the key to preserving its dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   And in one of his most damning findings, Jackson concluded that
``Web browsers and operating systems are separate products.''
Microsoft's key argument was that its browser was simply a feature
of Windows, not a separate product.
</P>
<P>
   He turned that argument around on Microsoft by finding that the
company had actually harmed consumers by bundling the two products.
Consumer harm is a key test in antitrust cases. Bundling the
browser with Windows ``unjustifiably jeopardized the stability and
security of the operating system,'' he wrote, adding, ``There is no
technical justification for Microsoft's refusal to meet consumer
demand for a browserless version of Windows 98.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that Microsoft had threatened and bullied Apple
Computer, Intel, America Online and other companies that Microsoft
perceived as competitors. In the case of IBM, he wrote, ``when IBM
refused to abate the promotion of those of its own products that
competed with Windows and Office,'' Microsoft's suite of business
productivity software, ``Microsoft punished the IBM PC Company with
higher prices, a late license for Windows 95 and the withholding of
technical and marketing support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and
businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft,'' the
judge concluded. ``The ultimate result is that some innovations
that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason
that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust lawyers say they cannot recall another instance in
which findings of fact in an antitrust case have been issued ahead
of the actual verdict. ``I've been at this for 40 years, and I've
never heard of anything like this,'' said Stephen Axinn, an
antitrust litigator at Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the findings are packaged with the conclusions of law _
the legal precedents justifying a ruling _ and the verdict. But
Jackson's decision to separate the findings offers at last two
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potentially a very clever thing to do,'' said Robert
Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's
antitrust division, now with the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it will allow Jackson to modify his final ruling
if written responses from the litigants in the weeks ahead suggest
to him that he might be standing on weak ground.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing the findings ahead of the verdict also ``prompts the
parties to try to settle,'' said Andrew Gavil, a professor of law
at Howard University. ``This is a lot brighter than tea leaves. It
tells the parties exactly where they stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has repeatedly urged Microsoft and the government to
settle the case. While the two sides have held fitful discussions
during the course of the trial, they remain far apart. Most lawyers
and analysts watching the case are not optimistic that they will
settle, even with Friday's strong findings in favor of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Litan said there's not much incentive for either side to settle.
He said the government feels it is in a position of strength, and
Microsoft will likely wait for the appeals court, or for another
presidential administration in just over a year. A new president
will appoint a new head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division, and Microsoft can hope that whoever that is will be
inclined to settle on more generous terms.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Burt, a Microsoft lawyer, agreed with that analysis but
added that Microsoft's leaders stand willing to discuss a
settlement. Nevertheless, he said, they remain unified in their
conviction that they will not accept any settlement that would
jeopardize ``our core value, the soul of our company, and that is
the freedom to innovate and design products as we see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Microsoft official said Microsoft was more than willing
to hunker down for what could be a lengthy appeals process. The
antitrust trial ``has been a very difficult period for the
company,'' he said. ``But the investment in pain is almost
completely behind us. The cost of going forward doesn't seem that
great to me.''

`BLOOD IN WATER' AS YEARS OF LEGAL BATTLES LOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s massive defeat in its federal antitrust suit
leaves the company facing perhaps the most severe crisis in its
25-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's holding that Microsoft is a
monopoly that abused its power and harmed consumers raises the
possibility that the US Justice Department might demand the
corporate equivalent of the death penalty _ the dismantling of
Microsoft _ after the manner of Standard Oil Co.'s 1911 breakup.
Joel Klein, antitrust chief at the Justice Department, Friday would
not rule out this Draconian penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Microsoft avoids action of this magnitude, years of
tough legal battles lie ahead, with a potential to sap the firm's
ability to keep up with its competitors. And those competitors can
use Friday's ruling to make life even tougher for Microsoft.
Antitrust experts say the findings of fact can be used by dozens of
Microsoft's competitors as the basis of their own private antitrust
actions against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a disaster for Microsoft,'' said Thane Scott, head
of the antitrust practice at Boston law firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge.
``Based on these documents alone, anybody who feels he's been
harmed by Microsoft can walk into a court and get a jury trial. . .
. If you're a company like Microsoft, the last place you want to be
is in front of a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wood, of Boston law firm Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish, said the
danger of private suits based on Friday's ruling is so severe that
it practically ensures Microsoft will fight to the bitter end,
rather than settle. ``To stop now and not finish could leave
Microsoft exposed to private litigation,'' said Wood, who chairs a
committee on antitrust law for the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wood predicted that Microsoft will soldier on, taking up the
next phase of the case in an effort to recoup its loss. In the next
phase, the findings of law, Jackson will apply antitrust law to the
facts he has settled upon. Microsoft will have to argue that even
if the facts are accepted as true, they don't constitute a
violation of law.
</P>
<P>
   Scott says the government's nearly total victory on findings of
fact bodes ill for Microsoft in the next phase of the trial, and
even reduces the likelihood of a successful appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has had some success before federal appellate courts.
An attempt last year to have the company held in contempt of court
for violating an earlier consent decree was rejected by an appeals
court, which ruled that Microsoft had a right to add Internet
browsing capabilities to its operating system _ one of the key
issues in dispute in the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott says the sweeping rejection of Microsoft's view of the
case will bear weight with the appeals court. ``They have an uphill
battle on appeal,'' he said. ``The facts have been decided against
them rather severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems unlikely Microsoft can now simply settle the
case, not only because of the threat of private lawsuits but
because the government is now in a position to make very tough
demands. Besides, 19 state attorneys general are involved in the
suit, as well as the federal government. Microsoft would have to
satisfy them all. ``It's difficult to settle a case when there's
blood in the water,'' said Scott, ``and this result does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ferguson, who sold Vermeer Technologies in Cambridge,
Mass. to Microsoft in 1997, is a harsh critic of the company. ``I
think they're going to fight to the death,'' Ferguson said. ``It's
their whole culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jackson's ruling could have an impact on other cases
already pending against Microsoft. The firm is still fighting
against rival Sun Microsystems Inc. in federal court. At issue is
whether Microsoft violated Sun's copyright to the Java computing
system, which allows programmers to write programs that can run on
many different types of computers. An appeals court in August
overturned an injunction against Microsoft, but Sun is seeking to
have that injunction reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   If this weren't enough for Microsoft, the company faces another
antitrust shootout in a case that has attracted far less attention
but could be equally devastating to Microsoft's future.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera Systems Inc., an Orem, Utah, maker of Linux software,
filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1996. The case
involves DR-DOS, an operating system once sold by Novell Inc. as an
alternative to an early Microsoft product, MS-DOS. Caldera chief
executive Ray Noorda formerly ran Novell, and he bought DR-DOS from
Novell in order to pursue a court case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Noorda believes that during the early 1990s, Microsoft used its
market power to stamp out DR-DOS and keep it from gaining a
foothold in the operating systems market. If Caldera wins, it could
obtain damages running into the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal judge in Salt Lake City threw out an
effort by Microsoft to have key charges in the case dismissed. The
judge ruled that the Caldera-Microsoft case will go to trial in
January. Unlike the Justice Department case, the Caldera matter
will be decided by a jury chosen from Caldera's back yard _ a
daunting prospect for Microsoft.

BUCHANAN, LOOKING FOR VOTES, VISITS `THE SO-CALLED EXHIBIT'
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan used the
controversy over the ``Sensation'' exhibit to rally his troops
Friday at a Manhattan restaurant, saying that he had gone to the
Brooklyn Museum to see ``the so-called exhibit'' and that he was
not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is dispirited, degrading, disgusting, sacrilegious,
blasphemous and an insult to the mother of God,'' said Buchanan,
wearing a Yankee baseball cap and watching the dozens who had come
out for his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am astonished that the people of New York are being required
to pay for an exhibit by some decadent British artists whose
objective is clearly to insult, wound and to offend,'' he said.
``This is one area where I find myself in agreement with the mayor
of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   This observation aside, Buchanan did not seem to think that
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had followed up with tough enough action
against the museum. Yes, the mayor had sued to have it evicted from
its city-owned building, and lost. Yes, he had pledged to continue
gathering evidence against the museum and had called U.S. District
Judge Nina Gershon's ruling against the city a ``knee-jerk
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   But counseling one person in his cadre of supporters, Buchanan
said: ``You tell Mr. Giuliani, `Look, Rudy, you've got to go all
the way through with this.' `` He explained moments later what
could be done if he was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get control of that National Endowment for the Arts,
you'll see how it ought to be done,'' he said. ``You shut it down,
fumigate the building and put the IRS in there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Buchanan, the museum had become one more foil to needle
other challengers in the 2000 presidential race, while he spoke to
the mostly older and male crowd at the Turtle Bay Grill &AMP; Lounge on
Second Avenue, near 52nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform Party's presidential
nomination, poked fun at Vice President Al Gore's comment that he
was the father of the Internet and his need for a feminist campaign
consultant. The vice president is someone who doesn't know who he
is, Buchanan said to hoots from the crowd, ``an alpha man, a beta
man, or whatever Naomi Wolf tells him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan singled out Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for particular
ridicule, citing his failure to identify the leaders of four
countries when a reporter in Boston administered a pop quiz on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give Mr. Bush a new map, geography lessons and
history lessons,'' he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later some of the same questions, Buchanan got most of
them right, telling reporters that he ``was briefed this morning.''
He began to stumble only when a reporter asked him to name the
prime minister of Armenia _ Vazgen Sarkisian _ one of several
government officials killed by gunmen who stormed the country's
Parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
   After pausing, Buchanan finally blurted out: ``He's dead, I
think that he's dead.'' Anyway, he said, the important thing was
that he knew the cause of the killings was a fight between Armenia
and its neighbor, Azerbaijan, over a territory called
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you what,'' Buchanan exclaimed. ``We will challenge Bush
to a contest of world capitals, history, the names of prime
ministers and any state you can imagine.'' A few moments, smiles
and handshakes later, he was back riding through the congested
roads of the city, which he likes to call ``the liberal capital of
the world.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CELEBRATES MICROSOFT DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add 8 grafs to end of original text, beginning:
`Blumenthal of...')   (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding
victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory
that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to
the simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General
Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had
agreed with the government. ``This case is about the protection of
innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the
products they want,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the
antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for
the government on virtually every important point.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors
during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always
interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial. I think
this case was about the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead
lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most
highly regarded litigators in the country. At first, Boies shied
away from the microphone. ``I had my shot in the courtroom,'' Boies
said, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general for Connecticut who
worked closely with the Justice Department, encouraged Boies to say
something. ``You're the man,'' Blumenthal said. ``Go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less
to do with strategy and more to do with facts. ``In some senses,
this is not a surprise,'' he said. ``In a lot of ways, this is
exactly what the evidence showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision,
Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is
above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft,
asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was
furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal
e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly
determined to remain a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to
D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications. ``Today, we
have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to
break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry. But Klein
deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to
another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the
nationwide telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal of Connecticut called antitrust law ``the Magna Carta
of consumer protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wager that these findings of fact will be used in law
school classes around the country to demonstrate what happens when
the antitrust laws are flagrantly violated,'' Blumenthal went on.
</P>
<P>
   Klein saw another reason to hold up the Microsoft case as an
example. Only about a year and a half elapsed from the start of the
case to Friday's decision _ lightning speed for such a complex
case, by the usual standards of the law.
</P>
<P>
   California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, said he expected
the decision to ``unleash powerful engines of innovation and
consumer benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``California is so impacted by the colossus of Microsoft, and so
many businesses were impacted and felt that their competitive
opportunities were smothered,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley is cautiously cheering,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   There was good reason for his use of ``cautiously.'' Appeals lie
ahead. Microsoft is a powerful adversary with deep pockets _ not as
deep as the government's, but deep enough to wage a long fight, if
it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft didn't get to be Microsoft by shrinking from the
battlefield.

BITTERNESS STALKS A GERMAN WAR EXHIBITION

<TEXT>
<P>
   The decision to postpone the U.S. debut of the controversial
exhibition ``The German Army and Genocide'' spotlights not just the
difficulty of using archival photographs as historical evidence but
a keen sensitivity within united Germany about questions of
national honor.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of photographs, personal letters and documents,
which was scheduled to open on Dec. 2 at Cooper Union in New York,
challenges a belief widely held in Germany and Austria that the
World War II German army was the sole decent institution under the
Third Reich. Since it opened four years ago, the show has enraged
conservative politicians and diplomats; right-wing extremists tried
to bomb it and rioters sought to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's ability to ignite such a furor stemmed from its
harrowing photographic component. Nearly a million Germans and
Austrians have visited the display, and in so doing young and old
alike have searched for and sometimes found depictions that
seemingly implicated themselves or their relatives in wartime
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, historic photos purport to show ``the way it was,'' but
as any viewer of television documentary film can attest, archival
images can be deployed to support a multitude of intentions. Thus,
once the credibility of even a fraction of the exhibition's images
was clearly shaken, the independent Hamburg Institute for Social
Research, which organized the taboo-breaking event, decided it was
best to suspend future presentations and subject all of its
materials to careful review.
</P>
<P>
   The institute announced on Thursday that it was postponing the
exhibition in New York and in several German cities after admitting
that a small proportion of the photos had been inaccurately
captioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever mistakes and errors there are have to be corrected as
quickly as they are presented,'' said the Cooper Union historian
Atina Grossmann, who added that a consortium of academics from
Cooper, Columbia, Princeton, Rutgers, New York University and the
New School was nonetheless determined to proceed with plans for a
major symposium next month on war crimes organized in conjunction
with the exhibition, including a special workshop on the
complexities of photographic documentation of such misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The average American may have long ago assumed that Hitler's
army played a key role in the Holocaust, but Germans and Austrians
have commonly held that the murder of European Jewry was solely the
handiwork of SS fanatics and extermination squads. And although
Germans in recent years have grappled with many aspects of their
dark past, the exhibition hit a nerve so raw that it has had ``the
effect of a national purgatory,'' said University of Chicago
historian Michael Geyer.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand photos, 80 percent taken by individual
soldiers, form its core. The snapshots show smirking infantrymen
grabbing and cutting off the beards of elderly Jews or executing
innocent bystanders at gunpoint. Other images chronicle the plunder
and torching of villages by military forces as well as troops
carrying out hangings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the exhibition contains official army documents
directing German military units to wipe out Jewish communities.
There are also personal letters, such as one from 1941 by an
infantryman to his parents boasting that his unit had killed 1,000
Jews in Ukraine and adding, ``That is far too few for what they
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the exhibition began its tour, critics alleged that
the photographs were forgeries or incorrectly labeled. Last month,
a Polish historian, Bogdan Musial, published an article in a German
academic journal stating that some of the images depicted victims
of murders in Ukraine committed by Soviet forces not German troops.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Musial's article appeared, the Hamburg institute
said it had conducted additional research and rephrased captions in
the English-language edition of the catalog to indicate that some
corpses in the relevant photos were murdered by the Soviet secret
police while others were Jews killed by Germans who later occupied
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's research director, Bernd Greiner, said that 10
pictures _ out of a total of more than 1,100 _ had been recaptioned
or removed since the exhibition originally opened.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Schiffrin, director of the New Press, which published the
English-language exhibition catalog, said 10,000 copies had already
been shipped to U.S. bookstores. ``We have nothing in the catalog,
to my knowledge, that is not historically correct,'' Schiffrin
said.
</P>
<P>
   While postwar Germany has reached a consensus on the need to
commemorate the crimes of the Nazi regime, resistance to
acknowledging broader military involvement in genocide remains
fierce since 20 million men _ a cross-section of society _ served
in the armed forces. The exhibition has helped break down a
psychological fire wall between history at large and family
experience.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the idea that the army had maintained a sense of
professionalism and ideological detachment throughout the war had
already been dealt a heavy blow in academic circles. Over the last
three decades, historians have documented with increasing precision
how soon after taking power the Nazi regime indoctrinated the
Wehrmacht and then used it as a policy tool until 1945.
</P>
<P>
   But not until the exhibition began its tour in 1995 did this
knowledge seep into German popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition unexpectedly became a historical event in its own
right. As it wended its way through Germany, still more evidence
came to light as visitors responded by rummaging in their attics
and coming forth to donate dozens of additional wartime photo
albums to the Hamburg institute. Many of these were to have been
displayed for the first time in New York.

</P>
<P>
   Other sectors of German society balked at the exhibition's
conclusion that not all but a significant part of the armed forces
hardly deserved the unsullied reputation made popular in postwar
films and novels. The Defense Ministry expressly barred active
soldiers from participating in symposiums about the exhibition;
extremists bombed it in Saarbruecken in March, and riots erupted at
several stops on its travels.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder never visited the exhibition and
was quoted as saying, ``I find it impermissible to say that the
bulk of the army was capable of committing such crimes.'' After the
chancellor declined an invitation to accompany the French
philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy on a tour of the show, pleading a
prior social commitment, Levy wrote in Le Monde that the Social
Democratic leader's priority was ``a party rather than remembrance
and history.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians at the Hamburg institute said that the disputed
photos came from Eastern bloc archives and that they had relied too
heavily on those archives' own captioning for the exhibition. ``The
vetting process did not go far enough,'' institute research
associate Hannes Heer told a Hamburg news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Omer Bartov, a professor of history at Rutgers, who has written
widely on German army involvement in genocide, said, ``It is
unfortunate that some of the photos may have been mislabeled, but
to my mind it casts no doubt whatsoever as to the facts as they are
presented in the exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that critics have ``latched on to these few unfortunate
errors, which have no bearing on the basic conclusions of the
exhibition or what the historiography has shown.''

ANALYSIS: JUDGE'S FINDINGS SHAKE MICROSOFT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs to include 460-word 2NDTAKE.) 
(For list of sidebars, see MICROSOFT-ADVISORY-NYT; the text of
Penfield's finding is available on The New York Times web site,
www.nytimes.com.) 
(th) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a 207-page legal document, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
has fashioned a club and wielded it against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In findings of fact that echo almost every one of the
government's allegations in its sweeping antitrust suit against the
big software maker, Jackson has concluded that Microsoft is a
monopolist that time and again bullied other companies in the
computer industry, harming consumers and hindering innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad day for Microsoft,'' observed William Kovacic, a
professor at the George Washington University law school. ``The
judge relentlessly accepted the government's story of what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Jackson used carefully calibrated legal prose, but at
the end of his findings he shifted to uncommonly blunt language.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's actions, he said, conveyed the message that the
company would use ``its prodigious market power and immense profits
to harm any firm'' that chooses to compete with the company's
mainstay products _ especially its corporate crown jewel, the
Windows operating system, which acts as the equivalent of the
central nervous system in more than 85 percent of personal
computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   Before the findings of fact were released Friday evening, legal
experts had expected that Jackson would generally favor the
government but also nod on occasion in Microsoft's direction. He
had suggested in the past that he would prefer to broker an
out-of-court settlement between Microsoft and the government. Such
an outcome would relieve the federal courts of the burden of having
to make fine-tuned decisions about products and business practices
in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement is still a possibility _ but only, it seems, if
Bill Gates, the company chairman, and his top lieutenants decide
that Jackson has done what no industry competitor ever
accomplished: brought Microsoft to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with these findings, antitrust experts say it is more likely
that Microsoft will persevere, hoping that Jackson's final ruling
is not such a one-sided rout as Friday's document might seem to
portend. The company's next step might then be to appeal his
decision to a federal appeals court and then perhaps the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge's goal was settlement, he would have to leave
enough ambiguity in the findings of fact so that neither side sees
it as in its self interest to fight this to the bitter end,''
observed Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa
law school, who is a leading antitrust scholar and who is advising
the government.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little that is ambiguous in Jackson's document.
``Having gone this far, I don't see Microsoft settling,'' said
Andrew Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's findings of fact are a preliminary step and not a
final ruling. But they form the all-but-unshakable foundation and
framework for the outcome of the case _ either a legal judgment or
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A court's legal judgment can be routinely overruled by a higher
court on appeal. But findings of fact can be overturned only in the
rare instance when the higher court finds a ``blatant
contradiction'' between the written record of the case and a
judge's finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson has poured a lot of concrete here,'' said
Kovacic of George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the defeat that Microsoft suffered Friday is
illustrated by the way Jackson dealt with one of the government's
main allegations: that Microsoft had tied its Web browser software
to its industry-standard Windows operating system merely to thwart
the challenge posed by Internet software makers, especially
Netscape Communications Corp., the commercial pioneer in software
used for browsing the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had replied that it simply made a product-design
decision to include browsing software in Windows, rather than make
it a separate product. The company noted that it had continually
added new features to Windows over the years, a strategy that it
said had helped consumers by making computers easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this product-tying claim by the Justice Department and
19 states who jointly sued Microsoft had appeared to suffer a sharp
setback shortly after the suit was filed in May 1998. A month
later, a federal appeals court ruled in a related case that
Microsoft should be free to blend its browser into Windows as long
as it can make a ``plausible claim'' of business efficiency or
consumer benefit from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the very high hurdle the appeals court had put in the
way of a product-tying claim, Jackson proceeded to find one. ``In
conclusion,'' he wrote on that subject, ``the preferences of
consumers and the responsive behavior of software firms demonstrate
that Web browsers and operating systems are separate products.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing Microsoft internal e-mail and licensing deals,
Jackson concluded that Microsoft had decided to ``bind'' its
browser to Windows and give it away free mainly to hobble its rival
Netscape ``rather than for any pro-competitive purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   As his product-tying finding showed, Jackson has accepted not
only the government's version of events but also its theory of the
case. The Justice Department had consistently argued that while
Microsoft operated in the high-technology economy, it was an
old-fashioned monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The practices at issue, the government charged, are similar to
those used since the turn-of-the-century days of smoke-filled
railroad cars _ threats and restrictive business contracts forced
on other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that the government was launching an assault on
the company's right to make its own product decisions, protect its
own intellectual property and innovate as it saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   The government, Microsoft insisted, simply did not understand
how the fast-paced software business worked in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson agreed with the government, and found Microsoft to
be an old-fashioned monopolist.

<P>
   ESZTERGOM, Hungary _ The road north from Budapest ends abruptly
at a pale green fence here in Esztergom, on the banks of the
Danube. And a good thing, too: The bridge is out. Spans of pale
green steel reach to the first pylons in the river from both the
Hungarian and Slovak sides, but the three middle pylons stand
alone. It has been thus for 54 years, since the bridge was blown up
by retreating Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, three more Danubian bridges lie in
ruins. All were bombed by NATO this past spring to cut Belgrade's
links with its northern provinces. A hastily erected orange pontoon
bridge has restored land traffic, but the ruins in the river are
causing a crisis, cutting off barge traffic and threatening to
flood the lowlands if an ice dam forms on the wreckage this winter.
</P>
<P>
   In Lom, Bulgaria, there are far older ruins; They are all that
are left of a bridge built by Rome to link its provinces of Thracia
and Dacia, the present day Bulgaria and Romania. And in the ``Iron
Gate'' between Romania and Serbia, only a plaque marks the spot
where the troops of the Roman emperor Trajan built a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   These collections of rubble _ twisted snares of steel or
algae-covered green stones _ are metaphors for the shifting fates
of the jigsaw puzzle of countries that make up Eastern Europe a
decade after the fall of communism, and for their tangled relations
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Esztergom, the ruined bridge is a harbinger of a new
spirit of amity: Hungary and the Slovak Republic, both eager to
earn entry to the European Union by showing that they can embrace
their neighbors, have decided to put aside centuries of ethnic
animosity and rebuild the bridge by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Novi Sad bridges, and the stubborn demands made by those
preventing the rubble from being cleared, are part of the shreds
left by ethnic hatred in the former Yugoslavia, and the animosity
between the Serbs and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The long, cranky negotiations between Bulgaria and Romania over
where to build one more bridge on their 600-mile river border shows
how difficult it is for the old order to give way to the new: the
Bulgarians want a bridge on the west end of the border to zip
trucks quickly from Asia Minor to western Europe; the Romanians are
happy with the old bridge at Giurgiu on the road to Moscow, its
former No. 1 ally, because they collect bigger road-use fees by
forcing trucks to detour several hundred miles east.
</P>
<P>
   The Danube, the longest river in continental Europe is a crucial
link between the eastern and western forces pulling at
mid-continent. Beyond inspiring Viennese waltzes, it has served
both as a frontier, separating Roman legions from Siberian
tribesmen and Christian Crusaders from Muslim holy warriors, as
well as a deep-blue vein of life, carrying food, coal and people
deep inland from the Black Sea. With the canal system connecting it
to the Rhine, it lets goods all the way to the North Sea, making it
the back door to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The river has served as a border between the Austro-Hungarian
and Ottoman Empires, but ``it has always been more of a symbolic
border than an actual one,'' said Ivo Banac, a professor of eastern
European history at Yale. ``The Magyars, and Atilla and the
Germanic tribes all crossed it. You can't sidestep the Danube, but
mountains are far greater obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   It has never really been an ethnic divider except on its eastern
end between the Romanians, who speak a Latin language, and the
Bulgarians, who speak a Slavic one, said Emil Fejzulahi, vice
president of a Hungarian-speaking party in Yugoslavia. On most of
its western stretches, there have historically been Serbs, Germans,
Croats and Hungarians on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the issue here in Esztergom, where the girders
of the Maria Valeria bridge were bolted together in 1895 by order
of Emperor Franz Josef I, and named after his daughter. The
Austro-Hungarian emperor ruled from Vienna, and the bridge was a
bit of largesse to allow two of his subject peoples, the Hungarians
and the Slovaks, to commune with each other.
</P>
<P>
   But peoples don't always obey natural boundaries, and the Slovak
side of the river was really more Hungarian than Slovak, part of
the 500,000 Hungarian-speaking ethnic Hungarians in the former
Czechoslovakia. While the view of the Hungarian side is dominated
by an archbishop's noble basilica, the Slovak side is full of ugly
apartment blocks erected to draw more Slovaks down-country to
dilute the Hungarian population.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of communism, in Czechoslovakia and Hungary,
conservative parties held sway. In Bratislava and Prague,
anti-Czech and anti-Slovak feeling rose, and ultimately split the
old country; in Slovakia this fed anti-Hungarian feeling, while in
Budapest the government laid claim to deciding the fates not only
of Hungary's 10.6 million citizens, but millions of others left
outside Hungary when Europe's borders were redrawn after World War
I.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, there was no government wish to fix what the Nazis had
done, no matter how much local people _ both Hungarians and Slovaks
_ were inconvenienced by the extra two-hour drive to the closest
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with new, more moderate parties in power in both countries
and an eagerness to accept the blandishments of the European Union,
a friendly bridge may well become a reality, thanks to a European
Union offer to pay half the $20 million cost.

</P>
<P>
   And yet Istvan Bindics, who has been the ferry captain here for
30 years, was somewhat saddened by the Sept. 16 signing ceremony,
not just because his livelihood may vanish, but because, he said,
he detected some of the cynicism that a new, capitalism-oriented
Europe has engendered.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidents of both countries met on a barge in mid-river,
about 1,200 people applauded on the Slovak bank. On the Hungarian
side, he said, ``it was 150 kids and nuns waving flags _ a very
forced celebration, the kind of thing you used to see in the
communist days.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the Slovak bank, he explained, were enthusiastic
because they view the bridge as a ``reconnection to the
motherland.'' But here in Hungary, the motherland, he said, ``They
don't care. There might be some business in it, OK _ but about the
people, they don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those waiting in line for Bindics' ferry, it was easy to
find the raw feelings demonstrating that even peaceful borders in
eastern Europe may be as divided by tribalism as they are by water.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Csonka, 25, a Hungarian-speaking housewife from the Slovak
side, said, ``I definitely feel hated there. When I went to school
and we had arguments, even my Slovak friends said: `You don't
belong here. We had a good empire, and then you Hungarian hordes
came and invaded us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bela Szekeres, 33, a Hungarian mall security manager waiting to
make his first tourist visit across the river, said he expected
life there to be much as at home. Poverty gives easterners more in
common, he felt, than ethnic ties to westerners. Hungarians and
Austrians were allies in both World Wars, but when he last visited
Austria, he saw an infuriating sign in a border shop: ``In
Hungarian, it said, `Hey, you Hungarians, Don't Steal,''' he said.
``Meanwhile, the money-changing guy was swindling from us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he added, ``we Hungarians are too nice to
everyone. The Austrians drive over our western border to shop,
because they can get things for one-tenth the price. And the
Romanians in Transylvania, when we have celebrations to mourn our
generals who were executed there, they demonstrate against them.''
</P>
<P>
   These are old grudges. The Magyar tribes invaded Slovak
territory in about 896 A.D. And the generals Szekeres referred to
were executed in 1849.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still-simmering ethnic hatred _ brewed with bad politics _ led
to the displacement and killing of Albanians by Serbs in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province and, this spring, _ to the bombing of
the old, well-loved bridge in Novi Sad by NATO jets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rubble itself is a new source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Barges on the Danube normally move more than 100 million tons of
goods a year, and the river is lined with factories, steel mills,
rail yards, oil depots and other users. With the river blocked, as
much as $1 billion worth of business is being lost or shipped more
expensively by rail or truck.
</P>
<P>
   The debris could be cleared for about $15 million, and all the
river's users are eager to foot the bill. But Slobodan Milosevic,
the president of Yugoslavia, is insisting that it not be cleared
until NATO agrees to rebuild the bridges it blew up. The United
States and Britain, the leaders of the NATO bombardment, are
insisting that they will not help rebuild Yugoslavia while
Milosevic remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the urgency of the matter is the fear that ice will
pack onto the wreckage this winter, damming the whole river and
flooding not just Yugoslavia, but the Hungarian plains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company that owns his ferry is going bankrupt, Bindics said,
because most of its income is from Danube traffic. ``It's a huge,
huge loss financially,'' he said. ``Romania just completed a canal
system at the Danube's mouth _ that money is just sitting there.
The traffic from France and Germany can't come down. The Ukraine is
crying out. Everybody but the Serbians is interested in clearing
the river, but in their little demented closed minds, it's no
problem _ because their little local barges can get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing between Bulgaria and Romania over a new bridge has gone
on for years now. ``It's crazy,'' one U.S. diplomat said. ``The
bridge at Giurgiu is underutilized, but it's still 1,000 kilometers
of river with only one bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many truckers prefer to avoid fractious former
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria has become the obvious route from Greece and
Turkey to Europe. The Bulgarians want a new bridge at Vidin, but
Romania has balked. A bridge somewhere farther east, probably paid
for by European Union money, would draw in more money to fix up
Romania's southern roads, and more fees paid by truckers. At the
moment, the negotiations are struggling to find a compromise that
might include a hydroelectric dam that trucks can cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any of this will be fixed soon,'' said
Bindics. ``But skepticism is my middle name.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A chief executive's ultimate test is how he or she copes in a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy maker, is definitely in a
crisis. Its stock has lost 70 percent of its value in the last 20
months. But instead of going on the offensive, Jill E. Barad, the
chief executive, has gone into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Although she generally loves the spotlight and thrives when she
is putting on a show, Ms. Barad abruptly canceled plans to attend
an influential toy industry conference last Wednesday in New York.
Most companies view the meeting, sponsored by Gerard Klauer
Mattison, an investment firm, as a golden opportunity to strut
their stuff before analysts and shareholders, and Mattel has almost
never missed a chance to make a presentation there. But the company
was nowhere to be seen this year, even though Ms. Barad was said to
be in New York a day later for a board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad declined to be interviewed for this article. But
conversations with many people who have worked with her at Mattel,
with current and former customers, with institutional shareholders
and with toy industry insiders draw an image of a company severely
damaged by Ms. Barad's management style. Most of these people asked
for anonymity when they spoke, fearing reprisals from Mattel, the
dominant company in a close-knit industry.
</P>
<P>
   The picture they paint is troubling. For years, Mattel benefited
mightily from Ms. Barad's marketing skill _ she takes credit for
building Barbie from $250 million in annual sales in the mid-1980's
to $1.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Barbie's growth has slowed to a crawl _ sales were
up 3 percent in the third quarter after a 14 percent drop last year
_ Mattel is suffering from Ms. Barad's weaknesses. People who know
her well say that she lacks financial acumen, is not disciplined
herself, cannot instill discipline in her employees and has severe
problems delegating authority to subordinates. Those on Wall Street
add another fault: she chronically overpromises and underdelivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad has also shown a tendency to do whatever she must to
get what she wants. On one occasion, while she was chief operating
officer, the company resorted to questionable tactics to make its
financial results look good, according to court documents. Ms.
Barad's compensation, like that of many a chief executive, is
closely tied to the company's financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing her performance, a former senior Mattel executive who
worked at the company for more than 10 years said: ``When I've seen
her at ad and marketing strategy meetings, everything she says
improves the quality or the strategy. But as a long-term strategist
and as a developer of people? No. An ability to accept an
alternative point of view? No. Her demons presently are outweighing
her assets, and I think the company is a lot the less for it.''
</P>
<P>
   No chief executive can excel at everything, of course. But Ms.
Barad's flaws are exacerbated, according to several former
colleagues and customers who know her well, by the way she
jealously guards her power. As a result, they say, she has driven
away many effective managers who might now make up for her
shortcomings and help Mattel out of its mess.
</P>
<P>
   Further, these people said, Ms. Barad is driven by the need to
succeed but cannot acknowledge failure. Over the 18 years she has
worked at Mattel, they said, Ms. Barad has shown herself to be a
brilliant presenter, but she refuses to listen to either her
customers or her employees.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Bozarth, Mattel's spokesman, said, ``We find the
criticisms to be unfair and unfounded.'' As for management
turnover, Bozarth said all those who had left did so for individual
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Ms. Barad was chief operating officer,
insiders were already expressing concern about her management
style. In a June 1995 speech before senior managers, James A.
Eskridge, then the newly installed president of the company and Ms.
Barad's subordinate, ran through a short list of challenges facing
Mattel. He said that in meetings with numerous executives he had
been told of a ``learned powerlessness'' at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   One element contributing to that powerlessness was the company's
tendency to operate according to what he called the ostrich school
of reality. Another element, Eskridge added, was the ``Jill
Factor,'' a cryptic reference to her volatile management style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge left Mattel in 1997, shortly after Ms. Barad was named
chief executive. He became chairman of the Stride Rite Corp. last
year, but quit in July. He could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But what he said looks prescient. Shellshocked Mattel
shareholders, searching for clues to why $13.5 billion in market
value has vaporized since March 1998, need look no further than the
pattern of denial that has characterized Mattel's board and its
management since Ms. Barad was named chief operating officer in
1992. Then, and until 1997, Mattel's chairman was John W. Amerman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad continues to have full support of the company's board,
a Mattel spokesman said, despite the string of disappointments that
has defined much of her tenure as chief executive. Several Mattel
directors, when called, declined to comment on Mattel or Ms. Barad.
</P>
<P>
   One of a handful of women occupying the chief executive's chair
at a major United States corporation, Ms. Barad ascended to the job
in January 1997, when Mattel's stock was at $27.75. It rose to a
high of $45.625 on March 13, 1998, but had fallen to $13.375 at
Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent bombshell hit Mattel shares in late September.
With no warning, the company said third-quarter earnings would fall
well below analysts' expectations, largely because of problems at
the Learning Company, a software maker Mattel acquired in May.
Instead of adding $50 million to $100 million to Mattel's
third-quarter earnings, as Ms. Barad forecast when the $3.8 billion
deal was completed, the Learning Company produced $105 million in
losses for the quarter, she said. More than a dozen shareholder
lawsuits have been filed since the company made the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders fled on the news, leaving those still in the stock
exasperated. ``Somebody has to be held accountable for the loss of
shareholder value,'' said Erik Gustafson, senior portfolio manager
at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago, which owns 3.8 million Mattel
shares, slightly less than 1 percent of the stock. ``Somebody must
present a cogent and well-thought-out plan to realize the value of
Mattel's core franchise. Who that is, I don't know anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Company debacle was only the latest shocker. Last
December, Ms. Barad told shareholders that a sudden change in
buying patterns by major retailers after Thanksgiving would result
in a 12 percent decline in sales and a 30 percent drop in earnings
during the all-important fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Few believed the explanation. Toy industry insiders at both
retailers and manufacturers said it was highly unlikely that a
chief executive would be surprised by a shift in buying after
Thanksgiving, because buying decisions are typically made well
before that. The stock fell 27 percent on the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Ms. Barad's current problems, however, her stint as
chief executive began well. In 1997, her first year on the job,
Mattel's sales rose 6.6 percent and earnings advanced 24.5 percent.
The market applauded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, while earnings rose 14.6 percent, sales fell 1 percent,
the first sales decline at the company since 1988. This year, sales
have risen 4.3 percent through the third quarter, but earnings are
22 percent below those of the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To put this volatile performance into context, for the five
years before Ms. Barad's appointment as chief executive, Mattel
showed 21 percent average annual sales growth and 35.7 percent
average annual earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Elikann was born in Brooklyn in 1951, a daughter of a
television show producer and homemaker. After attending Queens
College, according to past interviews, she wanted to become an
actress. A brief appearance in ``Crazy Joe,'' a B-movie made in
1974 by Dino De Laurentiis, changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   She then turned to another form of show business, cosmetics, and
started training department store cosmeticians for Coty. On a visit
to Los Angeles, she was having drinks with a friend at the Polo
Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel when she spotted an attractive
young man. As Ms. Barad later told The Los Angeles Times: ``I look
over and here's this really nice-looking guy with his mom and dad.
I said to my friend, `See that guy over there? I'm going to marry
him and move to L.A.''' His name was Thomas Barad.
</P>
<P>
   The two married and lived in Los Angeles starting in 1978. After
having the first of two sons, she landed a job at Mattel in 1981 as
product manager. In 1982, she was named marketing director for
Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, she was brilliant at expanding the Barbie brand
from a doll to a lifestyle, with cars, houses, horses and costumes
for any number of careers. Barbie became the canvas upon which any
little girl could paint her fantasy world. Sales skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   One executive who contributed mightily to the brand's success,
and Ms. Barad's, according to former Mattel managers, was Robert
Sansone, hired as president of Mattel USA in 1987. He died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people, Sansone provided the muscle for
Barbie's ascent. He raised the price on some merchandise _ Happy
Holidays Barbie, for one _ and got Toys ``R'' Us and Wal-Mart
Stores, a company new to toys, to increase their Barbie orders
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Sansone was integral to the company, several former Mattel
executives said, because he established and enforced management
controls. If a retailer balked at buying a certain Mattel item, for
instance, the sales force had a longstanding practice of promising
to provide token advertising if they agreed to take the product.
Not under Sansone. ``If they wouldn't take it, so be it,'' a former
executive recalled. ``The product was dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the former executive said, Sansone's controls have
disappeared. ``Jill is a shoot-from-the-hip person,'' this person
said. No executive there contradicts Ms. Barad.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Barad moved up Mattel's ladder, even after she was named
chief operating officer in 1992, she kept a tight rein on the
Barbie business. There was not an advertising storyboard or a doll
design she didn't see. ``Control Barbie and you control the
company,'' another former executive said. ``That was her best and
her constant move.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble started in the mid-1990s when Barbie sales growth began
to slow. People who have worked with Ms. Barad say her ego was too
entwined with the brand to want to accept that fact. ``She marketed
herself as the Barbie guru,'' a former executive said. ``If you
went in and said, `Barbie is going to be less than a year ago,' she
would have gone bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, top management realized that Mattel had problems.
According to a former employee who has filed a wrongful termination
suit against Mattel, top management took extraordinary measures to
make earnings predictions that year.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which was dismissed on summary judgment in December
1997, is on appeal in California state court. It was filed by
Michelle Greenwald, who was hired as a senior vice president in
1992. She contends that Mattel fired her in 1995 because she
alerted her superior, Eskridge, then Mattel's president, of her
concern that the company may not have accounted properly for a
royalty payment it had persuaded the Walt Disney Co. to defer from
1994 into 1995. Ms. Greenwald had primary responsibility for
Disney-licensed products at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, when the lawsuit was filed, Mattel has called Ms.
Greenwald's case ``baseless.'' A 1996 review by the law firm Davis
Polk &AMP; Wardwell and the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young into Ms.
Greenwald's allegations concluded that there was no evidence that
the company's accounting was ``inconsistent with generally accepted
accounting principles.'' In dismissing the case, the trial judge
said Ms. Greenwald had not objected strenuously enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenwald declined to comment, and her lawyer, Michael
Harris of Harris &AMP; Panels in Syracuse, declined to make her
available for an interview. But thousands of pages of documents
filed with the California Court of Appeals tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed by Ms. Greenwald in support of her
suit and obtained from the court, Jim DeRose, then president of
Mattel, wrote to Ms. Barad, the chief operating officer, on Oct. 6,
1994, that the company was short $40 million necessary to meet its
financial projections, and that they should ``determine
collectively how to address the profit fallout.'' Mattel management
then asked Disney to reduce the terms of its royalty arrangement,
and Disney said no, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, DeRose told some Mattel employees that he
``intended to inform the board of directors of the impossibility of
achieving'' the financial goals for 1994. On Dec. 9, DeRose was
fired, according to court documents. He did not return a telephone
call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the payments that Mattel owed Disney in 1994 on its
licensing deals was $11.8 million for infant and preschool toys.
The payment was not made by the end of the year and, on Jan. 10,
according to the documents, Ms. Barad wrote a letter essentially
asking Disney to forgive the royalty payment. In its response,
Disney agreed only to defer the payment until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenwald feared that Mattel did not consider the $11.8
million owed to Disney as a deferred expense in 1994, as accounting
rules would require. Court papers say that on April 25, 1995, she
alerted Mattel's new president, Eskridge, to her fears about this
and other amounts owed to Disney totaling $16.6 million. She said
she was fired two months later, while on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   On the deferral of the Disney royalties, the Ernst &AMP; Young
review said Mattel's accounting was ``reasonable'' given the
``facts and circumstances as they existed at the time the
accounting decisions were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Court documents also include Eskridge's slides from the June
1995 presentation to top management that outlined Mattel problems.
In addition to his reference to an ostrich school of reality and
the Jill Factor, there is a slide titled ``Mattel ... The Current
Business Situation.'' It said ``Strong track record of sales and
earnings ... but `manufactured' earnings in last two quarters. 4th
quarter 1994: Disney `deal' and $ currency hedges.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mattel spokesman said the comments from the slides were
taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1998 annual report, Mattel stated that during 1996, the
company received comments from the Securities and Exchange
Commission regarding ``its accounting for certain royalties and
participation fees in prior periods.'' The company said it
conducted a thorough investigation and found that its accounting
was consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.
Nevertheless, Mattel ``recognized a catch-up adjustment in the
amount of $21.8 million before taxes in the fourth quarter of
1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the SEC letter confirmation of Ms. Greenwald's allegations?
The spokesman said only that the company had consistently argued
that the suit was without merit.
</P>
<P>
   The $16.6 million cited by Ms. Greenwald may sound like small
change at a company as big as Mattel _ its revenues in 1994 were
$3.2 billion _ but if it did not record the amounts owed to Disney
as expenses, the company's earnings looked better than they
actually were.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond trying to please Wall Street analysts by meeting the
earnings estimates, Mattel management had an incentive to increase
profit because executive compensation is based on how the company
does financially.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1995, Mattel's management incentive plan focused on
profitability, asset management and revenue growth. According to
testimony of Barbara Luna, one of two independent accounting
experts hired by Ms. Greenwald to examine company records for
practices that would support her allegation, if Mattel reported
expenses of $16.6 million during 1994, the company would have
earned $1.46 a share, not the $1.50 necessary for top management to
receive greater bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luna testified that if a Mattel share earned $1.46 for the
year, the $26 million bonus pool payable to top management in 1994
would have fallen 21 percent, to $20.4 million. On the strength of
what Eskridge's slides had called the ``manufactured'' earnings,
Amerman, the chief executive at the time, earned a bonus of
$833,150, Eskridge received $425,000 and Ms. Barad got $635,800.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenwald also contends in her suit that Mattel consistently
delivered free goods and other incentives to major retailers in
exchange for their buying additional merchandise that would help
Mattel ``make their quarters.'' How the company accounted for
inducements was another concern.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive at a major toy retailer confirmed that over
many years, Mattel regularly asked him to place an order before the
quarter's end to help Mattel. ``They've been making their quarters
for 15 years by going to retailers and saying, `We need a $10
million order,' and give an inducement,'' the executive said.
Although this executive said that providing an occasional favor
like this was common in the industry, the regularity with which
Mattel did it was unique. ``Every company has done it at a time,
but not every company does it every quarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive might be a discount on merchandise or a promise of
free goods in the future. But the retailing executive was not sure
how Mattel accounted for the discount. ``It has to go in future
liabilities or current liabilities,'' he said. For example, it
cannot be deferred to a future quarter when higher revenues would
make the expense look inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel said it accounts for these incentives properly.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mattel's troubles began as early as 1994, the company
was telling the outside world that things were great.
</P>
<P>
   But toys made by other companies started to take market share
from Barbie. Beanie Babies became a sensation among both young
girls and collectors, and merchandise designed around the Spice
Girls, the rock group, stormed the market. Then came Furby.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, Barbie didn't have any competition,'' said Jim
Silver, publisher of the Toy Book, an industry newsletter. ``These
items all represented competition even though they weren't just
dolls.'' Barbie could no longer grow at 15 percent a year or more.
In 1994, according to an internal Mattel memo, Barbie sales rose 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Ms. Barad said she was ill-equipped to deal with
Barbie in decline. ``Jill is one of the most brilliant,
hard-driving marketing product people I have ever met,'' said a top
executive at a major toy retailer. ``Her problem is, the world is
not just Barbie. Not everything in the toy business can be done the
same as Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad's focus on Barbie seems to have resulted in a lack of
innovation in other areas at Mattel, former insiders say. So, even
as Barbie sales were slowing, Mattel flooded toy stores with
merchandise. The company also began producing far more of the
collector's line of Barbies _ a high-margin segment of the business
begun in the early 1990s _ than it said it would. The market became
awash in these dolls that fetched between $50 and $100, enraging
Barbie collectors who had believed the company when it said the
dolls were limited editions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Customers who complained to Mattel said they were ignored. ``A
lot of it was an obsession with the bottom line, and they were
riding on their high horse and not listening to their customers,''
one retailer said. ``Not listening to the dealers and the customers
is now a major part of their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Without ideas for internal growth, Ms. Barad was forced to look
to acquisitions. Her record in this area is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Her first was Tyco Toys Inc., whose Matchbox toy car brand and
radio control toys complemented Barbie. Tyco's sales were declining
when the deal was done in March 1997, but Mattel paid $881 million
for it, a little more than Tyco's 1996 sales. Mattel immediately
recorded a $275 million pretax charge against operations as a
result of the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mattel bought the Pleasant Co., a mail-order doll
concern that was generating $300 million in annual sales. Again,
the price was high: $700 million. Toy industry experts say that
paying the equivalent of sales for a toy company is considered
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Learning Company, for which Mattel paid $3.8
billion _ 4.5 times sales _ in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management felt in both cases that these were fair
valuations,'' Bozarth said.
</P>
<P>
   But even casual observers of the Learning Company knew that it
was no longer a hot property. Its software characters, Reader
Rabbit and Carmen Sandiego, were aging and it had lost money in all
but one year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, when Mattel warned shareholders that the Learning
Company would show a significant revenue shortfall and a loss, it
cited three reasons. A planned licensing arrangement was scrapped
because its terms were not what Mattel had understood them to be,
the company chose to write off bad debts and it had terminated
relationships with some distributors.
</P>
<P>
   To people familiar with the due diligence typical before an
acquisition, these explanations only clouded the issue. ``This is
not brain surgery,'' one former Mattel executive said. ``When
someone says to me they were shocked because licenses didn't do
what they were supposed to do, that says to me someone didn't
forecast properly.''
</P>
<P>
   And where is the Mattel board? According to Patrick McGurn,
director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder
Services, a corporate governance group, Mattel's board includes too
many people who have been there for 10 or 20 years. Most were there
to watch Ms. Barad mastermind Barbie's glory days, and are charmed
by her. Among outside directors, the average age is 60, the 1999
proxy states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is in some pretty desperate need of new blood,'' he
said. ``When they serve a long time, they may not see the need for
change.''
</P>
<P>
   McGurn is even more troubled by the fact that Ned Mansour,
Mattel's president and general counsel, sits on the board's
nominations and corporate governance committee, which is charged
with ensuring that the company is run effectively and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good governance, period,'' McGurn said. ``There
should be no insiders on those panels.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel responds that it believes Mansour's seat on the committee
to be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   For now, angry shareholders have only one reason to hope for
change: at the annual meeting, Mattel allows for so-called
cumulative voting for directors. That makes it easier for a big
shareholder to make a run at a board seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a shareholder had about 9 percent of the stock,'' McGurn
said, putting all his shares toward a single candidate ``could vote
a person onto the board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A dissident could swoop in,'' McGurn said.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, many people want resolution of Mattel's
problems.``I just hope they bring it around quickly, and we can
continue to grow together,'' said Fred Meyers, the owner of Meyers
Toy World in Battle Creek, Mich.

 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A large majority of New York City eighth-graders have
failed to meet tough new state standards on tests in mathematics
and English, raising questions about the quality and content of the
curriculum in middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   A 77 percent failure rate in mathematics, announced by state
officials Friday, combined with a 65 percent failure rate in
English, cast doubt on whether many students in years to come will
be able to earn a high school diploma under equally rigorous
statewide Regents tests required for graduation, educators said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight percent of New York City eighth-graders scored in
the bottom of the four categories in math, meaning that they had
barely moved beyond elementary addition and subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   The new tests caused dismay even in affluent suburbs and rural
areas outside New York City, where 54 percent of eight-graders
failed to meet state standards in mathematics and 46 percent failed
to do so in reading.
</P>
<P>
   From Kentucky to Massachusetts, more and more states are in the
middle of a drive to set and enforce standards that are based on
more rigorous and objective tests of hard knowledge. New York is
being closely watched as a laboratory for the most demanding
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The tests whose results were announced Friday were designed
exclusively for New York and the scores were based not on a
comparison to how a national average of students perform _ the way
New York City's own reading and math tests have been _ but on a
judgment about what children should know, such as elementary
algebra, the Pythagorean theorem, finding means and medians, and
calculating probabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some Board of Education officials in New York City, stunned by
the low scores, suggested Friday that they could only have come
from unrealistically difficult tests or a flawed scoring system.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state tests show the pitfalls of dropping the
national comparison, because it is problematic to evaluate the
significance of unique tests when standards may be higher in one
state and lower in another. Texas, for example, gives its students
statewide tests regarded as easier than New York's.
</P>
<P>
   In states like Massachusetts and Maryland, large numbers of
students failed new, more rigorous tests. A number of experts have
warned that the growing use of difficult tests will backfire
politically when large number of students fail and officials must
consider whether to hold those students back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, state officials defended the test, saying that it allowed
districts within New York state to make valid comparisons and that
it would force even the state's most affluent communities to
reassess how well their schools were performing.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates said the dismal scores would alert education
officials to pay more attention to the long-neglected middle and
junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle school is still a problem in New York City and
everybody knows it,'' said Noreen Connell, executive director of
the Educational Priorities Panel, a nonprofit education advocacy
group. ``People are still taking their kids out after elementary
school and moving to the suburbs or to private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In future years, New York City will use the new state tests to
determine whether students are promoted to the next grade, but city
officials said they would also weigh other factors like classroom
work and attendance.

</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills said the standards
had been pitched high on purpose, as a way of exposing years of
watered-down curriculum in many, though not all, of the state's
public schools. He said New York state's standards and the
questions on the tests had been developed by committees of teachers
and field-tested on thousands of students.
</P>
<P>
   They are based in part, he said, on findings from the 1996 Third
International Mathematics and Science Study, which showed that
American middle-school students are getting a less demanding
curriculum than those in 20 other countries, including France,
Japan and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a very great mistake to step back from the
standards,'' Mills said at an Albany news conference. ``If teachers
do that kind of work, you can learn it. But if you're not taught
it, it's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, declined
comment but issued a subdued written statement saying that Mills
was ``correct when he raised standards and introduced more rigorous
tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew boasted that 16 New York City's schools ranked in the top
100 statewide but did not mention that New York City has about 37
percent of the state's students. Robert Tobias, the board's testing
director, said some city schools were larger on average than those
in the rest of the state; even so, the city still lags.
</P>
<P>
   Crew also pointed out that New York City placed ahead of the
other four large urban school districts in the state, with 23
percent of its eighth-graders passing the math test, compared with
22 percent in Buffalo, 19 percent in Syracuse, 13 percent in
Yonkers and 10 percent in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   While New York City has many poor students, it also has large
tracts of middle-class families in parts of Queens and Manhattan.
Schools in those areas outperform even the best schools in the rest
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 60 percent of eighth-graders in District 26 in
Bayside, Queens, passed the math test, and 20 percent were in the
top or ``advanced'' category, well above generally affluent Nassau
County, where 52 percent passed and 12 percent scored in the
advanced category. In Manhattan's District 2, covering TriBeCa to
the Upper East Side, 52 percent passed the math test and 14 percent
were advanced.
</P>
<P>
   The state also released test scores in fourth-grade math, where
50 percent of New York City students failed to meet state
standards, compared with 23 percent in the rest of the state. The
state previously released fourth-grade English results, showing
that 67 percent failed to meet standards.
</P>
<P>
   The new test scores could add fuel to a class-action lawsuit,
supported by the Board of Education, charging that the state
underfinances New York City schools.
</P>
<P>
   Richard F. Elmore, a professor of education at Harvard, said he
considers standards-based tests better measures of achievement than
traditional nationally normed tests. But he warned that it took
time for curriculum and instruction to catch up with new standards,
on any test, making it risky to tie the tests to graduation and
promotion. ``In my view, New York has been a little too quick to
lay down stakes on tests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mills said he also expected the scores to drive badly needed
changes, whether state aid increased or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testsdo matter,'' said Seymour Fliegel, president of the
Center for Educational Innovation, a nonprofit research group. ``If
this is a terrible test, why should the rest of the state do twice
as well as we do?''
</P>
<P>
   But Marc F. Bernstein, superintendent of Long Island's
Bellmore-Merrick district, said many schools had not had a chance
to match their curriculums to the new tests, leading to an
exaggerated sense of failure. ``It's really doubtful whether those
youngsters need interventions in order to do well on the Regents
tests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
said the low scores in New York City pointed up the chronic
shortage of teachers trained in mathematics. ``New York City has
almost all the uncertified teachers in the state,'' Dr. Ravitch
said. ``It also has much more turnover than the rest of the
state.''

STANTON IN ACCORD FOR A 3-YEAR PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to retain another piece of the 1999 team, the
New York Yankees are expected to announce soon that they have
reached an agreement on a new three-year contract with reliever
Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton has expressed a desire to remain with the Yankees, but
the 32-year-old left-hander was unsure if the team could afford to
keep him, given its other budgetary concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But after several discussions, the two sides have essentially
agreed on the parameters of a three-year deal and should announce
it by early next week, according to people familiar with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman would not comment on Stanton's
status, and Sam Levinson, one of Stanton's agents, did not return
two telephone messages.
</P>
<P>
   The contract will probably exceed $8 million for three years.
Stanton, who made $1.85 million in 1999, had said he would take
less than he might get on the free-agent market to stay with the
two-time World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton was 2-2 with a 4.33 earned run average last season and
led the team with 73 appearances. Even though he pitched only 621/3
innings, Stanton is an important pitcher because of his
versatility, his durability and because there are few solid
left-handed relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton has closed games when Mariano Rivera has been
unavailable and even started once for the Yankees last May after
552 straight career relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre uses Stanton mostly as a weapon against left-handed
hitters, such as Cleveland's Jim Thome or Rafael Palmeiro of Texas.
Stanton allowed 23 hits in 90 at-bats (.258 average) to left-handed
hitters while striking out 28 this season. He retired 53 of the 72
first batters he faced and prevented 46 of 61 inherited runners
from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton has said that having a somewhat lesser role on a team
capable of winning a title is more important to him than being a
closer for a team that is not likely to reach the post-season. The
Yankees were also swayed to keep Stanton because he is 1-1 with a
1.09 earned run average in the postseason, with only four earned
runs in 33 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees still have not had a discussion with Pat Gillick,
Seattle's general manager, since Ken Griffey Jr. requested a trade
from the team, further evidence that they are not likely to be
involved in the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman was also expected to inform Chili Davis that the Yankees
were buying out the $800,000 option on his contract, allowing the
39-year-old player to officially retire. &QL;

UNION'S FATE? IT'S IN THE MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ballot is in the mail. The arbitration is in abeyance
</P>
<P>
   That was the box score on developments involving major-league
umpires Friday. The New York office of the National Labor Relations
Board mailed ballots to 93 umpires for an election that will
determine their collective bargaining representative, and an
arbitrator in Philadelphia began and then recessed a hearing that
could determine the job status of 22 umpires who lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Silverman, regional director of the labor board, said the
ballots were sent out by regular mail after a lawyer working with
the umpires seeking a new union checked them. The umpires are being
asked to vote for the existing union, a new union or no union. A
majority of votes cast is needed to win the election. Otherwise, a
second election will be held with the two leading vote-getters on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots that were mailed Friday must be returned by Nov. 30,
the day the votes will be counted.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 umpires who lost their jobs when the union's resignation
strategy backfired will have to wait beyond that date to learn
their status. The Major League Umpires Association contends that
the National League and the American League improperly hired new
umpires and terminated the 22.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's lawyers filed a motion Wednesday asking Alan
Symonette, the arbitrator, to dismiss the grievance on the grounds
that he does not have jurisdiction because the labor agreement
gives the league presidents the authority to determine umpires'
employment. Symonette gave the union's lawyers until Nov. 16 to
file a brief to respond to the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their view of our case is that it's in a tiny little box,''
Tom Jennings, a lawyer for the union, said by telephone from
Philadelphia. ``Now that they've decided that's our case, they say
it's not arbitrable. But it's not a tiny box. It involves things
they haven't even thought about. Our view of the world is vastly
different. I have no serious concern about that issue. It's a
typical employer ploy to avoid the consequences of their own
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is the second lawyer the union has retained to
represent the umpires. The first, Susan Davis, withdrew, a baseball
official said, because the union was not paying her firm's bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers spent much of the first day of the hearing arguing about
document requests. Frank Coonelly, one of baseball's labor
relations lawyers, said Symonette said he would rule on the
requests when he rules on the jurisdictional issue.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings, the arbitrator told the lawyers, would come before
Dec. 13, which is the date he set for resumption of the hearing, if
it is to resume.

 &HT;    What Microsoft ruling means
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The ultimate effects of the Microsoft case are
still months away at best. But here's what it may mean to different
groups, based on discussions with analysts, others after Friday's
ruling:
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMERS
</P>
<P>
   _ For those who already run Microsoft software, the court case
will have little or no effect. For those in the market for new
computers and software, the decision will likely lead to more
freedom of choice and, maybe, better prices.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   _ More PC makers will likely preinstall non-Microsoft software
in their products as the company's stronghold over the operating
system business softens. Dell Computer Corp. and other companies
already offer to install the Linux operating system on some models;
other computer makers will likely follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some PC makers will strike new deals with other software
companies since the fear of possible retribution from Microsoft is
reduced. One such recent deal: Gateway Corp. recently agreed to to
make computers for America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft will continue to dominate the market for software
operating on personal computers. And most software applications
developers will continue to support Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some software companies will start adapting programs to run on
non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   _ An even wider variety of new products will be offered, many of
them running non-Microsoft software. These include smart wireless
phones; video game consoles; set-top control boxes for digital
television; palmtop computers and other so-called ``information
appliances.''

CIA DIRECTOR SLIPS IN TO STUDY POLICE DEPARTMENT PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cloaked in a befitting amount of secrecy, CIA
Director George Tenet was quickly shuttled into police headquarters
in Lower Manhattan on Friday morning to see the nerve center of the
city's war on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, who was born in Queens County, is the latest in a line of
agency officials to visit and study the program known as Compstat,
in which the department uses block-by-block crime statistics to
measure police performance, detect trends and deploy resources to
trouble spots. The program, begun in 1994, has been widely credited
with reducing crime.
</P>
<P>
   One police official at the session said Tenet was impressed.
During the first year of the Giuliani administration, Police
Commissioner William Bratton began holding weekly meetings of
police supervisors, during which commanders were forced to explain
crime patterns in their precincts and devise strategies. The
meetings frequently included bitter criticism of supervisors on
whose watch crime had increased.
</P>
<P>
   The Compstat process has continued under Commissioner Howard
Safir, and the crime rate declined sharply until it began to level
off this year. Two years ago, Vice President Al Gore's task force
to ``reinvent government'' gave the program an award.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Tenet was considering a similar system to
coordinate efforts of the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, we humans just don't play well together,'' said
Jack Maple, a former deputy police commissioner. ``The CIA could
use this method effectively. I am sure that with this system they
would more easily be able to pick up on when a government is about
to be overthrown.''
</P>
<P>
   One Queens police official said officers ``really got grilled''
because Tenet was there. ``He was really impressed with it, how
they used maps and grids to track things, and how if someone
failed, there was always someone to follow up,'' the official
added.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials were officially mum on Tenet's visit. CIA
spokeswoman Marilyn Mode referred all questions to CIA officials in
Virginia, who said the agency generally did not comment on Tenet's
schedule. But Tenet and his security detail were spotted leaving
police headquarters at 8:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they had recently contacted the agency to
discuss terrorism threats and expected to meet with senior
officials later this year.

ROBOT FINDS FLIGHT 990 BLACK BOXES, WILL TRY TO RECOVER SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ A high-tech robot Friday attempted
unsuccessfully to recover two orange-colored boxes that could
explain why EgyptAir Flight 990 took a wild roller-coaster ride
above the Atlantic last Sunday before diving into the ocean,
killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery operations for the Boeing jet's cockpit voice and
flight data recorders were suspended about 7 p.m. EST because of
weather, said a spokesman for the National Transpiration Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   USS Grapple, the Navy's mother ship for the robotic submersible
Deep Drone, remained at the crash site overnight. But it was not
certain if conditions would allow the drone to resume its difficult
work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the strength of electronic pinging signals from each
box, the drone passed over them during the day-long search but was
unable to see them, said Navy Capt. Bert Marsh, who is supervising
the salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to dig for them,'' he said at a late-afternoon
briefing for the hundreds of print, radio and broadcast media who
have been here throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Without data from the boxes, safety board investigators have had
to rely on preliminary analysis by the Air Force of radar tapes to
tell them the final path of Flight 990. That analysis has been
questioned by unnamed experts in some media reports, most notably
CNN. The television network quoted an unnamed government official
as saying the Boeing 767 could not possibly have done what the
radar analysis indicates, and thus the analysis must be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Friday the board's top radar expert and the Air Force
have gone over the data again and stand behind their preliminary
findings: the Boeing jet, flying at 33,000 feet, entered a steep
and perhaps supersonic dive to 16,000 feet, where it then climbed
back to 24,000 feet before diving again. The plane broke apart
about 10,000 feet above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron, based at Hill
Air Force Base north of Salt Lake City, has provided assistance to
the NTSB in previous high-profile incidents, including the crashes
of golfer Payne Stewart's plane, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane, and
TWA flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said safety board investigators did computer
simulations that showed the Boeing 767-300 is capable of flying the
roller-coaster path indicated by the radar analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But with so little information about what happened to Flight 990
_ a situation that has fueled the speculation about the cause of
the crash in media reports _ investigators have expressed growing
frustration with the delays in getting the data- and
voice-recording boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said his investigators want to get the two so-called
``black boxes'' to labs in Washington, D.C., as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The plan Friday was to have a helicopter fly the boxes, stored
in water-filled ice chests to protect them, from the Grapple to an
FAA airplane waiting at Quonset Point. From there, it would be a
short flight to Washington, D.C., and the labs of the NTSB, where
the boxes will be carefully opened and technicians can begin
analyzing the data.
</P>
<P>
   But getting those boxes now depends on the cooperation of Mother
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has said it needs seas of less than 9 feet to safely
conduct its recovery operation with Deep Drone. Until Friday, high
winds had churned up seas of more than 20 feet at the crash site
for two days, but the Grapple and two other ships set sail from
Newport through the heavy seas Thursday afternoon after the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted calmer
weather for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Grapple was on the scene before daylight and dropped Deep Drone
into the water about 9 a.m. Within an hour, the robot had zeroed in
on electronic signals that are being emitted from each of the two
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   These so-called black boxes, which are actually painted high
visibility orange and are located in a plane's tail, may be hidden
in mud, silt or under wreckage of the Boeing 767, which is in
thousands of pieces in water about 250 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said the boxes are about 15 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   The robot, called a Remote Operating Vehicle, is about the size
of a mini-van. It is equipped with sonar, still and television
cameras, and small gripping tools that can be used to move
wreckage, dig in the mud and, investigators hope, retrieve the
recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The drone has lights, but in the deep black waters the
television can only see objects a few feet away. There are many
small bits of wreckage. The biggest seen by the drone was one of
the plane's wheels, Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   If the boxes are stuck in debris too heavy for the robot to
lift, Deep Drone can place rigging on the wreckage. It would then
be lifted to the surface with one of two cranes on Grapple, the
Navy's rescue and salvage ship that played a key role in retrieving
up wreckage from the TWA Flight 800 and SwissAir Flight 111 air
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are not the only ones who want to know what clues
the boxes will provide in helping them solve the mystery of Flight
990. Hall, who has held daily briefings with family members of the
victims, said they need to know what happened to their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've explained to them how essential the information on these
recorders is,'' Hall said.

APPEALS COURT HANDS INTEL BIG ANTITRUST VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court handed Intel Corp. an
important victory on Friday in its antitrust battles, lifting an
order that required the world's largest computer chip maker to
share patented microprocessor technology with another company.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-0 decision in a civil case brought by Intergraph Corp.,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Intel
probably did not violate antitrust laws when in a patent dispute it
withheld product information and samples from the Alabama-based
company that makes graphics chips and workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel signed an agreement with the Federal Trade
Commission earlier this year to halt its practice of withholding
advance copies of chips from companies with whom it has
intellectual property disputes, the ruling may help remove the
legal cloud the company is under as the subject of a broader
antitrust investigation by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the preliminary injunction, federal Judge Edwin
Nelson of Alabama had called Intel a monopolist, a label that could
have made Intel vulnerable to suits by other computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeas court said Friday that ``Intel's conduct with
respect to Intergraph does not constitute the offense of
monopolization or the threat thereof in any market relevant to
competition with Intergraph.''
</P>
<P>
   It noted that antitrust law had consistently recognized that a
producer's advantageous or dominant market position based on
superiority of a commercial product and ensuing market demand is
not the illegal use of monopoly power prohibited by the Sherman
Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   One of the judges, Pauline Newman, said Intergraph had not
proved a substantial likelihood of being able to prove antitrust
accusations against Intel, so the appeals court could not justify
``the dramatic remedy'' of requiring Intel to provide its
proprietary information to another company.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, said the company was
pleased with Friday's 41-page ruling, which spelled out in great
detail the court's views on how antitrust laws should be applied.
</P>
<P>
   The strong statements could affect both the final outcome of the
Intergraph civil suit and the broader FTC investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it newsworthy is that there is a substantial amount
of court opinion with respect to antitrust law,'' Mulloy said.
``The opinion talks about how you apply market power and whether or
not Intel is a monopoly and about what actions we've taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., rose
three-quarters of a point, to 82\; Intergraph fell a quarter of a
point, to 3}.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stems from Intel's decision to begin withholding
advance chip information from Intergraph after Intergraph asserted
patent claims against the chip maker. Nelson ordered Intel in April
1998 to continue supplying the chip technology data.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Intel has entered an agreement with the FTC to halt
the practice of withholding advance chips from companies with whom
it has intellectual property disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gates, a spokesman for Intergraph, said, ``While the
preliminary injunction which was overturned today was critical
prior to Intel's signing of the FTC consent decree earlier this
year, Intergraph does not anticipate that today's ruling will
impact its ongoing hardware business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson compared Intel to software giant Microsoft, saying access
to advance copies of Intel's chips was crucial for Intergraph's
workstation business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nelson sided with Intel on another aspect of the
case, dismissing Intergraph's patent claims. &QL;

   BRITAIN: LORDS PICK THEIR PEERS
</P>
<P>
   In the first election in its history, the House of Lords chose
75 hereditary peers who with 17 others will be permitted to remain
in the upper body temporarily under a government reform abolishing
voting rights of the 759 nobles who gained their titles through
birth. The 500 life peers, whose titles cannot be passed on to
their heirs, will not be affected by the vote.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: PINOCHET CHECK-UP
</P>
<P>
   Britain has offered Gen. Augusto Pinochet a medical check-up
after he suffered a minor stroke, his third in three months, while
under house arrest in England. A court has ruled that the
83-year-old former Chilean dictator can be extradited to Spain to
stand trial on torture charges, but his lawyers have appealed. The
medical tests could provide an independent measure of Pinochet
supporters' demands that he be freed on grounds of ill health.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: MODIFIED CROPS BAN EXTENDED
</P>
<P>
   Widespread public protests have persuaded the government to
extend its current ban on commercial growing of genetically
modified crops for three more years. Farm tests will continue,
however, said Environment Minister Michael Meacher, under controls
to prevent contamination of other fields.

   After criticism that East German civil rights activists had been
excluded from speaking at a ceremony on the 10th anniversary of the
fall of the Berlin Wall next week, a former pastor and East German
dissident, Joachim Gauck, has been added to the list of speakers.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and former Chancellor Helmut Kohl will

term from five to six years and permit immediate re-election
instead of the 10-year wait between terms required by the current
charter.

   MEXICO: CONFLICT OVER ADS
</P>
<P>
   A major opposition party protested that the interior ministry
tried to block the broadcast of new advertisements for its

National Action Party would interfere with the governing party's
primary election next Sunday, but later backed down and allowed
them to be aired.

</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Chihuahua filed corruption-of-minors charges and
issued an arrest warrant for Gloria Trevi, one of Mexico's
best-known pop stars, as well as her manager, Sergio Andrade. The
charges originated with a criminal complaint by the parents of a
12-year-old girl Ms. Trevi recruited as a chorus girl, and who two

ARMENIAN CHURCH GETS A NEW WORLDWIDE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the wall above the entrance to the Armenian
Orthodox cathedral on Second Avenue near 34th Street in Manhattan
is a large bas-relief of St. Vartan, a fifth-century warrior prince
whose leadership in a long struggle against a conquering Persian
army helped preserve Christianity as the faith of his people.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, inside the offices of the Diocese of the Armenian
Church of America next door, attention has focused on a much more
recent event in Armenian Christianity's long history: the
enthronement on Thursday of a new supreme patriarch of the
worldwide Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church. The worldwide church
includes about a million baptized members in the United States,
most of them in the New York-based diocese, which was founded 101
years ago to serve Armenian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity is preparing to celebrate 17 centuries in Armenia,
which borders the Black Sea in the southern Caucasus and re-emerged
as an independent republic after the Soviet Union broke up. In A.D.
301, Armenia's king was converted by St. Gregory the Illuminator,
who is considered the founder and first catholicos (the title means
``universal'') of the Armenian church.
</P>
<P>
   St. Gregory's current successor _ 132nd in that line _ is
Catholicos Karekin II, elected to the office on Oct. 27 by an
assembly of more than 400 lay and clerical delegates representing
Armenian communities around the world. (About 50 came from the
United States.) Until his election, he was Archbishop Karekin
Nersissian. He is 48 and a native of Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   The election occurred on the very day that gunmen entered the
Armenian Parliament, opened fire and killed government officials
including Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in the capital, Yerevan, was less than 20 miles from
the church assembly's meeting in Echmiadzin, where the catholicos
lives and governs. News of the killings got to the gathering as
Catholicos-elect Karekin was making his acceptance speech,
according to a report from the diocesan offices in New York. The
meeting was adjourned after a brief religious service to pray for
the victims, and the enthronement, originally scheduled for last
Sunday, was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Although he speaks English, Catholicos Karekin II is not so well
known in the United States as was his predecessor, Karekin I, who
died in June and had long worked in international ecumenical
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Karekin II was born near Echmiadzin and graduated with honors
from the seminary there in 1971. Ordained a monk in 1972, he
pursued graduate-level studies in Austria, Germany and Russia. He
became a bishop of the diocese that includes Yerevan in 1983. Nine
years later, Catholicos Vasken I, then head of the church, elevated
him to the rank of archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   THE PHILOSOPHER-DIPLOMAT
</P>
<P>
   Another overseas event of some religious interest in the United
States has occurred in Indonesia. The newly appointed foreign
minister there is Alwi Shihab, a scholar of Islamic philosophy who
happens to have been a recent visiting professor and faculty
research associate at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Shihab worked at the seminary for two years beginning in 1996,
teaching courses and helping edit The Muslim World, a publication
of the seminary's Center for the Study of Islam and
Christian-Muslim Relations, said Barbara Brown Zikmund, the
seminary's president. Before his government appointment, Dr.
Zikmund said, he also helped develop a program, with the Indonesian
Ministry of Religious Affairs, in which Muslim and Christian
students from Indonesia can study at the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Shihab, who holds degrees from universities in
Egypt and the United States, was appointed foreign minister last
week, as his country's new president, Abdurrahman Wahid, formed a
cabinet. Wahid has signaled that his predominantly Muslim nation is
ready to seek closer economic ties with Israel, and to Dr. Zikmund
it seemed fitting that Shihab would have a prominent role in such a
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man deeply committed to interfaith issues,'' she said.
``And that one of the first things he did was in relationship with
Israel is so fitting.''

MESSY TIMES FOR DIAPER SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
After five years of running Dy-Dee Wash diaper service in the red,
Nan Scott folded her business last month.
<P>
   Like scores of other diaper service owners before her, the
77-year-old Scott felt she no longer could compete with the
disposable diaper industry giants Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kimberly
Clark Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to hang on, because I knew the cotton diaper was doing
no harm to the babies,'' Scott said, blasting the chemically
treated disposable diapers as potentially hazardous to children's
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got such a mind-set in this country right now of
convenience that it was easy for people to say to themselves,
`Cloth diapers are such trouble, I'm going to use these
(disposable) things.'''
</P>
<P>
   The disposable-diaper firms defend their product as safe, clean,
healthy and convenient, and insist the debate of cloth versus vs.
 &LR; disposable is over. ``These things have played themselves out in
the marketplace,'' said Terry Loftus, a spokesman for Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Disposables now account for at least 95 percent of all diapers
changed in this country, up from roughly 82 percent at the start of
this decade. They constitute a $4 billion market in the United
States and a $17 billion market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Diaper Services, which claimed
nearly 225 members in 1991, has sunk below 50 today, although
association Executive Director John A. Shiffert thinks it has hit
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   That development jolted Arlene Kimata of San Francisco, a
customer of South San Francisco's Dy-Dee Wash and mother of two.
``I was really sad,'' said Kimata, who was subsequently referred to
Tiny Tots of Campbell, one of the Bay Area's few surviving diaper
services. ``I didn't think I was going to be so attached to my
diaper company.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimata, in particular, enjoyed the regular newsletters from
Scott, who mingled parenting tips with rantings against the
disposable-diaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Scott's business served 5,000 customers and had a
workforce of 40 to 50 employees. It served five counties with
trucks featuring musical horns playing ``Rock-a-Bye, Baby'' and
washers that held 800 and 1,000 pounds of dirty diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Dy-Dee Wash got a boost in 1989, when the 20th anniversary of
Earth Day brought a new focus on the environment _ and the
venerable cotton diaper. Parents concerned about overburdened
landfills switched to diaper services.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom only lasted three years. The beginning of the end
came during the 1991 Gulf War, when the nation was riveted to its
 &LR; television sets, and an advertising blitz buried the diaper
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their marketing skills and huge advertising budgets and a
product that people believe to be convenient, they pretty much
ground us into the dirt,'' said Shiffert.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's customers say they can't even understand their fellow
parents' complaints that cloth diapers are too much work. ``It was
never inconvenient for my daughter,'' said Mary Kay McKown of Mill
Valley, a nurse practitioner. ``Everyone said, `You'll have so many
accidents, so many messes.' It never happened. I have had one
`blowout.'''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's decision to close Dy-Dee Wash comes as her peers
brethren  &LR; in the diaper service business pin their hopes on new
technology, a multimillion-dollar effort to develop a cloth diaper
with a computer chip. A Minnesota diaper service is seeking venture
capital funds to market the product.
</P>
<P>
   It represents the first major advance since diaper wraps with
Velcro fasteners supplanted safety pins. The new diaper will be
stitched inside a diaper wrap, eliminating some of the cumbersome
folding and washing that parents must undertake with cloth diapers
and separate wraps.
</P>
<P>
   The chip will enable a service to count the number of dirty
diapers in a bag electronically, instead of manually, as is current
practice. It will be ready by next year, Shiffert said.
</P>
<P>
   But the cloth industry has a long way to go to catch its
competitors who deal in disposables.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Procter &AMP; Gamble _ the maker of Pampers and Luvs
_ is the largest advertiser in the United States, according to
analyst Doug Christopher at Crowell, Weedon &AMP; Co., a Los Angeles
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   And diapers are its single-best-selling product, accounting for
an estimated $5.3 billion of its $38 billion in sales in the last
fiscal year, which ended in June. ``It's very profitable, and they
just keep innovating,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the diaper services are barely hanging on. ``We're
treading water,'' said John O'Kane, president of ABC Diaper Service
in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to washing up to 90,000 dirty diapers a week, O'Kane
is diversifying. ABC already cleans blankets for the Berkeley jail
and is looking to launder sheets and towels from other customers.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, the analyst, pointed out the difficult hurdles for
cloth services.
</P>
<P>
   Many day care centers and preschools won't even accept children
in cloth diapers, believing that they spread germs or are too
difficult to store for presentation to parents at the end of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents simply want nothing to do with the cloth diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing people that got a gift of a diaper service for 60
days, it was like giving somebody the gift from hell,'' Christopher
said. ``You've got to change them every time it gets wet. There's
really no absorbency there.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side in the cloth versus vs.  &LR; disposable-diaper debate
claims that it has the best interest of children at heart and that
babies will get less diaper rash and will toilet train sooner with
their diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said studies in 1957 _ before Pampers' 1961 debut _ showed
that only 7 percent of babies got diaper rash. Now, she pointed
out, the figure approaches 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble has now  &LR; come out with Rash Guard technology
for its Pampers, which O'Kane at ABC dismisses as ``medication to
stop the problem that the diaper itself causes.''
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G spokesman Loftus, however, said the superabsorbent nature &LR; 
of the  &LR; chemicals in the disposable diapers keep babies drier than
cloth diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the wetness of cloth diapers leads the diaper
service industry to argue that children will toilet train faster.
``When you've got a soggy mess between your legs, you notice it,''
said Kimata, one of Scott's former customers. That helps teach
cause and effect, and motivates children to potty train. Kimata's
daughter was out of diapers at age 2.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Price, a spokesman at Kimberly-Clark, said children will
naturally reach an age where they are ready to toilet train.
Kimberly-Clark makes Huggies Pull-Ups training pants, which Price
said facilitate toilet training, but which the diaper service folks
say enables children to stay in diapers into kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   There are also environmental issues. The diaper services have
criticized the disposable diaper industry for creating products
that take up landfill space.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the makers of disposable diapers note that their
diapers are getting slimmer and take up only 1 percent of landfill
space. Meanwhile, they charge that diaper services consume a vast
amount of water to clean their diapers.
</P>
<P>
   The services counter that they recycle as much water as
possible, saving the final rinse water for use again as an initial
washing. And they skewer disposables for a disingenuous argument:
If used as directed, disposable diapers would use far more water.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it's illegal to throw human waste into the
garbage for burial in a landfill, according to O'Kane at ABC Diaper
Service.
</P>
<P>
   To clean and process one day's worth of cloth diapers for a baby
_ roughly 11 diapers _ O'Kane said a diaper service uses the
equivalent of one flush of a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Pampers and Huggies carry instructions to parents saying to
empty the waste from the diaper into the toilet before disposing of
the diaper. If people did that, O'Kane said, that would consume far
more water than his service.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one enforces the law,'' he said. ``If they did, there
wouldn't be disposable diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Loftus at P&AMP;G wouldn't discuss it further. ``I'm not going to
get into the environmental debate again,'' he said. Price at
Kimberly-Clark conceded the point, but said diaper services cause
other environmental harm by using bleach and detergent. The
services say their water is treated in sewage plants.
</P>
<P>
   The diaper services realize they have lost the war. ``If you saw
one disposable diaper commercial on prime time television, that

 _ SF CHRON  
 Government Backs Attack On ATM Law  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The federal government threw its considerable weight behind banks
yesterday in their lawsuit to overturn San Francisco's
just-approved ban on ATM surcharges.
<P>
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the U.S. agency
that regulates national banks, filed a friend-of-the-court brief
that supports the argument that local governments cannot bar ATM
fees levied by nationally chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention highlights a sharp clash between federal bank
regulators and San Francisco over the right of the city to set
rules governing national banks.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars of revenue are at stake. Bank of America and
Wells Fargo collect about $5.5 million a year in ATM surcharges in
San Francisco, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-page filing, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency backed the banks' position that federal law pre-empts
states, cities and counties when it comes to regulating fees
charged by national banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``National banks are free to set the prices for their services,
subject only to the OCC's supervisory authority,'' the agency
argued in its brief. ``National bank fee rate decisions are not
subject to limitation, either directly or by reference to state
law.``
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the intervention gives banks a major boost in
their bid to persuade a judge to block Proposition F, backed by San
Francisco voters Tuesday by a 2-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The brief ``should have considerable weight,'' said Lynne Barr,
a Boston banking lawyer. Courts ``give great deference to bank
regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America, Wells Fargo and the California Bankers
Association filed suit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on
Wednesday morning, asking for an order blocking Proposition F and a
similar Santa Monica law. District Judge Vaughn Walker scheduled an
expedited hearing for November 15.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's surcharge ban is scheduled to start 10 days
after the Board of Supervisors certifies results of Tuesday's
election. The Santa Monica ban takes effect November 11, four days
before the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules in favor of the banks, the surcharge bans
would apply only to a handful of cash machines owned by
state-chartered banks, thrifts and credit unions. The San Francisco
and Santa Monica laws would ban ATM surcharges, one of two fees
consumers typically pay when they withdraw cash from a machine
owned by a financial institution where they do not keep their
money. The ATM surcharge is the fee charged by the ATM owner to
noncustomers.
</P>
<P>
   The other fee, the one charged by a consumer's own bank for
using an outside cash machine, would still be allowed under the new
laws.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the federal agency has stepped in to
defend its authority in the face of attempts by local and state
governments to regulate national banks. The agency filed similar
briefs in court cases challenging ATM fee bans in Iowa and
Connecticut, and has made comparable moves in other cases when
states and localities have passed laws governing national banks.
</P>
<P>
   Although court rulings in the Iowa and Connecticut cases
contained some findings favorable to banks, the cases did not
definitively answer whether states and localities can ban ATM
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, supporters and foes of San Francisco's ATM
surcharge ban expressed sharply different views on the agency's
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased to see the OCC adding its voice to the
discussion,`` said California Bankers Association spokesman John
Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Daniel Bernhard accused
the federal agency of lending itself to a campaign to intimidate
local governments that might try to set tough consumer rules for
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks want every county and city in the land to understand
that if they imitate San Francisco and Santa Monica they will be
severely and immediately punished,'' he said. ``It's difficult not
to see (the federal agency's intervention) as part of a coordinated
program.``
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups charged the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency with acting to protect its own bureaucratic interests.
``This is the latest in a series of power grabs by federal
regulators,'' said Jon Golinger, consumer program director of
California Public Interest Research Group, a co-sponsor of
Proposition F. ``It's a turf war for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's office said it acted based on its reading of
federal banking law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a turf battle. It's a question of what the law is,''
said agency spokesman Robert Garsson. San Francisco ``is reaching
out to displace national bank powers in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the law is murky, with few precedents
providing direct guidance on local attempts to regulate ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   Banks point to federal laws that give U.S. regulators sole
authority over most of the operations of national banks. But
surcharge-ban backers say the law that specifically governs ATMs,
the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, allows states and localities to
set consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency's brief refers extensively to National Bank
Act, the basic statute that governs nationally chartered banks and
sets the authority of federal bank regulators. It does not mention
the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the law San Francisco and Santa
Monica cite as the legal basis for their surcharge bans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Garsson said the
agency does not believe it gives local governments the right to
prevent national banks from levying ATM surcharges.  &LR;

BUSH FINALLY AGREES TO DE BATE, BUT NOT DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of playing the wary front-runner avoiding live
debates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has agreed to take on his GOP
presidential opponents in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's preferred date of Dec. 6 has thrown state GOP
officials into turmoil and sparked complaints from the other
candidates, who had already agreed to hold a debate on Nov. 21 at
Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP chairman Mike Minnaugh called the whole situation a
royal pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, obviously they have all committed _ just at different
times,'' Minnaugh said. ``I feel like they are a bunch of kids in
the corner arguing over their marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) wants to win Arizona, and he cannot win it without
having a debate here,'' said Minnaugh in explaining the concession
from the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   All of the presidential candidates except Bush had already
agreed to attend the Nov. 21 debate. On Friday, Bush said he would
be available only for the Dec. 6 date.
</P>
<P>
   Minnaugh said he has begun to notify the other campaigns of
Bush's interest and that he would not issue formal invitations
until he has Bush's promise in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sudden interest in an Arizona debate drew the scorn of
several other campaigns, including that of Arizona Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain accused Bush of refusing to debate twice
in November in New Hampshire, then agreeing to debate there on Dec.
2 only when it suited his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush ignored their (New Hampshire's) debate invitations
for a long time, but now that the polls are getting closer, a
debate sounds more interesting to them,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said the question of whether McCain will show up for a
Dec. 6 debate is still very much up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Steve Forbes said they would continue to
assume that there is only one debate planned in Arizona _ on Nov.
21.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Alan Keyes also criticized the proposal, saying
the party appeared to be moving ahead with plans for a second
debate without even asking other candidates first if they were
interested.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, said Bush picked Dec. 6
after Minnaugh asked Bush whether he might be able to debate on
some date other than Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Minnaugh confirmed that he floated the idea of another date in a
last-ditch attempt to get Bush to come.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnaugh said he has continued to push Bush to appear for
the Nov. 21 debate.
</P>
<P>
   Minnaugh speculated that the Bush campaign agreed to the Arizona
debate because Bush was getting pressure from Forbes and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys, Forbes and McCain, are not letting him off the
hook,'' Minnaugh said. ``They're rattling his cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur, McCain's spokesman, suggested Bush was playing havoc
with normal debate protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought the way it worked was you got invited to a
debate and then you accepted,'' Schnur said. ``I never knew it
worked in the other direction.'' &QL;

IN BAFFERT VS. LUKAS, A RACE FOR DOMINANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Buoyed by increasingly cooperative weather,
thoroughbred racing was busily gearing up Friday for its annual
rite of revival, the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It will be staged Saturday at Gulfstream Park when 102 horses
from Europe and America compete for championship rank and $13
million in prize money before a crowd of 50,000 spectators and a
worldwide audience that will gamble $70 million to $90 million on
which stars will shine brightest.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 16th Breeders' Cup, and the third to be run at
Gulfstream Park, north of Miami. And three weeks after the
racetrack was inundated by Hurricane Irene, the weather forecasters
were predicting a partly cloudy day with temperatures near 80
degrees and breezes that may further dry the track.
</P>
<P>
   The personal intrigue of the day centers on the two most
accomplished trainers in racing _ D. Wayne Lukas and his rival Bob
Baffert. They will square off in four of the eight races,
principally the Juvenile, which casts its shadow on next year's
Kentucky Derby. Both come loaded to the Breeders' Cup; both will
start two colts in the Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rivalry mainly because we are supposed to be in a
race like this,'' Baffert said Friday morning. ``We have owners
that have money, and they spend it for good horses at the sales.
But we don't get on each other. It's not like we're doing the
running against each other. It comes down to the horses, the owners
and the jockeys, so you can't take all the credit when things are
good. Besides, no matter what records you set, there is always
somebody who will come around and knock you out of your seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas also removed himself from the line of fire. He will saddle
High Yield and Millencolin in the Juvenile, and Baffert will go
with Forest Camp, the morning-line favorite, and Captain Steve.
When Lukas was asked what it would take for his pair to outrun
Baffert's pair, he smiled and replied, ``Just open the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lukas and Baffert are not the only story lines of the
day. There is the richest race of the afternoon, the $4 million
Classic, which is one of six races to draw full fields of 14
horses. The Classic includes the leading candidate for Horse of the
Year, Behrens, the 5-year-old trained by James Bond. The horse has
won four of his eight races this year and finished second in the
four others. Two years ago, he ran seventh behind Skip Away in the
Classic; this year, he is the 3-1 early favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of the European travelers, who went 0
for 28 the two previous times the Breeders' Cup was held at
Gulfstream Park, in 1989 and 1992. The problem seemed to be the
humid weather, but the memory of those failures did not deter the
owners of 24 horses from abroad who were entered this time,
including Stravinsky, Europe's best sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   And there was glamour in the cast: the finest fillies were led
by Chilukki, the undefeated 2-year-old and the shortest
morning-line favorite in any of the eight races, and
Silverbulletday, the great 3-year-old filly who was facing her
sternest test in the Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the honors to be won by the horses, there was the
cast: led by the two superstar trainers, one of whom has been
dominant in the Breeders' Cup in the fall and both of whom have
dominated the Triple Crown in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas holds the record for horses entered in the Breeders' Cup
(126 in 15 years) and races won (13), and he has entered seven
horses this time. Baffert will run eight horses in six races,
including the favorites or near-favorites in the Distaff
(Silverbulletday), the Juvenile Fillies (Chilukki), the Juvenile
(Forest Camp), the Sprint (Forestry) and the Classic (General
Challenge).
</P>
<P>
   No one else will have as many horses running. And the two
trainers will square off from the start, with Lukas sending out A
Lady From Dixie to challenge Silverbulletday in the first Cup race
_ the Distaff. Lukas and Baffert will tangle again in the next
race, the Juvenile Fillies, and then four races later in the
Juvenile, the two races that suggest (but hardly guarantee) good
things in the seasons to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has dominated these races in the past, winning the
Juvenile five times and the Juvenile Fillies three times. Baffert,
a relative newcomer who has challenged Lukas' mastery in the Triple
Crown for the last three years, won the Juvenile Fillies last year
with Silverbulletday. Beyond that, he has just one other Breeders'
Cup victory _ the Sprint in 1992 with Thirty Slews.
</P>
<P>
   ``A race like the Juvenile turns into an East-West thing for
handicappers,'' Lukas said. ``I have seen all the races, and I
think the East is stronger. Same for the Juvenile Fillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the footsteps that Lukas is hearing come from Baffert:
his horses have earned $14.6 million this year, far ahead of Lukas
in second place with $8.3 million and putting him within sight of
the record of $17.8 million set by Lukas in 1988. Baffert can
almost close the remaining gap by winning the Classic, which pays
more than $2 million to the winner. Along with General Challenge,
he has entered River Keen, while Lukas is going with his 3-year-old
warrior Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat that record,'' Baffert said of Lukas' earnings mark,
``we're going to have to win the Classic. But we've had a great
year. Last year, when we reached $15 million, I thought we would
never have a year like that again. It's a great feeling to know
that I'm only a million or two away from my buddy.''

SOUND THE ALERT: HERRON GAINS A SHARE OF THE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spain _ It is dangerous to underestimate Tim
Herron's game.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Herron outplayed Davis Love III and Tom
Lehman during the final round to win the Bay Hill Invitational.
Love and Lehman entered that day with bigger reputations and more
career victories, but Herron left with the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The victory helped him qualify for the American Express
Championship this week. And Friday after the second round of the
tournament, Herron was threatening to capture another prestigious
victory in the tour's season-ending event.
</P>
<P>
   Herron shot a 5-under-par 66, leaving him tied for first place
with Chris Perry at 137, heading into a weekend that will see one
player leave Valderrama Golf Club with a $1 million first-place
check.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were tightly bunched, and the first World Golf
Championships event held outside the United States remained wide
open. Justin Leonard and Vijay Singh, the first-round leader, were
tied for third place at 4 under par (138), one stroke off the lead,
while four players were tied at 3 under par: Lehman, Fred Funk,
Scott Hoch and Mark James.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, trying to become the first tour player to win four
consecutive starts since Ben Hogan in 1953, remained in contention
at 2 under par, after shooting a 69 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Herron, who has three career victories at age 29, believes
he is ready to compete regularly with the game's very best players.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ball striking has gotten better and my putting is better,''
Herron said. ``I have some imagination where I can hit some shots
other guys can't. Today, I knew if I could get the ball in the
fairway, I'd have some chances for birdies. It's one of those
courses where if you're playing well and putting well, you can get
it going. But it can also backfire, because it's a very fine
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron had a solid round with six birdies and one bogey,
avoiding the costly mistakes that hurt others. It was a calm, sunny
day, far different from Thursday's blustery first round, and the
scores reflected the more favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 of the 62 players broke par Thursday. Friday, 28 players
were under par, including Perry, who shot a 67, and Stewart Cink,
who shot the best round of the day (65) and moved to 2 under par
for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Valderrama is never easy. The tree-lined fairways are
narrow, the greens are small and any mistake can lead to a bogey or
worse. Stuart Appleby shot a 66, but he did not mince words when
asked to appraise Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it was very tight, and I have to say it's way too
tight for golf,'' said Appleby, who was even par for the
tournament. ``Too much luck is involved. I have no idea how the
members play it. The greens give you very few spots to land the
ball. We're pros. We do it for a living. The members must have a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods avoided a potential nightmare when he double-bogeyed the
par-3, 225-yard at No. 15, but recovered with birdies at Nos. 16
and 17.
</P>
<P>
   On the double-bogey at No. 15, Woods' 3-iron tee shot sailed far
left of the green, and the ball hit the cart path and rolled down a
hill. There was a television tower between the ball and the green,
so Woods was given a line-of-sight relief drop on his next shot.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting from the cart path, his next shot was too high, and it
clipped a tree and fell into a bunker near the green. With little
green to work with, Woods almost pulled off a miraculous shot, but
his pitch shot from the bunker just caught the rough near the
green, where it stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Woods then hit another nice chip shot within two feet of the
hole. Then he tapped in for double-bogey, falling to even par.
</P>
<P>
   While some players would have been rattled, Woods regrouped,
making an 8-foot birdie putt on No. 16, then using his power and
short game on the par-5, 536-yard No. 17. Woods reached the back
bunker with his second shot, then hit a superb bunker shot that
landed a foot from the hole for a tap-in birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how well Woods has played recently, a 3-stroke
deficit with 36 holes to play hardly seemed intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shape,'' Woods said. ``No doubt, my best round is
still ahead of me.''

MALCOLM MARSHALL, 41, CRICKET PLAYER AND COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malcolm Marshall, who despite his small stature became one of
cricket's greatest fast bowlers, died Thursday at Queen Elizabeth
Hospital in his hometown, Bridgetown, Barbados. He was 41.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was given as colon cancer. He had received the
diagnosis in May during cricket's most important tournament, the
World Cup in England. At the time, he was coaching the West Indies
team, with which he had starred from 1976 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 10 inches, Marshall was much shorter than the
prototypical fast bowler, a position most Americans would liken to
that of a fastball pitcher in baseball. A bowler, however, takes a
running start before bouncing the ball at the batsman in order to
intimidate him or force a weak swing. Marshall, with his
distinctive whippy action, was known for both his extraordinary
pace and wicked bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, born on April 18, 1958, became the sixth most prolific
Test bowler in the sport, getting 376 wickets in 81 Tests, the
formal matches between national teams. Along with other greats like
Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Colin Croft,
Marshall helped make the West Indies team a dominating force in the
sport and a great source of pride to Caribbean residents and those
of Caribbean heritage in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   He was the national team's career leader until Courtney Walsh
surpassed him a year ago. Marshall also claimed 826 wickets _ or
outs _ while playing county cricket for Hampshire in England. He
appeared in his last Test in 1991, against England, and he retired
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is also remembered for the remarkable moment in 1984
when he batted with one only hand; his left was in a cast because
he had broken his thumb that morning. Yet he managed to allow Larry
Gomes, a teammate, to reach the century in runs, a milestone in the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   He played English county cricket for Hampshire, for which he was
the leading wicket-taker in England with 134 in the 1982 season and
topped the national averages in 1986 and 1988. He also played in
South Africa for Natal.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is survived by his wife, Connie Earle, his companion of
13 years whom he married 40 days earlier, and their son, Mali.

   Next Move for Bogle: Boardroom to Classroom &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John C. Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group, has always been fond
of the bully pulpit. His new one is in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle has used books, speeches and the prominence afforded him
as head of Vanguard, the nation's No. 2 mutual fund company, behind
Fidelity Investments, to rail against faddish investments and high
money-management fees that can drain the savings of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bogle has been named the Henry Kaufman visiting professor of
business at New York University's Stern School of Business, a
one-year appointment. He succeeds Paul A. Volcker, the former
Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanguard, Bogle, who relinquished the job of chief executive
in 1996, will step down as senior chairman and board member at the
end of this year, having reached the mandatory retirement age of
70.
</P>
<P>
   The news earlier this year that he was peeved at not being given
the option of staying on the board prompted an investor backlash,
and as a result the directors voted to let him remain. Bogle chose
instead to run a new research center from Vanguard's campus in
Malvern, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle, who has kept up his hectic pace of speechmaking and other
public appearances, will lecture several times a month during the
spring and fall semesters next year. ``When they told me I'd be
following Paul Volcker, what could I say?'' Bogle said.

   Soft Words, Tough Words &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a soft side and a hard side to Richard L. Huber,
Aetna's chief executive, both recently in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The soft side: ``Here we are in probably the most unprecedented
period of prosperity this nation has ever had, and there are still
numerous pockets of poverty,'' he said after serving as a host to
President Clinton in Hartford, where Aetna is based, last Thursday.
The president was there promoting inner-city economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Huber has moved into a gritty neighborhood, fixed up surrounding
buildings and attracted scores of other residents.
</P>
<P>
   The hard side: ``I wonder what Mr. Slugs does when he gets home
and looks at the mirror,'' Huber said in an interview just
published in MCO Executives Online. He pointedly mispronounced the
name of Richard Scruggs, a lawyer working on patients' suits
against Aetna and other managed-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what he does for personal enrichment is to make vital
services and goods more expensive.'' Huber's comment that another
lawyer is a ``skillful ambulance chaser'' prompted a defamation
suit. ``I thought `skillful' was complimentary,'' he said last
Friday. &QL;
</P>

   When J.W. Marriott Jr. &UR; , &LR;  as in Marriott Hotels, recently
received a 1999 Albert Schweitzer Leadership Award at a dinner to
benefit the Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation, he started by saying,
``Thank you for those kind words.'' Which reminded him of an old
story, one touching on his concern with service:
</P>
<P>
   A gentleman at a restaurant for breakfast told his waitress, ``I
would like some fried eggs over easy and a few kind words.'' She
came back with the eggs and started to leave. ``What about those
kind words?'' the man asked. ``Don't eat those eggs,'' the waitress
answered. &QL;

reflected any rancor. ``I don't want you to think this is a
troubled company with people only going out the door,'' he said.
``Nothing could be further from the truth.''

ROBITAILLE OUT WITH BROKEN FOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those who thought the Los Angeles Kings' fast
start was too good to be true, Luc Robitaille usually was the first
to offer a good swift kick. Trouble is that for at least the next
three weeks, Robitaille, the club leader in goals and among the
NHL's top 10 in scoring, will be sidelined with a broken left foot.
</P>
<P>
   The injury comes at a time when the Kings have climbed among the
Western Conference leaders with a high-scoring offense that has
gained spirit from Robitaille's scrappy play around the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (9-3-3) are undefeated in their past six games heading
into tonight's action against the Philadelphia Flyers, who were
6-1-1 in their last eight before Friday night's game at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of tests during a season and injuries are part
of the game,'' second-line forward Donald Audette said. ``I know we
will handle this. We have worked so that things don't get us
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who revitalized his game last season with 39 goals,
including the 500th of his career, started the season with five
goals in five games, the first player to do that since Pittsburgh's
Jaromir Jagr five years ago. He was named NHL Player of the Week
and was tied for the league lead with 10 goals at the time he was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Against the physical Flyers, the Kings will be tested
immediately. Seldom-used rookie Jason Blake, who didn't play during
Wednesday's game in Detroit, will take Robitaille's left-wing spot
on the Kings' first line.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, a center by trade, has just two points this season.
Vladimir Tsyplakov, a member of the first and second units the two
previous seasons, also is expected to get more playing time in
Robitaille's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray was reluctant to break up his second line of
Audette, Glen Murray and Bryan Smolinski, which has added speed and
balance to the Kings offense.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperactive Blake, who often stares down Murray on the bench
hoping to get the call, also is responsible for picking up the
opponent's top defenseman in the Kings' end. He worked out Thursday
with his new linemates Ziggy Palffy and Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous today, but this is what I have been waiting
for,'' Blake said after practice at the Iceoplex. ``I am not taking
Luc's job. I am filling a spot in our system until he gets back. I
am looking forward to the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, 33, learned the news late Thursday, a week after
taking a shot off the foot by Palffy in a game against Pittsburgh
at the Staples Center. X-rays at the time showed no fracture and
Robitaille played all three games of the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the pain became almost unbearable in the final game against
the Red Wings and Robitaille told captain Rob Blake on the flight
home that he might have a problem. An MRI revealed a small fracture
and doctors listed the recovery time as two to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed, but we have worked very hard to get to
where we are and that isn't going to change,'' said Robitaille, who
was wearing a soft cast on his left foot. ``I feel like I could
play, but I know it would not be a good thing. This is something
that has to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fracture, Robitaille is expected back within a month
because of the enormous healing capacity he has shown in his
career. He fractured his right ankle several years ago when playing
for the Rangers and played almost four months with the injury.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a similar foot fracture with the Kings and was
expected out eight to 12 weeks. He was back in six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be fine emotionally,'' Murray said. ``We talk
a lot to the team. We go to the emotional well every day to get
what we need for the next day. Not to demean Luc in any way, but I
think we will get along without him. We don't have any choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, one of college hockey's top players last year at North
Dakota, played one game for the Kings at the end of last season and
scored a goal against St. Louis. He had a great training camp until
getting sidelined by a knee injury. When he returned the lines were
set and playing time was limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a high-energy guy whose speed will give us something we
didn't have as much with Luc,'' Murray said. ``He always wants to
be on the ice and I've had to drive home the idea of playing as a
team. During the game, I'll look down the bench and he'll be
looking at me with those big kid eyes, just wanting to play so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances aren't the way you want them, but now he has
his chance.''

ONLY KICKER WILL ENJOY PSU'S TURF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ For the second and final time this season, the
Cal State Northridge football team is playing a game on artificial
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the spongy surface at Kansas, though, the Matadors can
look forward to aches and pains Sunday morning. The turf at
Portland's Civic Stadium, where the Matadors take on Portland State
tonight at 6:05, is much harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never made an issue of it,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said, ``other than when they get those turf burns. Playing
on wet turf is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it was raining Friday when CSUN had its workout at the
stadium. Rain is forecast for tonight, and the temperature is
supposed to be in the low 40s.
</P>
<P>
   There is one CSUN player who looks forward to a game on turf,
though: kicker Derek Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps the kicking game,'' Kearin said, ``because you get a
lot of lift on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't attempt a field goal at Kansas. He's 8 for 10 on
field-goal attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Up to the task: Some of the Portland State fans tonight will
probably remember Mel Miller, CSUN's starting cornerback who played
two seasons at the University of Washington, just a couple hours'
drive north in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who had a school-record 90-yard interception return
earlier in the season, said he's more motivated for the team to get
a win than his return to the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another game we have to get through,'' said Miller,
a senior. ``It's going to be a tough game. (PSU) is going to go out
there and air it out. I'm just going out there to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Choose your poison: A difficult task for the CSUN defense,
which recovered from a 48-27 loss at Montana on Oct. 9 to bail out
the Matadors in last week's 30-28 win over Weber State, is PSU's
varied offense. It features a running back (Charles Dunn) with
1,307 yards and a quarterback (Jimmy Blanchard) with 2,554 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Vikings) have a really, really explosive running back and
a fine offensive line,'' Kearin said. ``It's daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is sixth in Division I-AA in rushing yards per game and
Blanchard is fourth in the nation in passing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   __ He's pretty good: Marcus Brady, CSUN's starting quarterback
who was hobbled during the week with a sore left ankle, is second
in the nation in total offense, averaging 346.3 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Barring injury, Brady will break his own school record of 256
completions in a season, which he set last year as a redshirt
freshman. Brady enters tonight's game with 231.
</P>
<P>
   __ He's also pretty good: Brady's teammate and roommate,
redshirt freshman receiver Drew Amerson, has a team-leading 59
receptions and 770 yards. He's on pace to become the fifth player
in CSUN history with more than 1,000 receiving yards in a season.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Smiling stiffly, conceding no predatory
behavior whatsoever and insisting that Microsoft's actions had in
fact ``brought tremendous benefits to millions of consumers,'' Bill
Gates defiantly took issue Friday evening with a federal judge's
finding that the company had engaged in monopolistic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   With the company he co-founded in 1975 under siege from the
government, Gates appeared at a news conference at Microsoft
headquarters here barely an hour after Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson issued his finding.
</P>
<P>
   While repeating assertions that Microsoft has always ``wanted
nothing more than to resolve this case,'' Gates yielded no apparent
ground on which a settlement might be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft competes vigorously and fairly,'' Gates said.
``Americans should wish that every business was as competitive as
the personal computer business.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no attempt by any company officials to put a good face
on the judge's findings, which Justice Department officials in
Washington were hailing as a smashing victory for their side and
for consumers across the country and even around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the word throughout the company was that this was
simply a step in a process that is far from being resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to pick a winner, I think, is a dangerous business in
any lawsuit, just like it is in a nine-inning ballgame or a
12-round championship fight,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's
general counsel and the architect of the company's legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with even glancing knowledge of what the judge found
would have the sense, here on the Microsoft campus, that Gates and
other officials were looking at the same situation and seeing it in
almost diametrically opposite terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of our products is completely driven by the
benefits that those products bring,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's response to the findings was part of the prolonged
and sometimes controversial public-relations offensive that the
company has been conducting since the Justice Department started
pursuing an antitrust action.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the ruling would do to the company's stock when it
resumes trading on Monday, Gates smiled and said: ``Microsoft is
not a prognosticator of the stock market _ not up, not down, not
sideways. We're in the business of creating software.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he had spent the past several days in the midst of
one of his so-called ``think weeks,'' in which he typically
retreats to a remote location and contemplates long-term strategy
for improving existing products and developing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman seemed to make a point of saying that that would
remain his main focus. ``What we get excited about is building
great software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's chief operating officer, Bob Herbold, asked whether
the company was developing any contingency plans in case it
ultimately faced drastic judicial remedies such as a forced
breakup, vigorously shook his head no. And he declined to speculate
on any such remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Said Neukom: ``We continue to be fully confident that the law is
favorable to the defense we have organized. We expect that at the
end of the judicial process, Microsoft's position will be fully
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   He also described the company as ``not anti-competitive but
pro-competitive,'' and added: ``Microsoft does not live the
so-called quiet life of a monopolist.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, in a statement to reporters, said: ``This lawsuit is
fundamentally about one question: Can a successful American company
continue to improve its products for the benefit of consumers? That
is precisely what Microsoft did by developing new versions of the
Windows operating system with built-in support for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Allen and I started Microsoft with the simple idea that
technology can improve people's lives,'' he continued. ``Over the
past 25 years, Microsoft has helped create a broad industry of
literally thousands of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has repeatedly defended its actions and did so again
Friday. While government lawyers have portrayed the software maker
as a rapacious monopolist, charging among other things that
Microsoft has bundled its Internet browser to the Windows operating
system as part of a predatory pricing scheme, the company said it
was simply trying to make its products as user-friendly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a central principle in this lawsuit, and we have stood
up for our ability to integrate new functionality, new capability
into our products,'' Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, said Friday.
``We care deeply about our ability to improve our products.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has moved aggressively in advertising and lobbying
blitzes, and even on its Web site, to rebut the government's case.
The home page of the Web site has a description of its ``Freedom to
Innovate Network,'' described as a ``nonpartisan, grass-roots
network of citizens and business who have a stake in the success of
Microsoft and the high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft has been lobbying Congress to enact laws
that could protect the company in some of the very areas in which
it is being sued. In its annual report issued in September, sent to
2 million shareholders, the company's chief operating officer,
Robert Herbold, urged shareholders to join the lobbying effort. The
Web page also urges visitors to contact their congressional
representative.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said recently that more than 100,000 people
have used the Web page to send messages to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's findings amount to another step in what is expected to
be a protracted fight that could wind up before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   For Gates, the battle has taken no small personal toll, as he
has watched his reputation as an innovator and business icon become
sullied by charges that he is a bully and corporate predator, bent
on destroying his competition.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Gates has been fairly restrained, parsing out all the
ways in which he believes the government's case is legally
unwarranted and, in fact, most of the message he has tried to
project was an optimistic one. At a hearing in June before the
Congressional Joint Economic Committee in Washington, he waxed
enthusiastic about the company's role in wireless networks and
electronic commerce, which he said would turn ``consumers into big
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the country's antitrust statutes, he said at the
hearing that ``the laws as they are currently written are fine,''
but he passed up the opportunity to blast the government, only
stating his belief that ``things like integration of new features
are one of the freedoms companies have'' under those laws.
</P>
<P>
   And he has stepped up other activities that have put him in a
favorable public light, including huge philanthropic donations for
scholarships, libraries and international medical assistance and
even an appearance late last year on the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show,''
in which he discussed the intricacies of his then 2 1/2 year-old
daughter's experience with potty training.
</P>
<P>
   In private, friends said, Gates is deeply angry about the
government's antitrust action and has portrayed himself as the
victim of a vendetta by disgruntled competitors who could not keep
up with him and his company.

SEASON'S YOUNG, BUT THE NETS FIND THEMSELVES REELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Toronto's Vince Carter and Kevin Willis
had just simultaneously slam-dunked an offensive rebound, while the
New Jersey Nets nearby remained on the floor as if attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   Having just witnessed this display of dominance, Tracy McGrady,
who two years ago was competing against high school players, jogged
down the court lazily, staring and smiling at the Nets' bench.
Looking like an arrogant playground kingpin whose squad was
crushing a team of wannabes, the 20-year-old McGrady saw no reason
to hold back his gloating and show respect for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   That is how bad it is for the Nets: Three games into their
season, a bench player on a team that has never made the playoffs
is mocking them.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the game in which the Nets finally put it all
together, Friday night's contest turned into the most nightmarish
experience of their harrowing opening week. Under the watchful eye
of George Steinbrenner, the Nets were thoroughly defeated by the
Raptors, 112-92.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Don Casey's club is now 0-3, playing terribly on both ends
of the court and, almost unbelievably, performing at a lower level
than it did during last season's catastrophic 3-17 start. While the
losses to Indiana and Cleveland included a few inspiring moments
for the Nets, there was nothing redeeming about this defeat. Some
of the lowlights follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ In keeping with their custom of starting slowly and playing
porous defense, the Nets allowed 35 points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ With 4 minutes 42 seconds left in the second quarter and
Toronto ahead 53-35, the Continental Arena crowd of 15,517 began
booing the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the third quarter, Charles Oakley, Toronto's lumbering
35-year-old power forward, led a fast break that finished with him
feeding an underhanded alley-oop pass to Carter, who completed the
play with a thunderous two-handed dunk with his chest at rim level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toronto outrebounded the Nets, 52-38, and outshot them, 50.6
percent to 38.2 percent. The Nets had 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, abusing whomever dared guard him, mainly Scott Burrell,
led everyone with 26 points, while Willis, who is 37, added 20 off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   In another freewheeling shooting display, Stephon Marbury led
the Nets with 25 points on 10-of-26 shooting. He had only three
assists, making his season total 11. Lucious Harris followed with
19 points, and Keith Van Horn added 16.
</P>
<P>
   Having entered the season with great expectations, the Nets came
into Friday night's game with a growing sense of desperation. ``We
have to stop this skid,'' Casey said beforehand. ``Games at the
beginning of the season are not critical, but they're important.''
</P>
<P>
   It was important for the Nets, who had been victimized by their
one-dimensional offense in their first two games, to get someone
besides Marbury cruising offensively. But at the outset, the point
guard was the only Net who could find the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing by Alvin Williams with incredible ease, Marbury scored
the Nets' first three baskets, two of them on driving layups, while
his teammates missed six jump shots. Van Horn, who missed his first
three shots, finally got on track midway through the quarter,
scoring on a pair of free throws, two jumpers and a resounding dunk
off an offensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury and Van Horn, who accounted for the Nets' first 16
points, finally got some help when Harris replaced Kendall Gill,
who had missed three jumpers in the first seven minutes. Harris hit
three shots, one a 3-pointer, to provide some semblance of balance.
With the trio combining to score 25, the Nets put an admirable 29
points on the board after one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But with their defense giving up open shots outside and being
overpowered inside, they allowed Toronto to score 35. Carter had
his way with Burrell, scoring 10 points in a variety of ways, and
Doug Christie, who made six 3-pointers in Thursday's upset of
Miami, was even more lethal, hitting two 3-pointers in scoring 12
in the first 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a near replay of the debacle in Cleveland, the Raptors also
scored on numerous fast breaks. Once, Christie scored a layup seven
seconds after Marbury made a 22-footer.
</P>
<P>
   It grew worse in the second quarter, as Raptors of all sizes,
ages and abilities enjoyed offensive prosperity.

ALBANY STUDIES IMPACT OF RULING RESTORING THOUSANDS OF BIAS CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The administration of Gov. George Pataki is
wrestling with the impact of a recent federal court ruling
requiring the state to reinstate thousands of discrimination
complaints, even as it already faces an enormous backlog of such
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert L. Carter of U.S. Court in Manhattan ruled on Oct.
27 that the state had improperly dismissed more than 5,000
complaints of racial, sexual and other bias. The judge also
required the state to take on an additional 2,400 cases that
officials had improperly refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes as the state's Division of Human Rights, the
main agency charged with investigating discrimination complaints,
is struggling with a backlog of more than 10,000 complaints, many
of them dating to the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision stems from a 1994 lawsuit filed by the state
chapter of the National Organization for Women over the agency's
handling of cases. The lawsuit contends the backlog of cases is so
enormous that it has left the division in disarray and has caused
cases to drag on for an average of seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Carter also ordered the Pataki administration to
hire additional staff members to clear the backlog, calling it
unreasonable and saying the cases should not drag on as long as
they have. He also ruled that the state should be settling cases in
24 to 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration would not comment on the ruling,
saying it was a matter of litigation and could still be appealed.
But state officials noted that they had inherited the backlog from
the administration of Gov. Mario Cuomo, and that they had taken
steps, albeit controversial ones, to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that we inherited a tremendous backlog from
the previous administration,'' said Denise Ellison, a spokeswoman
for the Division of Human Rights. ``But instead of letting it
languish for 12 years like the previous administration, we took
active measures to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Human Rights was established in the mid-1960s to
investigate discrimination complaints filed against employers,
government agencies, banks, unions, real estate brokers and others.
But the agency soon became overwhelmed by complaints and faced a
16,000-case backlog by 1995, the year Cuomo left office.
</P>
<P>
   The caseload dropped to 10,000 under the Pataki administration.
But the policies the agency has undertaken under Pataki have
themselves been the focus of fierce criticism and in part led to
Carter's recent ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, for example, the agency did away with a longstanding
policy that required the agency to investigate every complaint it
received, regardless of whether it seemed frivolous or whether it
fell under the state's jurisdiction, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellison said the change allowed the agency to focus on
legitimate claims, instead of devoting its attention on ones that
were not worth pursuing. ``We did that to unclutter the process,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including the plaintiffs in the case, said the
change led the state to reject thousands of legitimate complaints
and thereby deprived New Yorkers of the opportunity to take legal
action against, say, a discriminatory employer. In the end, Carter
agreed with them and used their arguments as part of the basis for
his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   David Raff, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the
number of complaints the state received under the new policy
dropped to 3,400 a year from an average of about 5,800 annually in
the 10 years before the change. He said the figures left no doubt
that the state was denying people the opportunity to have a fair
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfortunate that New York state, which has one of
the best human rights laws on the books, feels it necessary to turn
away people with legitimate claims instead of providing sufficient
staff to properly investigate those claims.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the judge also sided with the plaintiffs' contention
that another agency policy was depriving people of the opportunity
to pursue their discrimination claims once they were filed.
</P>
<P>
   That policy, which was enacted under Cuomo, required people to
respond to a letter or phone call from the agency alerting them
that their case was being actively reviewed. If they did not
respond, the agency could dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the policy was absurd, given that the agency
did not get around to responding to complaints until years after
they had been filed. As a result, the critics said, people had
often moved and never got phone calls or letters sent out by the
agency in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, the plaintiffs in the case said, was for the state
to hire more people to deal with the mounting caseload. Currently,
the agency employs 180 full-time staffers including lawyers and
investigators as well as eight administrative judges to hear cases.
For starters, the critics say, the state should have 25 to 30
judges reviewing the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Pataki has been in office for five years but the only
effort that was made to reduce backlogs was to turn people away
from filing complaints,'' said Raff, the lawyer for the plaintiffs.
``The real solution is to hire more staff.''

MAYOR-ELECT IS GAY, BUT IT WAS NO ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The winning platform was what you might expect from a man eager
to be mayor of Plattsburgh, a small, once industrial border town
upstate: more police officers, after-school programs, and a plan to
revitalize the economy by drawing tourists to the town's War of
1812 battle sites. (A diorama of the war, he likes to point out, is
inside City Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, that platform helped Daniel Stewart, a
Republican, narrowly defeat Plattsburgh's five-term mayor, Clyde
Rabideau.
</P>
<P>
   And it made Stewart, 37, a former Air Force sergeant and
tractor-trailer driver who now works as a financial clerk at a
local car dealership, the first openly gay person to be elected
mayor in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who described himself as having been ``in the closet''
during his eight years of service in the Air Force, had served on
the Plattsburgh City Council since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the mayor's race, he said,
was that his sexual orientation did not come up for discussion.
``The mayor never used anything about that; I never mentioned
anything about that,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did concerns of special interest to gays, like
nondiscrimination statutes or domestic partnership benefits, enter
the race. (Plattsburgh, population 20,000, has a nondiscrimination
law but not partnership benefits.) Gay political organizers saw the
lack of gay themes as a cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``One great thing about this race was that sexual orientation
was not an issue,'' said Matt Foreman, executive director of Empire
State Pride Agenda, a lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stewart pledged to hire more police officers in
Plattsburgh, where, he said, crime had increased in the last two
years, bucking a national trend. He also pledged to attract more
tourists to the town, which was home to an Air Force base until
1995, by playing up its historical attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also vowed to increase financing for youth programs and
to lure companies that could take advantage of Plattsburgh's
electricity rates _ the cheapest in the country, he said _ and
abundant water.
</P>
<P>
   He was endorsed by the town's police union and by Gov. George
Pataki. According to unofficial results from the Clinton County
clerk's office, Stewart won by 68 votes. About 100 absentee ballots
have yet to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Gay political organizers hailed Stewart's victory as evidence of
an increasingly level political playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it the first ever of its kind in New York state,
but it happened in a small middle-America type of city way
upstate,'' said Sloan C. Wiesen, a spokesman for the Gay and
Lesbian Victory Fund, a Washington-based group that supports gay
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's races, nine lesbians and gay men _ a record
number _ ran for office across New York, most notably in rural and
suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, Jonathan Cooper, a Democrat, was elected to the
Suffolk County Legislature. Two incumbents, a New York City
councilwoman, Christine Quinn, and a Nyack village trustee, John
Shields, also Democrats, held on to their seats. Several gay
candidates lost, including Judy Green, a Democratic mayoral
candidate in Poughkeepsie; Mary Mendola, who ran for the Ulster
County Legislature; and Brian Cafferty, who ran for supervisor of
Rosendale, a Catskills town of river bridges and antiques shops.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Cooper and Stewart brought the statewide total
of gay elected officials to 27, including six elected school board
members in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In Plattsburgh, Stewart faced an opponent known for positions
favored by gays on issues like domestic partnership benefits and
same-sex marriage. Rabideau had long enjoyed the support of the
state's major gay lobbying group, Empire State. This year, Stewart
got its endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The group has sought out Republicans to press its agenda within
the state Republican Party.

PEEKSKILL ARTISTS' PROTEST SPAWNS A POLITICAL REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEEKSKILL, N.Y. _ For nearly 10 years, the all-Republican City
Council here tried to spark a downtown renaissance by luring
artists to settle in the large empty storefronts along its once
busy main streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the renaissance suddenly turned into a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, a few artists and activists stirred up trouble at
City Council meetings. They videotaped their antics at the meetings
and broadcast them on local public access television. The city
retaliated, first by restricting their time to speak, then by
having them arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Council's approach might not have been the smoothest way to
revitalize the town. But it did have the unintended effect of
reinvigorating the city's politics.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a group of renegade Republicans was swept into
office in an election crowded with candidates. The dissident
Republican candidate for mayor, John J. Kelly III, won with 50
percent of the vote. Eileen R. Yajure, a Democrat, followed with 38
percent, a surprising showing for a party that couldn't even field
a candidate in other years. Councilwoman Catherine E. Pisani, an
incumbent who in a normal election season would have had an edge in
her bid for mayor, trailed with only 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we received a mandate from the voters,'' Kelly, 42,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a change.''
</P>
<P>
   After the spring turmoil, the incumbent mayor, Frances Gibbs,
decided not to seek re-election. Three of the four City Council
incumbents whose terms were expiring lost in the primaries and were
forced to run as independents. And a dissident faction, led by
Kelly, seized control of the city's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   More surprisingly, for the first time since Gov. George Pataki
was elected mayor of this riverfront city in 1982 and started an
all-Republican streak, the Democrats thought they had a chance to
stage a coup.
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't won an election in so long that they had all but
given up trying. This year was the first time in 14 years the
Democrats ran a full slate of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were quite unhappy at seeing the Council have people
arrested just for speaking out of order,'' said Lawrence W.
Grunberger, 56, chairman of the city's Democratic committee.
``Discontent boiled over. The level of political interest was
unusually high this year as a consequence. We didn't win, but next
time I think we'll have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have the artists to thank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't shut us up, so they had us arrested,'' said
Valerie Courreges, 38, a multimedia artist who likes to boast that
she used rancid meat as a medium long before it was fashionable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commotion began when a small group of artists and activists
who called themselves the Coalition for Creative Solutions objected
to the city's plan to install surveillance cameras at certain
downtown intersections to combat crime, saying it smacked of
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Their objections were loud, persistent and impolite. They were
broadcast repeatedly, with a hefty dose of editorial comment thrown
in, on local television. The seven Council members decided enough
was enough.
</P>
<P>
   They instituted a rule prohibiting the public from speaking at
the beginning of meetings. Under the rule, each person could speak
for three minutes only at the end of meetings, which often
stretched until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The artists and their supporters decided to challenge the rule
and get themselves arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time they didn't realize what I was doing, and I had
to talk for 45 minutes, and they still didn't arrest me,'' said
Georgia Svolos, 60, a sculptor who moved to town five years ago
after a lifetime of political activity on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The next time, she got what she wanted. In all, six people were
arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Two, Ms. Courreges
and Nick Mottern, a carpenter who opened a natural food co-op and a
performance space in the artists' district, decided to go to jail
rather than ``participate in an economy that prevents free
speech,'' as Ms. Courreges said. Three others paid fines of $250
per violation. One has yet to come to trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the politicians are stung by the acts of a few freethinkers,
it hasn't changed their commitment to using art as a medium for a
downtown revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, when they began running ads in the Village Voice,
the city leaders have recruited about 80 artists to Peekskill. The
city's planning consultant, Ralph DiBart, worked with its downtown
landlords to make it easy for them to renovate their storefronts
with low cost loans, into lofts suitable for living and working in.
Then he worked as a matchmaker introducing interested artists to
interested landlords.
</P>
<P>
   The city's leaders have just begun a new campaign to invite more
artists to town. In September, construction began on a $5.7 million
project called ArtLofts. It will include 48 state-subsidized lofts
built for artists only (though the definition is broad and ranges
from fine artists to computer entrepreneurs). The one- and
two-bedroom lofts, each with a work area set off from living space,
offer a financial incentive for moving to Peekskill, a city of
21,000 people about an hour north of midtown Manhattan. The lofts
cost from $89,000 to $138,000 and carry tax breaks for fifteen
years.
</P>
<P>
   The artists were drawn to Peekskill by the idea of an arts
community that was created by the very government officials they
gleefully helped bring down, but the arrested artists don't feel
they've bitten a welcoming hand.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that ``artist only'' zoning invites gentrification
and say that city policies favor a middle-class elite, while
ignoring the needs of the town's largely poor African-American
residents. The group saw the surveillance camera issue as an
indication that the government would rather police the
African-American community than offer the residents the kinds of
opportunities it was creating for outside artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have known that this grand artist scheme was to
create a layer on top of the African-American community that was
already living here, I wouldn't have participated,'' Mottern said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the surveillance cameras that started the fuss, the newly
elected Kelly said he was in favor of installing some. But he said
the speaking restriction at the City Council meetings would go.

WALTER SKEES, 64, CHIEF VOCALIST FOR THE ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., R.I., Va.)  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Francis Skees, who as the U.S. Army's chief vocalist sang
for seven presidents and millions of people around the world, died
Oct. 23 at his home in Carmel, Calif. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Patricia, said.
</P>
<P>
   Skees, who was with the Army Band from 1955 to 1983 and retired
with the rank of sergeant major, sang for Presidents Eisenhower,
Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan. He also performed
for Harry S. Truman after he left office and for George Bush when
he was vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a resonant baritone voice to a repertory that varied
with the audience and atmosphere, and enjoyed a job that gave him
one of the longest careers of any top big-band vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   He sang patriotic songs to 1.4 million people on the Washington
Mall during the nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, played
Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall and appeared on television
with Bob Hope, Steve Allen and Merv Griffin. In addition to
carrying out his duties with the main Army Band, he sang with an
18-piece jazz band called The Army Blues.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague in the band, Sgt. Maj. Bob Smith, said Skees was
``comfortable in all settings,'' from the halls of Congress to the
State Department to nightclubs in Aruba. Smith said his Sinatra
repertory was particularly polished. ``He was an absolute
consummate entertainer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was following in famous footsteps. Others who held the job as
top Army vocalist included Eddie Fisher and Steve Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   One fan was President Nixon, who would often ask Skees to
perform for guests on the presidential yacht, his wife said.
``After the guests left, Nixon liked to play the piano,'' she said.
``Nixon would play and Walter would sing until 3 or 4 in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Some others were less admiring, among them a Washington Post
reviewer, Octavio Roca, who suggested after a concert on the Mall
in 1980 that Skees had made ``easy listening'' something less than
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Skees was born in Providence, R.I., and began singing at age 7
on radio stations there. After graduating from high school he sang
in nightclubs in Europe until he was drafted by the Army in 1955.
He was named top vocalist the next year. Though the Marine Band is
considered the president's official band, the bands of other
branches of the military services are invited to play at the White
House for occasions like Christmas-tree lightings.
</P>
<P>
   Skees sang in 38 countries, appeared at Radio City 224 times and
recorded three albums, including ``A Little Tenderness,'' with the
jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd. After he retired, he was a cruise
director for the Holland America line.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by five children from an
earlier marriage. They are Walter Skees Jr. of San Francisco;
Melanie Harrison of Fairfax Station, Va.; Laurie Kightlinger of
Purcellville, Va., Christopher Skees of Campbell, Calif., and Kelly
Katz of Elk Grove, Calif. He is also survived by three
stepchildren, Sherry O'Donnell of San Francisco; Mark Balestra of
Atherton, Calif., and Katie Walter of Tiburon, Calif., and 13
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Skees said her husband never envied the success of Fisher
and Lawrence, who left the Army for greener pastures. ``His career
in its own way was a very special thing,'' she said.

JOHN W. EVANS, 90, FIRST HEAD OF SOLAR OBSERVATORY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John W. Evans, an astrophysicist who was the first director of
the National Solar Observatory, in Sunspot, N.M., and his wife,
Betty, died on Sunday at their home in a suburb of Santa Fe, N.M.,
in what the local police described as an apparent murder-suicide.
Evans was 90 and his wife was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Evans used a revolver to kill his wife and then himself, leaving
a note saying they did not wish to become a burden on their
children, said Nancy Evans, their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The note also said they wanted to leave while they were
gloriously happy,'' Ms. Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, after a distinguished academic career, Evans was
appointed the founding director of the Sunspot observatory, then
the Air Force's Sacramento Peak Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   It cost about $100 million to build and remains the only
nationally supported solar observatory in the United States. The
observatory is now financed chiefly by the National Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Evans retired in 1974 but continued to work at the observatory,
designing, building, testing and operating new instruments to study
the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   John Wainwright Evans was born in New York City on May 14, 1909.
He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Swarthmore
College in 1932 and a master's degree and a doctorate in astronomy
from Harvard in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   He taught astronomy at Mills College in Oakland, Calif., at the
University of Minnesota and at the University of Rochester before
taking the post in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Besides their daughter Nancy, of Santa Fe, Dr. and Mrs. Evans
are survived by another daughter, Jeanne Regentin of Harbor
Springs, Mich., and a son, Wayne, of San Carlos, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Evans chose the name Sunspot for the community where the
observatory was established.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked everyone to make suggestions and said the name would
be determined by a vote,'' said a former colleague, George Simon.
``But he preferred Sunspot and we always thought the election was
rigged.''

 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding
victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory
that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to
the simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General
Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had
agreed with the government. ``This case is about the protection of
innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the
products they want,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the
antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for
the government on virtually every important point.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors
during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always
interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial. I think
this case was about the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead
lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most
highly regarded litigators in the country. At first, Boies shied
away from the microphone. ``I had my shot in the courtroom,'' Boies
said, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general for Connecticut who
worked closely with the Justice Department, encouraged Boies to say
something. ``You're the man,'' Blumenthal said. ``Go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less
to do with strategy and more to do with facts. ``In some senses,
this is not a surprise,'' he said. ``In a lot of ways, this is
exactly what the evidence showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision,
Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is
above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft,
asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was
furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal
e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly
determined to remain a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to
D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications. ``Today, we
have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to
break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry. But Klein
deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to
another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the
nationwide telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each market and each case presents its own facts,'' Klein
said. While he did not say so, the case against the telephone
system was played out about two decades ago, when personal
computers were a novelty and virtually no one had heard of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on what kind of remedies the government might now
pursue, and whether it might go so far as to actually break up
Microsoft, Klein said it was far too early to dismiss any remedies.
Whatever they are, he said, he hopes Friday's finding will deter
other monopoly-minded companies.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal called antitrust law ``the Magna Carta of consumer
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wager that these findings of fact will be used in law
school classes around the country to demonstrate what happens when
the antitrust laws are flagrantly violated,'' Mr. Blumenthal added.
</P>
<P>
   Klein saw another reason to hold up the Microsoft case as an
example. Only about a year and a half elapsed from the start of the
case to today's decision _lightning speed for such a complex case,
by the usual standards of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Several state attorneys general whose offices assisted in the
case expressed elation at the ruling. ``The opinion is really a
clean sweep for the perspective we presented at trial,'' said
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Tom Miller of Iowa said he was glad the judge
had zeroed in on what he called Microsoft's ruthless discouraging
of innovation in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general of California, Bill Lockyer, said he
expected the decision to ``unleash powerful engines of innovation
and consumer benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``California is so impacted by the colossus of Microsoft, and so
many businesses were impacted and felt that their competitive
opportunities were smothered,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley is cautiously cheering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was good reason for his use of ``cautiously.'' Appeals lie
ahead. Microsoft is a powerful adversary with deep pockets _ not as
deep as the government's, but deep enough to wage a long fight, if
it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft did not get to be Microsoft by shrinking from the
battlefield.

ROBERT LINN, 74, COMPOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lh) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Linn, a composer who was best known for his chamber and
orchestral works for wind instruments, died Oct. 28 at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 74 and lived in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said James Lytle, a spokesman for the
Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California,
where Linn was professor emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Linn was born in San Francisco in 1925. He studied composition
with Darius Milhaud at Mills College and with Roger Sessions,
Halsey Stevens and Ingolf Dahl at the University of Southern
California, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1951 and a
master's degree in 1952. He joined the faculty of the university's
Thornton School of Music in 1957 and was the chairman of the music
theory and composition department from 1973 until he retired in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Linn was drawn to the timbres and technical capabilities of wind
and brass instruments and wrote prolifically for them. Among his
earliest published works were a Clarinet Sonata (1949) and Five
Pieces for Flute and Clarinet (1950). In addition to several solo
works, duets, trios and concertos for clarinets, oboes, bassoons
and saxophones, he wrote a quartet for French horns (1957), a Brass
Quintet (1963) and a Woodwind Quintet (1964) and such peculiarly
scored works as ``Trompe l'Oeil'' (1978) for bass trombone and
piano, ``Diversions'' for six bassoons and ``Trombosis'' for 12
trombones (both in 1979).
</P>
<P>
   Also among Linn's compositions, which were admired for their
lyricism, were two sonatas and several groups of etudes for piano;
two string quartets, a score for a 1952 educational film, ``The
Storytellers of `The Canterbury Tales''' and several choral works,
including ``Three Madrigals'' on texts by James Joyce (1951),
``Songs of William Blake'' (1982) and a ``Cantata Jovialis'' (1997)
for voices, string quartet and harpsichord. His orchestral works
include an Overture for Symphony Orchestra (1952), a Symphony
(1956-61), a setting of ``The Pied Piper of Hamelin'' (1968) for
tenor, narrator and strings, a Fantasia for Cello and String
Orchestra (1976) and a Piano Concerto (1990). He also completed an
orchestral reconstruction of Franz Liszt's ``Hexameron'' in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia; a daughter, Stacy Linn of
Orange, Calif., and two sons, Robert, of Oceanside, Calif., and
Roger, of San Francisco.

CSUN'S BRASH MOORE OOZES CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ When he gets into his crouch and looks the wide
receiver in the eye, Chazz Moore starts to wiggle his knees back
and forth, like he's trying to do the hula with his ankles tied
together.
</P>
<P>
   It's a technique used in football by most cornerbacks just prior
to the snap of the ball; it's similar to what a baseball infielder
looks like just before a pitch. But Moore seems to put a little
more pizazz into it, to show an air of confidence bordering on
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   That's the edge Moore seeks. A senior at Cal State Northridge,
he's 6-foot-3, 210 pounds and not supposed to be playing
cornerback. Hardly anyone in college football his size chooses to
play there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the hardest position on the field, besides
quarterback, is cornerback,'' Moore said. ``There's a lot of
responsibility. You have to have confidence in yourself. It takes a
lot of practice, it takes a lot of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has the charisma. An all-city player at Portland's
Jefferson High four years ago, Moore guaranteed a victory tonight
when CSUN plays Portland State in the Matadors' most important game
of the season. He made the prediction to a reporter from the
Portland Oregonian, no less, and Moore's hometown newspaper carried
the guarantee in a headline Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Moore didn't regret making the fated statement:
``We are definitely going to beat Portland State.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guaranteed the win, not only with confidence, but something
has been telling me (that) ever since I came here and I saw I had a
game in Portland,'' Moore said. ``I am working hard every day to
achieve my goal and do what I'm trying to do as far as my
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm this close and people are taking notice of it,
especially in my hometown, I definitely think it was fate,'' he
said. ``This was my mission, this was my role, it was my destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore says all this knowing he is lining up to face one of the
best quarterbacks in the Big Sky Conference _ Vikings junior Jimmy
Blanchard, who hasn't thrown an interception in eight weeks. And
PSU has two of the best receivers in the Big Sky in Terry Charles
and Orshawante Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Moore hasn't exactly been a pain in the neck for opponents. He
has only three interceptions in two seasons at CSUN, including one
this year. He is seventh on the team in tackles, though, with 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensive backs are a strange breed,'' said CSUN defensive
coordinator Foster Andersen, who previously coached the Matadors'
secondary. ``They are so visible out there, they have to have a
certain amount of cockiness to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore certainly believes that. He is the biggest trash-talker on
the team and his tendency to be aggressive in practice used to rub
many players the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get in my opponent's ear, I like to get in his
mind,'' Moore said, ``I like the psychological warfare. When I
first came here . . . there were a lot of incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Miller, CSUN's other starting cornerback, said being
arrogant is just part of Moore's way of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a corner, you have to have that cockiness,'' Miller said.
``You have to be physical to play corner. As far as I'm concerned,
(I have) no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several coaches and players, though, noticed a kinder, gentler
Moore when fall practice began. He still yells at the receivers,
just not as frequently or as loudly as last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get better every day in practice,'' he
said.

KEIZO SAJI, 80, HEADED BEVERAGE CONGLOMERATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan)  (lh) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keizo Saji, the chairman of Suntory Ltd., one of the world's
largest alcoholic beverage companies, died Wednesday at a hospital
in Osaka, Japan. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was pneumonia, according to a report in The
Asahi Evening News.
</P>
<P>
   Saji, as president of Suntory for 29 years, was instrumental in
changing Japan's drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   As a young executive at Suntory, which was then called
Kotobukiya, in postwar Japan, Saji began selling an inexpensive
whiskey called Torys that became immensely popular with the
emerging nation of salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also became well known in advertising circles
through what was then considered its relentless marketing
techniques, especially its catchy slogans and flashy ads.
</P>
<P>
   Saji is also widely credited with helping establish Japan's
Nihonbashi culture, the culinary concept of drinking whiskey with
foods that need chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   The second of three sons of the founder of Suntory, Shinjiro
Torii, Saji was born Nov. 1, 1919, in Osaka and was graduated from
the department of science at Osaka University. In 1945, he joined
Suntory, which is also based in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar years, Suntory benefited greatly from the thirst
of the occupying U.S. military forces, who preferred whiskey and
beer to sake. Suntory _ the name is a corruption of san, a Japanese
word for three, and Torii, Saji's father's name _ continued to grow
long after the occupation ended, however.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the company, now 100 years old, had become a
global multibillion-dollar conglomerate with interests in
restaurants, taverns, bottled water companies, golf resorts,
vineyards, movie studios and baseball teams as well as alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   And Saji had become the 48th-richest person in the world, with
an estimated net worth of $6.7 billion, according to Forbes
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Saji, whose survivors were not immediately known, was something
of a Renaissance man, too. He wrote books about wine, established
the Suntory Museum of Art in Tokyo and was an ardent gourmet and
golfer. Like many wealthy executives, he was also a philanthropist
of note.
</P>
<P>
   As a manager, Saji was regarded as temperamental as well as
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Once, an investment banker found a wine company ripe for
acquisition. The deal had been approved by everyone at Suntory,
including Saji. On the day the papers were to be signed, the
sellers and the Suntory executives gathered and waited for Saji to
appear. He never did. He never explained why. The deal died.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes Saji would put executives through a Zen-like
ordeal of the five whys.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a meeting someone will suggest something,'' Saji said in an
interview in Fortune magazine in 1984. ``I ask, `Why?' I want more
detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will answer, and then I ask, `Why?''' Saji said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask `why' five times,'' he said. ``And then I stop.''

JUDGE CALLS MICROSOFT MONOPOLY THAT HAS HARMED CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft Corp. has monopoly power and has
harmed consumers by its conduct, a federal judge declared Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His 207-page findings of fact represent just the first phase of
a several-step process by which the judge is evaluating charges
leveled against Microsoft by the federal government and multiple
states. But the findings were as bad as could be for Microsoft,
condemning the company's behavior in harsh language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel and
others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products,'' wrote Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and
businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft,'' he
said. ``The ultimate result is that some innovations that would
truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason that they
do not coincide with Microsoft's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft expressed confidence that it would eventually prevail.
In a previous legal proceeding, Microsoft was rebuked by this same
judge but won on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should wish that every business was as competitive
as the personal computer business,'' said Microsoft Chairman and
Chief Executive Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Having issued his interpretation of the facts of the case,
Jackson now plans to tackle the question of whether those facts
constitute violations of the law. He has asked the government and
Microsoft to file a new set of legal briefs addressing that
question.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the judge issues his conclusions of law will he
consider how to punish Microsoft, if at all, in a separate legal
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The judge could consider anything from requiring Microsoft to
make changes in its marketing or licensing procedures to breaking
up the company.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the decision on a Friday night, Jackson maximized
the amount of time stock traders would have to digest it before
markets reopen Monday. Microsoft's stock, which had declined only
19 cents to $91.56 in daytime trading, fell as much as $4.81 more
in after hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh findings could increase the likelihood that Microsoft
will consider a settlement of the case. Both Gates and Justice
Department Antitrust Chief Joel Klein said they are open to
settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which can not be appealed, could become fodder for
companies suing Microsoft in private antitrust cases. In
particular, the judge's finding that Microsoft has monopoly power
is potentially troublesome for the company, because it means the
company is held to a high standard of conduct under the nation's
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell if it will be a steady stream, a tidal wave
or a torrent, but past experience suggests there will be cases
filed,'' said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which has been battling Microsoft largely
without success since 1991, was exultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge found what the department (of justice) charged, and
what we produced mountains of evidence to demonstrate at trial,
which is that Microsoft is a monopolist and is engaged in massive
anti-competitive practices that harmed innovation and limited
consumer choice,'' said Klein. ``This is truly an important victory
for America's consumers and the American economy. It shows once
again that in America, no person and no company, is above the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's general counsel, William Neukom, warned against
overinterpreting the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to pick a winner now is like trying to judge the end of
a baseball game in the third inning,'' he said. ``At the end of the
legal proceedings, we expect our position to be fully vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the company's chief defender in Congress, Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., said the ruling is a blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no disguising the fact that this is a great triumph
for the lawyers in the Department of Justice, but in my view it is
large a defeat for American consumers as it is for Microsoft,''
Gorton said. ``The judge's decision is almost entirely in favor of
the government's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Business groups, as well as Microsoft's supporters in Congress,
were troubled by the ruling, which they say paves the way for
government interference in a successful industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No high-tech company should cheer these findings because they
could easily become the next target of government's mad rush to
regulate our most promising industry,'' said Bruce Josten,
executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Once
again we are seeing the unlimited arsenal of government used
against a successful company. Every high-tech executive in America
should be asking, `Am I next?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's defenders responded in force. Gov. Gary Locke said
``we strongly disagree with the judge's findings.'' Rep. Jennifer
Dunn, R-Wash., proclaimed herself ``fearful of government efforts
to overregulate this dynamic and competitive industry,'' while Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said ``after today's announcement, I wonder
whether Congress should reconsider our antiquated antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings of fact follow an eight-month trial in which
Microsoft was embarrassed by the eccentric and forgetful
performance given by Gates in videotaped depositions and by a
string of e-mails in which company executives spoke of their
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   To come to the conclusion that ``Microsoft enjoys monopoly
power'' over the market for operating systems for personal
computers using Intel chips, Jackson cited three factors: the size
of market share held by Microsoft Windows, estimated at 95 percent;
the difficulty a competitor would have in promoting an alternative
operating system; and the lack of a commercially viable alternative
to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The judge cited a variety of examples in reaching the conclusion
that ``it is Microsoft's corporate practice to pressure other firms
to halt software development that either shows the potential to
weaken the applications barrier to entry or competes directly with
Microsoft's most cherished software products.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft tried to persuade the Netscape Communications
Corp. not to make an Internet browser that would run with Windows,
tried to convince Intel not to develop some software, tried to
persuade Apple to stop producing a Windows 95 version of its
Quicktime multimedia playback software, tried to weaken
RealNetworks' hold on the streaming video and audio business, and
discriminated against IBM by pressuring it to stop supporting
software that competed with Microsoft and then punished IBM with
high rates when the company refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the judge did not assert that any of those hardball
tactics violate the law _ that's the next step _ he did say that
``Microsoft's interactions with Netscape, IBM, Intel, Apple, and
RealNetworks all reveal Microsoft's business strategy of directing
its monopoly power toward inducing other companies to abandon
projects that threaten Microsoft and toward punishing those
companies that resist.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the government's initial case was the allegation
that Microsoft used a monopoly in operating systems illegally to
try to gain share in the market for browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson found that Microsoft executives, having failed to stop
Netscape's manufacture of a browser, became ``engrossed with
maximizing Internet Explorer's share of browser usage.'' He noted
the company gave away its browser for free with Windows, then
restricted Netscape's access to key distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson rejected Microsoft's contention that its browser is
simply a function of its operating system, and not a standalone
product. ``The preferences of consumers and the responsive behavior
of software firms demonstrate that Web browsers and operating
systems are separate products,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson said consumers have been harmed by being forced to
accept Microsoft's browser, because Windows became inhospitable to
other browsers and more likely to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson found that Microsoft's tactics were effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In late 1995 and early 1996, Navigator seemed well on its way
to becoming the standard software for browsing the Web,'' he wrote.
``Within three years, however, Microsoft had successfully denied
Navigator that status, and had thereby forestalled a serious
potential threat.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Jackson found, the actions harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has done much more than develop innovative browsing
software of commendable quality and offer it bundled with Windows
at no additional charge,'' Jackson wrote. ``Microsoft also engaged
in a concerted series of actions designed to protect the
applications barrier to entry, and hence its monopoly power, from a
variety of middleware threats, including Netscape's Web browser and
Sun's implementation of Java. Many of these actions have harmed
consumers in ways that are immediate and easily discernible. ''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's long-awaited conclusions in the
Microsoft antitrust case were labeled as simple ``findings of
fact.'' But by declaring that the software giant built by Bill
Gates had ruthlessly stifled competition and harmed consumers,
Jackson went further than most experts expected in declaring
Microsoft guilty of misconduct as a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and his stunned aides indicated that they intended to
appeal the decision. But the sweeping nature of the document
suggests that Jackson wants to provoke settlement talks between
Microsoft and the government on possible remedies. A settlement
would let the court avoid ordering a breakup of a company that has
helped drive the growth of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The long Microsoft trial yielded some riveting moments. But
nothing in the trial was as dramatic as Jackson's 207-page finding
of fact. The case began as a Justice Department accusation that
Microsoft's tying of its own browser to its Windows operating
system software was an attempt to stifle the rival browser produced
by Netscape. Then Justice broadened the case by bringing in what it
said was misconduct by Microsoft against other rivals and
competitors. The most striking aspect of Jackson's findings was
that he accepted these other examples, declaring that the company
had, as a factual matter, engaged in anti-competitive conduct
against Netscape, IBM, Compaq and other giants in the computer and
software business.
</P>
<P>
   It remains now for Jackson to lay out his findings as to
possible violations of the law by Microsoft. These particulars
should suggest whether the misconduct found by the judge requires a
limited remedy of sanctions against the company, directives that it
stop certain of its business practices, a much more radical
restructuring or even breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the task of drawing a sensible road map
toward achieving a fully competitive playing field in the computer
software business, one that encourages fair competition and rewards
innovation, requires the cooperation of the best minds from
Microsoft itself. That is why Gates must now ponder whether it is
in the interest of his shareholders to fight the Justice Department
with more appeals or enter into discussions that achieve these
goals and also enhance the owners' investment in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft should fight for its rights under the law, but it
should also recognize the sweeping nature of the government's
victory. Certain facts about its behavior have now been
established, and it is in everyone's best interest to achieve a
solution.

MARY WEITZMAN, 85, HUMANIST RESEARCHER IN ENDOCRINOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va., Calif. , Mass.)  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary C. Weitzman, who was a chorus girl as a
teen-ager, a college freshman at 35, later a professor and finally
a respected medical researcher, died Oct. 30 at a Manhattan
hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As a researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
the Bronx, she worked on isolating microscopic samples of endocrine
hormones from the eyestalks of Bermuda land crabs, some of which
she captured herself. The work provided evidence for the once
radical but now established theory that nerves secrete hormones in
small but extremely influential quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, Dr. Weitzman was still taking two subways and
a bus to work each day from her Upper West Side apartment. It was
the last leg of a journey that began in Norfolk, Va., where she was
born in 1914 to two poor Eastern European immigrants. She dropped
out of high school to dance in a chorus line, much to the delight
of her father, a frustrated vaudevillian.
</P>
<P>
   She married J. Daniel Weitzman, an investor and art collector,
who made headlines in the 1970s when more than $400,000 of his
artworks were stolen from his home by three gunmen who left him
bound and gagged.
</P>
<P>
   The Weitzmans were involved in the early stages of the civil
rights movement, even before it was generally called that, and in
1948 they opened the Dupont Theater, the first desegregated theater
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Weitzmans' politics, the American Legion picketed
the theater and Hollywood distributors cut off the supply of films.
The Dupont therefore came to specialize in foreign and avant-garde
films. Chess tables and espresso added to the bohemian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the Weitzmans, neither of whom had graduated from high
school, enrolled at George Washington University. Weitzman dropped
out because of a business deal. Mrs. Weitzman went on to earn a
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the couple moved to New York City when Mrs. Weitzman
was accepted by Einstein's doctoral program, which at the time was
jointly administered by Columbia University. She received her
doctorate in 1963, staying on to join the Einstein anatomy
department.
</P>
<P>
   For years, she single-handedly published Bibliographica
Neuroendocrinologica, an abstract of the world's research in her
field. Colleagues said that part of her motivation was to spread
new findings to Third World countries. She personally translated
articles from German, French, Spanish and Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Her research was done with two other Einstein scientists, Berta
and Ernst Scharrer, who are often credited as founders of
endocrinology, which describes how hormones control the nervous
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Weitzmans were divorced in 1962. Weitzman died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weitzman is survived by two sons, Donald, of Brookline,
Mass., and David, of Orinda, Calif.; a sister, Frances Pasmanick of
Washington; two brothers, Harold Cohen of Arlington, Va., and
Norman Cohen of Venice, Calif.; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weitzman's impact was as much human as scientific, said Sam
Seifter, a professor of biochemistry at Einstein. She worked with
students one-to-one in the laboratory, devoted herself to helping
minority students, and often counseled students on personal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the anatomy department's lunchroom, her colorful
past would return when she burst into song; she favored old-time
show tunes, the Loyalist songs of the Spanish Civil War and the
anthems of the civil rights movement.

HOUSE APPROVES AID BILL BUT SOME CALL IT INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 13th graf re Kosovo, bgng: The deal...)  (See also SPEND-CONGRESS) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House overwhelmingly approved a compromise
foreign aid bill on Friday, but some allied governments and
international aid workers expressed disappointment at the debt
relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 316-100, lawmakers agreed to an aid package
negotiated by the White House and Congress on Thursday that added
$799 million more than Republicans wanted to spend on matters like
peacekeeping in Kosovo, nuclear security in Russia and cancellation
of poor nations' debts, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The $13.5 billion measure will advance next week to the Senate,
where approval is expected.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the bill ``meets our commitments'' in key
policy areas. But some European diplomats here and international
aid workers were more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   In debt relief, the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed in
Cologne, Germany, in June to cut the debt burden of the poorest
countries to ease poverty. To help pay the American share, Clinton
requested $370 million this year to help the 41 countries
identified by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as
``heavily indebted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, who included $33 million in their spending
bill, agreed to only $123 million in the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   They said that to spend more would raid the Social Security
surplus, which both parties vow to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger today is not American hegemony, but American
disengagement,'' said one diplomat from a European country involved
in the debt fund set up at Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said America could well afford to cancel loans to
let poor countries focus their resources on needed services like
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think a farmer in Mali should be selling some of his
crop to go into the U.S. Treasury, when they need to get children
into school,'' said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam, a worldwide
anti-poverty agency.
</P>
<P>
   The initial foreign aid bill passed by the Republican Congress
last month contained $12.7 billion, and was vetoed by Clinton as
inadequate. The administration had asked for $14.4 billion, but
compromised on $13.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise restored some administration priorities,
including an additional $170 million in economic support funds and
$150 million for development aid.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also increased financing for peacekeeping operations in
Kosovo, including a new police force and assistance to neighboring
countries. The administration originally requested $130 million,
and Congress first approved $78 million, but in the end, they
agreed to $153 million. The allies are to hold a donors' conference
later this month to work out the cost-sharing. Financing for the
American troops in Kosovo will be handled in separate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed earlier to spend $1.8 billion over three
years to underwrite the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Of that
amount, providing Clinton's full request, $1.2 billion is for
military support to Israel, $400 million in economic aid for the
West Bank and Gaza, and $200 million for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also restored $104 million for nuclear-security
programs and other aid in the former Soviet Union, but the $839
million total fell far short of the administration's request for
$1.32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has worked hard to prevent nuclear material in
Russia from falling into the hands of terrorists. Even some
proponents of these safeguards have grown frustrated as Russian
authorities have restricted access to some sensitive nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Luongo, the head of the Russian-American Nuclear
Security Advisory Council, a private group, said: ``Given the
problems in Russia, the thought that devoting less money is going
to give them incentive to be more cooperative, or solve the problem
faster, is inaccurate.''

EDITORIAL: A POP QUIZ FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 6:
</P>
<P>
   A presidential campaign is a time of testing. Few candidates,
however, face an embarrassment like the one endured this week by
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The Republican front-runner was asked
by a Boston television reporter to name the leaders in four world
hot spots _ Chechnya, Taiwan, Pakistan and India. Although Bush has
not been very forthcoming on his international policies, this kind
of quiz-show questioning offers little chance for illumination.
Bush, whose alpha-male instincts clearly made him consider
throttling the reporter, probably fared no better than most
ordinary Americans would have. He called up part of one name,
``Lee,'' for Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Aslan Maskhadov is head of Chechnya, Atal Behari
Vajpayee is the prime minister of India, and Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf
controls Pakistan. Bush's camp argued that other governors seeking
the White House have had to learn about foreign policy on the run
and that actually knowing these difficult names has little to do
with presidential leadership potential. But Vice President Gore
made a more telling point when he attacked the substance of Bush's
analysis of what is happening now in Pakistan. Bush said of the
Pakistani leader that ``he's just been elected _ not elected, this
guy took over office. It appears this guy is going to bring
stability to the country and I think that's good news for the
subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's military coup is far from unqualified good news for
his country's shaky democratic tradition, especially given his
resistance to international pressure to schedule elections. Bush
failed to mention either the most positive aspect of the general's
regime, which was his promise to end systemic corruption, or the
most negative, that it raises the danger of nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Such an un-nuanced formulation was a novice mistake in
presidential politics and comes as a reminder that Bush, despite
his poll ratings, is still a newcomer to high-level campaigning. He
has time _ and a clear need _ to master his foreign policy
briefings. His opponents are entitled to make what they can of his
embarrassment, but we hope that this pop-quiz style of interview
will not tempt other journalists away from a deeper, more probing
style of questioning.

WOMAN IS FOUND GUILTY OF ASSAULTING A TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn woman was convicted Friday of assaulting
her daughter's sixth-grade teacher for giving the girl
unsatisfactory marks on her report card.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Brenda Smith, 44, of East New York, was found guilty
of third-degree assault in Brooklyn Criminal Court by a jury that
deliberated for two hours in a trial that lasted a week-and-a-half.
She could be sentenced to serve up to a year in jail and fined up
to $1,000 for conviction on that misdemeanor charge and convictions
for menacing and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, 12, who also took part in the attack, was
previously deemed in Family Court to be a juvenile delinquent for
her participation. The girl, whose name was not made public, was
put on probation for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the Brooklyn district attorney's office said that
Ms. Smith and her daughter argued with the teacher, Jamina Clay,
22, at Public School 306 in East New York on the last day of
school, June 28, after Ms. Clay had given the girl several
unsatisfactory grades on her report card. The prosecution said that
as the argument escalated, Ms. Smith punched Ms. Clay in the back
and held her from behind while her daughter punched the teacher,
scratched her face and pulled her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Other students called a school security guard, who broke up the
assault and called the police, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who lives on Cozine Avenue, is to be sentenced on
Jan. 5 by Judge Charles A. Posner. She and her lawyer could not be
reached Friday by telephone to determine if she planned to appeal
the conviction.

COMMENTARY: HAS JERRY FALWELL SEEN THE LIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS ``handed down'' to ``announced'' in first graf) (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By chance, the verdict in the Matthew Shepard murder trial was
announced in Laramie, Wyo., on Wednesday just before my interview
with the Rev. Jerry Falwell. He hadn't heard the news, so I told
him of Aaron McKinney's conviction and asked his response.
Falwell's reply was instantaneous. After saying that the ``horrific
crime'' deserved ``the severest of punishments allowed by law,'' he
volunteered: ``I could never accept `gay panic' or any other excuse
as grounds for what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   What in God's name has gotten into Jerry Falwell? With this
statement, he sided with the gay activists who had reviled
McKinney's defense argument that Shepard invited his own slaughter
by allegedly making sexual advances to his assailants. ``Gay
panic'' is a hateful courtroom strategy _ last seen famously in the
``Jenny Jones'' murder trial _ but it's trotted out nonetheless by
lawyers hoping to sway a homophobic juror or two. And Falwell, like
the judge in Laramie, would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same preacher who has reaped millions of dollars
with fund-raising letters and Web site screeds decrying
``deviants'' who ``will stop at nothing, including violence''? Who
has warned tirelessly of ``the radical homosexual onslaught of
America''? Who pushed an advertising boycott of ``Ellen'' and outed
a gay Teletubby?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. ``I have been strident in my language,'' says
Falwell of his record on the subject of homosexuality, but referred
me to a Brill's Content article that had at least cleared him of
outing the Teletubby. ``I'd never heard of Tinky Winky,'' he
protested.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Falwell now does own up to other, more serious fanning of
anti-gay fires, and it was this seeming change of heart that led to
our conversation. Two weekends ago his Thomas Road Baptist Church
in Lynchburg, Va., was the setting for an anti-violence meeting
between 200 of his flock and 200 gay civil rights advocates
recruited nationwide by Soulforce, an ecumenical group based in
Laguna Beach, Calif. The meeting came about thanks to one of those
only-in-America stories that make this country eternally
unpredictable. The founder of Soulforce, the Rev. Mel White, was
the favorite ghostwriter of the religious right _ he wrote
Falwell's autobiography as well as books for Pat Robertson and
speeches for Oliver North _ until he declared his previously
closeted homosexuality in 1991. Since then, White has become a
campaigner for gay rights and has engaged in loud public battles
with his former allies. But Falwell never entirely tuned his old
friend out, and their continued contacts, however acrimonious at
times, led to the conference in Lynchburg.
</P>
<P>
   To make it happen, the two men agreed to disagree about
Falwell's rock-ribbed conviction that homosexuality is a sin akin
to alcoholism or drug addiction that can be reversed with spiritual
treatment. While that view is regarded as repugnant by White and
most gay Americans, Soulforce's delegation turned up in Lynchburg
nonetheless with the hope that Falwell might tone down his most
incendiary demagogy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   No gay civil rights group I can find has officially applauded
the conclave, and neither has any organization of religious
conservatives. When I asked White if his former boss' olive branch
might be opportunistic political positioning at a moment when the
hard right is being disowned by the Republican front-runner, George
W. Bush, he replied: ``I'm skeptical. How could you not be?'' But
he believes that Falwell, ``for whatever reason, good or bad,'' is
``doing the right thing.'' He adds: ``I know this guy, and this guy
is sincere, though he will blather about stupid things.'' Even
during the Lynchburg weekend, Falwell couldn't resist offending his
guests by endorsing a proselytizer for the ``ex-gay'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be wrong to dismiss the conference as mere
posturing. Falwell did break sharply with many religious-right
ideologues, who had closed ranks after the Shepard murder to deny
any link between the shrill gay-baiting pronouncements by their
``family'' organizations and a national rise in gay-bashing
violence at a time when most violent crime is down. ``We
acknowledge that words can lead to actions,'' Falwell said flatly
to the Lynchburg gathering, speaking of the potential fallout of
``reckless and dangerous language.'' He vowed that he and his staff
would vigilantly examine their ``characterizations and criticisms
of the homosexual community'' to avoid any ``statements that can be
construed as sanctioning hate or antagonism against homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He even put some distance between himself and a favorite
semantic dodge of the religious right: ``Many of us pastors like to
talk about loving the sinner but hating the sin,'' he said, but
``unfortunately, that statement has often become a meaningless
cliche'' because ``we too often fall short of the mark of ... truly
loving the sinner.'' Expanding on this point in our conversation,
Falwell said: ``Admittedly, evangelicals have not exhibited an
ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian
community. We've said go somewhere else, we don't need you here
(at) our churches.''
</P>
<P>
   What, I wondered, brought on this change in attitude besides the
prodding of Mel White? ``Matt Shepard and Billy Jack Gaither,'' he
said, referring to the gay Alabama man beaten with an ax handle and
then set on fire in February. ``And Columbine.'' Convinced that
Christians were targeted by the assailants in Littleton _ a view
that has yet to be confirmed by official investigators _ Falwell
found himself with a new perspective on the victims of hate crimes:
``You don't know what it means to be targeted until you've been
targeted yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected going in that we could change the world with a
meeting,'' he says, and he's not sure where it will all lead. His
congregants reacted enthusiastically to the weekend; of some 5,000
messages and letters he's received, ``well over 90 percent are
positive,'' including those from fellow evangelicals and some 300
Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   Distressed by this week's shooting incidents in Honolulu and
Seattle, Falwell is thinking of organizing a larger anti-violence
conference of not just ``gays and evangelicals, but believers and
non-believers ... everyone from people of color to Aryan Nations.''
Though repeatedly reiterating his opposition to gun control, he
opened the door a crack on that once-closed subject too: ``I'm
opposed, but we've got to do something,'' even ``getting us hard
heads on the right to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those heads _ and hearts _ can be pretty hard. Right on the eve
of the Lynchburg weekend, the most effective gay-baiting
organization in the country, The Family Research Council, helped
spur on a new campaign _ this one to dramatize the rape and murder
of a teenage boy allegedly committed by two gay men in Arkansas.
Why? According to its electronic newsletter of Oct. 20 the council
believes the gay-infested national media are suppressing the story
even as they overcovered the Shepard case. This specious argument,
rabble-rousing in the guise of media criticism, has since been
taken up by a right-wing amen chorus: David Duke, The Washington
Times, a columnist in The New York Post and Bill Horn, a notorious
anti-gay propagandist who turned up last week on ABC's
``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what: Sometimes gay people commit murder, just like
any other people, and if the press is engaged in a conspiracy to
cover up that reality, it's sure done a poor job of keeping Jeffrey
Dahmer and Andrew Cunanan, among others, a secret. The fact is that
plenty of murders don't make the national news, including most of
the 31 gay-bashing killings that the National Coalition of
Anti-Violence Programs has documented since Shepard's death.
</P>
<P>
   A nother little-publicized story: How Benjamin Matthew Williams,
who has admitted participating in 2 of those 31, the July shooting
of a gay couple in Redding, Calif., has rationalized his act. ``I'm
not guilty of murder,'' he told The Sacramento Bee this week in a
jailhouse interview. ``I'm guilty of obeying the laws of the
Creator ... So many people claim to be Christians and complain
about all these things their religion says are a sin, but they're
not willing to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, a determined Jerry Falwell, speaking out in the
media soup of Larry King and Geraldo, might make a difference.
Instead of worrying about his motives, we should cheer on his
embryonic conversion, even as we remind him that his work has just
begun.

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As expected, senior quarterback John Fox will
start today against Arizona State in place of junior Mike Van
Raaphorst, and Fox said he would not be nervous making his first
start since Nov. 22, 1997 against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared. I haven't experienced butterflies,'' Fox said.
``I've had tingles before, with 95,000 people in the Coliseum
against UCLA I think, but no butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterflies are from not being prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox started nine games in '97 but spent most of last season at
tight end and played linebacker to start this year. Since his last
start at quarterback, Fox has gained 10 pounds and increased his
weight to 215, and his speed.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes he is more mature as a fifth-year senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more confident in my abilities,'' Fox said. ``I
know my limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   One area that Fox continues to work on is his accuracy, which
was something that plagued him two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fundamentals still need work,'' Fox said. ``Hopefully, I
can correct it by (today).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Battered line: The struggles of the offensive line continue,
which Hackett attributes to injuries as much as inconsistent
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never started the same offensive line after the third game.
People will say, `Well, they're no good anyway.' I've heard that,
but it's as much how good they are as how you play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve tackle Matt Welch could see an increased role today,
forced to back up both left tackle Brent McCaffrey and right tackle
Travis Claridge, because tackle Trevor Roberts is out with a broken
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive line is in disarray and has been for about three
weeks,'' Hackett added.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that offensive guard Faasea Mailo will be
available after missing last week's game with a deep shin bruise.
</P>
<P>
   __ Penalty problems: After having nine more penalties last week
against Cal, USC has 84 in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant battle,'' Hackett said. ``It's just like
turnovers. You just don't say it (will stop) and then it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rideaux improves: Freshman defensive back Darrell Rideaux has
taken over as USC's nickel back, after previously splitting time
with freshman Kevin Arbet. Rideaux allowed only one completion in
eight attempts in his direction against California last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell was one of the brightest spots,'' Hackett said. ``He
really played his best ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Childers out: Defensive end Matt Childers will miss the game
with an injured shoulder. Childers also missed last week's game
against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed, who has shared the job with
Childers, will start.
</P>
<P>
   __ Local battle: Arizona State has 34 players from California on
its roster, so that should add some emotion to today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our players are from Southern California, so it makes
it a very personal thing even though I'd like to keep the focus on
us,'' Sun Devils coach Bruce Snyder said. ``I see it as a major
challenge to go there and play a team who is probably very
disappointed about their season.''

MIXED FEELINGS ON EFFECT OF RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson lobbed a cannonball
at Microsoft with his ruling the Redmond software maker is a
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Or ...
</P>
<P>
   Investors are more worried about such business developments at
the software giant as whether it'll release its next software on
time. The federal court's findings of fact Friday are a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and computer-industry analysts surveyed last night
were strongly polarized.
</P>
<P>
   Two saw the document as bad news. Three others played down its
significance, and one went so far as to say that any decline in the
company's stock should be seen as a buying opportunity. Its stock,
at $91.56 earlier in the day, did fall as much as $4.81 in
after-hours trading after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to advise my brokers not to overreact to this,''
said Craig Johnson, a Minneapolis-based vice president at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ``The stock may trade lower for awhile, but
there are huge opportunities looking forward, and if it does get
knocked down, if I were a shareholder, I'd buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Cummins, a portfolio manager with Rigel Capital Management
Inc. in Seattle, was nearly as sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft didn't do a very good job at trial, but does this
really affect the core value of Microsoft? I don't think so,'' he
said. ``It's extraordinarily strong.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins said the future of computing clearly lies with the small
devices called personal digital assistants, rather than PCs. He
strongly believes operating systems, the focus of the Department of
Justice's monopoly inquiry, ``have about two years left.'' So any
decision based on Microsoft's operating-systems monopoly will
become irrelevant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Wilson, a Bellevue-based industry analyst with Summit
Strategies, said Friday's events won't change how he advises his
clients. Summit counsels companies seeking strategic advice, such
as whether to partner with or compete against other companies,
including Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I sit, the case is a non-factor, in part because
because the business community is more worried about more
substantial challenges, like whether Windows 2000 will launch on
time and be bug-free ...,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Less optimistic about the fallout from the findings of fact was
Jonathan Geurkink, a software analyst with Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned; I'm definitely concerned,'' Geurkink said.
``The judge is firing a big cannonball across Microsoft's bow. It's
a stern warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Most emphatic in his worry about the impact of Judge Jackson's
findings of fact was Erik Olbeter, senior Internet analyst with
Schwab Washington Research Group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here suggests Microsoft is in deep water,'' he
said. ``The judge went out of his way to essentially agree with the
government on all points. This is a stunning blow to Microsoft.''
He said he'll tell his clients, who are institutional investors,
that ``this phase of the trial doesn't support Microsoft in any
substantial way and that's it's going to be very rough going for
this company.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, based on the findings of fact, he foresees
``significant, worst-case remedies'' being visited on Microsoft.
But, he noted, several events _ for example, a settlement or a new
political administration _ could alter that outcome.
