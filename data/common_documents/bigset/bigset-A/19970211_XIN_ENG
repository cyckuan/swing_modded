<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Bank Reduces Lending Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest commercial
bank Standard Chartered Bank today said it will reduce its
minimum lending rates in response to a cut in the rediscount rate
by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a move expected to trigger similar actions by other
commercial banks, a spokesman of the bank said it will with
effect from Tuesday reduce its lending rate to 25.5 percent, a
drop of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time since July last year that the bank has
adjusted its lending rate.
</P>
<P>
This is in response to an announcement last week in which the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said it was cutting the rediscount rate
from the present 27 percent to 23.5 percent in response to
indications of further falls in inflation, currently pegged at
16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This also is the third time in less than a year the Central
Bank has adjusted the rediscount rate following similar cuts in
August and October last year when the rate was progressively
reduced from 29.5 percent to 27 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma Launches Corruption Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 10 (Xinhua) -- President Leonid Kuchma, facing
increasing complaints from the world about corruption within the
top levels of Ukraine's civil service, has vowed to kick off a
major campaign against graft.
</P>
<P>
In a recent television speech, Kuchma said a working group led
by the Justice Minister Serhy Holovaty would be set up to
implement anti-corruption measures.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Security Service (the successor of the
KGB) and other law enforcement agencies would also be involved.
</P>
<P>
"Public employees must be people with spotless reputations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The corruption issue was raised during Kuchma's meeting with
World Bank President James Wolfensohn at the 27th World Economic
Forum, held in Davos, Switzerland from January 30 to February 4.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Wolfensohn sent Kuchma a letter expressing
concern over widespread corruption among Ukrainian officials.
</P>
<P>
Graft has become a major obstacle in the country's attempts to
attract most badly needed foreign investment as foreign firms were
frightened by tales of arbitrary regulation and outright
extortion by Ukrainian officialdom.
</P>
<P>
In regard of this, Kuchma proposed to establish a National
Bureau of Investigations (NBI), which will join a half dozen
existing agencies responsible for fighting corruption, and monitor
the progress of foreign investment projects, gas distribution
deals and other matters.
</P>
<P>
High-level government corruption has received more press
coverage than at any time since the country became independent in
1991, but few of the media scandals were prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Security Service Chairman Vladimir Radchenko told parliament
deputies last October that his agency was investigating 1,500
senior civil servants.
</P>
<P>
But, he has announced since then only a handful of solved
cases, most of which involved low-level provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs show more than
3,000 civil servants have been punished for job-related crimes
since 1991, while none of them held a top position in the
government.
</P>
<P>
Mykola Melnyk, consultant to the parliamentary commission on
the Fight Against Organized Crime and Corruption, estimated that
the country's law enforcement agencies now caught just one percent
of corruption cases and misuse of office by government
officials. Only 10 percent of the officials caught had received
punishments more than a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
"Most likely, the president has lost faith in the
effectiveness of the law enforcers and decided to entrust the
fight against corruption to a Justice Ministry headed by a young
and energetic minister," Melnyk said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Release Palestinian Women Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel is set to release
23 jailed Palestinian women tomorrow as Israel's High Court of
Justice today rejected a petition against the move.
</P>
<P>
The court issued Sunday an interim injunction on the
release pending the petition against the government's decision
to pardon Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture towards
the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
A three-member panel turned down the petition filed by the
Association of Terror Victims (ATV) and Ora Klein, whose
husband was killed in 1991 by an Arab terrorist, saying the
issue was not within its jurisdiction and there was no
legal base for blocking the release.
</P>
<P>
Klein and the ATV argued that the release of the
prisoners, who include three convicted murderers of Jews, had
crossed the red line and would surely lead to more Arab
terror.
</P>
<P>
The release of 23 female prisoners was to have been
carried out immediately after the signing of the Oslo II
accords in September 1995, but Israeli President Ezer Weizman
refused to pardon two of them, who were convicted of killing
Jews.
</P>
<P>
In a show of support to the two, the other 21 women
prisoners refused to leave Israeli jails though they were
already free to go. As a goodwill gesture, Weizman changed
his mind earlier last year and has already signed orders to
pardon also the remaining two women prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Although Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi threatened Sunday that
he would refuse to recommend a pardon for the three
convicted murderers, Israeli law officials said that Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu could sign the recommendation himself.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, preparations were underway today in
the Palestinian city of Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, to hold
a major celebration tomorrow for the release of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat is
to fly from Hebron to Ramallah to take part in the
celebration. PNA officials have issued calls for release of other
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The release of Palestinian women prisoners was pledged by
Netanyahu during his meeting with Arafat overnight in the Erez
crossing between Israel and Gaza Strip. The two leaders agreed
to resume peace talks from Sunday to discuss further
implementation of the Hebron accord, and the release is
expected to create a favorable atmosphere for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli cabinet held a meeting today in which
security officials briefed them on issues over carrying out
further Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Today's cabinet meeting did not discuss any detail, and
Netanyahu decided to hold several meetings at the end of
this month to discuss in details the issues of further troop
withdrawals.

<P>
HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of Zimbabwe's
market reforms will be launched once consultations in the
government and its social partners are completed, Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the government hopes the reform program will be
launched well before the end of the year once discussions in the
government as well as with the private sector and donors have
been held.
</P>
<P>
He said the second phase will be called the Zimbabwe program
for economic and social transformation and will concentrate on
further liberalizing the investment climate, reform of the public
enterprise sector and implement projects aimed at improving the
living standards of the poor majority.
</P>
<P>
"Once cabinet has approved the final paper, we will consult
all stakeholders in industry and commerce before launching the
program this year," the minister said, "we hope we can get this
process of consultation out of the way as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
He also said a joint International Monetary Fund and World
Bank team is expected in Zimbabwe this week for consultations on
the country's economic transformation.

<HEADLINE> Special Telephone System for Hearing Impaired Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Hearing impaired persons in
Cyprus will no longer have the problems of communication with
others after the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority (CTA)
installed a special telephone system for them.
</P>
<P>
The new telephone-fax system, implemented by CTA from
February 1st, will allow the hearing impaired to send and
receive telephone messages.
</P>
<P>
Hearing impaired persons can contact others by sending a
written fax to the CTA at a specific telephone number. A
CTA employee then telephones the individual the message is
intended for and reads the message. The fax message is also
mailed to the receiver.
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to contact a hearing impaired person follow
the same procedure conducted in reverse.
</P>
<P>
The service applies also for international calls.
</P>
<P>
CTA's assistant Director for Commercial Services, Eleftherios
Koudounas, said today that the service was something CTA
deemed to be part of its social responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"Fees for the service do not even cover its expenses.
However, it is something the Authority feels as an
obligation to our community," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Director of the School for the Deaf, Andreas Lemesios, was
very pleased with the new system, saying that it will greatly
aid the needs of the island's hearing-impaired community.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy with the sensitivity CTA has shown on the
matter and the speed with which it implemented the service,"
Lemesios added.

<HEADLINE> Victory of FN in City Election Worries France, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The victory of the far-right
National Front (FN) party in the municipal election of the
southern city of Vitrolles has cast a shadow over the political
life of France, and worries its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The FN candidate, Catherine Megret, who is the wife of the
number two of the FN, Bruno Megret, carried off the second round
of the election with a net majority of votes of 52.48 percent,
beating incumbent socialist mayor Jean-Jacques Anglade.
</P>
<P>
Vitrolles has become the fourth major French city in the
southern region of Provence-Alps-Cote d'Azur -- after Toulon,
Marignane and Orange -- to fall into the hands of the party of
Jean-Marie le Pen, the FN leader universally regarded as a racist.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party today held the ruling rightwing parties
responsible for the victory of the FN, which it said has taken
advantage of the on-going debate on immigration launched by the
ruling majority.
</P>
<P>
Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande said that most
leaders of the Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR) talk about
the FN "without bitterness," and accused them of refusing to give
their clear instruction to their voters on whom they should vote.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Jacques Toubon said today that France
should draw a lesson from the victory of the FN in Vitrolles, and
stay vigilant against the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the FN victory in Vitrolles is only a local
event in Vitrolles -- where the unemployment rate is 22 percent --
which should not be considered as the result of "a national test."
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that although Prime
Minister Alain Juppe began to engage in a fight against the FN
last autumn, many figures of the ruling gaullist RPR party have
maintained silence over the racist and xenophobic propaganda
spread by the FN.
</P>
<P>
One of the RPR leaders, former Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua, once said that there were common values between the RPR
and FN.
</P>
<P>
The victory of the FN in Vitrolles also aroused concern in
France's neighbors of Italy, Germany and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based Italian daily, Republica, said that "the
irresponsible advances" of the FN are posing a threat to the
French government, and that the victory of the FN in Vitrolles
shows that it is capable of harming the ruling majority of France.
</P>
<P>
The German central city of Morfelden-Walldorf, which is the
sister city of Vitrolles, is considering whether to maintain the
relationship with the French city any more.
</P>
<P>
Belgian press reports said that the victory of the FN in
Vitrolles indicates the rejection by part of the French population
of the traditional political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
It also reflects the difficulties France is experiencing in
adapting itself to globalization and European construction, said
the Belgian daily, le Soir.

<HEADLINE> Han Sung Joo Holds Talks With Greek Officials on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. secretary general's
special envoy for the Cyprus question, Han Sung Joo, met today
with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and held talks with Greek
Foreign Undersecretary Yannos Kranidiotis.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the press after their talks, Kranidiotis said
he had been briefed by Han on his recent talks in Nicosia and
Ankara. Han arrived here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis reiterated the position that the Cyprus issue was
an international and a European problem, which did not solely
concern relations between the two communities on the island or
between Greece and Turkey, since the problem in Cyprus was "the
Turkish occupation and not the Cypriots' right to defend
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Greece, he said, supported a proposal by Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides for the demilitarization of the island and the
installation of a multinational force to maintain peace and
stability. Greece also supported the resumption of direct talks in
Cyprus, he added.
</P>
<P>
"These talks should begin as soon as possible," he noted,
adding however that "common ground" should first be found, that is
a convergence of views providing for some chance of success in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that there did not appear to be much cause
for optimism with regard to this "common ground." Efforts would
continue and current contacts had not been completed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy restricted his statements to thanking the Greek
government for what he called important talks which formed part of
his tour of the region in an attempt to explore all possibilities
for promoting an agreement on resolving the Cyprus issue through
the resumption of talks.

A French commanding and logistic unit, comprising 50 French
military men, has arrived in Bangui from Nantes, central France,
to back up the soldiers from six French-speaking African nations,
who are led by General Edouard N'Kili of Gabon.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers are stationed around strategic points such as
the presidential palace, the barracks of the "ex-mutinous
soldiers," the airport, and some districts of Bangui which have
seen fighting and violence during the three-month mutiny from
mid-November last year to late January.
</P>
<P>
President Ange-Felix Patasse and the mutinous soldiers signed a
truce accord on January 25 to agree to set up a new government of
national union, after French troops attacked the rebels on January
5 in retaliation of the "assassination" of two French soldiers by
the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Set up More Natural Gas Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will set up more natural
gas fueling stations as part of its efforts to reduce air
pollution by use of cleaner and more efficient fuel, Egyptian
Minister of Oil Hamdi al-Banbi said today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency quoted him as saying that his
ministry will establish a number of small-scale projects to
encourage the use of natural gas as a cleaner fuel.
</P>
<P>
It also works for the expansion of natural gas network to
cover the main consumption areas and link them to natural gas
fields across the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The use of natural gas saves about 60 percent of the fuel used
by any vehicle when compared with the conventional fuel, he said,
adding that natural gas also reduces pollution by over 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Seven natural gas filling stations have been set up in Greater
Cairo and Alexandria. The Social Fund for Development will finance
the new ones.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 328
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In a similar drive to protect environment, Egypt announced
earlier that its benzine production will be lead-free by June in a
bid to protect the environment from pollution. It is among the
first of the developing countries to make such a move.
</P>
<P>
About 82 percent of car fuel sold at service stations
nation-wide is lead free, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Cairo, Giza and Qalyub in the so-called Greater Cairo is now
consuming 100 percent of the lead-free benzine distributed through
its benzine filling stations, which is in line with the
government's efforts to protect environment.

<HEADLINE> Next UK Gov't to Face Huge Financial Hole: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The next British government
will inherit a financial position so bad that it will need to cut
spending, or raise taxes by up to 22.4 billion pounds (36.7
billion US dollars), according to an authoritative research due to
be published.
</P>
<P>
If the new government does not take additional action to cut
spending or increase taxes, higher interest payments will eat into
spending plans anyway, the research paper warned.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, a highly respected economic think-tank and an
adviser to the Tory government.
</P>
<P>
The 22.4 billion pound hole is the equivalent of more than 8
percent on the basic rate of income tax, or the entire budget of
the Department for Education and Employment or the Scottish
Office.
</P>
<P>
The report warned, "The choice is not between adjusting fiscal
policy and not adjusting. It is simply between adjusting now and
adjusting in the future."
</P>
<P>
The financial plans set out in last November's budget, showing
government borrowing falling gradually to zero, are not plausible,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The report said that expenditure is likely to rise faster and
taxes more slowly than shown in the budget without extra measures.
</P>
<P>
Martin Weale, who heads the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, said, "The new government will have to raise at
least 11.2 to 16 billion US dollars in extra tax. It is what the
Chancellor should have done in the last budget and it is the only
sensible thing to do."
</P>
<P>
The budget mess arises from the fact that the shortfall between
government spending and tax receipts has been very slow to fall
despite more than four years of economic recovery, according to
Weale.
</P>
<P>
The government's present spending plans envisage bringing the
deficit down to just under 3 percent of GDP or 30.4 billion US
dollars in 1997/98 and falling further in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute's paper said, "Deficit reduction to 3
percent of GDP does not go far enough.... The budget deficit has
to be reduced by means of spending cuts or tax increases by 2
percent of GDP as compared with the situation in 1996/97."

<HEADLINE> Peruvian President on Hostage Crisis in Lima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori has expressed the hope for a peaceful solution to the
hostage crisis in Lima but flatly ruled out any possibility of
offering ransom money to those hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a visit to London today, Fujimori said that he
was still hopeful that preliminary talks with the guerillas due to
start Tuesday could lead to a peaceful solution to the 54-day
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the way out for the siege is to find out a
peaceful solution. The preliminary conversations will start and
then we can see what happens," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Peruvian president said that there was no chance
of paying any ransom money to the anti-government guerillas, who
stormed the Japanese embassy in Lima and seized hundreds of
hostages last December.
</P>
<P>
"As a government we don't accept this kind of ransom payment. I
think that all governments, not just Peruvian but around the
world, must not accept these kinds of crimes and later pay a
ransom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Peruvian government would consider use of force
in resolving the crisis, Fujimori said, "We are trying to exhaust
all possible means for a peaceful solution."
</P>
<P>
"Only if there are victims inside the embassy compound, then
there may be another type of solution," he added.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Frankfurt Ends at New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended the session mixed today after last week's strong surge, with
both London and Paris slightly down and Frankfurt extending last
Friday's gains and climbing to a new record closing high.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London had surged to a record trading high of
4,330.0 points earlier in the day on the FTSE 100 index before
ending almost unchanged, 0.1 points lower at 4,307.7 due to
profit-taking and Wall Street's failure to build on Friday's
rally.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the London market was earlier underpinned by
Wall Street's strong performance last Friday and today's latest
factory gate prices which supported Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke's decision to keep UK interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares also failed to hold their early gains
today as losses were driven by uncertainty on Wall Street, with
the CAC-40 index finishing 2.15 points down at 2,595.37, below the
2,600 level.
</P>
<P>
However, on the Frankfurt market, which ended before Wall
Street opened, German shares ended sharply higher in response to a
strong bond market and Wall Street's firm close last Friday, with
the DAX-30 index 46.35 points higher at 3,184.36.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 0.1
points down at 4,307.7. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished down

<HEADLINE> Incident Erupted Between Muslims, Croats in Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- At least two Bosnian Muslim
civilians were killed and 20 wounded while two Croatian policemen
were injured in clashes between Muslims and Croats in Mostar
today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Sarajevo, a group of Croats opened
fire on Muslims who were visiting a cemetery in the
Croat-controlled western section of the divided city of Mostar in
southern Bosnia, killing and wounding local Muslims.
</P>
<P>
In spite of strong pressure from the international community
for unification, Mostar is still divided, with Croats controlling
the western part and the Muslims the eastern section. There is
little freedom of movement between the two ethnic groups in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Muslim Radio Sarajevo said that all the wounded, including
Mufti Seid Smajkic of Mostar, had been taken to medical
institutions in the city's eastern Muslim section for treatment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo Alexander Ivanko told a news
conference that members of the International Police Task Force
were investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said Croats had first hurled stones at the Muslims,
after which the shooting started.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) also confirmed that the
incident took place in Mostar and said three persons had been
wounded and two were in serious condition, according to the Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
But according to Croat Radio, Muslims had attacked the western
Croat section early this morning, using small arms and explosives.
</P>
<P>
Muslims and Croats in Bosnia fought against each other in 1993.
They formed a federation in March 1994 under U.S. mediation to
join force against the Bosnian Serbs, but the contradiction
between the two federal partners has never ceased since then.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Media Professionals Urged to Sensitize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian media
professionals were today called on to sensitize the public about
the problems facing women and children.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the call came from
Bisrat Gashaw, vice-minister of information and culture when she
was opening here a five-day workshop under the theme "the
well-being of women and children".
</P>
<P>
Bisrat said all citizens, particularly journalists, are
expected to make endeavor in helping resolve the problems of
women and children as well as ensure their rights.
</P>
<P>
She said journalists in order to enlighten the public
primarily know in depth the situation of children and women,
particularly in the fields of health, agriculture, education,
environmental protection, politics and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition are some of the
difficulties confronting women and children, she said, adding
that insufficient supply of clean water, population explosion and
the increasing number of street children must also be of great
concern to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
Country representative of the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) R. Tuluhungwa said rehabilitation programs are jointly
undertaken by the Ethiopian government and the UNICEF to benefit
poor Ethiopian women and children, urging journalists to
contribute their share in making these programs a reality.
</P>
<P>
"Poor Ethiopian women and children are awaiting the helping
hand of citizens and donors," he said, adding that 64 percent of
children under five are vulnerable to diseases due to lack of
balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
He added that only half of the total Ethiopian child
population were inoculated against the six child killing
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Journalists from different regional states and representatives
from governmental and non-governmental organizations are taking
part in the workshop.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Provide Basic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- African governments
were today urged to find alternative strategies for providing
basic education for all children.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day microplanning and school mapping workshop
for the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) education program
officers from 17 east and southern African countries, UNICEF
representative to Tanzania Agnes Aidoo said the present system
applied by many African countries is inadequate and has made many
children fail to get basic education.
</P>
<P>
Aidoo said many children in Africa do not get the basic
education because of poverty which compel them to work to
complement their parents' efforts to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
"Even if all children have an opportunity to go to school,
poverty would keep most of them out of school because they do not
have the money to pay school fees and other requirements," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Citing Tanzania as an example, Aidoo said statistics shows
that out of every 100 seven year olds, only 14 are in school, out
of 100 children of primary school age, only 55 are in school.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, she said out of 55 in school, only 38 complete
primary school and of the 38, only six proceed to secondary
school.
</P>
<P>
She further said that the socio-cultural and economic factors
in Africa do not favor girls education, which she said needs
urgent measures to change.
</P>
<P>
Aidoo also challenged African countries to increase budget
allocations to the education sector and set strategies to improve
the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
"Without education, development and democracy are undully
constrained as the potential of the individual who is supposed to
bring about development will be underdeveloped," she said.
</P>
<P>
Aidoo said the non-governmental organizations and private
people could be drawn into the provision of education, or
capacity of communities be built to own education services.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, co-organized and sponsored by the UNICEF and the
UNESCO and attended by about 40 participants, aims at
working out ways of improving basic education in the region.

HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa today welcomed last week's decision by the
Central Bank to cut the rediscount rate by over four percentage
points, saying it will underpin recovery of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister today said on its part, the government will
continue to pursue sound fiscal policies aimed at further cutting
the budget deficit and recurrent expenditure.
</P>
<P>
As a result of budget overruns, the budget deficit as a
percentage of GDP has exceeded the original target of five
percent, and is in the year to June 1997 expected to reach 11
percent compared with 10.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said the government will continue to support the
restrictive monetary policy which has been in place since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe last week announced it had cut
the rediscount rate from a high of 27 percent to 23.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "it is very welcome news indeed and it is
the effect of policies being implemented to reduce inflation. We
hope it will be sustained and it will be important that we
continue to reduce the budget deficit."

PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-seven percent of Frenchmen
take seriously the victory scored on Sunday by the far-right
National Front (FN) in the southern city of Vitrolles, regarding
it as an event with a national impact, the Agence France-Presse
(AFP) quoted a poll as saying today.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, conducted by the CSA polling group on

think that FN is an extreme right group, 70 percent regard it as a
racist group, while 70 percent say that it should be represented
in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four percent of the people polled said that FN makes up a
danger to democracy, and 60 percent think that FN will take on
more and more importance in the future.
</P>
<P>
Most French people think that if the government wants to
prevent FN from gaining more power, it should pay more attention
to the concerns of people, priorly the improvement of security in
cities and their suburbs, and the fight against clandestine
immigration, unemployment and corruption.

<HEADLINE> Fingerprinting to Be Applied to Computer Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Fingerprinting is to be used
as a means of keeping computer hackers out of sensitive corporate
databases.
</P>
<P>
Oracle Corp., a major database software company, today is
announcing that for about 500 U.S. dollars, its customers will be
able to buy a new palm-sized device that will compare users'
prints to sets stored in a central file before letting them log on
to the machine.
</P>
<P>
The unit is made by Identix Inc., of Sunnyvale, California, and
represents yet another escalation in the battle aimed at keeping
computer data in a really safe place, according to a report by the
Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
Passwords, the first line of defense, can be stolen or cracked,
according to experts. And while many companies currently use
credit-card sized "smart cards" that must be inserted into a
scanner along with a password, those cards, too, can be stolen.
</P>
<P>
But fingerprinting "is the ultimate in security, because it
doesn't depend on what you know, but what you are," said Randall
Fowler, president of Identix.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the security field refer to the technology as
"biometric authentication" instead of fingerprinting. Some of the
technology are already appearing in products, such as scanning
patterns in eyeballs. Others, though, are still laboratory
projects. Among them: sniffing body odor.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the Identix unit can tell a real finger from a
wax model, or from a glove with someone else's fingerprint on it,
because of a collection of sensors that track blood flow, blood
pressure and other signals. The device has already been used by
the military, as well as in welfare offices for fraud detection,
but is only now being deployed for traditional desktop software
applications.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that a kind of keyboard with a built-in
fingerprinter will soon reach the market. Some experts said they
hope that one day, a fingerprint scanner will be built into
virtually every computer mouse. That would help with security in
such endeavors as electronic commerce, in which people buy goods
over the Internet.

</P>
<P>
He also announced a one-week half work-days so that people can
go off from their work to register.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,263 registration centers are set up in the state,
the official News Agency of Nigeria said.
</P>
<P>
In Port Harcourt, the state government has set up a monitoring
committee as the watch-dog of the practice.
</P>
<P>
The registration of voters marks another major step in General
Sani Abacha's three-year transition to civil rule program, after
the elections of local government on non-party basis and
registration of political parties in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The elections of local government on party basis had been set
for the last quarter of 1996 but was postponed to March 15 this
year, partly because of delayed preparations and partly because
of the spate of bomb blasts aimed at the military force now
ruling the country.
</P>
<P>
While some are hailing the registration of voters as the start
of the creation of the fourth republic, others, however,
expressed the worry over the prospects of a General Abacha
staying in power after the October 1998 deadline for the military
to quit.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview he granted to the U.S.-based "Washington
Times", the head of state said he has not put his mind to the
much-speculated issue of whether or not he will run for
presidency in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the decision will be his constituency's and
that it is not new in Africa for soldiers to drop their uniform
and step into politics.

JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) --Top leaders of South
Africa, Mozambique and Swaziland have met to deal with the
deepening crisis in Swaziland, the Southern African Broadcasting
Association (SABA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between South African President Nelson Mandela,
his Mozambican counterpart Joaquim Chissano and Swazi King Mswati
III was held in Pretoria, South Africa last weekend, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the discussions have not been made public yet.
</P>
<P>
The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions last week sponsored a
nationwide strike, calling on the government to draft a

democracy.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Swazi workers are reportedly pushing Mswati III
to institute reforms and scrap a 1973 decree banning political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only Southern African country where
multi-party democracy has not been introduced. enditem

<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation rate went
down to 26 percent by the end of January this year from 29
percent in December last year, according to Finance Minister
Anthony Ani.
</P>
<P>
The rate, which has been decreasing at a rate of 3.5 percent a
month, is expected to go down further to between 12 to 15 percent
by the middle of this year, the minister said, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
During a visit at the weekend to the Calabar Export Processing
Zone in southeast Nigeria, the minister said the government is
determined to bring down inflation to ensure that prices of goods
and services come to an affordable level.
</P>
<P>
The government decision to increase investment in agriculture,
as is seen in this year's budget, is part of the efforts to
improve the living standard of ordinary Nigerians, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the country's dual foreign exchange rate system, the
minister said the federal government is doing everything possible
to ensure stability and consistency of the exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The export processing zone, the first of its kind in Nigeria,
is expected to be officially inaugurated in June this year and
construction of infrastructure facilities is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investors to the zone, the Nigerian
government has committed to offering a number of preferential
policies, including free remittance of exchange and profits and
the establishment of solely foreign-owned ventures.

PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni arrived here this afternoon for a brief visit, during
which he will hold talks with French President Jacques Chirac on
Tuesday on the war in Zaire, in which Ugandan troops are
reportedly involved.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
today that France is expecting President Museveni "to contribute
to an ending of hostilities" in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We don't doubt that, given his stature, he can contribute to
an ending of hostilities in the region and to the emergence of
solutions, in conformity with the principles of OAU (Organization
of African Unity) on the respect of territorial integrity and
respect of frontiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zaire has accused Uganda, Rwanda, and to a lesser degree,
Burundi of supporting the Tutsi-led rebels of Laurent-Desire
Kabila, who have been gaining ground against government troops
over the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who arrived here from New York, will also meet with
the ambassadors of African countries in Paris and give a press
conference on Tuesday, before leaving for an undisclosed
destination.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Museveni will also talk about the holding of an
international conference on the Great Lakes region, which France
said should be called with emergency.

Tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees have been again
caught in and thrown on the road by the fighting between Zairean
government forces and rebels.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Unit Trusts Sales Surge In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Total sales of unit trusts
in Hong Kong hit 4.5 billion US dollars in 1996, recording a
whopping increase of 45 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Growing confidence among investors pushed net sales of unit
trusts in 1996 up to 580 million US dollars, three times higher
than in the previous year, according to the Hong Kong Investment
Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lo, Chairman of HKIFA attributed the high inflows of
funds to the strong performance of Hong Kong's stock market. The
other reason was that the US Federal Reserve did not lift interest
 rates.
</P>
<P>
However, he was cautiously optimistic about the future
performance of unit trusts since redemptions shot up to 260
million US dollars in the fourth quarter of 1996. Some investors
redeemed their investment funds to capture high returns on the
booming property and stock market, according to Lo.

BELGRADE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian parliament opened
a special session today on a draft law which will acknowledge the
opposition's victories in the local elections held in 14 major
cities last November.
</P>
<P>
The law, drafted and submitted to the parliament by the Serbian
government, is expected to recognize the coalition opposition's
victories, which were annulled by the ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The session, to last for a few days, was convened after
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic instructed Prime Minister
Mirko Marjanovic, on February 4, to prepare a "special law".
</P>
<P>
The parliament session will also discuss a reshuffling of the
government. Local reports said several ministers were likely to be
reshuffled and three new ministries would be appointed.
</P>
<P>
By recognizing the victory of the opposition in the local
elections, the government expected to end the daily street
demonstrations organized by the opposition which have lasted 80
days.
</P>
<P>
While demonstrations continued here today, leaders of the
coalition opposition, Zajedno, vowed to continue the protests
until all its demands were met, including the freedom of the

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today started the distribution of model guidelines to its
members to facilitate international donations of essential
medicines containing narcotic or psychotropic substances,
according to a WHO press release.
</P>
<P>
The medicines containing narcotics like morphine and pethidine
and psychotropics like sedatives and tranquilizers are needed to
treat victims of natural and man-made disasters, said WHO, but
both kinds are closely regulated by national authorities under
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
"The guidelines will assist national authorities in simplifying
their regulatory procedures for such donations, which at present
make the quick international transport of controlled drugs to
sites of emergencies virtually impossible," WHO noted. "The lack
of these medicines results in additional human suffering, by
depriving those in need of adequate pain relief and sedation."
</P>
<P>
WHO said that the procedures set forth in the model guidelines
will allow selected suppliers of these controlled medicines,
acting at the request of recognized humanitarian relief agencies,
to make international shipments in emergency situations without
prior export or import authorizations, following procedures
acceptable to control authorities and the International Narcotics
Control Board.

<HEADLINE> Upgraded Hubble to Probe Deeper Into Universe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hubble Space Telescope,
one of the finest tools of Big Science, awaits a servicing call
this week for the installation of advanced instruments which will
open a new window on the universe.
</P>
<P>
Aboard shuttle Discovery, which blasted off early this morning
with seven crew members, there are two instruments. One is the
100-million-dollar Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object
Spectrometer (NICMOS), and the other, a 120-million-dollar Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).
</P>
<P>
After replacing older science instruments with the above two,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) expected
to look farther back in space and time with the Hubble than ever
before, and have a more powerful tool in the search for black
holes, planets and details of galaxies and stars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it was possible to look back to the epoch of
galaxy formation, less than one billion years after the Big Bang,
with the new instruments.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA's schedule, following a two-day orbital
chase, Discovery will approach the telescope from directly below,
using a rendezvous procedure developed for docking with the
Russian Mir Space Station.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes well, the astronauts will use a robot arm to
pluck the Hubble at 2:52 a.m. Thursday, and mount it vertically on
a service platform in Discovery's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
In four space-walks, the astronauts will install the 765-pound
NICMOS and the 700-pound STIS in place of old hardware, and then
replace computer equipment, data recorders and other ageing
electrical and mechanical components of the telescope.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to release the upgraded Hubble back into open
space at 12:42 a.m. on February 18. Then engineers on the ground
will begin to check out and calibrate the new instruments.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Reaffirms Principle of Border Intangibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni reaffirmed here today that he is attached to the
principle of intangibility for the borders of Zaire, after holding
talks with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Museveni as saying that
he also proposed the deployment of international observers in
eastern Zaire and expressed support for the holding of an
international conference on the Great Lakes region, which Paris
described as "emergent."
</P>
<P>
The French presidential office said that talks between Museveni
and Chirac, focused on the crisis in the Great Lakes region in
central Africa, made an all inclusive review of the regional
situation, especially the situation in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Both of them described the situation in eastern Zaire as
"extremely serious and worrying" and expressed their support for a
political solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Zaire has accused Uganda, Rwanda and -- to a lesser degree --
Burundi of being involved in the fighting between its government
forces and the rebels, an accusation denied by all three nations.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and France have both warned the neighbors
of Zaire to stay out of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that Museveni, an ally of the United States, is
playing a key role in East Africa and is capable of exerting
pressure on the Tutsi rebels in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry Monday called on Museveni, who is
himself an ethnic Tutsi, to "contribute to a stop of hostilities"
in eastern Zaire.

BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland could
possibly have no say in the decision-making process in a future
border-free European Union (EU), a Dutch diplomat said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, under a proposal submitted to EU treaty negotiators,
representatives from non-EU members, Norway and Iceland, would be
allowed to vote on matters relating to the border-free lands of
the Schengen Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Many EU member states expect the 1985 Schengen Agreement, a
pact signed by most EU countries which abolishes border controls
and increases cooperation on police matters, to be extended to the
EU when a new treaty might be drawn up this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch diplomat said it would be difficult to imagine that
Schengen members such as Norway and Iceland, though they were
non-EU members, could not take part in the decision-making
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Britain has said that it will not lift its border controls,
while Ireland, which cannot join Schengen without London, has an
open border with Britain.

<HEADLINE> France Relaunches New Caledonia's Independence Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Overseas
Territories, Jean-Jacques de Peretti, left yesterday for the South
Pacific territory of New Caledonia to reopen talks on
self-determination for the island.
</P>
<P>
The government announced today that De Peretti will renew
talks with the pro-independence movement of the Kanak Socialist
National Liberation Front (FLNKS) and the pro-French Rally for
Caledonia in the Republic (PRCR).
</P>
<P>
The talks would be on a political accord on ``shared
sovereignty'' between France and New Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
He would also sign an agreement with FLNKS on the sharing of
nickel resources in two mines with the Front, in order to let
FLNKS open a nickel-processing plant in the northern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
The Kanak Front had sought ownership of nickel resources as a
pre-condition to resuming negotiations. It argues that the
northern part of the territory is economically poor.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with FLNKS and PRCR delegates in Paris on
January 30, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe vowed to do all
within the power of the government to help remove blocks to the
resumption of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS leader, Rock Wamytan, agreed to cooperate with the
French government on organizing a referendum in 1998 on on
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
France also reportedly agreed to recognize the injustices
inflicted upon the local Kanak residents when they colonized the
island in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
Paris will also provide 45 million francs (9 million U.S.
dollars) to aid Kanak students and strengthen a local university.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Funds Pour into Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The annual introduction and
utilization of overseas funds by south China's Guangdong Province
has exceeded 10 billion US dollars for three years running,
according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
The province absorbed 11.45 billion US dollars in foreign
investment in 1994, marking a major breakthrough in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
In the following two years the figure further rose to 12.1
billion and 13.9 billion US dollars, respectively, making the
province's total foreign investment over the past three years hit
37.45 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure made up 56 percent of the province's cumulative
foreign investment of 66.9 billion US dollars introduced since the
start of the country's reform and opening-up drive in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that foreign investment has effectively
injected vigor into the province's economic development and
construction.
</P>
<P>
To date, foreign funds account for around 40 percent of the
province's annual fixed assets investment. And nearly half of the
circulating capital needed by enterprises comes from foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The vigorous introduction of foreign investment has remarkably
boosted the development of the province's foreign trade and
quickened the construction of the province's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the introduction of foreign investment has helped to
create employment, as the province's 32,000 foreign-funded
enterprises employ more than seven million workers.
</P>
<P>
So far, Guangdong has absorbed overseas investors from over 70
countries and regions worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Farmers See Incomes Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The annual per capita net
income for farmers in east China's Fujian Province reached nearly
2,500 yuan in 1996, a 15 percent rise after deducting price hikes
and the highest leap since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers' per capita income from primary industry reached
1,265 yuan, thanks to the provincial government's decision to
increase agricultural investment, which rose by 13.3 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Another major source of local farmers' income is township
enterprises. The total output value from township enterprises
surpassed 250 billion yuan in Fujian last year, up more than 20
percent from the previous year and contributing a per capita
income of 661 yuan for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The province helped four counties and 101 townships shake off
poverty last year. As a result, the number of rural households
with annual income below 1,000 yuan has fallen to 2.3 percent of
the province's total, from 8.2 percent in 1995.

ABU DHABI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat has said that the coming steps toward settling the
Palestinian issue depend on how the joint committees formed with
Israel will work to examine all the outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in an interview broadcast by Abu Dhabi
television today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel would release Palestinian women detainees
either today or Wednesday, adding that some advancement would be
secured on both the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat warned of the difficulties currently experienced by the
Palestinian people in the self-rule territories, as the Israeli
siege laid on these territories gives rise to losses ranging
from 7 to 9 million U.S. dollars daily.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, had it not been for the money sent into these
territories by overseas Palestinians, a famine would have
happened.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on Arab states to help the Palestinian people
get out the difficult circumstances they are experiencing.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu Sunday, Arafat said: "The joint committees that the two
sides agreed to set up will examine all outstanding issues."
</P>
<P>
"This depends on how these committees will work and how they
execute the agreements concluded between the two sides,
especially in connection with the Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank, the release of Palestinian detainees and settling
economic questions."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Relaxes Restrictions on Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has opened its doors
to allow greater foreign investment on the island with the
implementation of a new investment policy by the Central Bank as
of today.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policy, the Central Bank has lifted a
range to restrictions on foreign ownership, making it easier for
companies to invest in Cyprus by allowing them to control a 100
percent share in certain sectors.
</P>
<P>
The new liberalization policy replaced a government decision
in 1986, which, in most cases, put a fixed ceiling of 49 percent
on foreign ownership and barred entry in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank official Iacovos Pashos was quoted today by local
media reports as saying that up to 100 percent foreign investment
will be allowed in secondary industries, retail and wholesale
trading and services.
</P>
<P>
For foreign investment in finance and insurance companies,
banks and publications, the percentage of ownership will be
judged on the merits of individual applications.
</P>
<P>
These areas were previously considered "saturated", which
meant that foreign participation in such sectors was not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
Three sectors still classified as "saturated" are land
development, operation of airlines and public utility companies,
according to the bank official.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of investment laws is part of a move to
prepare for the island's European Union (EU) accession. The
negotiations will begin six month after EU's intergovernmental
conference.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an associate member of the then European Community
(EC) since 1972, applied for full EU membership in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, applications to invest in traditional
industries were rejected, but now we are encouraging greater
foreign investment," Pashos said.
</P>
<P>
The new policy also increases the amount of money Cypriots
can invest abroad.
</P>
<P>
Cypriots investing abroad will be allowed to export a capital
sum of 500,000 Cyprus pounds (about one million U.S. dollars),
accompanied by a bank guarantee for a further 500,000 pounds
(about one million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Chamber of Commerce has voiced welcome to the
Central Bank's new policy, saying it will help revive the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Panayiotis Loizides, Secretary General of the Chamber, said
that making it easier for Cypriots to invest abroad would help
Cyprus' economy to expand in the region.

<HEADLINE> PNA Complains About Israeli Clogging Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) complained today that Israel's non-compliance has
made a greater part of the Hebron executive agreement still left
on the paper.
</P>
<P>
"Achievements of the peace should be felt on the ground," said
PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath in an interview with Voice of Arab radio here.
</P>
<P>
He said that nothing related to the Hebron accord has been
implemented so far except for an Israeli pullout from the West
Bank city and a partial opening of the Shuhada street.
</P>
<P>
Israel pulled back troops from 80 percent of Hebron in January
but the PNA has accused it of foot-dragging on the implementing
agenda to the Hebron deal signed last month.
</P>
<P>
Forming joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss
pending differences regarding the Hebron agreement was cited in
the Hebron protocol clauses.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli side clogged the work of these committees," said
the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA are due to start negotiations in eight
panels dealing with security and other issues to further
implement the 1995 Interim Agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
This was decided during a summit meeting between Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat
Sunday night at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the
autonomous Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The panels, which are called for in the recent Hebron accord,
include ones regarding the construction of an airport as well as
a seaport in Gaza and a safe passage for Palestinians between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Restore Foreign Investors' Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- When attending the Asia-Europe
Meeting in Singapore this week, Philippine officials will seek to
undo the "damage" caused by the Supreme Court ruling on the Manila
Hotel privatization bid and restore foreign investors' confidence
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said today that he will assure
investor-countries represented in the annual consultation meeting
that the country remains to be an attractive investment site.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said he would made it clear to his foreign counterparts
that the Manila Hotel incident is just "a singular case" and there
will be no repetition of it.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, the Supreme Court voided a Malaysian
consortium's winning bid to purchase the Manila Hotel and ordered
the government to sell it instead to a Philippine bidder.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the 84-year-old hotel is part of the
country's heritage and its sale to a foreign firm will violate the
"Filipinos first policy" enshrined in the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has given rise to wide concern over the country's
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
At least six foreign business chambers in the country have
expressed apprehension over the court decision, saying foreign
businessmen may choose to take their business in countries with
clear and consistent bidding procedures.
</P>
<P>
In response to the ruling, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed said earlier his country would reduce investment in the
Philippines.

<HEADLINE> "Railway Transport to Become More Competitive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- In order to tide over
difficulties in the growing fierce market competition, railway
departments across China should take the initiative to attract
travelers, with improved service and marketing.
</P>
<P>
"Under the conditions of the planned economy in the old days
railway departments lived continuously in the `Year of the Pig',
and were fed (by the government), while under the conditions of
the market economy today it is as if we are in the `Year of the
Horse', and we have to rely on ourselves and go out to look for
food," said Han Zhubin, minister of railways.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of people are turning to highways and
civil aviation for still faster or more comfortable
service. Statistics show that the number of rail passengers fell
by 12.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways will soon put into use a computerized
ticket-booking system in 44 major stations, as well as stations on
the four major Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Harbin, Beijing-Guangzhou
and Lianyungang-Lanzhou lines.
</P>
<P>
It will take travelers only minutes to enquire about and buy
train tickets, Han said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry is likely to launch a batch of
holiday and tourist trains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts are to made to increase the speed of
trains. Trains on leading trunk lines will run at more than 110
kilometers per hour (KPH) as of April 1 this year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the minister said, since the railway sector is
facing a heavy and arduous task this year, all railway workers
should further change their outmoded concepts and go all out to
expand business, so as to score new achievements in both work of
reform and development.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Set Up New Antarctic Science Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will set up a second
center for scientific studies on the Antarctic continent, the
Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries said today.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies of possible sites for the science center
would be conducted this year, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Though the first science center on the Antarctic continent,
located at the southern latitude of 62 degrees, had an advantage
for resupply, it was inconvenient for conducting research, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The second center, located at the southern latitude of 70
degrees, would cost about 100 million U.S. dollars and was
expected to be completed by 2002 at the earliest, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
After completion of the second center, the country's research
activities would expand to exploration of fish resources, and such
resources as chromium, copper, cobalt, manganese and petroleum, he
added.
</P>
<P>
So far, South Korea has conducted research of the stratosphere,
geology and biology in the area of the Antarctic continent.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four science centers have been set up by 25 countries on
the Antarctic Continent.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King, Queen Launch Polio Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian king and
queen today launched the National Immunization Days (NIDs) which
are aimed at eradicating poliomyelitis from the country by 1998.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in the Royal Palace, King Norodom Sihanouk and
Queen Monineath Sihanouk fed oral doses of polio vaccine to
hundreds of children, and distributed gifts to them and their
parents.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian senior health officials, foreign ambassadors and
representatives of international organizations attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, the King called upon his compatriots
to make a fresh push to achieve the goal of eradicating polio in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to achieve a worldwide eradication of
polio by the year 2000, the Cambodian Ministry of Health, the
World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund
have planned a series of NIDs in Cambodia. The first was launched
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Health, Chhea Thaing, said 1,768,636 children
were immunized in the first round and 1,832,533 in the second
during the NIDs in 1995 and 1,782,039 children were immunized in
the first round and 1,808,701 in the second round during the 1996
NIDs.
</P>
<P>
"The coverage for both years was 95 percent and on March 11,
1996, there were also 1,415,356 children aged 12 months to five
years who received vitamin A," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Chhea Thaing highly valued the result of the campaign in the
two years, saying the number of poliomyelitis cases in 1996
dropped by 75 percent compared with the figure in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister said 10,596 fixed vaccination posts and 461 mobile
teams consisting of 3,784 health staff and 41,832 volunteers were
working throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health also took many other measures in
fighting the disease, like spreading knowledge about polio through
the media, producing 50,000 T-shirts printed with NIDs message and
putting up loudspeakers on February 11 and March 11 to remind
people to take their children to vaccination posts to receive
vaccine.

PHNOM PENH, February 11 (Xinhua) -- King Norodom Sihanouk of
Cambodia said here today that he would ask the United Nations to
help Cambodia hold really democratic and fair elections in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the government of Cambodia does not lack goodwill
(to hold free and fair elections), but we certainly need the help
of the U.N.," Sihanouk said.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment in an interview with the United States
Cable News Network, at a ceremony in Phnom Penh to launch the
nationwide National Immunization Day.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing for sincere elections," the King said,
referring to the commune elections later this year and national
elections next year. "And now we are strengthing democracy
(although) that is fragile."
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said: "We should get help from the United
Nations... in order to make those elections fair and really
democratic and peaceful without intimidation, pressure, threats,
and violence."
</P>
<P>
The King said Cambodia was "a sovereignty country now,.. but I
think we can, even as a sovereign country, have observers and
technical aid from the U.N."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the United Nations supervised elections according to
the terms of a 1991 peace agreement signed by Cambodia's rival
political factions to put an end to two decades of war and
authoritarian rule.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Reports Grain Output Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
reported a record total grain output of 9.52 million in 1996, up 3.5
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The province's arable land now totals about two million ha, or
0.037 ha per-capita. With the rapid development of rural and urban
industries it is difficult for Fujian to increase its
grain-growing area.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's annual grain output has to increase by more than
120,000 tons annually, however, in order to keep its ratio of
grain to population steady during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities said that the way to achieve this
objective is to improve the grain strains and use advanced
technology.
</P>
<P>
They went on to note that total growing acreage for hybrid rice
has reached 889,000 ha in Fujian, and will be raised again this
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 96 percent of the seed strains will be improved ones,

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Electronic Media Urged to Help Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The electronic media in
Malaysia have been urged to complement the government's efforts to
combat social ills among youths, but not to confine their role
merely to expose the social problems besetting the people.
</P>
<P>
Reminding the private electronic media not to go overboard in
making profits to the extent of breaching National Broadcasting
Policy regulations, Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said today
the electronic media should also give priority to air informative
and educational programs rather than concentrating fully on
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Social ills like drug addiction and abandoning babies could be
overcome if the media played its role effectively, the minister
said at the Festival of Fast-breaking "Open House" in Kampung
Pasir, Tampoi, near Johor Baharu, some 370 kilometers southeast
from here, according to the Malaysian news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was reviewing the National Broadcasting
Policy to tackle the social ills plaguing the people and
monitoring programs of private radio and television stations to
gauge to what extent they confirm with the country's requirements.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry through the monitoring unit was keeping
tab not only on foreign radio and television programs but also on
those produced locally.
</P>
<P>
He issued a warning that if the media failed to observe
provisions spelt out explicitly in the policy, the government will
revoke their broadcasting license.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was necessary as the government did not want
the people to blame the authorities if the social ills worsened
following lack of control over radio and television programs.

<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir, the national-flag
carrier of Egypt, has been allowed by the United Nations Security
Council Committee on Sanctioning Libya to transport Libyan
pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Today's Egyptian Arabic newspaper Al-Akhbar quoted an EgyptAir
official as saying that the same rules applied in the past couple
of years will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
The move comes to relieve the sufferings that Libyan pilgrims
face in traveling on land or by sea.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir will operate 90 flights to carry 11,000 Libyan
pilgrims from the Libyan capital of Tripoli and the second
largest city of Benghazi to Mecca, the Islamic holy site,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, Libya sent one plane of pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia for the Hadj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, in violation
of the U.N. sanctions that limit diplomatic contacts, ban arms
sales and prohibit air traffic in and out of the country.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, Egypt stepped in to fly the pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed the sanctions in April 1992 after Libya
refused to surrender suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan AM
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Two
Libyan nationals were suspected of conducting the bomb attack.

He said that instead of undertaking war games, both countries
have agreed to conduct smaller activities such as simulation
exercises, discussions and other mind games.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said the joint military exercises were concealed
because the Philippine government wanted to review the policy on
how to handle cases involving foreign soldiers who would be
charged of a crime while participating in a joint military
exercise in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have previously agreed to hold a joint
military exercise codenamed "Balikatan '97" this month, with the
participation of 5,000 soldiers, including 3,000 troops from the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
But this has to be canceled, along with another war game called
"Handa '97", because the proposed Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA) between the two countries is still being reviewed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said the Justice Department has given its legal opinion
on the issue and has stressed the need to "reword" the proposed
SOFAs to the satisfaction of both parties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said that although
all the joint military exercises with other countries have been
suspended, the country will continue to allow port calls of
foreign ships for refueling, rest and recreation activities for a
limited period.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has not received any complaints from
other countries about the suspension, adding that they "understand
these things have been explained to them already".
</P>
<P>
The Philippines had already signed Memorandum of Agreements
(MOA) with France, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the United
Kingdom and South Korea, but the MOAs did not address the status
of visiting foreign soldiers in the country. So the Philippines is
holding talks with these countries in a bid to sign the SOFAs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines does not have an MOA with the U.S., but its
military troops still regularly conduct war games with the U.S.
soldiers as part of the Mutual Defense Treaty between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
De Villa said he hoped the review on all MOAs will be finished
before the end of the year so that they can proceed with the
drafting of SOFAs and have them ratified by the Senate before
conducting any war games.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the U.S., the UK and Singapore were also
scheduled to hold combined military exercises with the Philippines
this year.

<HEADLINE> OAU, U.N. Hold Seminar on Refugee Issue in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) held a one-day seminar today on mobilizing resources and
raising public awareness for refugees in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The seminar discussed the problems and challenges of
mobilizing resources for refugees in Africa and the strategies
for generating and maintaining public interest in refugees
there.
</P>
<P>
Osman Elsayed, the First Vice Chairman of the OAU Commission
of 20 on Refugees, said the situation of refugees and displaced
people in Africa is continuing to worsen.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the seminar can help accelerate the process
of seeking lasting solution to the refugee and humanitarian
crisis in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The asylum countries are continuing to bear a heavy burden in
carrying the load of assisting refugees. Environment in the
asylum countries is being affected a great deal," Elsayed said.
</P>
<P>
He said his commission, the supreme organ in charge of
refugees and displaced persons in Africa and just next to the OAU
Minister Council and Summit, has the duty of putting forward the
profiles of the uprooted people on the continent to the world.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR regional liaison representative for Africa David Lambo
said that Africa hosts more refugees and internally displaced
persons than any other continent.
</P>
<P>
"Humanitarian assistance in Africa has reached a critical
point" where the number of refugees go on to rise and need more
aid from African countries and the international community, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is becoming more difficult for African countries and
international community to maintain their support, he said.
</P>
<P>
Refugees and displaced people in Africa has shot up over
recent years. In 1969, there were about one million refugees on
the continent. Now, Africa has nearly seven million refugees and
more internally displaced people. enditem

<HEADLINE> India Considers Ban on Import of Critical Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Ministry of
Environment and Forests has proposed a ban on the import of
critical chemical wastes containing asbestos dust and fiber,
beryllium, thallium, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides and
their residues, The Economic Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it is also keen to impose a ban on the import of
chemical wastes that contain hexavalent chromium, waste oils and
other wastes that have poly-chlorinated biphenyls,
poly-chlorinated terephenyls and poly-brominated biphenyls.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already issued a notification prohibiting the
import of certain chemical wastes that contain mainly cyanide,
mercury and arsenic.
</P>
<P>
The user industries are keenly awaiting the decision of the
ministry on the proposed import controls. If the ban covers
metallic wastes, industries like agriculture and mines will be
affected because the wastes are being imported mainly by these two
industries for recycling.

<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- At a marathon meeting chaired by Prime Minister Alain Juppe on
Monday, high school students, entrepreneurs, trade unions and
government officials agreed to replace the old pre-requirement for
job application, called graduating stages, with a simpler and easier
professional training requirement. They also agreed to cooperate in
arranging professional training opportunities for 400,000 youths
this year.
</P>
<P>
-- The Basque separatist group ETA launched two attacks in the
Spanish cities of Grenada and Madrid in the past few days. After
making a car bomb attack in Grenada, ETA members shot dead Rafael
Martinez Emperador, a judge of the Spanish Supreme Tribunal which
ordered last week the preventive detention of five leaders of Herri
Batasuna, the political wing of ETA.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Several cities in French provinces have been affected by a
three-week long strike of bus drivers who are demanding early
retirement at 55 and shorter working week. Marseille, Toulouse,
Nice, Cannes, Dijon, Clermont-Ferrand and Reims were most touched by
the strike.
</P>
<P>
-- The victory of the far-right National Front party in the
municipal election of Vitrolles, southern France, aroused concern
from the government, the leftwing oppositions and the rightwing
ruling majority. The rise of FN also shows the existence of a gap
between the ideas of the country's political leaders and public
opinions.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Foreign Exchange Reserves Decline Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves registered a sharp fall in January this year, according
to the Bank of Korea here today.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange holdings stood at 31 billion
U.S. dollars as of the end of January this year, down 2.24 billion
from 33.24 billion at the end of last year, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The January decrease was in stark contrast with November and
December when foreign exchange reserves rose by 90 million and 920
million U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank blamed the January fall primarily on the soaring trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the country's exports stood at 9.11 billion U.S.
dollars, down 8.2 percent from a year earlier, while imports
amounted to 12.59 billion U.S. dollars, up 4.5 percent, to record
a trade deficit of 3.48 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange holdings hit a record high of
36.56 billion U.S. dollars at the end of June last year, but have
since then showed declines to 35.06 billion in July, 33.56 billion
in August, 32.48 billion in September and 32.2 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves refer to foreign currencies held by
the central bank to brace for international payment contingencies
and ensure exchange rate stability in the event of market jitters.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommends that a nation
should retain foreign exchange reserves equivalent to at least
three months' import bills.
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that South Korea's average monthly imports of
12 billion U.S. dollars, the central bank's foreign exchange
reserves appear short of the proper level," a bank official said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to have Less Industrial Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 11 (Xinhua)-- Industrial investments in
Sweden will drop six percent this year, breaking a trend of
three years of steady increase, the Confederation of Swedish
Industry predicted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, industrial investments in this country increased by
about 14 percent. The confederation contributed the decline to a
cyclic development that big firms have completed their major
investment programs.
</P>
<P>
"One hopes that small and mid-sized firms will fill up the gap, but
it doesn't look like that will happen," said Ola Virin, economist from
the confederation.

COLOMBO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Liam Fox, parliamentary
under-secretary of state at the British Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, left here this evening for Pakistan after paying a two-day
visit to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he held talks with Sri Lankan Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar Monday. They exchanged views on Sri
Lanka's political situation and shared perceptions on regional and
international developments, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed attempts to counter international
terrorism, particularly measures aimed at giving effect to the
1996 UN Declaration on Terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Fox noted that a private members bill had already been moved in
the British parliament in this connection, which would facilitate
prosecution of those who conspire in the UK to commit terrorist
acts abroad, which is presently not an offense under British Law.
</P>
<P>
He also called on several Sri Lankan ministers and had a
meeting with the leader of opposition Ranil Wickremasinghe.

Then he thumb-printed his voter card.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated NECON on being able to make the arrangement
for starting the registration on schedule.
</P>

the country's five political parties and NECON for creating new
local governments and the then approaching Ramadan fast of
Moslems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his wife Mariam Abacha urged Nigerian women to come
out and register.

<HEADLINE> US-Australia Military Operation Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Proposed US-Australia
military operation came under questioning today when Environment
Minister Robert Hill revealed in federal parliament that 50 smoke
grenades had been lost overboard from a U.S. ship preparing to
take part in the military operation.
</P>
<P>
Social activists expressed concerns about this problem and
questioned the need for the joint military exercise -- Tandem
Thrust -- to be held off the north Queensland coast within the
area of Shoalwater Bay next month.
</P>
<P>
Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Organization president Ted
Loveday said the grenades could be a problem if they were in an
area used by trawlers. Following World War II, a lot of ammunition
had been dumped at sea off the Queensland coast, according to a
press release from Brisbane, Queensland.
</P>
<P>
Queensland Conservation Council coordinator Imogen Zethoven
said her council was opposed to the exercise to be held in the
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area.
</P>
<P>
"The area is already under threat, with 17,000 US troops and
5,000 Australian troops moving into the area as well as a
nuclear-powered submarine. The threat to the environment is
tremendous," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Why are we doing it? who are our enemies that we have to have
this sort of operation?" she queried. "Tens of millions of dollars
are being spent on this operation, and Australians should be
demanding answers about why their tax dollars are being spent on
the exercise."

<HEADLINE> Israel to Hold Road Show in Gulf State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Koor Industries Ltd.,
Israeli largest industrial concern, will send a delegation on an
investors' road show to one of the Gulf states later this year
following Israel's improved relations with neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jerusalem Post published today,
Koor's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Benjamin Gaon
offered a broad assessment of the relationship between big
business and the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Gaon, who would not specify exactly when the event will take
place or in which country, said the plan reflects improvement in
Israeli business relations with neighboring countries following
the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I can not go into details...," Gaon said. "It is enough of a
statement that it is kosher, which means it is not a secret."
</P>
<P>
As an open supporter of Israel's Labor Party chairman Shimon
Peres' reelection bid, Gaon said the peace process is
continuing under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and its
benefits are beginning to be felt throughout the business
community.
</P>
<P>
While the Arab boycott is less acute, he pointed to improved
relations with countries such as Indonesia, India, China and
Japan as a real proof of Israel's expanding circle of business
partners.
</P>
<P>
"Being an Israeli entrepreneur and an Israeli businessman is
no longer a liability, in fact, it has become an asset
worldwide," Gaon said. "I do not have to apologize that I am an
Israeli or to hide my identity."
</P>
<P>
According to Gaon, the real change in business climate took
place following the Middle East and North Africa economic
summit in the Egyptian capital of Cairo last November.
</P>
<P>
Gaon said that unlike the 1995 regional business conference in
Casablanca, Morocco, where some 250 enthusiastic Israeli
businessmen descended on the north African country with billion
U.S.-dollar business proposals, Arab and Israeli delegates
discussed more realistic deals in the range of 20-30 million
dollars, at last year's event.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent visit here by Ibrahim Kamel, an Egyptian
business tycoon and the Cairo-based Kato conglomerate's CEO,
followed their acquaintance during the conference.
</P>

"I insisted that if he came to Israel he would do so in the

</P>
<P>
Since then, unconfirmed reports by The Financial Times have
claimed that Kato purchased 60 million dollars worth of Koor's
shares, a batch which would add up to a 5 percent stake in the
holding company.
</P>
<P>
But Gaon said that he "had no idea" about the size of the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
Recently warming business relations with Cairo have also led
Koor to consideration of participating in the Egyptian
government's privatization efforts, specifically in the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Koor, which has also been deeply involved in the Palestinian
National Authority's accelerated construction activity, is now
beginning to look for opportunities in its telecommunications
sector.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia to Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Multi-national firms are
expected to pour more investments into Asia in the years ahead due
to the healthy economic operations in the region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, the Asian economy grew at an average
rate of 7 percent compared with an average of less than 3 percent
for industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Despite a slowdown in the export growth last year, the Asian
economy grew 7.2 percent and the momentum will be kept this year,
according to economists in the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The high growth rate will attract more foreign investors
because they want to be part of that, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A French government survey released late last month said that
multi-national firms are expected to shift some investments from
the United States and Western Europe to Asia.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, China, followed by Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia
are expected to attract the largest foreign investments over the
next five years, it said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which included interviews with 310 international
corporations and experts, said that Africa and the Middle East had
little appeal for multi-national corporations because of
"perceived political risk" and limited growth prospects compared
with other developing countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than half of total global foreign investment
is concentrated in Western Europe and North America. But since
1992, there has been already a market shift in favor of developing
economies, which captured 40 percent of worldwide inflows in
1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
As Asia is likely to remain the world's fastest growing region
beyond this century, the region will attract more foreign
investments in the years ahead, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Such a view is shared by the Institute of International
Finance, a Washington-based research group. The institute said
that Asia will continue to bag more than half of all the private
capital flowing into the world's emerging economies, despite the
recent export slowdown and stock market weakness in parts of the
region.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that eight Asian developing countries will absorb
a combined 136.2 billion dollars in direct and portfolio
investments, commercial loans and bond sales this year, or 59
percent of all the private flows going to the 30 major emerging
economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
The eight Asian countries are China, India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
But the group expects the Asian portion will grow moderately by
5 percent this year from the 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is being proved by the present foreign
investment tendency in the region. Recently, representatives of
seven California pension funds with combined assets of 234 billion
U.S. dollars scoured the region for investments.
</P>
<P>
Asian fund managers said that the presence of the U.S. fund
managers reflected renewed interest in Asia after the slumps of
1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The renewed interest by U.S. pension funds signaled an
awareness that Asia was healthier economically than many suspected
last year.
</P>
<P>
Even as a drastic fall in semiconductor prices and softer-than-
expected growth in demand for certain other electronic components
badly dented exports across Asia last year, foreign companies are
pumping record sums into new manufacturing in the region.
</P>
<P>
While Singapore announced recently record new electronics
investments, factories continue to sprout up across Malaysia,
Thailand and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers said that though cyclical factors caused
electronics export growth to slow last year, the electronics
industry has many years of booming growth ahead. And that is why
they have been sinking money into Asia despite export slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that new electronics investment is coming to Asia
for several reasons, including the relatively low cost of labor,
attractive investment incentives, proximity to component
suppliers, and in particular a fast growing consumer market
stimulated by the fast economic growth.
</P>
<P>
All these tendencies indicate that Asia, with the continuation
of its healthy economic growth in the coming years, will see more
foreign investors pouring their money into the region.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Predicts 9 Percent Growth Rate for India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- India is a potential
economic powerhouse comparable to China and other East Asian
countries and can achieve a nine percent growth rate by 2005-2006,
the World Bank has said.
</P>
<P>
In a report published recently, the World Bank said India has
the potential to accelerate its rate of economic growth from seven
percent in 1995-1996 to eight percent by the end of this decade
and progressively reach nine percent by 2005-2006, according to
The Hindustan Times today.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve such a growth rate, India must make
significant progress in attracting foreign and domestic private
investment to all the areas of the economy and in particular,
infrastructure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under this growth scenario, the Indian government is assumed to
pursue its outward-oriented strategy more aggressively through
significant reduction in the rate of protection, including the
consumer goods industries.

<HEADLINE> HK Float Driver Cried for Whole Night after Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- "I felt guilty and terribly
sad at knowing of the death and injuries and I cried for the
whole night after the accident," said the driver of a float which
killed British tourist Brenda Stevens and injured 31 others in a
Lunar New Year parade here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wong Wai-kwok, 48, lapsed into a coma after inhaling toxic
levels of carbon monoxide suspected to be leaked from two electric
generators fitted to the vehicle to provide power for lighting and
moving parts for the celebration, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
The float then careered onto a packed pavement causing the
fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
"I felt terribly hot after the generators and lights were all
turned on during the parade," Wong said Monday from his hospital
bed.
</P>
<P>
He said he even did not realize he was falling unconscious. "I
just felt very hot," he added.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that he closed the windows and turned on the
air-conditioner after driving about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle moved at a very low speed, of only five kilometers
per hour, and the driver for 28 years believed "it was impossible
to have any accident to happen."
</P>
<P>
The vehicle passed safety checks last Wednesday, but the light
bulb decorations were not fitted until Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wong, a father of three, said that he would not quit despite of
what had happened and he might drive a float in the future.
</P>
<P>
A tourist guide who had taken 45-year-old Stevens sightseeing
in Hong Kong has identified her body and a post-mortem examination
is expected within the next two days, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Cover-Up of U.S. Use of Radioactive Bullets Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese local press reported
today that U.S. warplanes accidentally fired more than 1,500
radioactive bullets during exercises in Okinawa Prefecture in
southwestern Japan in late 1995 and early 1996.
</P>
<P>
But Tokyo was not informed of the incident by Washington until
last month, the reports said, quoting the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration have regretted the incident and the
late notification. It was not clear why the notification was
delayed for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday expressed
indignation over the U.S. handling of the matter, saying, "The
slow notification is more of a problem" than the inadvertent
firing of radioactive bullets.
</P>
<P>
The local government of Okinawa criticized the central
government for not informing Okinawa of the matter until Monday.
</P>
<P>
The incident came amid growing resentments against
U.S. military presence on Okinawa, site of one of the most
important U.S. military bases in the Pacific, where two-thirds of
the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are stationed.
</P>
<P>
The resentments were even heightened since the rape of a
Japanese schoolgirl in September 1995 by three U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
During the routine shooting exercises on December 5 and 7, 1995
and January 24, 1996 over the uninhabited coral island of
Torishima, about 100 kilometers west of Okinawa Prefecture's main
island, the 1,520 bullets which contained depleted uranium were
fired accidentally by U.S. Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier jets, said
the reports.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials have said the bullets, each of which
contained 5.2 ounces of depleted uranium, posed no danger, and are
only as radioactive as old color TV sets.
</P>
<P>
However, the use of such bullets is not allowed on training
ranges except at certain sites on the U.S. mainland under
U.S. Marine Corps regulations.
</P>
<P>
Washington explained that the incident happened because the
bullets were wrongly labeled, said the reports.

COLOMBO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The volume of cargo handled by
the Sri Lanka's port of Colombo increased 20 percent from 17.4
million tons in 1995 to 20.9 million tons in 1996, according to
the port sources today.
</P>
<P>
The port handled 1,356,300 transshipment containers in 1996, 29
percent more than the 1995 figure of 1,049,000.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the port of Colombo has clearly captured
an additional share from the regional transshipment market.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the increase is the entry of New Consortium
Lines in 1996 into the port of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo Port Authority expects to handle 1,550,000
transshipment containers in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Tell Clinton Principles for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu will inform U.S. President Bill Clinton of the
principles that will guide Israel in the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks when they meet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's aides were quoted by today's English daily The
Jerusalem Post as saying that he would also tell Clinton the
extent of Israeli further troop pullouts on the West Bank, which
are scheduled for March 7.
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be a good idea for the Americans to know
the basic outlines of our thinking on final status," one aide
said, adding Netanyahu would only reveal the general principles
instead of an exact map.
</P>
<P>
The extent of further pullouts is one of the two key subjects
discussed in the recent high-level consultations between
Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Foreign Minister
David Levy, Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak, Army Planning
chief Shaul Mofaz and Netanyahu's senior aides.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu wants the Americans to understand Israel's stance
before the final-status talks begin next month, believing that
failure to make it clear could mean that Israel would be
isolated internationally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's cabinet meeting, government ministers were
briefed by senior security officials on a general overview of
the Oslo process -- its past, present and future. Mordechai,
Shahak and Mofaz also outlined Israel's strategic interests on
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During their Thursday summit, Netanyahu is also expected to
discuss with Clinton the thorny issue of reopening talks with
Syria. Clinton has said that he was waiting for Netanyahu's
proposed formula for renewing the talks.
</P>
<P>
But both Israeli and U.S. officials believed at this stage
that it would be impossible to restart the Syrian track within
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
While Israel has repeatedly called for resuming talks without
preconditions, Syria is insisting that the talks restart from
"where they left off," namely Israel's full withdrawal from the
occupied Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Make 380 Million Long-Distance Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Chinese
capital have made and received a total of 380 million
long-distance phone calls in the past year.
</P>
<P>
As the city has 1.11 million authorized long-distance call
users, each of them made an average of 343 such calls in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sources claim that the local telecommunications industry has
enjoyed a fast growth. In 1985, there were only 4,000 authorized
long-distance phone users. The figure increased to 32,000 in 1990,
804,900 in 1995 and 1.11 million in 1996, among which 66 percent
are private phone users.
</P>
<P>
The soar in number of phone users has made the long-distance
international and domestic calls rise by 15 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, local residents were complaining about
difficulties of how to make long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
Following the popularization of telephones and improvement of
phone services, long-distance calls have been made more available
and various services are staged, including the "200", "800" and
"290" card services when the cost of the call can be automatically
recorded on the cards.
</P>
<P>
International call charges have been reduced by 20 percent in
Beijing during the traditional Spring Festival season, and the
practice will also be effective on three other national holidays,
International Labor Day, the National Day and the New Year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city reported an increase of 188,000 telephone
users, while the whole country added 15 million lines to its
telephone switching capacity, bringing the total to 100 million
lines.
</P>
<P>
China readjusted rates for its telephone services last
December, with a reduction of 30 percent for international calls.

<HEADLINE> Bids to Halt Gunmen Sneaking into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
taken measures at check points along its borders with Zaire to
halt gunmen masquerading as refugees to sneak into the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has intensified the screening of Zairean
refugees fleeing the escalated armed conflicts in eastern Zaire
as more boats carrying asylum seekers are expected to dock at
Mpulungu Port at Lake Tanganyika in northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Eight armed arrivals were detained by police at the harbor
last week, local press today quoted Home Affairs Deputy Minister
Peter Muunga as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people disguising as refugees have been denied
entry into Zambia following the tight screening process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the refugees throw their guns in the water when they
know they are about to reach peaceful land" and report themselves
to the Zambian authorities at points of entry, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, all refugees once under suspicion of carrying guns
will not be allowed entry, Muunga stressed.
</P>
<P>
Some refugees argued they carry guns for fear that they might
be attacked by rebels who were fighting the Zairean government
troops on their way to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,300 refugees have entered Zambia since February 5
and more refugees are still waiting at the points of entry.

HARBIN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ma Changxin, a self-employed
businessman, looks forward to visiting Hong Kong on July 1 when
the island returns to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He is only one of those who want to visit HK this year in
Harbin, the capital city of northeast China's Heilongjiang
province.
</P>
<P>
"To visit HK and have a look is one of my dreams," said Ma, who
had gone to some well-known scenery spots in the country, such as
the Great Wall, Mount Huangshan, Mount Tai, as well as the
life-sized terracotta horses and armored warriors.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of people's living standards, traveling to
south China, even to Southeast Asia, has become a new trend among
residents in Harbin, the city of ice and snow.
</P>
<P>
Local travel agency sources said that at least one group left
for HK, Macao, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand each week since
last December.
</P>
<P>
And the number of tourists have seen a rapid growth during the
Spring Festival, they added.
</P>
<P>
Each day there is a flight from Harbin to Guangzhou with nearly
150 seats available, which still could not meet the demands of
local residents.
</P>
<P>
Sources also said that both air and rail tickets to south China
and HK have long been sold out before the Spring Festival.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Law Protects Overseas Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has issued a regulation to protect overseas donations for
public-spirited activities.
</P>
<P>
This law, the first such regional rule in the country, is aimed
at upgrading the management of such donations in the province,
which is the native place for many residents in neighboring Hong
Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Between 1978 and 1995, the province received a total of 170,000
donations worth 14.3 billion yuan (about 1.7 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among the donations, 42 percent are for 260,000 public-spirited
projects, including schools, hospitals, gymnasiums, science
museums, homes for the elders, kindergartens, highways and bridges.
</P>
<P>
The new rule specifies principles, rights and benefits,
management and legal responsibilities concerning the donations.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the volunteer principle of donating and its
public-spirited nature, and prohibits any persuasion or forced
donations.
</P>
<P>
The rule requires the people concerned to ensure sound
management of the donations and offers preferential policies to
the projects built with donations.
</P>
<P>
According to Fu Shengrong, deputy director of the provincial
overseas Chinese affairs department, Guangdong is a province which
has the biggest number of regulations conerning the overseas
Chinese issue.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Boss Refuses to Appear Before Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Beleaguered COMESA boss Bingu
Wa Mutharika has refused to cooperate with an investigation team
set up by the council of ministers to probe various complaints
against him, ''the herald'' paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sources told the Herald from Lusaka, Zambia, headquarters of
the Common Market of East and Southern Africa (COMESA), that
COMESA executive secretary Wa Mutharika had turned down
invitations to appear before the probe team which has already
begun its work on the instruction of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary, who is on forced leave pending
completion of the investigations, had threatened he would not
cooperate with the investigators because the ministers had
allegedly exceeded their authority.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika has also charged that it is a witch-hunt
perpetuated by the government of Malawi through Chairman
Chakakala Chaziya because they believed he was involved in the
internal politics of Malawi and wanted to stand in the
presidential elections against Bakili Muluzi.
</P>
<P>
But the allegations of maladministration and financial
mismanagement were made by senior COMESA officials and presented
to member countries in the form of a confidential document. It is
on the basis of the investigation and the instruction of the
ministers that all the allegations be presented to Wa Mutharika
so that he could answer for himself.

<HEADLINE> Cover-Up of U.S. Use of Radioactive Bullets Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes accidentally
fired more than 1,500 radioactive bullets during exercises in
Okinawa Prefecture in southwestern Japan in late 1995 and early
1996, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
But Tokyo was not informed of the incident by Washington until
last month, the reports said, quoting the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government told the Japanese government that the
accident occurred because the bullets were incorrectly labeled,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday expressed
indignation over the U.S. handling of the matter, saying, "The
slow notification is more of a problem" than the inadvertent
firing of radioactive bullets.
</P>
<P>
The central government informed the Okinawa prefectural
government Monday about the incident, the reports said. The local
government criticized the central government for the belated
notification.
</P>
<P>
The incident came amid growing sentiment against U.S. military
presence on Okinawa, which was whipped up by the rape of a
Japanese schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen.

<HEADLINE> Broad Prospects Evident for Zhuhai-Macao Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- As good neighbors,
supplementary economic cooperation between Zhuhai and Macao will
enjoy an even brighter future, according to local economists.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai, one of the country's five special economic zones in
south China's Guangdong province, is exploring more ways for
economic cooperation with neighboring Macao.
</P>
<P>
Analysts claim that Macao has many advantages in developing its
economy, especially the export-oriented economy. First of all, it
is a free port city which boasts flexible and modernized
mangement, especially in the international banking sector.
</P>
<P>
And Macao, as member of the international trade organization,
has trade and economic links with more than 100 countries and
regions, enjoying a great potential in the international market.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Macao economy has cherished an all-round
growth and formed fine structures in the export-oriented
processing industry, tourism and lottery, property, finance and
insurance businesses, which all have great potential for further
growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhuhai is a booming city in the Pearl River Delta
and now has five major development zones: the State-Level New and
High Technology Zone, the Hongwan Bonded Zone, the Henqing
Development Zone, the Aviation City and the Ninggang
Heavy-Chemistry Zone.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the improved investment environment and the
rich land resources have served to provide good chances for
domestic and overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Now, Zhuhai has a labor force of some 300,000, plus hundreds of
thousands of transient workers. Since pilot reform started in the
city a decade ago, it has absorbed tens of thousands of high-level
technical and managerial personnel.
</P>
<P>
Experts urge the two cities to focus their cooperation on
sectors of international trade, finance, tourism, transportation,
consultancy, commerce, new and high technology and manufacturing,
in an effort to give full play to their respective advantages.
</P>
<P>
The two places should consider the establishment of high-level
industrial bases to help renovate their existing industries and
pay more attention to developing the heavy-chemistry and raw
material industries, experts add.
</P>
<P>
Policy-makers are suggested to help explore markets in European
countries and open flight routes and marketing systems with these
countries.

Habib.
</P>
<P>
"We must fully support the commitment of our nations' leaders
who are in the fore-front to ensure that people in east Africa
are cooperating in all sectors for the mutual benefit of our
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan envoy callled upon importers in Tanzania to visit the
exhibition so as to meet Kenya exporters and exchange ideas. They
could cover issues like trade exhibitions and make business contacts
with agents of Kenyan companies in the country, the Kenyan envoy
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Habib said, Tanzanians should also conduct trade
exhibition in Kenya in order to show Tanzanian goods to Kenyans.

record to 31-1. Montiel fell to 33-3.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was originally supposed to have fought Montiel last
September but the champion broke a hand sparring. He had not
fought since his first defense, an eighth-round knockout of Raul
Juarez last August.
</P>
<P>
Montiel's eight-fight win streak was snapped by Johnson, the
first African-American world flyweight king.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet today said that 1997 would be the year for Vietnam to start
improving infrastructure so as to meet the demands for the
country's industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
In a special Lunar New Year interview with the Vietnam news
agency, the prime minister said special attention should be paid
to improving national, provincial as well as inter-village road
systems.
</P>
<P>
That would be the major task to bring about a breakthrough in the
industrialization process, he said, adding that the task should be
done without let-up till at least the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
To improve people's livelihood, maintain economic growth, curb
inflation and overcome aftermath of the 1996 floods would be other
four tasks for the government to accomplish in 1997, Kiet added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the strength of the Vietnamese people was what
had enabled the country to defend and build itself throughout its
thousand-year-old history and the strength was now called upon
again to make the country an industrialized and modern one equal
to other nations in the world.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Regulate NGO Activities in Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
preparing a list of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the
environmental protection sector in the country with a view to
regulating their activities, officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
A seminar organized by the Ministry of Population and
Environment opened here Monday with the objective of fostering
better coordination between the government and non-governmental
sectors and implementing environmental protection programs in an
integrated manner, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to them, about 700 NGOs so far have been registered
under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Minister Prakash Man Singh said at the seminar that
environmental protection programs launched through
service-oriented NGOs become less expensive and more effective.
</P>
<P>
Such programs would become sustainable as they attract maximum
public participation, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, development officials here often accused local
environmental NGOs of blocking development activities because of
their persistent opposition to some proposed major hydropower
projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba described some environmental
NGOs and activists as "anti-developmental forces" when he
inaugurated the construction of a medium-size hydropower project
in West Nepal last week.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Counters Baht-Dollar Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand
has kept short-term interest rates high and stable in a move to
counter speculation in the baht-dollar exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the central bank, i.e., the Bank of Thailand, fixed
the mid-rate at 25.90 baht a dollar, two satang lower than Friday,
the last trading day.
</P>
<P>
The US dollar has continued to rise against major currencies
since late last year. The Thai currency, baht, has also been
depreciating against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
As the trend of the dollar appreciation is predicted to
continue, speculators have enjoyed making profits from the trend.
</P>
<P>
To counter speculation in the baht-dollar exchange rate, the
central bank has kept the interbank rate high in the 15-16 percent
range.
</P>
<P>
The interbank rate is the short-term rate charged on loans
borrowed among commercial banks. A high interbank rate will raise
the cost of speculations on the exchange rate of the baht and the
dollar, thus it will increase the risk of speculating.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the return on speculation will be less attractive.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some foreign traders with bases in
Singapore have continuously spread rumors that the baht would be
devalued despite repeated denials of such rumors by the Bank of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand had intervened by selling dollars against
baht on Singapore markets to boost the confidence of investors.
</P>
<P>
Both Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan and the central bank
governor Rerngchai Marakanond had declared that the central bank
would put up strong fight against such speculations.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is confident that, with huge foreign reserves
of 38 billion US dollars, equivalent to six month's imports, it
will be able to defend the baht.
</P>
<P>
However, many investors believed that the rumors of baht
devaluation would come true as there were some factors supporting
the rumors.
</P>
<P>
The revenue shortfall during the first quarter of the 1997
fiscal year, which started on October 1, 1996, was one of them.
During the last nine consecutive years the country had always had
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's export performance last year was very
poor, suffering a drop of 0.1 percent from 1995, the first decline
in decades.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Accelerates Development of Mobile Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Mobile telephones have become
more common in both urban and rural areas in Vietnam after the
recent application of advanced telecommunication technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available, two national mobile phone
networks -- VMS and Vinaphone -- and the Ho Chi Minh city based
Call-Link are now in operation with nearly 74,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
VMS is a joint venture between Sweden and Vietnam Post and
Telecommunications (VNPT). The joint venture, which was
established nearly five years ago, has recorded an annual growth
rate of 250 percent over the past two years, with the number of
subscribers increasing from 3,500 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 and
51,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
VMS has built 120 relay stations, including 40 stations in Ho
Chi Minh city, the country's biggest commercial hub, to help
extend telephone coverage to 32 provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
The company is also striving to extend its international phone
coverage to Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Vinaphone was set up in June 1996 by VNPT, which has a 100
percent stake in the company. It has commissioned mobile phones
for 8,000 subscribers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Call-Link was the first mobile telephone network installed in
the country and has some 15,000 subscribers in southern
Vietnam. Using analogue technologies, Call-Link is facing tough
competition from VMS and Vinaphone, which use modern digital
technologies.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Poland's gross domestic product
(GDP) increased six percent in 1996 over the previous year,
slightly lower than the seven percent record growth rate in 1995,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rzeczpospolita, one of the country's major newspapers, said
that 1996 was the fifth year in a row for Poland to see economic
growth since the country began to recover from the massive
upheavals caused by the radical reforms started in 1989.
</P>
<P>
GDP rose 2.6 percent in 1992 and 3.8 percent and 5.2 percent
respectively in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in 1996 increased by 8.5 percent compared
with 1995 and the agricultural output rose 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Production was stimulated by fixed capital investment, which
grew by 21.6 percent, and consumption, which rose by 7.2 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Poland's foreign trade grew strongly during the country's
transition to a market economy, but imports grew much faster than
exports. The trade deficit in the first three months of 1996
reached 8.3 billion U.S. dollars, compared with a budget forecast
of 3.8 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Appoints Ousted Speaker as Crimean Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukranian President Leonid Kuchma
on Monday appointed Vasili Kiselev, ousted parliamentary speaker
of the autonomous Crimean Republic, as his new permanent
representative to the peninsula to enforce Ukraine's control over
the mostly Russian-populated area.
</P>
<P>
Kiselev was dismissed as chairman of Crimea's parliament on
February 6 after a majority of deputies endorsed a no-confidence
motion against him, the Ukrainian Telegraph News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The move was one of several decisions taken by the pro-Russian
parliament to get rid of the government backed by Kuchma and to
expand its own powers.
</P>
<P>
It adopted a no-confidence motion on January 23, calling for
the government to step down. The motion said the government would
stop functioning and be replaced by a Council of Ministers to be
formed by February 5.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded that Crimean Prime Minister Arkady Demidenko
be sacked and replaced by the new chairman of the Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Kiselev called the move "a serious mistake" and "an apparent
challenge to the president" and Kuchma declared the motion
illegal, handing the case to the Ukrainian Constitutional Court
for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth time in three years that the Crimean
parliament, which is mainly pro-Russian, has voted to bring down
the government.
</P>
<P>
The republic was part of Russia for nearly two centuries but
was incorporated into Ukraine by the Soviet authorities in
1954. It has threatened several times to secede since Ukraine
gained independence in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Aquatic Exports Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's aquatic exports
reached 670 million U.S. dollars in 1996, a 22 percent increase
over 1995 and four times 1991's level.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the aquatic sector ranked fourth
in the country's export industries after rice, crude oil and
garment producers.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the growth of aquatic exports to the
increase in the variety of products exported to nearly 100,
including fresh, frozen, semi-processed, dried and instant aquatic
products.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's main export market is Japan, which buys 65 percent of
Vietnam's acquatic exports, followed by the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
But the sector is facing a shortage of investment for buying
new equipment and inadequate access to new technology needed to
develop processed products, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Military Court to Retry Former Nazi Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Former SS Captain Erich Priebke
should be tried for a second time in a military court for his
admitted part in a 1944 massacre during World War Two, Italy's
Court of Cassation ruled today.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the country's highest court ended a two-month
dispute between the military and civil courts who both declared
they had no jurisdiction over the case.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, now 83, is charged with participation in the massacre
of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves near Rome on March 24,
1944, was extradited from Argenitina to Italy to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
He was tried for the first time by a military court last
year. He was found guilty but the court decided that he
was no longer liable for punishment under the statute of
limitations.
</P>
<P>
The verdict caused an outcry among the public and opposition
and Priebke was rearrested that night after relatives of the
massacre's victims surrounded the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was quashed on appeal last October.
</P>
<P>
The Court de Cassation's ruling was a triumph for the defense,
which had argued for a new military trial. The civil plaintiffs,
formed by relatives of the victims in the massacre, had wanted a
civil court to retry Priebke.
</P>
<P>
Priebke will be tried with former SS Major Karl Hass, who acted
as a witness at his first trial. Hass was later charged with
similar offenses. No date has been set for the re-trial.

<HEADLINE> Warmer Temperatures May Be Wiping Out Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Warmer temperatures may
be the determining factor in the rapid decrease in the number of
penguins in the Antarctica, said a team of U.S. scientists.
</P>
<P>
William Fraser, a professor with Montana University of the
United States, noted today that marine ice is the habitat
preferred by Adelia penguins in the Antarctica during winters.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there has not been enough marine ice in the
South Pole region in the past 40 years, and that may have been an
important factor in the decrease of the penguin population.
</P>
<P>
Figures from Greenpeace, an environmental protection group of
world renown, indicate there were 15,200 pairs of Adelia penguins
in the Antarctica in 1975 but there are only 9,200 pairs now.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team is currently on an expedition in the Antarctica
and is exploring the link between presumably rising temperatures
and the penguin population, said a TELAM news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the Antarctic peninsula experienced a
warming of 2.5 degrees Celsius in the last 50 years while the
global temperature increased 0.5 degrees between 1860 and 1996.

WELLINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The total population in New
 Zealand at the end of 1996 is provisionally estimated to have

</P>
<P>
The office noted that a population increase was recorded during
the December quarter in 1996, which is larger than the same period
of previous years.
</P>
<P>
The population growth in the quarter is attributed to the
natural increase and migration gains, meaning more people arrived
in NZ than those departed from the country.

<P>
Statistics NZ said the December quarter saw an excess of births
over deaths (natural increase) of 7,600 and an excess of arrivals
over departures of some 75,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will hold talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington later this week on the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
This will be Netanyahu's first visit to the United States since
the conclusion of a deal with the Palestinians on January 17 over
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
early on Thursday before holding talks with President Bill
Clinton. It will be "a very serious strategic discussion" on how
to advance the peace process, according to Martin Indyk, U.S.
ambassador to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will also meet Defense Secretary William Cohen and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the Israeli embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Netanyahu convened his Cabinet to discuss
plans for further Israeli troops withdrawals from rural areas of
the West Bank and for the release of Palestinian women from jail,
designed to serve as a signal of his seriousness over the
completion of the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, have complained of delays on
other issues in the Hebron accord, including the operation of
Palestinian sea and airports, and free passage between Gaza and
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"A month after the Hebron protocol was signed, many things
should have been implemented, but until now nothing has been
implemented," a Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have expressed hope that the deal on Hebron
could pave the way for resumption of talks between Israel and
Syria, an issue which will almost certainly be on the agenda
during talks between Clinton and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, seen as the other track leading to an
overall Middle East peace deal, has long been stalled as Israel
has refused to hand over the strategic Golan Heights, Syrian
territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> NBA Considers to End Olympic "Dream Teams" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- "Dream Team" Olympic squads
composed totally of top National Basketball Association players
could be eliminated for the 2000 Sydney Games under a plan being
considered by league officials.
</P>
<P>
According to AP, Russ Granik, deputy commissioner of the league,
said the next United States Olympic men's basketball team might
be a mix of NBA players and college talent in training for their
first NBA season.
</P>
<P>
The original Barcelona gold medal Dream Team starred Michael
Jordan, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley and Larry
Bird. No players without NBA experience participated on the second
at third "Dream Team" squads, which won titles at the 1994 World
Championships in Toronto and 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Teams of US collegians competed in prior international events
with diminishing results, including losses at the Pan American
Games, Olympics and World Championships. Their failures prompted
the "Dream Team" idea.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous eras, Granik said it would be unlikely players
planning a return to college would be invited to play alongside
NBA talent at the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Inmates Take Over Guatemalan Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- About 800 inmates in
Pavon prison north of the Guatemalan capital took control of the
prison today in protest at conditions at the jail.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners, who took over the prison peacefully, are
demanding talks with the authorities to improve what they describe
as an inhuman situation in the jail, reports reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Donis, a spokesperson for the inmates, said they
have eight demands, including better food and drinking water, the
installation of public telephones and repairs to electrical
installations.
</P>
<P>
However, prison director Lorenzo Castillo rejected the takeover
of the prison, some 22 kilometers north of Guatemala City, and
said "the movement is poorly directed and there is no reason for
one."
</P>
<P>
Nely Morales, a spokeswoman for the Public Prosecutor's Office
confirmed that prison authorities are studying the situation to
find a quick solution.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry as saying that vice-minister Salvador Gandara will
negotiate directly with inmate representatives to resolve the
conflict peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy to Improve This Year: Lee Kuan Yew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
has said that the Singapore's economy will improve over last year
as the United States' economy is now on an upward trend this year,
the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Chinese New Year and Hari Raya, the Malay New
Year, dinner at a local community club last night, Lee said that
the economy of Europe will do marginally better this year, while
the Japanese economic growth might not be as high as that of the
United States this year.
</P>
<P>
Japan had its difficulties with its banking system and had
increased taxes to meet budget deficits, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that Singapore's neighbors, especially Malaysia
and Indonesia, would have even higher growth and this meant
increasing competition that would force Singapore to improve its
own competitiveness by enhancing productivity and keeping costs
down.
</P>
<P>
"The government will do its utmost to keep down rents, fees and
taxes, water and power rates and other costs," he said, adding
that otherwise, the multi-national corporations would shift their
lower end production elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Moldova Willing to Take Part in NATO Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Petr
Luchinsky today said that his country would like to strengthen
cooperation with NATO and continue to take part in activities of
the alliance's Partnership for Peace (PFP) program.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with visiting NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana in Kishinev, capital of Moldova,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived in Kishinev earlier today for a two-day
visit, said he noticed that Moldova was pursuing a policy
transparent to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the solicitude Moldova showed for NATO's
efforts in maintaining peace and security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Moldova's new prime minister and foreign minister
held talks with Solana.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc told the top NATO official that to
realize integration with Europe was the final goal of his country.
</P>
<P>
As for NATO's planned eastward expansion, Foreign Minister
Mihai Popov indicated that the 16-member organization should
continue dialogue with Russia, who has repeatedly expressed
objection against the plan.
</P>
<P>
Moldova is the first leg of Solana's four-nation tour which
will also take him to Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched its PFP program in 1994 to help foster ties with
its former Warsaw Pact adversaries and other neutral countries.
</P>
<P>
Till October 1996, the program had boasted 27 partners
including such neutral countries as Finland, Austria and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Moldova by constitution is also a neutral country and should
not join any international military alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, it joined the PFP program in 1994 and has taken part
in over a dozen of NATO's joint military exercises.

Senate (upper house), headed by its vice president Michel
Dreyfus-Schmidt.
</P>

Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has expanded from traditional

which is of great importance to Cuba at a time when the U.S. is
tightening its long-standing blockade against his country, the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Enter 1997 Admiral's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia will fight for 1997
Admiral's Cup yachting regatta at Cowes after missing the last Cup
two years ago, officials said in Sydney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Veteran skipper Syd Fischer will lead a team of three boats for
the eight-race regatta in July and August, culminating in the
Fastnet Race, off the English coast.
</P>
<P>
A veteran of seven Admiral's Cup regattas and numerous
America's Cup campaigns, Fischer will be joined by skippers Steve
Kulmar and John Calvert-Jones.
</P>
<P>
David Kellet, Australian Yachting Federation's Offshore
Committee chairman, said Australia has twice won the Admiral's Cup
and came within 0.25 of a point of victory in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The unavailability of many top yachtsmen, including Fischer,
because of America's Cup duties in 1995 and the high cost of
shipping boats were factors in Australia's decision not to send a
team to Cowes two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Needs Massive Annual Infrastructure Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Latin America needs to
invest 70 billion U.S. dollars a year in infrastructure to
integrate the region's economies, a report from the Inter-American
Development Bank(IDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Full regional integration will require the repair, improvement
and creation of infrastructure projects including water, sewers,
roads, telecommunications and energy systems, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If such investment is made, it could lead to economic growth
of some 4 to 5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The IDB approved 11 projects worth 72 million dollars
last year to strengthen democratic institutions in countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The IDB report estimates that Latin America accounts for 10
percent of the world's population and 16 percent of global
territory but only has 3 percent of the world's made-up roads.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Europe now has 2,000 kilometers of
highways for every one million people while there are only 600
kilometers of highways for every one million Latin Americans,
which makes many aspects of life, including the transport of
goods, difficult.
</P>
<P>
Janice Perlman, the founder of the U.S. "Mega-cities Project",
said that one of the reasons why investment in infrastructure is
low in the region is that it isn't considered profitable over the
long run.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Ordered to Pay $25 Million in Punitive Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A jury in Santa Monica,
California today ordered former U.S. football star O.J. Simpson to
pay 25 million U.S. dollars as punishment for the slayings of his
ex-wife and her friend.
</P>
<P>
The decision marked yet another milestone in the two and a half
years of legal saga that also exposes the racial divisions in the
country -- from the acquittal by a mostly black jury to the
wrongful death verdict from a mostly white panel.
</P>
<P>
Simpson was awarded last week 8.5 million dollars in
compensatory damages as the same all-white jury found Simpson
liable in the June 12, 1994, slashing deaths of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Simpson's estate, whose beneficiaries include her two
children now living with Simpson, was allotted 12.5 million
dollars of the award. Goldman's father, Fred, got another 12.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mother Sharon Rufo did not ask for punitive damages. But the
long-divorced parents got the 8.5 million dollars compensatory
award for the loss of their son's love and companionship.
</P>
<P>
Simpson's lawyers said their client was worse than broke and
said that the verdict and compensatory award would left him 9.3
million dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
But plaintiffs insisted that Simpson is potentially worth at
least 15.7 million dollars, based on the predicted 3 million
dollars he stands to make every year for selling his name,
likeness and trademark.
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki must decide whether the
awards are reasonable, or inflated by irrational passions. Simpson
also could appeal, but that would not let him postpone
payment.

LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Josiah Thugwane, the first

Thugwane, whose Olympic success has provoked jealousy at home,

He was also involved in an attempted car robbery before the
Olympics, but London's international race director David Bedford

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Experts Needed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China will hire more foreign
agricultural and managerial experts in 1997, as planned by the
State Bureau of Foreign Experts.
</P>
<P>
This conforms with the national economic and social development
plan, which stresses agriculture as the foundation and improvement
of industrial efficiency as the main methods of economic growth,
according to China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau looks for people with advanced and pragmatic
techniques to improve the production and quality of grain, cotton,
edible oil, vegetables, poultry and aquatic products, said Shi
Zhongcheng, bureau spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts have contributed a great deal to good harvests
in the past decade. In 1996 alone, the dry rice cultivation
technology introduced to China by Japanese farming expert Shoici
Hara was used on 8.66 million hectares; 800,000 tons more rice
were gained.
</P>
<P>
With the knowledge taught by Dutch experts, 11 villages in
Tongchuan county, Shaanxi Province, shook off poverty by growing
apples last year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said experienced technicians and managers who can
help state-owned enterprises renovate out-dated facilities and
management are very welcome.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 80,000 foreigners from 64 countries and regions
worked in industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational,
scientific, health, financial, legal and sports sectors.
</P>
<P>
While the total number will not change much because of budget
limitation, Shi said his bureau will try to hire a larger portion
of agricultural and managerial personnel, who are most urgently
needed.
</P>
<P>
The state bureau will work hard to implement a series of rules
it promulgated in 1996. The rules were designed to administer the
employment of foreign experts in line with legal and
internationally accepted practices, Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
The bureau discourages Chinese employers from contacting
prospective employees themselves as this might lead to disputes
later.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the bureau advertises its national recruitment plan
through foreign expert organizations or headhunting companies it
recognizes.

<HEADLINE> Legislation to Target Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Legislation and measures
concerning overseas investment will be improved this year to
improve the quality of overseas funding, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that work will be accelerated to issue temporary
regulations concerning special permission of overseas investment
to be used in some projects. Such regulations can strengthen
government administration of investment.
</P>
<P>
The government will promote the experiment of introducing
overseas investment in the form of BOT (build, operate and
transfer). Highways, bridges and water supply plants will be
included in sectors open to BOT experiments this year.
</P>
<P>
To guide investing of overseas capital to the encouraged
sectors, the government will regularly announce batches of
selected priority projects for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Priority sectors for overseas investment will remain to be
agriculture, transportation, energy, raw materials and key
industries.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that when the time is right, the government
will give foreign-funded enterprises the same treatment as
State-owned enterprises in terms of fees.
</P>
<P>
State Planning Commission sources said this year international
concessional loans will continue to favor projects in west and
central China, where the economy is weak compared with the coastal
regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will take measures to punish
enterprises that delay payment of international loans and
interest.

<HEADLINE> China Protects Precious Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Effective environmental
protection measures are enabling many of China's endangered plant
and animal species to thrive, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that thanks to the protection measures, wildlife
species such as the giant panda, ibis, Chinese alligator and
David's deer, and plant species like metasequoia and ginkgo have
significantly increased in number.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas have already taken their first step out of the
shadow of extinction caused by the death of large amounts of
bamboos, and an estimated 1,000 pandas now live in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that China has developed great expertise in
feeding science and artificial reproduction of pandas.
</P>
<P>
And the country also plans to launch a new panda protection
project, including the establishment of 14 more preservation
zones, "biological corridors" connecting reserves and habitats,
and the resettlement of people living in the reserves.
</P>
<P>
At one point, only seven ibises were left in China. Now there
are more than 80. Half of them live in the wild and the rest have
been artificially bred.
</P>
<P>
So far, 574 protection zones have been set up, covering 6.43
percent of the country's landspace, the highest percentage in the
world. The number of zones is expected to increase to 1,000 by the
end of the century, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry has also set up 14 reproduction and
feeding centers for endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's only country with a special ministry under
the State Council to handle afforestation, wildlife protection,
desertification control and other environmental protection issues,
said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Airs Concern on Political Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate has
stated that President Fidel Ramos' recent comments on the Supreme
Court were undermining political stability in the country,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople said the country's
political stability achieved under the 1987 Constitution is
"trembling in the balance" because of Ramos' bellicose threats
against the Charter and the High Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos said that the Supreme Court's decision to void
the sale of Manila Hotel to a Malaysian firm in favor of a local
corporation was damaging the sustained development of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The uncertain ties surrounding the presidential succession in
1998 are now aggravated by Ramos' "reckless and wanton" attacks
against the Charter and the Supreme Court, therefore, undermining
the country's political stability, Ople said.
</P>
<P>
Although Ramos had made it clear that he wants judiciary
reforms through amending the Constitution, the opposition is
charging that he is trying to stay in power beyond 1998, which is
forbidden by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Senator Edgardo Angara, chairman of the opposition party Laban
Ng Demokratikong Pilipino, said the president's plan to postpone
the national elections indicates a "full-scale attack" against
democratic institutions.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Global Telecoms Pact Hopeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The chances of achieving a
global pact on freeing the world's 600 billion-U.S.-dollar-a-year
telecommunications market look good, Neil McMillan, chairman of
the negotiations said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the latest round of negotiations at the World
Trade Organization (WTO), McMillan said he was optimistic that a
deal to liberalize the telecommunications market could be secured
by the February 15 deadline. The accord is due to take effect in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I do actually think that we should all be encouraged by what
we've seen over the last two weeks," McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
"The sort of language I heard used by most delegates was the
most encouraging in a long time."
</P>
<P>
Some 57 governments are taking part in the negotiations.
Fourteen European Union countries are acting as a single entity.
</P>
<P>
The issues being negotiated include voice telephone services,
data transmission services, telex, telegraph, facsimile, private
leased circuit services, cellular telephone services, mobile data
transmission, and personal communications systems.
</P>
<P>
Talks on opening up competition in basic telecommunications
were originally part of the 1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade
negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT).
</P>
<P>
But they were left out of the final trade pact signed in 1994
after the countries involved failed to agree. Negotiations
restarted under GATT's successor, the WTO, in May 1994, with April
30, 1996 set as the deadline.
</P>
<P>
But talks failed to meet the deadline after the United States
said offers from emerging economies were not good enough for it to
open its domestic market, worth some 200 billion dollars a year,
to foreign operators. The deadline was then extended to February
15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting of the Basic Telecommunications Group
yesterday, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero urged negotiators to
achieve a "satisfactory agreement" as part of a wider agreement on
services, known as the General Agreement on Trade and Services
(GATS).
</P>
<P>
"Success in these negotiations will do a great deal to strengthen
the credibility of the services agreement, by demonstrating that it
can deliver valuable results even in sectors of the greatest
technical and political complexity," Ruggiero said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Failure, or a disappointing outcome, would correspondingly
damage confidence in the GATS and perhaps in the WTO itself," he
warned.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Fund Programs to Help Handicapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.4 million handicapped
people in Chile are expected to benefit from a 1.7 billion-peso (4
million U.S. dollars) program planned for this year by the
National Fund for the Handicapped in Chile (FONADIS).
</P>
<P>
The organization is starting four projects -- training the
handicapped, introducing them into the labor market, encouraging
them to run small businesses and providing special scholarships,
said Sergio Prenafeta, executive secretary of Fonadis.
</P>
<P>
Being handicapped is a problem for society and can't be solved
easily through things like art therapy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fonadis, set up three years ago, not only looks after the
health needs of the handicapped, but also tries to teach them to
work, and tries to instill self esteem in them from an early age.
</P>
<P>
The fund has so far found work for 178 handicapped people in
companies. A small number, but still progress, said Prenafeta.

DUBAI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- British tennis hero Tim Henman
was surprisingly beaten 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 by German Martin Sinner
Monday in the first round of the one-million-dollar Dubai Open.
</P>
<P>
Henman, playing in his first match since reaching the third

92-minute contest. His serving was strong, with an 81 percent
average on first serve, but he was unable to back up the big
weapon.
</P>
<P>
Spanish eighth seed Felix Mantilla was eliminated by Norway's
Christian Ruud 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the only other singles match of the day, Argentine Hernan
Gumy beat James Sekulov of Australia 6-4, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in 200-Car Pile-up on Foggy Highway </HEADLINE>

<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A massive 200-car pile-up on a
fog-hit highway in northern Italy left one person dead and
hundreds injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
The string of crashes, which happened on a highway linking
Venice and Padova, was caused by drivers going too fast on a
stretch of road where visibility was down to about 50 meters in
places, police said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the road was closed for much of the day as rescue
services battled to clear the debris.
</P>
<P>
Highways in northern Italy become very dangerous in winter when
heavy fog frequently reduces visibility to less than 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Police have tried a variety of measures such as painting white
traingles on the roads in a bid to make motorists to watch their
speed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will negotiate a
free trade agreement with the European Union (EU) this year, a top
Mexican official said today.
</P>
<P>
The deal will eliminate trade barriers between the two sides
and will provide Europe with a gateway to the Latin American
market and the countries making up NAFTA, the North American Free
Trade Agreement, Mexico's Secretary of Commerce and Industrial
Development Herminio Blanco said today in London.
</P>

<P>
"Mexico wants to recover territory in its trade with EU and,
for that reason, the negotiation of a free trade agreement between
both parties is important," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We are working together with EU on a document that will
constitute a model and serve as the point of departure for
the negotiations. We hope that we will reach an agreement about
what we are going to negotiate in the first half of 1997."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Mexico is a good trade partner because it has
a competitive economy.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Expects Drop of Inflation in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Enrique Cardoso said today that the annual inflation in his
country should drop to 7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso told a conference of about 500 people, including
British businessmen and government officials, in London that
Brazil managed to lower inflation to 10 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
That trend, he was quoted by government sources here as saying
in a 30-minute speech at the conference, is expected to continue
and the inflation rate is likely drop to 7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is one of the pioneering countries in economic
globalization and in position to receive more foreign investments,
the president declared.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment tripled from 2.9 billion U.S. dollars
in 1995 to 9.4 billion dollars in 1996, and some 380 of the
world's 500 biggest companies are operating in Brazil, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's international reserves of 60 billion dollars are
currently among the highest in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the regional integration of the Americas, Cardoso said
the consolidation of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) has
spurred trade among its four member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Mercosur is a platform upon which we are working for the
building of a free trade area that will embrace all the Americas,"
said the president, who is on a 2-day visit to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Rutelli Defends Rome Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli said
critics of the city's bid to stage the Olympic Games in 2004 had
failed to expose any serious failing in the plans.
</P>
<P>
"We do not wish to repeat the errors made in the past by ohter
administrations, such as during the World Championships of 1990,
when they opened stations only to close them the next day,"
Rutelli said.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing some 600 sports stars and young sports
enthusiasts at Rome's ciy hall as part of a programme of meetings
to promote the Rome 2004 bid.
</P>
<P>
Next month the International Olympic Committee is due to decide
on a shortlist of four or five out of the 11 cities bidding for
the games. Several international commentators have picked Rome as
a favourite to make the shortlist.
</P>
<P>
The bid has been criticised by a "No Committee" who claim that
it would overload the already stretched facilities of the city and
bring no lasting benefit. But a recent oponion poll put public
support for the bid at 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
Francesco carducci, councillor in charge of major events on the
city council, said the games would leave behind a valuable
legacy. That would include improved public transport, some 150
sports installations, and the Olympic village at Tor Vergata which
would be transformed into a university campus with space for
18,000 students.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Killing Raises Call for Tougher Gun Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The massacre of six people
by a gunman in New Zealand's central North Island on Saturday has
prompted the anti-gun lobby group and some government MPs to voice
the call for stricter laws on gun control.
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old Wellington man shot dead six people, including
his father, with a shotgun on Saturday in a central North Island
village and wounded another six. The Ministry of Health later
issued a statement confirming the gunman had received psychiatric
treatment in the capital.
</P>
<P>
After the killing, the anti-gun lobby group has renewed its
call for tougher gun laws, claiming that NZ had the laxest gun
laws among the Commonwealth countries.
</P>
<P>
Anti-gun lobbyist Philip Alpers urged the government to
introduce tougher gun laws, including setting up a register for
individual guns, as well as their owners.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said over the National Radio Monday
that he "would not be surprised" if the laws were made tougher.
</P>
<P>
"I would not all be surprised if the recommendations came down
and if the government pursues even tighter gun laws than we've got
at the present time," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Police Minister Jack Elder said that he personally favored
toughening up gun laws, though any changes of the laws were
unlikely before the finding of a review of the laws. He
particularly expressed concern about the number of guns in
circulation, estimated to be around 1.1 million throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
Justic Thorp, who is conducting the review, said the latest
massacre would be considered during a current inquiry into gun
laws. The review has been expected to make recommendations this
month, but its deadline was put back after the number of
submissions was unexpectedly high.
</P>
<P>
Associate justice spokesperson of the opposition Labor Party
Dianne Yates said the government should not wait till after the
review of the gun laws.
</P>
<P>
She said the current gun laws were not properly enforced
because police did not have the time or resources.
</P>
<P>
The government should also move to license all guns as well as
gun owners, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Doug Graham said changes to mental
health and criminal justice laws, dealing with the detention of
mentally unstable people, would be sped up.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced support for changes to the gun laws.

WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
urged Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), to renounce its violence policy.
</P>
<P>
"There's no position for them at the peace table until violence
is clearly renounced," U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicolas

"We've seen, over the last couple of months, too many acts of
violence, indiscriminate acts of violence that takes innocent
people's lives," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his country supports the positions of the
British and Irish governments, which insist that Sinn Fein should
renounce the violence before it is invited to the negotiation
table.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a White House spokesman denied reports that the U.S.
government is considering sharp changes in policy towards the
issues involving peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which seeks to end British rule of the province, has
bombed security targets in Northern Ireland several times every
week this year to back its demand that Sinn Fein, be invited to

WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A man convicted of
murdering a federal judge during a string of mail bombings in
South U.S. was today sentenced to death in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
Walter Leroy Moody, 51, from Rex, Georgia, was convicted of
murder in November in the slaying of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert
Vance, who died when he opened a package at home. His wife was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Moody already is serving seven life sentences without parole on
federal convictions of murdering Vance and a civil rights lawyer,
threatening to kill 17 judges and sending two other bombs that
were intercepted.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Groups Say Global Forest Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 of the
world's major environmental groups today voiced their opposition
to a proposed international convention on protecting forests.
</P>
<P>
The move came one day before the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Forest starts its final session at the
U.N. headquarters on February 11. The 11-day meeting is expected
to be the culmination of an intense international debate opened
five years ago during the U.N. Conference on Environment and
Development--"Earth Summit"--held in Rio De Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said that the Panel would
seriously consider proposals for implementing various proposals
for protecting the world's forests.
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time to negotiate a global forest convention,"
Bill Mankin, Director of the Global Forest Policy Project, told a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the World Wildlife Federation, Greenpeace,
the Green Earth Organization and others also attended the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said that they support the idea of an
international convention on forests but not at this time.
</P>
<P>
The problem of protecting forests required "effective regional,
national or local action" and not another treaty that could take
years to negotiate, the representatives said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that a convention now would limit the role
of grass-roots conservation groups and allow "unsustainable forest
practices."
</P>
<P>
U.S. timber companies are also opposing the convention mainly
because they fear they would suffer economic losses under a forest
convention.
</P>
<P>
Henson Moore, President of the American Forest and Paper
Association, told reporters today that American companies fear
that an international convention on forests would result in audits
by U.N. agencies and put them at a disadvantage against
competition from countries that do not enforce the treaty.
</P>
<P>
But Canada, the European Union and a number of other countries
have been calling for an international convention to set rules for
managing the world's remaining forests.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of a convention hope to convince the U.N. Panel to
recommend to the 185-member U.N. General Assembly at a special
session in June.

<HEADLINE> Silajdzic Says Incidents in Mostar Worst Blow to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's co-premier from the
Muslim community Haris Silajdzic said on Monday that the
Muslim-Croat clash in Mostar during the day was the worst blow to
the Dayton accord and the Muslim-Croat Federation so far.
</P>
<P>
Muslim Radio Sarajevo quoted Silajdzic as saying that, as of
Monday, the international community had to go to Croatia to
enquire about the implementation of the federation agreement. The
Muslim-Croat federation was formed in March 1994 under U.S.
pressure.
</P>
<P>
He also invited the U.S. and German governments to intercede
with Croatian government, saying that there would be no
Muslim-Croat federation at all if only Bosnian Croats were dealt
with.
</P>
<P>
Silajdzic, who was in Mostar later in the day to look into the
incident himself, said that all reports in the past three years
had clearly pointed to the fact that extremists in the Croat
sector of Mostar, with the help from neighboring Croatia, wished
to block the normal functioning of the federation, according to
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
At least one person was killed and more than 20 wounded on
Monday when Muslims, who went to a cemetery in the
Croat-controlled sector to pay tribute to their dead, clashed with
Croats.
</P>
<P>
The premier told Muslim media in Mostar that the situation in
the city, where Muslim-Croat clashes broke out earlier in the day,
was still highly critical.
</P>
<P>
The Croat authorities in the western sector of the divided city
were collecting Muslims from their homes and bringing them to one
assembly point to use them as human shield, Silajdzci said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,000 Muslims still living in the Croat part of
the city, which the two ethnic communities have divided since
1993.
</P>
<P>
Silajdzic said that Monday's armed clashes between the Muslims
and Croats showed that the Croat side had decided to split Bosnia,
because it did not want the Muslim-Croat federation to function
well.

<HEADLINE> Curfew to Be Imposed in Mostar After Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Interior Minister of the
Neretva-Herzegovina Canton Valentin Coric said Monday evening that
a curfew would be imposed in Mostar from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. starting
from Monday, Croat radio reported from Mostar.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken due to a growing tension in the city
following a clash between Muslims and Croats earlier in the day,
in which at least one person was killed and 22 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Mostar Mayor Ivan Prskalo, a Croat, blamed the clash on the
Muslims who attempted to visit a Muslim cemetery in the
Croat-controlled western part of Mostar without application in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Although the Bosnian Muslims and Croats formed a federation in
March 1994 under U.S. pressure, Mostar is still divided into two
parts controlled by Croats and Muslims separately.
</P>
<P>
Organizing the visit at the time when Croats were having a
carnival in western Mostar was not a coincidence, Prskalo said.
</P>
<P>
Croat radio also said that a shell fired from Muslim positions
exploded a little after 7 p.m. Monday in the Croat-controlled
northern suburb of Mostar, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Sarajevo said fighting broke out again
between several hundred Croats from the western part Muslims from
the eastern part of Mostar at a city bridge after 5 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 Spanish SFOR troops have arrived to the spot in an
effort to stop the fighting while the tension there was mounting.

<HEADLINE> Name of New Yugoslav Premier to Be Made Public Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- After extensive consultations
with different parties, Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic said Monday
the name of Yugoslavia's new prime minister would be made public
next week.
</P>
<P>
Lilic told the press he was happy to note that all party club
leaders and representatives of parliamentary parties, who accepted
his invitation for consultations, shared the same hopes and
endeavors for strengthening the position of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and its institutions as regards both internal and
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"This fact is without any doubt a reason for satisfaction as it
shows that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has a future,"
President Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
Lilic has made wide-range consultations over the past few days
with political parties and party club leaders in the Federal
parliament on the candidate for the post of federal prime
minister. The current prime minister is Radoje Kontic whose term
of office expires next month.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, the ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia and some other political parties have renamed Kontic as the
candidate for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said the consultations provided an opportunity for all
party club leaders and political party presidents to express their
views on the activities of the federal government and its
ministries, which they did.
</P>
<P>
They also had the opportunity to present their views on how the
federal government should look in the future and to say whether
they wished to take part in it, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would inform the future prime minister of the views
expressed during the consultations and would ask him to undertake
similar consultations before he decides on the composition of his
government.
</P>
<P>
Monday was the last day of the consultations Lilic had with
party representatives on the future prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes Extension of UN Angola Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today that he would recommend an
extension of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Angola for two
months if a delayed government of national unity were formed
before the expiry of the mission's current mandate at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the proposal in a written report to the
Security Council of the world body.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was based on the understanding that steps
would be taken to transform the U.N. peacekeeping force into a
smaller, reconfigured observer mission that would remain until the
end of 1997, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), which has
been helping oversee the peace accord of the African nation,
comprised 6,638 troops, military observers and civilian police
from more than 30 countries on February 1 after the withdrawal of
some 650 troops at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the Angolan government and UNITA
rebels signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in 1994, a government of national
unity and reconciliation should be established on January 25. But
the establishment was postponed after negotiations failed to find
an acceptable role for UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi who still
reportedly controls much parts of Angola, including diamond-rich
areas.
</P>
<P>
Annan told the Security Council that if former UNITA rebels
designated to serve in the national government failed to arrive in
the country's capital of Luanda by Feb. 12 as currently scheduled,
he would recommend the Council extend the mandate of the U.N.
force for only one month, until March 31.
</P>
<P>
If by then the national unity government had still not been
formed in Angola, the U.N. Security Council "may wish to consider
appropriate steps to address the situation," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Drift Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street fell
today, led by technology shares, which slid sharply amid heavy
profit-taking on January's gains and more disappointing earnings
news.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 49.26 points to 6,806.54.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume reaching 467.56
million shares, down from 538.62 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 4.11 to 785.45, and
the NYSE composite index fell 1.45 to 412.35. Both measures fell
from their record highs set on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 22.32 to 1,335.39, but the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.23 to 587.84.
</P>
<P>
Networking equipment maker 3Com warned that earning for its
current quarter will be disappointing. 3Com shares tumbled as the
second most active Nasdaq issue after rival Cisco Systems, which
also plunged.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares, meanwhile, pulled back again as investors
moved to secure more profits from that sector's rapid advance.
</P>
<P>
IBM continued to move down. Nasdaq leaders such as Intel,
Microsoft, Dell Computer and U.S. Robotics also fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
Bonds were slightly lower, lifting the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond from late Friday's 6.69 percent to about 6.70
percent.
</P>
<P>
Some of the bond market's weakness was attributed to the
dollar's tumble early today against other major currencies. The
dollar fell after officials at a weekend meeting of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations indicated the U.S. currency's recent
surge has gone far enough.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Halts Flights over Gulf of Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force today
extended its suspension of all training flights off the East Coat
to include the Gulf of Mexico after reports of more close
encounters between military jets and commercial planes.
</P>
<P>
Two incidents were reported on Friday. One involved two F-16s
and an American Airlines MD-80 passenger jet that came too close
near Clovis, New Mexico. The second incident involved one F-16 and
a Northwest Airlines airbus about 70 miles (117 km) southwest of
Palacios, Texas.
</P>
<P>
In the New Mexico incident a collision warning was triggered
aboard an American Airlines MD80 jetliner and the pilot climbed to
avoid coming close to the military planes.
</P>
<P>
The F-16s were about 3.5 miles (5.633 km) from the airliner and
flying within 300 feet (90 meters) of the airliner's altitude at
the time, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Regulations call for a separation of five miles (8.047 km)
horizontally and 1,000 feet (305 meters) vertically.
</P>
<P>
In the Texas incident, an F-16 came within 4.6 miles (7.73 km)
horizontally and 300 feet vertically of a Northwest Airbus flying.
</P>
<P>
The incidents added to the two incidents on Wednesday and
Friday off the East Coast of Maryland and New Jersey involving
commercial aircraft and F-16 Air National Guard jests that
prompted a suspension of training missions along the coast.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday ordered
controllers at its Jacksonville, Florida, Washington and New York
air traffic control centers and military controllers at the
Virginia Capes station to review procedures for handling traffic.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Slow to Inform Japan of Radioactive-bullet Incidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
belatedly informed the Japanese government of its Marine Corps
jets accidentally firing 1,520 radioactive bullets during a
live-fire exercise near Okinawa more than a year ago, according to
Monday's Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an air force officer as saying that the
radioactive-bullet incidents occurred on Dec.5 and Dec.7, 1995 and
Jan.24, 1996, when AV-8B jets were undertaking routine
gunnery-range practice at Tori Shima, an uninhabited coral island
62 miles from Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Technicians examing one of the aircraft's guns jammed on
Jan.24, 1996 found depleted uranium rounds had been used by
mistake, the newspaper said. Each shell contained 5.2 ounces of
depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
But the training incidents were not notified to the Japanese
government until January this year, the newspaper said. U.S.
Forces Japan headquarters in Tokyo told the newspaper in a
statement, saying: "The U.S. government has told the government of
Japan that it regrets these incidents and the late notification."
</P>
<P>
Under a U.S.-Japan agreement, no nuclear weapons are to be
stored on Okinawa during peacetime.
</P>
<P>
News of the incidents came amid growing anti-u.s. military
sentiment on Okinawa, site of one of the most important U.S.
military bases in the Pacific, where some 28,000 U.S. troops are
stationed.
</P>
<P>
Anti-U.S. sentiment has been high on Okinawa since the rape
of a Japanese schoolgirl in September 1995 by three U.S.
servicemen.

<HEADLINE> Improving Productivity Vital to Survival: SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Improving productivity
is vital to southern African countries' efforts to stimulate
economic growth and development, a communique issued by Southern
African Development Community (SADC) Consultative Conference said
today.
</P>
<P>
"The conference agreed that productivity improvement is no
longer an optional extra, but a matter of survival," said the
communique issued at the end of the three-day annual SADC
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 delegates from the SADC member states and
international organizations participated in the conference with
the theme "Productivity, Key to Sustainable Development in SADC"
from February 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The conference emphasized that industry must remain
competitive through increased productivity rather than through
subsidies, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the process of change within the SADC is gaining
momentum and has made southern Africa a region "at peace with
itself", meaning it could now focus on economic growth and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The conference commended the regional body for steps it has
taken towards regional integration by signing protocols on shared
water course systems, transport communication and meteorology,
energy, illicit drug trafficking and trade.
</P>
<P>
The conference also urged the SADC member states to pay
particular attention to the development of small and medium scale
enterprises as these sectors offer greater prospects for gains in
productivity, the communique added.
