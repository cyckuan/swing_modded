LAKERS HOPE BEING TESTED BRING BENEFITS

   PHOENIX _ The Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers are
each one victory away from meeting in the Western Conference
finals. Both teams could complete sweeps today to set up that
anticipated series next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But their playoff paths could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers rolled past the Minnesota Timberwolves, 3-1. The
Lakers got pushed around for two games by the Sacramento Kings and
needed a fifth game to put them away.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are on the verge of sweeping the Utah Jazz, having
posted 20-point routs in three straight games. The Lakers are on
the verge of sweeping the Phoenix Suns, but it has taken
last-minute heroics in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are skipping along. The Lakers are getting pushed to
the brink. Coach Phil Jackson has suggested that's probably a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Rick Fox said. ``I think they (the Blazers)
haven't been challenged quite yet, in playoff-basketball sense.
They've had quite the easy run so far. And we, in turn, have played
some tough games and found ways to win. You'd much rather not have
to lay off, not have the easy cakewalk in a sense, because then
you've been on edge the whole time. We've played with our nerves
rattled, and we've had to adjust to make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had the NBA's best regular-season record, but the
Blazers, who struggled late in the season, seem to be challenging
them for the mantle as presumed favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen them,'' Fox said. ``We get the tickers, and we get
the highlights, too. I don't think it's anything that we didn't
suspect them being capable of doing. It's just that they've
struggled throughout the last month of the season, and they looked
as though they were beatable in the sense of all the talk at the
beginning of the season was along the lines of them being
invincible. They've now returned to somewhat more of that fashion
of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning ahead: Scrawled, optimistically, on a dry-erase board
in the Suns locker room was a schedule for a Monday flight to Los
Angeles. But the Suns were already addressing questions about what
they need to do to compete next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just like the Portland Trail Blazers,'' Phoenix
guard Penny Hardaway said. ``They went into the offseason, and they
got guys like Steve Smith and Scottie Pippen to try to make their
roster a lot stronger. And I think we're going to have to make our
roster a lot stronger next year if we want to compete with the
Portlands and Utahs and the Lakers. If you're going to contend with
the Lakers, you're going to have to have somebody to play with
those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting, the hardest part: The conference finals are slated to
start no sooner than Saturday, potentially next Sunday, meaning if
the Lakers and Blazers both sweep, they could have five or six days
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time, it's a real long time to stay sharp,''
Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``But we'll take it, we'll deal
with it if it comes our way.''

FOREST-THEFT _ For more than a year, a U.S. Forest Service clerk
who was mired in debt dutifully counted the fees hikers and boaters
put into the Tonto National Forest drop boxes _ and routinely took
some home for herself. By the time she was caught last year, the
total take was $17,400. That made it the biggest internal theft yet
in the government's four-year experiment to charge visitors fees
for use of the federal forests. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOP-MCCAIN _ State Republicans doused a smoldering political feud
Saturday by electing Cindy McCain chairwoman of the state
delegation to the Republican National Convention. And they did it
with the full support of Gov. Jane Hull, who, despite initial
misgivings about giving up the governor's traditional role as the
head of the delegation, stressed the need for party unity. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BURN-FOREST _ Charred walls, blackened car shells, skeletons of
furniture _ the bleak legacy of the Los Alamos fire sends a strong
message to many forestry experts: Set more fires. To non-experts,
that may seem crazy. Still, there's broad agreement that controlled
burns are critical in keeping forests healthy. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COL _ It's not like the moms didn't warn them. ``Don't make
us come up there,'' the moms said to the politicians. We don't want
to put the guns away, the politicians say. We like playing with
them. Our friends give us money to let them play. It's fun, and
everybody's doing it. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A''

MCCAIN'S WIFE TO LEAD GOP DELEGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES AND CHRIS MOESER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - State Republicans doused a smoldering political feud
Saturday, May 13, by electing Cindy McCain chairwoman of the state
delegation to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it with the full support of Gov. Jane Hull, who,
despite initial misgivings about giving up the governor's
traditional role as the head of the delegation, stressed the need
for party unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Republicans we must find common ground, not a battleground,
and that's what this convention is all about,'' Hull told about 800
party activists gathered in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is also a convention in which we want to honor John and
Cindy McCain for a marvelous campaign,'' Hull added.
</P>
<P>
   By installing his wife at the head of the Arizona delegation,
McCain assures himself additional media exposure at the national
convention. When it comes time for the roll-call vote, it will be
Cindy who will stand up and deliver Arizona's 30 delegates on
nationwide television.
</P>
<P>
   The feuding between Hull and the senator began when Hull
endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush during the Republican primary, a
move that miffed McCain and garnered national headlines. The
dispute simmered even after McCain ``suspended'' his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After Hull disclosed that she wanted to lead the delegation,
McCain laughingly dismissed the idea during a nationally televised
interview. McCain's preference that his wife, a political newcomer,
lead the delegation angered Hull and her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But after two weeks of Yalta-like negotiations, Hull stepped
aside and allowed the senator's wife to take the lead. Cindy McCain
took the podium and urged unification behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage this party in the tradition of Barry Goldwater,
Burton Barr . . . Jack Williams, John Rhodes, Jon Kyl, Jane Hull
and John McCain _ that we unify together with our primary goal
being to put George W. Bush and his lovely wife, Laura, in the
White House in November,'' McCain said, speaking on behalf of her
husband, who missed the convention for a speaking engagement in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   At the state convention Saturday, May 13, the party also elected
its 30 delegates to the national convention in Philadelphia. For
the most part, the nominating process went smoothly for McCain and
his aides, whose preferred slate remained mostly intact.
</P>
<P>
   The ample supply of public amity between former opponents came
as no surprise to party regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone conducted themselves with grace and
dignity,'' said state Rep. Carolyn Allen, R-Scottsdale. ``They are
both gracious people, they are both good politicians, and this is
not the place to open a wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Thayer Verschoor of Gilbert said party leaders made the best of
a difficult scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awkward situation,'' said Verschoor, a former Steve
Forbes supporter. ``It was awkward from the time the governor came
out and supported Bush. From what I've been able to gather, it
looks like it's worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention had the potential to further roil the already
troubled relations between McCain and Hull, particularly during one
period of voting that had Hull, the senator's wife and Secretary of
State Betsey Bayless all vying for three delegate spots. McCain
aides fretted that had any one of them lost, the McCain camp would
be blamed. All three won, though Hull received the most votes with
67; Bayless and McCain each received 50 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Hull went out of her way to emphasize her improved relationship
with Sen. McCain, noting that there had been ``a lot of work in the
last couple of weeks'' between the two staffs. Hull said she had
not yet spoken to McCain about the convention, saying she has been
working on her education plan while he continues to campaign in
behalf of GOP congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But when she was pressed for an opinion on McCain's tepid
endorsement of Bush last week, Hull revealed that the cracks in the
relationship haven't been entirely caulked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control John McCain,'' she said. &QL;

KEEP FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Charred walls, blackened car shells, skeletons of
furniture - the bleak legacy of the Los Alamos fire sends a strong
message to many forestry experts: Set more fires.
</P>
<P>
   To non-experts, that may seem crazy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``controlled burn,'' intended to destroy brush at
Bandelier National Monument, that raged out of control across
northern New Mexico last week.
</P>
<P>
   To Los Alamos resident Katherine Gluvna, stuck in a Santa Fe
shelter, the decision to burn defied common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my kids said, `It's too dry to be doing this,'' Gluvna
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another controlled burn turned into a wildfire on the Grand
Canyon's North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's broad agreement that controlled burns are
critical in keeping forests healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tragedies are horrible, but we shouldn't let that
dissuade us from using controlled fire,'' said Kieran Suckling of
the Center for Biological Diversity, a Tucson-based environmental
group. ``Airplanes crash, but we don't ban air flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the federal government has suspended the practice
of controlled burns, banning them for 30 days in the West while
agencies investigate how New Mexico's ``Cerro Grande'' fire broke
loose.
</P>
<P>
   And the logging industry draws a different lesson from the
disaster: Cut more trees.
</P>
<P>
   Why fight fire with fire?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Western landscape is adapted to fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the pine forests around Flagstaff, ``fires were coming
through every couple of years,'' said Wally Covington of Northern
Arizona University. These were low-intensity fires, which mature
trees could easily survive. They burned off underbrush, preventing
it from building up into fuel for a giant blaze.
</P>
<P>
   This normal cycle of fires ended in the late 1800s. For most of
the following century, government policy was to fight every fire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, woodlands are in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's forests are dangerously overgrown, with 10 times more
trees per acre than before, most of them small and fire-prone,
Covington said.
</P>
<P>
   So much dry and dead material has built up that when blazes
occur, they're ferociously hot and rapidly climb to the crowns of
trees, creating a tower of flame.
</P>
<P>
   The entire arid West is a tinderbox.
</P>
<P>
   The number of wildfires in the United States that destroy 1,000
acres or more has increased from 25 in 1984 to an average of 80 a
year, nearly all in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the government has done a U-turn. The U.S.
Forest Service now allows many remote, naturally caused fires to
continue burning. Agencies are even setting their own fires to
clear underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Most go off without a hitch, like a recent 7,000-acre burn near
Safford by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. In 20 years, just 1
percent of the National Park Service's 3,783 controlled burns have
escaped their limits.
</P>
<P>
   That's small comfort to people forced to flee the Los Alamos
fire. High winds whipped it out of control, and the government is
investigating whether the superintendent of Bandelier should have
known about weather reports predicting the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Humans created much of the cycle of fires here, maintains fire
historian Stephen Pyne, a professor at Arizona State University. He
believes Native Americans set fires to make paths, remove flammable
vegetation near their homes and attract game by keeping meadows
open.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pyne said, ``it's our job as a species to do the
burning; we can't just defer to nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists note that the forests of North America evolved
before people arrived on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   And the job of fire management is a lot harder than lighting a
match.
</P>
<P>
   Most obvious right now is the risk of losing control.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is another factor. The U.S. General Accounting Office
estimates that reducing brush and other fuel in national forests,
through a combination of burning and cutting, costs $320 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   And Pyne says vast areas would have to be burned three or four
times to remove all the undergrowth, then burned again regularly.
</P>
<P>
   All that burning can threaten endangered species, water quality
and clean air.
</P>
<P>
   NAU's Covington says land managers are caught in a bind when
they do a controlled burn.
</P>
<P>
   The best conditions are cool temperatures, little wind and high
moisture content in the fuel. But that, Covington said, ``is a
prescription for fumigating the land,'' trapping smoke near the
ground and harming people with lung and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is to wait for the temperature to warm and the
wind to pick up, carrying the smoke into the upper atmosphere _
thereby increasing the risk that the fire will race out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the best weather conditions, Covington argues,
Arizona's forests are too dense for simple burning. To avoid
disaster, he said, the smaller trees must be cut down.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists generally agree to thinning out some trees,
but not the big old-growth trees needed for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Wahl, executive director of Santa Fe-based Forest Guardians,
opposes commercial operations and says any trees that are chopped
down should be mulched in place.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the timber industry, however, say logging is the best
relief for much of the fire danger.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo County Supervisor Lewis Tenney Jr., formerly co-owner of
a sawmill, sees proof in areas ravaged by the ``Dude'' fire on the
Mogollon Rim a decade ago. Some places have yet to recover, he
said, but ``in the areas logged prior to that fire, you've still
got trees standing.''
</P>
<P>
   A pitfall with logging, the GAO said, is that areas with the
most valuable timber often are not those with the greatest wildfire
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Klein of the American Forest &AMP; Paper Association
argues that cutting makes more sense when forests are so overgrown
it's hard to keep control of a burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in Los Alamos and the Grand Canyon doesn't
really surprise us at all,'' he said. ``This was inevitable.'' &QL;

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - It's not like the moms didn't warn them. ``Don't make
us come up there,'' the moms said to the politicians. You think
they listen?
<TEXT>
<P>
   We don't want to put the guns away, the politicians say. We like
playing with them. Our friends give us money to let them play. It's
fun, and everybody's doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody was jumping off a cliff, would you want to do
that, too?'' the moms say.
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, the politicians mutter under their breath, figuring
the moms can't hear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you use that tone with us, mister,'' the moms say.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians know what moms want. They've heard it a million
times. Moms want legislation requiring cool ing-off periods and
back ground checks on all gun sales. They want licensing and
registration. They want mandatory safety locks. They want to limit
handgun pur chases to one a month.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't like that, the politicians pout.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know you don't like it if you haven't tried it?''
the moms ask.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the politicians refuse to budge, or even to listen. The
moms have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to hurt us more than it hurts you,'' the moms
say. They organize a massive Million Mom March for Washington, D.C.
Other groups of moms plan similar gatherings in cities like Phoe
nix, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   News of the march makes the papers and the TV news, which makes
the National Rifle Association sniffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pro-mom,'' whines Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop crying, or we'll give you something to cry about,'' the
moms say. But they al ready are. They're serving up a heaping dose
of homemade common sense, which tastes like castor oil to
politicians and extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for you,'' the moms say.
</P>
<P>
   Not all moms agree, say the politicians. The Second Amendment
Sisters believe we don't need new laws. They organized a
counterdemon stration called the Armed In formed Mothers' March.
What do you say to that? the politicians ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all,''
the moms say.
</P>
<P>
   That's not fair, say the politicians. We run the coun try now.
You should treat us like grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll start treating you like adults when you start acting
like adults,'' say the moms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, moms have asked the politicians many times to fix
laws that allow buyers at gun shows to avoid background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close that loophole,'' the moms say. ``Were you born in a
barn?''
</P>
<P>
   But, when it comes to guns, politicians don't pay any at
tention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put an eye out with those things,'' the moms tell
them, to no avail. (The moms believe politicians get this trait
from their fathers' side of the family.)
</P>
<P>
   Some things you must do yourself, however. Or, as moms always
say, ``Do you expect those socks to pick up themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   So, the moms decide to march on Washington and tell the
politicians exactly what they should do when it comes to regulating
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   When the politicians ask why _ and they will _ I'm hoping the
moms give them the only reason a mom needs to give a quarrelsome
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we said so.'' &QL;

You should treat us like grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll start treating you like adults when you start acting
like adults,'' say the moms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, moms have asked the politicians many times to fix
laws that allow buyers at gun shows to avoid background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close that loophole,'' the moms say. ``Were you born in a
barn?''
</P>
<P>
   But, when it comes to guns, politicians don't pay any at
tention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put an eye out with those things,'' the moms tell
them, to no avail. (The moms believe politicians get this trait
from their fathers' side of the family.)
</P>
<P>
   Some things you must do yourself, however. Or, as moms always
say, ``Do you expect those socks to pick up themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   So, the moms decide to march on Washington and tell the
politicians exactly what they should do when it comes to regulating
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   When the politicians ask why _ and they will _ I'm hoping the
moms give them the only reason a mom needs to give a quarrelsome
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we said so.'' &QL;

FOREST SERVICE FEE PROGRAM QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JIM WALSH  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - For more than a year, a U.S. Forest Service clerk who
was mired in debt dutifully counted the fees hikers and boaters put
into the Tonto National Forest drop boxes _ and routinely took some
home for herself.
</P>
<P>
   The few dollars that Linda Holmes skimmed off every chance she
got totaled about $1,000 a month, which went toward medical bills
and payments on a pickup truck and a sport utility vehicle, she
ultimately told authorities.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was caught last year, the total take was
$17,400. That made it the biggest internal theft yet in the
government's four-year experiment to charge visitors fees for use
of the federal forests. Her husband, who claimed he never knew
about the theft, also was charged.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, 46, and her husband, Johnny Holmes, 52, a veteran Gila
County sheriff's deputy who patrolled Roosevelt Lake, are to be
sentenced this month under a plea deal involving federal theft
charges. Both are eligible for probation. Linda Holmes repaid the
money she stole in hopes of avoiding prison.
</P>
<P>
   The case has given new ammunition to critics of the forest fees
program and has helped bring sweeping changes to the way the Forest
Service collects and counts the money.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who earned about $20,000 a year as Forest Service
accounts maintenance clerk, had been allowed to count the cash in a
room by herself, with few checks and balances. Her attorney said
the temptation finally proved too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a bowl full of money in front of her every day and
said, `Count it up, tell us what was there, we'll take your word
for it,'' attorney David Michael Cantor said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a licensed, bonded contractor handles all the money. And
the tin drop boxes have been replaced by ATM-style machines in
Oregon, Washington state and in the Tonto National Forest,
including at the parking area at Roosevelt Lake near Globe where
Holmes worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular case has been a wake-up call,'' said Greg
Super, a Forest Service official in Washington, D.C., who
supervises the program nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1996, the experimental program collects fees from
national forest visitors for the services they use and plows most
of the money back into forest maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, hikers and boaters pay a $4 parking fee, with
boaters charged an additional $2 per boat. Camping fees range from
$6 to $14 per night.
</P>
<P>
   The only two known instances of employee theft under the program
have been in Arizona. An employee of the Coronado National Forest
near Tucson was convicted last year of stealing $3,900 at Mount
Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 99 percent of our employees are good people,'' said
Bud Shaver, special agent for the Forest Service's law enforcement
division in Phoenix. ``Unfortunately, two of them have been caught
in the cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the human element. There is a percentage of people who
will take advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the Holmeses said they were particularly
vulnerable to temptation because they had plunged into debt after a
serious motorcycle accident in Colorado left them hospitalized.
Bills piled up when they failed to win an insurance settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The stealing began in February 1998 and continued through June
1999, when Johnny Holmes made a fateful trip to a bank
drive-through window with a fellow sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes' colleague thought it odd that a deputy making $30,000 a
year was jamming wad after wad of $5 and $10 bills into the
canister to make a deposit. The deputy reported the incident,
triggering the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For failing to disclose the thefts and benefiting from them,
Holmes was kicked off the force after 17{ years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny was a good deputy. He was caught between his loyality
to his wife and his loyality to his job,'' Gila County Sheriff Joe
Rodriquez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paid for it with his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda and Johnny Holmes declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Their crime has cast a harsh spotlight on a program under review
by Congress for extension beyond 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another example of incompetence and confusion by the
Forest Service in administering this program,'' said Rob Puddicombe
of Free Our Forests, a Southern California-based environmental
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program doesn't seem to have any organization or
direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Odem, a Northern Arizona University professor and
president of the Grand Canyon Private Boaters Association, is
likewise unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a poorly conceived program. This incident at
Roosevelt Lake underscores that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials disagree, saying the program has
improved maintenance and added facilities the public wants.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tonto National Forest alone, the user fees raised more
than $2 million in 1999 and $1.96 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was happening all over the place, lots of times,
they'd have a point. But this is an isolated incident,'' Super
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In isolated incidents, I think we listen and take actions to
keep it from happening in the future.'' &QL;

Tension between Dierker, relief corps starting to show
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Between the Reds, with players named Gookie and Pokey, and the
Astros' bullpen, which put on another Huey, Dewey and Louie kind of
performance, you couldn't have had more animated antics if you
tried.
</P>
<P>
   For the embattled Astros bullpen, this Reds 8, Astros 7 debacle
Saturday afternoon at Enron Field was like a Dr. Seuss story on
heavy doses of caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   There was no joy in Mudville yet again after the pen blew a
handy effort by starter Chris Holt. And all the Whos in Whoville
couldn't have found exactly Whom to blame for a crumbling
performance in a game the Astros should have won.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Jay Powell and Yorkis Perez? It took them only nine
pitches to give up three home runs and turn Holt's 6-2 lead into a
tied ballgame and yet more heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Billy Wagner? Kid Heat was one pitch away from striking
out Ken Griffey Jr. in the ninth, protecting a come-from-behind
Astros win and soothing all his bullpen mates' pain. But Griffey
sent a 97-mph fastball into the upper deck in right-center field
with a man on, giving the Reds the win and sending more ripples of
frustration through the Astros' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this was a horrible effort by the guys who are supposed to
protect leads and secure wins. Sure, the boos the relievers heard
Saturday were deserved. And if you thought the Astros' bullpen had
troubles, this day only offered more cause for grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers don't lie,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   But the more the bullpen has struggled this year, the more you
have to realize there are more things at work than simply the
location of pitches or Ten-run Field's hitting-friendly dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   There are bad vibes. There is finger-pointing and as much
confusion about the messages they're getting from manager Larry
Dierker as there is anxiety from Dierker regarding what to expect
from his relief staff.
</P>
<P>
   After Griffey took Wagner's best pitch and all but chipped paint
off the second-deck railing in right-center, Dierker was asked if
Wagner's best pitch is as overwhelming today as it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. They're making a lot more contact with his
fastball,'' Dierker said. ``There's nothing wrong with his
velocity, but maybe the movement isn't there like it was. Hitters
seem to have a better read on him. They used to swing and miss
everything, a lot of times not even getting close, instead of
fouling him off so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wagner: ``That's not the first time I've heard Dierk say
something about my fastball. If he doesn't like the way I throw,
well, there are a lot of other guys out there in the bullpen that
he can bring in. If he doesn't think my fastball is moving, hey,
get a bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, of course, figures to make everyone happy again. But
right now is not a good time to be an Astros reliever or the guy
that calls them in from the pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try everything you can and hope that eventually you find
guys that can pitch consistently,'' Dierker said. ``We've had some
good games but haven't had the consistency. We haven't had anyone,
including even Billy now, string some innings together.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wagner said, the numbers don't lie. But before Saturday's
awful outing, the bullpen had been making strides toward finding
something of a groove. In 13 previous games, the bullpen had a
combined ERA of 1.58.
</P>
<P>
   Including Wagner's blown save Friday night, the pen's ERA
against the Reds is 14.14.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was tough because it came on top of (Friday's)
game,'' Dierker said. ``That's just the way it's been with us. When
you think you're getting things the way you want, they blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues the Astros must address are the confidence the
relievers show in their best pitches and how Dierker handles a
relief staff that needs his experience now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   When the Astros enjoyed the pitching-friendly confines of the
Astrodome, Dierker consistently rode out the bad times with his
hurlers. Saturday, when Powell gave up a two-run homer to Michael
Tucker to trim the Astros' lead to 6-4, Powell got a quick hook,
leading to two more home runs off Perez and a tied game.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he took the ball from Powell because he didn't see
the kind of pitches he had gotten from him in recent outings. And
who are we to question Dierker's judgment on that one? The man
knows pitching. Of Wagner, he continued to wonder about the
movement of his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are going good, Wagner would get that pitch by
them,'' Dierker said. ``When they're not, Griffey hits a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad vibes need to be fixed as much as bad pitches.

Memories keep Van Dyken going
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   His name is Andrew and his face tells a story that no one should
ever have to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Of hurt. Of fears. Of tragedy. Of tears.
</P>
<P>
   He is a victim of the Columbine High School massacre in
Littleton, Colo., unhurt physically but hardly untouched.
</P>
<P>
   When Amy Van Dyken climbed out of the pool and onto the victory
platform at Atlanta in 1996 as the first American woman ever to win
four gold medals in a single Olympics, she proclaimed, ``This one
is for all the nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   Now as she prepares for Sydney, Van Dyken swims to heal herself
and the lost survivors at Columbine. Kids like Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken's own scars come from a pair of surgeries on her right
shoulder in the past two years. Andrew's scars come from the
memories of that April day in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He is a young boy who was working in the choir room at the time
of the shooting and when he ran out of the school to safety,
literally tripped over the bodies of some of his friends. The star
basketball player at Columbine who recently committed suicide was
his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew doesn't see why all of this had to happen to him, to his
school, to all of them. Still trying to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look in his eyes, there's a sadness,'' Van Dyken said. ``A
sadness that's there when you talk about the tragedy, when you talk
about baseball, anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many faces searching for answers, so much sadness
there and never the same reaction. She sits in a ballroom of the
Hyatt Regency at the Olympic summit miles away, and she can see
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met one kid who said his one friend was dead and another was
in a wheelchair because he convinced them to stay inside the
cafeteria rather than go outside for a cigarette,'' Van Dyken said.
``So when I have a bad day, it's not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken's own story in Atlanta was inspirational enough as the
one-time insecure schoolgirl shocked the world by striking gold in
the 50 freestyle, 100 butterfly, the 4x100 freestyle relay and
4x100 medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected Van Dyken to wash over the pool like a tsunami
in 1996, especially not those who knew the Colorado native as
something less than confident in her school days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not the most popular or the prom queen or any of that,''
she said. ``And the reason I said what I did in Atlanta was to tell
other people out there that you don't have to be on top of your
game your whole life. I wasn't, and I won four gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from a lot of people after the Olympics. People who
said, `That was me. I was the outcast. I didn't fit in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Things actually got painful for Van Dyken in the aftermath of
the Olympics as she first needed surgery in the summer of 1998 to
repair the labrum in her right shoulder and just last Jan. 4 had
surgery again to remove scar tissue and repair the rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   It was the day after the second operation that she sat there,
arm in a sling, unable even to brush her teeth, that the
27-year-old Van Dyken wondered if it was worth her effort to try
for Sydney. She asked a few friends and relatives, as well as
fiance Tom Rouen, punter for the Denver Broncos, and not one of
them gave her the encouragement to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the gleam for swimming in my eye,'' she said. ``I
don't want to be 40 years old and be sitting there some day with my
kids and have them ask me, `Mom, why didn't you try doing it
again?' And I wouldn't have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is doing it for all of those hurt friends at Columbine,
whom Van Dyken practically has adopted since the tragedy. Rouen
grew up across the street from the school. You couldn't live in
Colorado and not be touched by what had happened to your neighbors.
So she reached out.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Broncos, Rockies, Nuggets and Avalanche pro
franchises, there have been pizza parties and autograph sessions
for the kids. There was a holiday show where she joined the
Columbine swim team as one of the seven swans-a-swimming in The
Twelve Days of Christmas. Most of all, she looks into eyes like
Andrew's and she still sees the terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day Time magazine came out recently with the cover, I was
on the stairs where that picture was taken,'' Van Dyken said. ``I
was sick. It made my skin crawl. To see these children. To see
(bullet) holes in the walls that haven't been covered up. I'm
thinking, `Am I standing where somebody lost their life?'''
</P>
<P>
   She competes with a memorial ribbon on her swimsuit and the
letters ``CHS'' on her cap and is petitioning the USOC to allow her
to wear them in the Olympics. Never mind four gold medals. What she
sees is Andrew's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't forget,'' Amy Van Dyken said. ``We can never
forget.''

LAKERS HAVE FOUND MATURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix forward Rodney Rogers, his voice resolute,
said it would be a different series, yesiree, if his shots were
falling like they were two weeks ago. To Rogers' right, center Luc
Longley was speaking as though coming up with an answer for
Shaquille O'Neal is so tough, it ought to be worth $1 million if
you can get it right, lifeline or no.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns sounded Saturday a lot like the Los Angeles Lakers of
not so long ago. Not exactly defeated but definitely disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   In the measured voices of the Suns, you could hear echoes of
O'Neal last year saying the Lakers' Western Conference semifinal
series against San Antonio would have unfolded differently if he
hadn't missed so many of the shots he usually makes (never mind
that he could barely breathe, much less see, over the Spurs' Tim
Duncan and David Robinson).
</P>
<P>
   In the mystified tones of the Suns on the matter of stopping
O'Neal, you could hear echoes of the Lakers talking about Utah's
pick-and-roll during the 1998 Western Conference Finals on their
way to being swept.
</P>
<P>
   It's really no mystery why the Lakers are leading 3-0 in their
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series against the Suns.
They can close out the series today at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Under Phil Jackson's tutelage, the Lakers' learning curve this
season has followed the trajectory of a rocket. They are playing so
much smarter than they have in the past and so much more serenely.
</P>
<P>
   This Lakers team is making its opponents beat it instead of
beating itself. It is a marked departure from previous years when
the Lakers would run into adversity in the postseason and spend all
their collective energy running helter skelter trying to chase it
off the court.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal would fume when his foes fouled him with impunity, Kobe
Bryant would blithely proceed as if divinely called upon to deliver
his team from defeat, and the team's cohesion eventually would come
completely unglued.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers weren't able to block out adversity, and so they
invariably succumbed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Game 1 of last year's Western Conference semifinal
series? O'Neal missed 13 of 19 shots and steadfastly refused to
kick the ball out when Duncan and Robinson doubled down on him, and
the Lakers lost to the Spurs by six points.
</P>
<P>
   And who can forget Game 2, when Bryant missed two free throws
with less than 20 seconds to play, the Lakers let Duncan get off a
deadly accurate jumper despite having a foul to give, and Bryant's
last-gasp inbounds pass ricocheted off Derek Fisher's hands and
face?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers swore all the way to summer that they were done in by
bad breaks, not the Spurs, in succumbing in four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were a team in full, as they would go on to prove
against the Knicks in the NBA Finals. The Lakers were like a
12-year-old trapped in a 6-foot-3 body; they looked mature, but
they hadn't yet had their emotional growth spurt.
</P>
<P>
   They were fine as long as things were going their way, but a
full-blown pout was always just a disappointment away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely grew up a little this year,'' Rogers said of
the Lakers. ``Last year, they'd get behind, a team could put
pressure on them, and they'd fold. This year, they're taking a hit,
and they're coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   We saw it in Game 2 when the Suns held the Lakers without a
field goal for 4 minutes late in the fourth quarter and lost by a
point when Bryant hit a jumper with two defenders crowding him and
less than three seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   We saw it in Game 3 when the Lakers, playing on enemy turf, had
no offensive rebounds in the third quarter on the way to being
badly outrebounded, 11-5, trailed by five with 10 minutes to play
and ended up winning by five points largely because O'Neal, who was
shooting .531 (17 for 32) from the foul line for the series to that
point, made five of seven free throws down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are saying it's a sign of weakness that the
top-seeded Lakers needed five games to dispatch eighth-seeded
Sacramento in the first round. Some people are saying it's a sign
of trouble that the Lakers had to come from behind to win Games 2
and 3 of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Silly people.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it'd be sweet to win every playoff game by 28 points,
the Lakers' margin of victory over the Suns in Game 1. But to sour
on the Lakers' title chances just because they've had to win ugly
is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   It says here these early tests will prove to be a great source
of strength for the Lakers later on. As in next month, not next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing about winning big is it doesn't prepare one's mind
or one's muscle memory for the really tight, really intense games
that are part of the pageantry when the two best teams in the
conference or in the league meet.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that won 67 of 82 regular-season games, the Lakers
are awfully battle-tested and battle-tough. They are stronger for
having had to attack adversity after years of retreating at the
first signs of it.

PARK SPARKS DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Getting a two-hit shutout from Darren Dreifort in
the series opener was huge in many respects for the Los Angeles
Dodgers, particularly in resting the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But in getting eight overpowering innings Saturday from Chan Ho
Park, the Dodgers have the making of the dominant rotation they
thought they had a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Park struck out a career-high 12 batters, and Mark Grudzielanek
had a two-run double with two outs in the ninth as the Dodgers
rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1 before a season-high
48,372 at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Using his breaking pitches to set up his fastball, Park (4-3)
allowed three hits, retired 11 straight at one time, and struck out
Jim Edmonds during a pivotal eighth-inning at-bat in one of the
best performances of his five-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort threw a great game (Friday) night, and this was just
as impressive,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I was
enthralled. ... Some good players never got some good swings off
him. He had a great breaking ball, two different breaking balls,
change-up and fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jeff Shaw got his eighth save, and his first since May 3,
by pitching a perfect ninth inning. Cardinals closer Dave Veres
(0-1) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've seen (Park) throw,'' Grudzielanek said.
``He was consistent around the plate, first-pitch strikes. He made
some pitches when he had to. He didn't (fool) around. There's one
guy on the staff we really need, and that's him. If we have him
throwing like that, it's great. We know what he's capable of doing,
and he showed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning the first two games of the series, the Cardinals are
batting .093 (5 for 54). Meanwhile, Dodgers' starters have allowed
two runs in their last 30 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fun for everybody on the team, and I imagine it's real
fun for the pitcher out there,'' Dodgers ace Kevin Brown said.
``When guys throw the ball like that, it's a lift for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who was 0-2 with a 9.39 ERA in his last three starts, got
off to a rough start on a homer by Cardinals leadoff hitter
Fernando Vina. Replays showed the ball hit the yellow line atop the
right-field wall, which ground rules state isn't a homer, but Park
shook that off.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had two baserunners in the second with one out, but
Park struck out catcher Mike Matheny and got pitcher Rick Ankiel on
a grounder. The next time a Cardinal reached base was a
sixth-inning walk to Vina.
</P>
<P>
   Park was so masterful that he didn't allow a ball to leave the
infield between Placido Polanco's fly out to right for the second
out in the third and Thomas Howard's fly out to center for the
second out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest out of the game, and perhaps Park's season, came
on his 122nd and last pitch. With two out in the eighth, he walked
Vina, and Polanco singled to right to put runners on the corners.
But Park struck out the lefty Edmonds in a seven-pitch at-bat,
filled with curveballs, to end the threat. After the strikeout,
Park showed some rare emotion by pumping his first on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concentrating on the batters, especially Edmonds
and McGwire,'' Park said. ``With one run scored, I didn't want to
give up the bomb. I pitched inside. I feel like I only missed one
itch, and it was a change-up (to Vina).''
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the moment was not lost on Dodgers catcher Chad
Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That at-bat with Jim Edmonds, that was huge,'' Kreuter said.
``That's big time. That's crunch time. That's the kind of thing
that propels him to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel was awesome in his seven shutout innings, striking out
nine and allowing four hits, but the bullpen failed him. Mike
Mohler loaded the bases in the eighth with none out, and the
Dodgers tied it on Eric Karros' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Grudzielanek doubled down the left-field line to
score Kreuter and pinch hitter Dave Hansen to give the Dodgers a
3-1 lead. Grudzielanek went to third when St. Louis left fielder
Ray Lankford, trying to throw the ball back to the infield,
mistakenly threw it into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a game is on the line like that, you try not to miss your
chances,'' Grudzielanek said. ``You want to get a quality pitch and
hit it hard. I just battled and was able to hit it hard.''

KAPONO JOINS UCLA EXODUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerome Moiso and JaRon Rush are gone. Jason Kapono
took the first step Saturday to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he wants to ``test the waters,'' the UCLA freshman
announced he has declared for the NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the Bruins' leading scorer and Pacific-10
co-Freshman of the Year is gone, however.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono, a 6-foot-7 McDonald's All-American from Artesia, has no
plans to sign with an agent, meaning he can declare for the June 28
draft but still return to school if he's not satisfied for any
reason (read: he doesn't think he'll be drafted high enough).
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts think he will be chosen in the first round. Others
think Moiso and Rush will be selected ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso and Rush, both sophomores, declared for the draft May 2.
Kapono had until today to declare. He now can attend NBA tryout
camps and withdraw from the draft by June 21 without jeopardizing
his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the NBA has been a lifelong dream of mine,'' Kapono
said in a statement released by the school (he was unavailable for
comment).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that now is the appropriate time to explore that
option. After the next few weeks, I will be able to accurately
decide what will be my future plans. My first year of college and
playing for Steve Lavin and the UCLA Bruins has been a great
experience. That's why I have left open the door to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono averaged 16 points - second all-time among UCLA freshmen
- and was one of just two players to start all 33 games. He also
set the school single-season 3-point record with 82 made.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin also was unavailable for comment but said
in a statement he understood Kapono's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason has been very deliberate in his approach to exploring
his future in basketball at the next level,'' Lavin said.
``Obviously, I'm happy he's left open the option of returning to
UCLA. If he decides to enter the NBA Draft, it's because he will be
a first-round selection. If he decides to come back to us at UCLA,
we will welcome him with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Kapono elect to turn pro, it will be the first time three
underclassmen have left early from UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has sent numerous players into the NBA, but very few have
stuck in recent years. Ed O'Bannon, Tyus Edney and George Zidek,
who played on the Bruins' 1995 national championship team, no
longer are in the league.

DODGERS' CENTER-FIELD DOOR ROTATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Since Devon White injured his left shoulder diving
for a ball May 2, Todd Hollandsworth has spent more time in center
field in the past nine games than practically all season.
</P>
<P>
   But he's still not to the point of being the Los Angeles
Dodgers' every-day center fielder. In fact, since the
switch-hitting White went down, it's been a strict platoon in
center field, though it's never been classified as that by manager
Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed-hitting Hollandsworth started against the six
right handers, and switch-hitting F.P. Santangelo started against
the three lefties, including Saturday against St. Louis southpaw
Rick Ankiel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I'd love to play seven days a week, but I
recognize the importance of having F.P. out there and (Geronimo
Berroa) out there,'' Hollandsworth said. ``If we're winning, and
we're a better team for it, than that's great for the club. If this
is going to help us win ballgames, I'm all for it. If this is
what's going to make us better in the long run, I don't have a
problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot different role than I was in before.''
</P>
<P>
   Before White's injury, Hollandsworth was wallowing on the bench.
His playing time was sporadic, and his contribution wasn't what he
wanted it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone was trying to trade
Hollandsworth - Seattle, Colorado and Texas showed the most
interest - but would have only done so if the other club was
willing to take on Alan Mills' $5.25 million through 2001 and the
Dodgers got prospects back.
</P>
<P>
   But with White's injury, that plan has been scrapped, at least
for now. And Hollandsworth, eligible for free agency after the
season, has been performing well when in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get starts, I play better,'' Hollandsworth said. ``It's
a comfortable feeling. You feel like you're an integral part of the
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back up Hollandsworth's thoughts. In the 13 games
he's started, he's hitting .323 (20 for 62) with all his homers
(four) and RBI (nine). When he doesn't start, he's hitting .111 (2
for 18), including Saturday's strikeout with runners on first and
third with one out in the ninth in a 1-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time of White's injury, Johnson said he would be
giving Santangelo more playing time to try to work the utility
specialist out of his offensive funk. Santangelo started the season
1 for 20. He's 2 for 9 in his past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Confident Cora: Injured shortstop Kevin Elster took batting
practice and fielded ground balls for the first time since pulling
his right groin and said he would be ready to come off the disabled
list Friday when the Dodgers open a three-game series in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, what's the rush?
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora has filled in nicely for Elster, batting .350 and
playing steady defense. The knock on Cora was his offense, and he's
still unproven in that capacity, but he's off to a quick start. In
his first five games, Cora has seven hits and scored five runs. In
40 games with the Dodgers before this season, Cora had nine hits
and scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more relaxed I'm going to be, especially offensively, the
less I think out there, the better player I'm going to be,'' Cora
said. ``I'm not even thinking about what happens (when Elster
returns). That's the way I have to do it. In spring training, I
didn't say it, but I was looking ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rancid right field: Through the first six weeks of the season,
right fielders have complained about the condition of right field
at Busch Stadium. The back half of right field, extending into the
far reaches of center field, is nothing but choppy clumps of grass.
The Cardinals said the problem stems mostly from having different
kinds of grass in the outfield, and when the weather warms, it
should be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks,'' Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green said. ``It's
pretty bad. There's a little lip there. You have to charge the ball
a little harder because you don't want it to bounce from one
surface to another surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Johnson said it still could be a month before
reliever Gregg Olson is ready to return from his arm problem. ...
Right-hander Mike Fetters is eligible to come off the disabled list
Friday, but he said the Dodgers might give him a few more days to
get ready.

WE MISS YOU, TOO, EDMONDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Credit Mike Scioscia with a smart response to
Jim Edmonds' dig at the fans who come to Edison Field to root on
the Angels - or to root on the Angels' opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of East Coast transplants here, and they root
for the Yankees,'' Scioscia, the Angels manager, said
matter-of-factly. ``I don't think there are a lot of New Yorkers
who move to St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Touche. One point to sunny Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia was speaking in the third-base dugout during batting
practice Saturday, the day after Edmonds celebrated a six-year
contract extension worth $57 million by caustically contrasting the
atmospheres in Anaheim and St. Louis, his former and present
baseball homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in Anaheim and the Yankees come into town, it's
pretty tough to handle when 75 percent of the fans are rooting for
the other team,'' Edmonds, the Cardinals center fielder, had told
reporters in St. Louis. ``It was disappointing to go out every day
and fight to have a good team and still not have the fan support.''
</P>
<P>
   Big man, Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   How brave of him to sit 1,800 miles away, on top of the world
with the gaudiest hitting stats in the major leagues, and fling an
insult at the fans who supported him for seven seasons. He could at
least have told us something we don't know.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding - Edison Field isn't Busch Stadium by almost any
measure, whether it's attendance, hometown passion or baseball
vibe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' Mo Vaughn said in the clubhouse after reading a
news clipping of Edmonds' comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely right in saying it's different,'' said Adam
Kennedy, the young second baseman who went from St. Louis to
Anaheim with pitcher Kent Bottenfield in the spring-training trade
for Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come to enough games, you see what's going on,'' Darin
Erstad said, tacitly agreeing with Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   But being right and having a point aren't necessarily the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Does Edmonds mean to imply the fans, in addition to the Angels'
management, contributed to his discomfort in Anaheim? That wouldn't
say much for his focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a player, the fans don't make or break the situation,''
Vaughn said before the fans filed in for Saturday night's
Angels-Texas Rangers game. ``You're a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what Jimmy's saying. He feels like he's in a
great situation, playing in a town with a great baseball tradition.
But I feel like I'm in a great situation too, with a chance to make
a new tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Edmonds really think St. Louis, where every home game is a
sea of red, presents a realistic standard for Anaheim to aspire to?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the fans, it's the franchises. Cardinals history is
full of championships, heroics and daffiness (and Dizzyness).
Angels history is 40 years of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the people, it's the places. Around Edison Field, the
closest attraction is Disneyland. Around Busch Stadium, the closest
attraction is the Bowling Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't where the fans live, it's where they're from. A lot of
people in St. Louis are from ... St. Louis. A lot of people in
Southern California are from ... anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a reflection of lack of interest in
baseball here or lack of support for the Angels,'' Scioscia said of
the phenomenon of fans here cheering for the Yankees or Red Sox.
``I think it's a reflection of the number of East Coast people in
Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia speaks as a native Pennsylvanian who has lived in
Southern California for the better part of two decades and still
roots for the 76ers and the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's apples and oranges,'' the manager said of St.
Louis vs. Anaheim. ``You're talking about different communities and
different demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find better fans than the diehard Angels
fans. There's a lot of reasons St. Louis is drawing more fans than
us right now.
</P>
<P>
   One reason happens to be Jim Edmonds. If he'd hit .390 with the
Angels, he might have helped to improve things.

MERCKER IMPROVES, BUT BLEEDING STILL A MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Manager Mike Scioscia visited with pitcher Kent
Mercker for about 20 minutes Saturday at the UC Irvine Medical
Center in Orange and said Mercker appeared stronger and in better
spirits than the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   However, doctors are still unsure what caused the hemorrhaging
that was discovered after Mercker left Thursday night's game with
Texas complaining of a headache and dizziness, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Until doctors identify the cause of the bleeding, which had
stopped by Friday, they cannot prescribe a treatment. Team medical
director Dr. Lewis Yocum indicated Friday that surgery was a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who remains in stable condition, is expected to stay in
intensive care throughout the weekend and will be hospitalized
through next week, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt a lot more comfortable,'' Scioscia said after
Saturday's visit. ``I think his wife (Julie) is out here now (from
their home in Ohio), so that helps. He sounded a lot stronger.
Hopefully, we'll get some good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his teammates continued to have Mercker in their
thoughts particularly the fellow members of the bullpen, who like
kickers and punters in football, are bonded by all the down time
they spend together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in (the clubhouse) is pulling for him, but when you
hang out with a person, you become pretty close,'' reliever Al
Levine said. ``We're all trying to think positive and hope things
work out. He knows we're all pulling for him. He's a great guy - a
funny man. I miss him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, because he is in intensive care, is allowed few
visitors. Levine said he was turned away at the hospital Saturday
and was glad to arrive at Edison Field and find out Mercker's
condition hadn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they wouldn't let me in, I thought, `Oh, man. That's not
good,' '' Levine said. ``I figured something bad happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The hole in the starting rotation left by Mercker's illness and
Ken Hill's strained rib cage muscle isn't too big thanks to the
schedule. Jason Dickson, due to come off the disabled list and
pitch today, is taking Hill's turn, and because the Anaheim Angels
are off three times in eight days beginning Monday, that enables
them to go two weeks - until May 27 - with only four starters:
Dickson, Kent Bottenfield, Jarrod Washburn and Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds update: Jim Edmonds, who signed a $57 million, six-year
contract extension Friday with St. Louis, said that one of the
reasons he signed the deal was because of the tremendous support of
the Cardinals fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first at-bat in spring training I got a standing ovation,''
said Edmonds, who was traded for Bottonfield and second baseman
Adam Kennedy. It was louder than any time in Anaheim during a
regular season game. ... I wanted to play where there was a
hometown feeling and fans who cheered for the home team.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, a native of Philadelphia, said it's simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of transplanted East Coast people living here,''
he said. I don't think that many people move to St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Brother's perspective: Angels director of player development
Darrell Miller, after learning that little brother Reggie had been
kicked out of the Indiana Pacers' playoff loss to Philadelphia for
taking a swipe at the 76ers' Matt Geiger, shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie doesn't know how to fight,'' Darrell said.

RANGERS BEAT ANGELS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels demonstrated once again Saturday night that
there's no quit in them when they're behind. Unfortunately for
them, there's not many wins either.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels staged a late rally for the second consecutive night
against the Texas Rangers, but for the second time a row, all it
got them was close when Mo Vaughn, with the tying and winning runs
on base, grounded out to conclude a 6-5 loss Saturday night to
Texas before 33,236 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the sixth consecutive game in which the Angels trailed
and while they rallied to win two of them _ including coming from
five runs down against Oakland _ the pattern is becoming a concern.
</P>
<P>
   It shows we have a lot of heart, but we're going to have to
control the bleeding early,'' said Angels mananger Mike Scioscia.
``It seems like the last 10 days, we've always been behind early.
It's great to be a comeback team. You just don't want to have to
prove it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In this one, the Angels trailed 5-1 entering the bottom of the
seventh and 6-4 as they took their last at-bat. As they did Friday,
they knocked around Texas closer John Wetteland in the ninth, but
couldn't put him away.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro and Bengie Molina singled to begin the inning
and Palmeiro scored on pinch hitter Scott Spiezio's sacrifice fly
to the warning track in left. But after Darin Erstad walked, Adam
Kennedy flied out and Vaughn hit a slow roller to shortstop Royce
Clayton for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are now 0-15 in games they've trailed after seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to jump out early,'' said Kennedy, who was 0
for 4, including a fly out in the first that preceded Vaughn's solo
homer and a ground out in the eighth that was followed by Vaughn's
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about other guys, but I've been throwing away too
many at-bats early. I take the first couple of at-bats for granted.
If I'm on base when Mo hits the double and the home run, it's a
different game. Being in the game (at the end) is what you ask for
every night and it's fun to come back. (But) it's too much of a
fine line to be doing that every night. We need to be jumping out
early and putting pressure on their pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they did little with Rick Helling, who limited them to
three hits and one run --- Vaughn's fourth of the homestand and
11th of the season --- through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels closed the deficit to 5-3 in the seventh when Helling
dropped a toss while covering first base and then stewed on it,
walking Troy Glaus and Palmeiro on nine pitches. Molina and Benji
Gil followed with sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got within 5-4 in the eighth when Vaughn barely beat
right fielder Scarborough Green's strong throw on Garret Anderson's
single. But Texas added a run on Chad Curtis' two-out RBI single
off Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   The late inning drama overshadowed the first start of the season
by Angels left-hander Jarrod Washburn. The 25-year-old left-hander,
recalled Wednesday from triple-A Edmonton when the Angels sent
Ramon Ortiz down, was hurt by three long balls --- solo homers from
Ruben Mateo and David Segui, and a two-run homer by Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up five runs on six hits, walked three and struck out
five in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't give up three home runs, it's a good outing,''
Washburn deadpanned. ``You get away with a lot more mistakes (in
