<HEADLINE> King Sihanouk Meets Hun Sen on Political Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk
met here Saturday with Second Prime Minister and Vice-President of
the Cambodian People's Party Hun Sen to discuss political issues.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Hun Sen advised media representatives that he
had reported on the situation and conditions in the country to the
king. He said they also discussed the forthcoming elections and
the progress that had been made so far.
</P>
<P>
"I have reported to his majesty the King that I and the royal
Cambodian government will try our best to make the upcoming
elections free, fair and credible, and without violence," Hun Sen
said.
</P>
<P>
The king expressed his wish to stay in Cambodia until the end
of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the highest priority for Cambodia now is to
mobilize efforts for organizing the elections and for stabilizing
the country, and not about setting up an international tribunal to
try Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his grave concerns about the motives of those
countries that are urging trials for Khmer Rouge leaders now.
</P>
<P>
"We should make those considerations after the elections and
they should be decided by the National Assembly," He said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about when he would meet with Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen
said he had once planned to meet the prince, but now he has
reasons not to meet him: one reason is that Ranariddh is still
calling himself the first prime minister, and the other reason is
connected to his relations with the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
"Our first prime minister is Ung Hout not Ranariddh," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen and his entourage arrived here Friday. He made his
first public appearance, since the death of his mother on March
10, on April 29 at a peace rally.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen and his 14-member delegation are scheduled to visit
Thailand on May 6. He and his Thai counterpart, Chuan Leekpai,
are expected to oversee the signing of agreements on drug
suppression and an extradition treaty.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Say Its Delegation Not to Come Back to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The delegation of the Afghan
Taliban militia to the current round of intra-Afghan peace talks
will not come back to Islamabad for Sunday's meeting, a senior
Taliban official here told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative to Islamabad, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid,
said he himself would represent the Taliban at the talks and would
be accompanied by some other Taliban officials based in the
Pakistani capital.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for the Taliban delegation to come to
Islamabad. We have already discussed all the issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Joint Steering Committee was constituted to form the Ulema
(religious scholars) Commission. It has no authority to discuss
the remaining issues on the agreed agenda," Mujahid said,
referring to the lifting of the blockade to humanitarian
assistance to central Afghanistan, the cease-fire and an exchange
of POWs.
</P>
<P>
"We have informed the United Nations and OIC (Organization of
the Islamic Conference) that the Taliban delegation will not come
to Islamabad for Sunday's meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have proposed that the Ulema Commission hold a meeting
either in Jalalabad (capital of Afghanistan's Nangarhar province)
or in Islamabad next Thursday," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the five days of talks on April 26-30, the Taliban
accepted the Northern Alliance's request to include 20 people from
each side in the Ulema Commission despite the fact that the
Northern Alliance only controls eight Afghan provinces out of the
total 26, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Taliban only agreed to allow the U.N. and
other international organizations to provide medicine to central
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Mujahid stressed that the remaining issues on the agreed agenda
should be discussed by the Ulema Commission, not by the Steering
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"I have been given the authority to talk to the delegation of
the Northern Alliance tomorrow (Sunday)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fazal Hadi Shinwari, head of the Northern Alliance
delegation to the intra-Afghan peace talks, told Xinhua that they
would go to the talks "in accordance with the promise made on
Thursday."
</P>
<P>
"We expect the Taliban will also come. If they not, we will
talk with these people (led by Adbul Hakeem Mujahid)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shinwari also said the lifting of the blockade to humanitarian
assistance to central Afghanistan will be "a minor issue" in the
Afghan peace process and should not have been the reason for the
stalemate of the current round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The intra-Afghan peace talks, which began last Sunday, ran into
a deadlock on Thursday due to differences between the two sides
over issues relating to the lifting of the blockade, the
cease-fire and an exchange of POWs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was adjourned for two days to allow the Taliban
delegation to consult with their leadership on these issues. It is
scheduled to resume on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that with the absence of the Taliban delegation,
the intra-Afghan peace talks are not expected to achieve any major
breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ambassador: Israel-Turkey Ties to Be Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli new Ambassador to Ankara
Uri Barner said on Saturday that Israeli-Turkish relations will
continue to improve in the future.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Barner as saying in a
seminar in Istanbul that there was no need for Arab world to show
great concern over the cooperation between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the seminar "New Atlantic Initiative", he said
mutual visits between Tel Aviv and Ankara will increase in the
future, adding that the trade volume of the two countries will be
increased to 1 billion U.S. dollars from the current 650 million
dollars in the next year.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey will develop cooperation in the medical
field, said Barner, adding that medical equipment exchange is
planned between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Military cooperation between the two countries is also to
develop as Turkey and Israel are reportedly to start a new
project to jointly produce medium-range defensive missiles with a
range of about 150 kilometers, similar to the "Arrow" missiles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ankara and Tel Aviv are expected to hold high-level
military talks in Israel at the end of this month to discuss the
"threats" to the Middle East and bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iran, Iraq and Syria are among countries which will be
reportedly discussed at talks for their alleged support for
terrorism and their efforts to increase their offensive missile
technologies, a Turkish military source was quoted by the Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Israel and the United States held joint naval
maneuvers in the Mediterranean off Israel last January, which
drew harsh reactions from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Israel is upgrading 54 Turkish F-4 warplanes under a
contract worth 632 million dollars and has also won a bid to
upgrade 48 Turkish F-5 fighters.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly expanding Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has
prompted grave concerns from Iran and Arab nations in the
region, which accused Turkey of betraying the interests of the
Muslim world by coalescing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly explained that its military collaboration
with the Jewish state is not directed against any third party.

<HEADLINE> Africa Optimistic in Malaria War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Africa is optimistic in its
endeavors to eradicate malaria which has affected the social and
economic development of the continent, health experts meeting in
Harare said.
</P>
<P>
The experts who met for the two-day preparatory committee
meeting on the African initiative for malaria control in the 21st
century were from different institutions affiliated to the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a provisional report released Saturday in Harare,
the meeting which ended Thursday resolved to develop an effective
and timely malaria surveillance and information system.
</P>
<P>
That would help develop a practical malaria control strategy
in all malaria endemic countries by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
It was also envisaged that by the year 2030, malaria would no
longer be the major cause of deaths in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The targets adopted by the meeting included reduction of
malaria mortality by 50 percent by the year 2010, and reduce by
at least half the socio-economic negatives of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The experts said they were encouraged to come up with the
strategy which channeled 10 million U.S. Dollars towards malaria
control in Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
A further boost to their initiatives was through the
commitment of African leaders to combat the disease as evidenced
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Harare Declaration on
Malaria Prevention and Control signed in June 1997 in Zimbabwe's
capital city.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also suggested that a competent interim
secretariat be urgently recruited. The secretariat would have a
degree of operational independence from WHO.
</P>
<P>
It was also recommended at the meeting that an African
Initiative for Malaria (AIM) steering committee be elected based
on a coalition of major stakeholders and medical personnel to
develop the fight against malaria.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Vows to Support Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei vowed Saturday to continue support to the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in its fighting against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In our support for the Muslim nation of Palestine, we
won't be deterred by any political or propaganda pressures,"
he assured the visiting Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying that
 "so long as there is a struggle for god, it cannot be defeated by
any initiatives, ploys, politics or weapons, and as long as such a
spirit guides the Palestinian struggle, the victory over the enemy
(Israel) is a certainty.''
</P>
<P>
He also termed Israel as "the cancerous tumor created in the
Middle East by colonial powers."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yassin said that Hamas would continue its struggle
for liberation of Palestine and not give up even an inch of the
Palestinian land, adding that "in the course of our struggles, we
will either achieve martyrdom or liberate the holy Qods
(Jerusalem)."
</P>
<P>
Praising Iran for its support for the Palestinian struggle
against Israeli occupation, Yassin said that Iran has adopted a
"principled and realistic stand" toward the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Palestinian issue has concerned all the
Islamic states and freedom-loving nations, hoping that the Muslim
world would pool efforts in supporting the Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Yassin also met with Iranian former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Terming the stance adopted by Hamas with regard to the Israeli
aggressions as realistic, Rafsanjani urged unity and cooperation
among the Islamic states to help resolve the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Yassin arrived here Tuesday for a five-day visit on the fourth
leg of his five-nation tour, which has taken him to Egypt, Syria
and Qatar. He will go to Kuwait after winding up his visit to
Iran.

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges U.S. to Officially Announce its Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) once again called the United States to officially make public
its initiative on Israeli troops withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat in Ramallah made the remarks
Saturday before the U.S. Vice President Al Gore's talks with PNA
Chairman Yasser Arafat, Jerusalem Media and Communication Center
said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat called on the U.S. to officially announce its initiative
and set a time limit for Israel's response.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative calls on Israel to hand back to
Palestinians 13.1 percent more of the West Bank land in its second
troop redeployment. But Israel insists on a handback of no more
than 9 percent and opposes the U.S. initiative to be made public.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Gore and Arafat would discuss the stalled peace
process, Palestinian-U.S. relations and the setup of a Palestinian
representative office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will visit Cairo Sunday on his way to London to attend
the May 4 talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who is also expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Banjamin
Netanyahu there.
</P>
<P>
The London talks, brokered by British Prime Minister Tony Blair
in his recent Mideast tour, aims to revive the year-long stalled
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Arafat has ruled out the possibility of a
face-to-face meeting with Netanyahu in London.
</P>
<P>
PNA and members of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) warned Friday that failure of the
London talks could drive the region back into violence.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian self-rule region is Gore's third leg on his Mideast
tour, which has taken him to Israel and Saudi Arabia. He will also
travel to Cairo to end his regional visit.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Protecting Environment of Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Vice President Masoomeh
Ebtekar Saturday called on regional countries to adopt necessary
measures to protect the environment of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Ebtekar, who is also head of the Environmental Protection
Organization (EPO), said at a seminar on the Caspian Sea
environment protection in Ramsar, Iran's northern province of
Mazandaran, that economic and industrial activities in and around
the Caspian Sea should be coupled with environmental protection
policies.
</P>
<P>
Rapid industrial and economic development can lead to the
destruction of natural resources, therefore it is necessary for
regional states to adopt sustainable development policies, she was
quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying,
</P>
<P>
She warned that the world biggest inland sea is exposed to
environmental crises, saying that fluctuations in level of the sea
waters has created many environmental problems for the region.
</P>
<P>
Ecology of the sea is threatened by various kinds of
pollutants, Iran's first female vice president said, terming the
oil pollution as being among the major pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration and exploitation over recent decade have posed
serious threats to the environment of the sea, she said,
reiterating Iran's stance against any plan to lay oil pipelines
under the sea bed.
</P>
<P>
Ebtekar stated that Iran hopes collective efforts made by
countries and international organizations will guarantee the
success of Caspian Sea environmental protection programs.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, co-sponsored by the EPO and the United
Nations, was attended by Iran, Russia, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan
and Kazakhstan, aiming at compiling a definite regional program
on removal of industrial, oil, urban and agricultural pollutants
and preservation of biological reserves in the sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Friday transported back home
some 473 Somali refugees from the Darwanaji refugee camp, eastern
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials working in the camp said that Friday's
repatriation brings down the total number of refugees from north
western Somalia at the Darwanaji camp to 31,617, the Ethiopian
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials said the Somali refugees at the Darwanaji camp
will all be repatriated by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Somali refugees have camped at Darwanaji since 1991
following the civil war in Somalia in 1988 and the subsequent
clan conflicts between 1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
Now, 225,507 Somali refugees have taken shelters at eight
camps in eastern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNHCR says in its latest fact sheet that Ethiopia
is currently hosting 304,436 refugees who fled neighboring

LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG began Saturday a house-to-house search for arms
and ammunition in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of the former military junta who have not surrendered
to ECOMOG are also the target of the searching exercise,
according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored

</P>
<P>
No result has been released so far, but the searching has
demonstrated the continued determination of the Nigerian-led
sub-regional force to free the country from illegal arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The searching exercise is said to be triggered off by a
violent explosion in western Freetown Friday, which killed a

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Captures More Liberian Ex-Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- With the capture of six more former
Liberian factional fighters, the west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG said Saturday it has detained a total 88 such
persons.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fighters belonged to the defunct National
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by the country's
warlord-turned President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
They were captured while fighting alongside the remnants of
Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and allied rebels in the
eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led sub-regional force, which is launching a
mopping up exercise on the remnants of the junta forces and
allied rebels in that area, has repeatedly condemned Liberia's
support to the junta.
</P>
<P>
The accusation met with strong opposition from the Liberian
government.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the six who was sent to the Sierra Leonean
capital Freetown Friday said he was among a group of former NPFL
fighters re-grouped as special task force to fight with the junta
remnants and allied rebels against ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
He said they were each given 100 U.S. Dollars, according to a
British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, which overthrew the junta in mid-February, has
captured most parts of Sierra Leone. Due to alleged Liberian
support, the mopping up exercise in the east has made little
progress.

<HEADLINE> IGC Revises Forecast For World Wheat Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Revisions have been made to initial
forecasts for wheat harvests in several major producers in
1998/99, according to an announcement by International Grains
Council (IGC) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The major wheat producers, which might reduce production, are
the EC, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
However, these are largely offset by increases for Australia,
Canada and the United States. The net change is a decline of 1
million tons in forecast world production to 592 million tons, IGC
said.
</P>
<P>
The world wheat trade is unchanged at 98 million tons. The
increase of 2 million from the previous year reflects higher
demand for milling wheat, with durum expected to decline and trade
in feed wheat and wheat flour likely to be maintained at current
levels.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast at one million tons, lower
than previously estimated at 599 million tons.
</P>
<P>
World wheat stocks at the end of the season are projected at 2
million tons. higher at 124 million tons, due mainly to a higher
estimated carryover from 1997/89, according to IGC.
</P>
<P>
On coarse grains, world production is forecast at 896 million
tons, 7 million lower than in the previous year and 16 million
below the 1996 record of 912 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Hosts 5th Arab People's Forces Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The 5th Arab People's Forces
Conference opened Saturday in Baghdad with the participation of
500 Arab politicians, intellectuals and MPs.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein's representative, Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan hosted the three-day conference, which is under
the theme "with the help of a unified Arab struggle, we can lift
the sanctions imposed on Iraq and liberate Palestine."
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the opening ceremony, Ramadan expressed his
appreciation of the stance adopted by some Arab countries against
the U.S. threats and toward the lifting of U.N. embargo on Iraq
imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, stressing that such
stance embodied pan-Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan confirmed Iraq's full compliance with all its
obligations set in relevant Security Council resolutions and
complete cooperation with hundreds of inspection teams in Iraq
over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, spies of the American Central Intelligence
Agency and army officers controlled the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), which is in charge of the weapons inspection in Iraq,
and endeavored to sabotage Iraq's national security and overthrow
its leadership.
</P>
<P>
The vice president pointed out whenever Iraq got ready to see
U.N. sanctions lifted, the U.S. agents in the UNSCOM would create
a crisis followed by the U.S. threat to use force to kill innocent
Iraqis and destroy symbols of civilization in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said Arabs should be aware of the double-standard policy
pursued by the U.S. in dealing with the Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said Iraqi leadership has decided to urge the Security
Council and all governments and parties concerned to implement
immediately Paragraph 22 of resolution 687 if they wanted to
maintain a balanced relationship between Iraq and the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The paragraph provides that sanctions imposed on Iraq should
be lifted once all its weapons of mass destruction have been
destroyed. But without an affirmative report by UNSCOM, the
sanctions will remain in place.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Iraq will make their enemies feel that
they have to pay a high price if they decide to keep the embargo
in place because Iraq has destroyed all weapons banned and the
world should now assume their responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Parliament Approves Government's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's parliament Saturday
approved government's harsh measures to boost the economic reform
in the oil-dependent Gulf state in context of the plunge of oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Following a closed-door session of the parliament to discuss
the nation's financial situation, Kuwaiti Finance Minister Sheikh
Ali Salem Al-Ali said that "for the first time there is consensus
between the parliament and the government over views of a
prospective plan," according to reports of Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said "the parliament has accepted to take harsh measures
for the sake of economic reform."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti government would present the National Assembly a clear
plan on specific economic reform proposals within a month period,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said "we are eager to remedy the economic crisis...before
the beginning of the next fiscal year (July 1 to June)."
</P>
<P>
The nine-year low oil prices in the world market since the
start of this year has a very negative impact on Kuwaiti economy
and Kuwaiti government last week projected a 1.733 billion Kuwaiti
Dinars (5.719 billion U.S. dollars) deficit for the 1998-99 fiscal
year starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser warned last Sunday
that Kuwait could face an "economic catastrophe" if Kuwaiti
crudes remained at 10.5 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, Kuwaiti government approved the 1998-99 budget
which is based on an oil price of 12 U.S. dollars a barrel. It
forecasts a deficit of 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, the highest
deficit since the Gulf War in 1991 and 41 percent higher than
1997-98 budgeted deficit.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Cabinet last Sunday asked its economic committee to
study a number of economic measures searching for new sources
of income in response to the fall of oil prices
</P>
<P>
The government wants to "diversify revenue (sources), reduce
public expenditures and improve the management of public funds
in response to fall in oil prices," Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Nasser
Abdullah Al-Roudhan said last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Cabinet last Sunday discussed a memorandum by the
Ministry of Finance that deals with the impact of declining
oil prices on the treasury to finance the government's budget.
</P>
<P>
The memo "includes 27 measures that should be implemented
to cut public spending and reduce challenges facing the budget
including its deficit," he added.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Hold Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
leader Yasser Arafat is due in Cairo Sunday for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak before attending the London meeting to
revive the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will leave for London immediately after his meeting with
Mubarak scheduled for Sunday evening, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss issues possibly to be raised
during the May 4 London talks, during which U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright will meet separately with Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sell its proposal to
keep the peace process moving, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative, which is likely to be made public in
London, calls on Israel to withdraw from a further 13.1 percent of
the West Bank over 12 weeks in its second troop redeployment, with
each step met by PNA's security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has insisted on handing back no more than 9 percent
and opposed public announcement of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said London meeting will also discuss the third stage
of Israeli redeployment in the West Bank, the guarantee for its
implementation and the timetable for the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have finished troop withdrawal in three stages by
this summer under the Hebron accord signed in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March 1997
after Israel decided to build a settlement in Arab East Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians want as capital of their would-be state.
</P>
<P>
Wishing the London talks a success, Moussa said "the meetings
are highly significant so far as they will decisively clarify a
set of points relating not only to the Palestinian track but also
to the peace process in total."
</P>
<P>
He also warned of dangers of grave frustration and escalation of
tensions if the London talks fail.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Saturday sent a message to the U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, voicing Iran's concern over the growing tension and
unrest in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi
warned of the possibility of spread of conflict in the Tajikistan
capital city of Dushanbe, saying that under such circumstances all
the agreements reached based on trust in order to pave the way for
peace and stability in Tajikistan has been disrupted.
</P>
<P>
This situation has caused much concern among the regional
countries, particularly the Islamic Republic of Iran, which
shares historical, cultural and religious commonalties with that
neighboring country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Iran's readiness in providing all possible
assistance to bring peace to Tajikistan, Kharrazi said that as
before, Iran still believes that the only way to achieve a just
and a permanent peace in Tajikistan will be a simultaneous and
timely implementation of peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the settlement of differences should come
under negotiations and exchange of dialogs, hoping that the
Tajik two rival parties will be encouraged to continue their
negotiations and execute the previously reached accords with the
mediation of the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the Tajik pro-government
groups and the opposition clashed in the capital during the past
few days, killing at least five people and injuring dozens of
others.

</P>
<P>
The crackdown, which claimed 18 lives, was caused by a
conflict between his supporters and Hezbollah members over the
ownership of a religious center in the area.

<HEADLINE> Newly Discovered Galaxy The Oldest Object Ever Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A newly found galaxy, lying some 12.3
billion light years from the Earth, is the oldest and most distant
object ever seen, The Independent newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is calculated that light from the galaxy would have started
travelling towards the Earth when the universe was less than 800
million years-old, about one-fourteenth of its present age.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that some of the objects inside the galaxy may
be going off for the first time and making stars. Such early
starbirth is believed to hold significant information for the
evolution of the universe.
</P>
<P>
The group of astronomers, including Dr Richard McMahon from
Cambridge University, made the discovery with one of the two
10-meter twin Keck telescopes on Mount Mauna Kea, Hawaii, the
world's most powerful optical observatories.
</P>
<P>
The new galaxy has displaced the previous record-holder,
another galaxy found just in March, by dating from about 60
million years earlier in cosmic history, The Independent said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Sunday called for recommitment to the principles of a free
and independent press.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of World Press Free Day, May 3,
Annan said that over the past 50 years, the world has made great
advances in fostering freedom of the press, and the United Nations
has been a persistent advocate of such freedoms and has been
instrumental in laying the legal foundations for them.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the freedom of the press ultimately
implies freedom for reporters, broadcasters and editors to work
without interference or coercion. It means the freedom to report
events or express opinions guided solely by the highest standards
of professional ethics.
</P>
<P>
Annan said modern media are primary agents of globalization in
educating people about the world; in uncovering discrimination,
abuses of human rights and other injustices; and in giving people
throughout the world a sense that their concerns have a place on
the global agenda.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said many developing countries are
conscious of the need to improve and strengthen their media
organizations. He welcomed and encouraged all efforts to foster
such working conditions in all countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that over the past decade, the United
Nations has reported the murders of 474 journalists, which reminds
the international community of the grim reality that still hangs
over universal application of the freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
To honor the memory of those members of the press who have
fallen in their quest to bring news to the world, to tell the
truth and to expose injustice, the U.N. chief called on this
special day for recommitment to the principles of a free and
independent press that advances a culture of respect for human
rights, for good governance, and for social integration and
development among all people.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of Nepal, Maldives Discuss SAARC Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala and visiting Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom on Sunday discussed issues relating to the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Nepal's Foreign
Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Koirala reiterated Nepal's commitment to working in concert
with the other six SAARC member countries to promote cooperation
based on trust, understanding and shared benefits.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that in the process of negotiations
on transition to the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), the
special needs and problems of the least developed member countries
-- Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal -- would be fully
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that time has come for SAARC to embark on
concrete areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Gayoom, current chairman of SAARC who is on a tour of the SAARC
capitals, arrived in Nepal Sunday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Koirala on his consultations with leaders of Sri
Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan during his visits to these countries,
and the progress made in implementing the major decisions of the
ninth SAARC summit held in May 1997 in the Maldives, which
includes the progress in establishing SAFTA by 2001 and in
eradicating poverty from the region preferably by 2002, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
It said the two leaders also discussed issues concerning the
environment and child welfare in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Maldivian president is scheduled to visit the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A member of his entourage said Gayoom's current tour of SAARC
countries will not include India and Pakistan, the other two
member countries of SAARC.
</P>
<P>
The president is expected to visit the two countries some time
before the 10th SAARC summit opens in July in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
arrived here Sunday for a three-day official visit to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya trip is the third leg of Annan's African tour which
has already taken him to Ethiopia and Djibouti and will bring him
to Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Eritrea before returning
to New York on May 10.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. boss is expected to meet Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi and hold discussions with leaders from opposition parties and
church bodies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that civil wars in Rwanda and Somalia would be
likely to dominate Annan's discussions with leaders of the eight
African countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, hundreds of thousands of refugees from
the Rwanda and Somalia have affected nearly all the other
countries Annan visited or is going to visit during his African
tour.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is accompanied by his wife, was met at the Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport by Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana and U.N. officials based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
In a special report, Kenya's Sunday Times newspaper said, "We
hope and trust what you (Annan) did in Iraq and that you will
also give a try in troubled African states like Somalia, Rwanda
and Burundi and help bring sanity to countries in Africa which
have been swimming in pools of blood."
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to leave the country for Tanzania on
Tuesday.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Hong Kong citizens
participated in a parade-cum-carnival on Legislative Council
elections for the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A Variety of colorful programs such as children's chorus,
instrumental music and magic performance were presented to explain
to the public the details of the arrangements for the first
Legislative Council elections of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, which are scheduled for May 24.
</P>
<P>
The proper procedure for casting ballots was demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
David Lan, secretary for Home Affairs, said the electors'
active participation in the Legislative Council elections are the
most important.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the participants on the arrangements for the
elections and voting procedures, Lan said the responsibility of
the government is to ensure the elections are conducted in a fair,
open and honest manner.
</P>
<P>
The obligations of the electors are to earnestly exercise their
civic rights to elect Legislative Council members so as to
implement the principles of "Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lan urged all registered electors to cast their votes on
polling day.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is divided into five geographical constituencies of
Hong Kong Island, Kowloon West, Kowloon East, "New Territories"
West and "New Territories" East.
</P>
<P>
Publicity activities have also unfolded in other geographical
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council elections will produce 60 members with
20 to be returned from the geographical constituencies through
direct elections, 30 from the functional constituencies and 10
from an 800-member Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the May 24 elections, a total of 156 candidates will
contest 50 seats of the Legislative Council. Candidates from 10
uncontested functional constituencies have already automatically
become members of the Legislative Council.

<HEADLINE> Population Growth: One of Africa's Greatest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and some sub-Saharan
countries such as Kenya, South Africa and Botswana have now
reached a critical turning point in their efforts to meet the
dual challenge of rapid population growth and poor reproductive
health, said a international study released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Population Action International (PAI), commissioned a study
which concluded that the sub-Saharan region's prospects for
economic development largely depended on the success or failure
of governments in accelerating efforts to expand family planning
services and to combat deaths in pregnancy and childbirth and
from AIDS, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The study noted that two-thirds of countries in the region had
active family planning programs, up from just a handful in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
''This dramatic change in government policy has been
accompanied by a fundamental shift in people's attitudes towards
child bearing,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
''Urbanisation, the rising cost of education and other basic
needs, and the improved chances of survival for children are all
affecting the traditional preference for large families," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The use of family planning, although still low at 18 percent
for the region as a whole, had increased dramatically in some
countries, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
However, the study established that with only 10 percent of
the world's women, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 40 percent of
all pregnancy-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
About 22,000 African women die each year from unsafe abortion,
reflecting both legal restrictions on abortion and limited access
to contraception.

SHENYANG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Two converters refitted from open
hearth furnaces have recently entered operations in the second
steel mill operated by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang)
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The event represents a milestone for technological upgrades at
Angang, one of the nation's iron and steel giants.
</P>
<P>
The steelworks initiated a project to transform its open hearth
processing late last year.
</P>
<P>
An additional converter is expected to enter operations within
the year and will help Angang end its use of open hearth furnaces.
</P>
<P>
Angang's continuous cast ratio is expected to exceed 90 percent
during 1999.
</P>
<P>
When compared to open hearth furnaces, the converting process
is not only less costly, but also consumes less power and creates
less pollution.

<HEADLINE> HK's Endeavor to Protect Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's classrooms in primary
and secondary schools as well as tertiary institutions are the
latest battleground in the fight against pirated goods, the Trade
and Industry Bureau said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, staff members from the Intellectual
Property Department (IPD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region Government have visited 85 Hong Kong schools with more than
23,000 school children aged between 15 and 17 - a prime target of
pirated goods.
</P>
<P>
The long-term education initiative is believed to be a world
first in ongoing efforts to protect intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The government's aim is to visit all 400 secondary schools
within the next five school years and then to start all over
again, the Trade and Industry Bureau said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Primary schools will soon receive a new teaching kit which
helps younger children understand the importance of protecting
original work through role-play exercises and a video featuring
messages from pop and movie stars.
</P>
<P>
Presentations to tertiary institutions focus on the students'
special areas of interest. Budding actors, for example, are asked
to perform in a play with a script about protecting copyright.
</P>
<P>
Three new laws -- the Copyright Ordinance, Patents Ordinance
and Registered Designs Ordinance -- were introduced in June last
year to provide greater protection for intellectual property
rights holders as well as bringing in tougher penalties for
pirates.
</P>
<P>
A Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance was also passed in
March this year.
</P>
<P>
A "taking it to the schools" campaign was kicked off at the
beginning of the current school year, in September 1997, as part
of Hong Kong's concerted efforts to eliminate the manufacturing,
selling and buying of pirated goods including software, movies,
music and fashion accessories.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very strong enforcement regime through our Customs
and Excise Department but relying on enforcement is not enough,"
said acting Senior Intellectual Property Examiner Belinda Sin, who
heads the IPD's Promotion and Education Section.
</P>
<P>
"We need to get the message through to the kids who use these
products that buying them is morally wrong," he added.

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China will not accept any action
designed to include the Taiwan Straits either directly or
indirectly in the sphere of Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
Guidelines, according to Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian
today.
</P>
<P>
General Chi emphasized China's position during afternoon talks
with Fumio Kyuma, director-general of the Japanese Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
China has paid close attention to laws Japan has either amended
or enacted with regard to the Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
Guidelines because they concern Taiwan, said Chi, who also serves
as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and state
councillor.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's stand on the Taiwan issue is
consistent and clear-cut, said Chi, adding that the Taiwan issue
is China's domestic affair. He stressed that attempting to include
the Taiwan Straits into the sphere of the guidelines would both
violate and interfere in China's sovereignty, and would be totally
unacceptable to the Chinese government, people and armed forces.

Chi said China has also noticed that Japanese leaders have
expressed their willingness to deal with that issue by adhering to
the spirit of the Joint Statement issued by the two governments
and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and
Japan. "We sincerely hope that Japan will handle the issue with
great care, and will refrain from any actions which would cause
worry on the part of neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
Fumio Kyuma noted that Japan fully recognizes the government of
the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government
representing China in accordance with the principles of the
Sino-Japanese joint statement. He said Japan fully understands and
respects the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
"We uphold this position," said Kyuma, noting that Japan will
exhibit the utmost care when dealing with the Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
With regard to bilateral relationships, Chi stressed that China
and Japan must take the past experience as reference and strictly
adhere to the spirit of the bilateral joint statement and peace
and friendship treaty while handling existing problems and any
divergence in the process of developing friendship.
</P>
<P>
Chi said China is willing to engage in exchanges with the
Japanese defense sector in all areas at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Fumio said Japan is pleased with the progress of bilateral
exchanges in the realm of defense and is ready to further such
exchanges to increase mutual trust and understanding.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Wins Her First Clay Title in German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Top-ranked Martina Hingis struggled to
hold off the tough Jana Novotna 6-3, 7-5 on Sunday, winning her
first title on European red clay in Hamburg of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Hingis needed four match points to finally beat the
second-seeded Novotna, ranked No 3 in the world, in a match
marked by sloppy play by both players. It was the third title of
the year for the 17-year-old Swiss.
</P>
<P>
The Czech is 12 years Hingis' senior.
</P>
<P>
Neither player was at her best. Novotna strayed from her usual
serve-and-volley game, staying behind a lot and using a slice
backhand in an attempt to unsettle Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Hingis served poorly, but Novotna could not capitalize and
Hingis finally won in 98 minutes. Novotna wasted three break
points in the last game.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Cautious Optimism for London Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- As Israeli and Palestinian
leaders are leaving Sunday for the crucial London peace talks,
there is a sense of cautious optimism about a breakthrough in
breaking the prolonged peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to
hold separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat in a desperate, if not the last, bid to break the
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's media adviser, said Sunday that
his cautious optimism was not based on expectation for an
agreement but rather on the realization on both sides that some
progress must be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He repeated that Israel would not accept the proposed U.S. plan
calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli pullback from the West Bank,
but he added that progress could be seen in reaching agreements on
opening the Gaza airport and building the Karni industrial zone
for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Washington is eager to push through its pullback plan in order
to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The dispute over
the size of pullback has been one of the outstanding obstacles
stalling the progress in the talks for over a year.
</P>
<P>
The London talks were brokered by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair during his first official visit to the region late last
month. Blair, whose country holds the European Union's rotating
presidency, tried hard to inject new impetus into the moribund
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross and U.S. Vice President
Al Gore have been in the region since last week, launching
intensive efforts to narrow the huge gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has publicly endorsed the U.S. plan for a 13.1 percent
Israeli pullback, while Israel has remained adamant in rejecting
the plan citing that any redeployment exceeding 9 percent would
seriously endanger its security.
</P>
<P>
There have been no clear signs so far indicating Israel's
willingness to make any compromises, but Netanyahu has reportedly
hinted that he might consider an 11 percent pullback in exchange
for tighter PNA measures in cracking down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Although no dramatic headway was made, the U.S. diplomatic
mediation has indeed brought the two sides much closer than weeks
ago. After meeting with Netanyahu Friday, Gore said the London
talks offered a great occasion for progress, urging the sides to
seize the crucial opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed with the U.S. pro-Israeli bias and its repeated
delays in publishing the redeployment plan, the PNA still hoped
Washington would keep pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Following the Arafat-Gore meeting that ended early Sunday
morning in the West Bank city Ramallah, PNA Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said: "On pure
forecast, the hope is not that high, but the determination is."
</P>
<P>
Shaath indicated that even if no agreement on the redeployment
would be reached in London, the U.S. should at least publicize the
13.1 percent pullback plan to keep pressure on Israel. "They
(Americans) must say something to our public, to the Israeli
public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan strongly refuted the Palestinian demand, saying
Israel did not expect any ultimatum to come out from the London
talks. "I don't think there is going to be any kind of ultimatum,
or that kind of announcement. What's important here is that the
two sides sit together and try to iron out their differences," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But for the Palestinians, as well as the Americans, it seemed
that there have been too much talks, and it is high time for
action. The U.S. urgency for quick progress in the peace talks is
intensified by the fact that according to the Oslo agreements, the
one-year countdown to the end of the Oslo process has begun in the
month.
</P>
<P>
Till now, the most important final-status talks have yet
started to address the central issues in the Israeli-Palestinian
disputes, including Jerusalem, refugees and final borders.
</P>
<P>
The continued lack of progress and deepening desperation on
the Palestinian side could lead to the unilateral declaration of
independence by the Palestinian side in May, 1999, a move that
could lead to direct confrontation with Israel and renewed
tensions in the region.

<HEADLINE> Chief U.N. Military Observer Arrives in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua)-- The head of the U.N. military
observer mission in Sierra Leone has arrived in the capital
Freetown to help the Nigeria-led west African force with
disarmament and demobilization of combatants in the country.
</P>
<P>
Indian-born Brigadier-General S.M.C. Joshi arrived in Sierra
Leone's capital on Friday, a U.N. statement said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The other nine military liaison officers -- two Russians, two
Zimbabweans, two Kenyans, two Botswanans and one briton -- will
arrive over the weekend," said the statement reaching here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The role of the mission is to help the Nigerian-led west
African force which ejected the military junta from Freetown in
February with disarmament and demobilization of combatants by
creating a climate of confidence in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Joshi will be based in Freetown, with other members of the
team in other S.leonean cities of Bo, Kenema, Makeni, Koidu and
Lungi.
</P>
<P>
The statement said west African chiefs of staff would meet in
Ghana's capital Accra on May 4 and 5 to discuss the objectives of
their ECOMOG force following S.leone's elected President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah's return home in March.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on the military
junta to pressure it to restore power to Kabbah, whose 1996
election ended four years of army rule. The junta took power
after disgruntled soldiers toppled Kabbah in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Junta loyalists and their rebel allies remain active in the
areas near the border with Liberia and Guinea, despite an ECOMOG
offensive to snuff out resistance. Fighting has focused on the
diamond town of Koidu.

COLOMBO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Army will launch a
recruitment campaign to enlist 15,000 troops in schools across the
country, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the military will ask local officials to
identify schools where officers could carry out propaganda
campaigns to encourage youngsters to enlist.
</P>
<P>
The military's current drive to capture a main highway in the
north of the country from the Tamil rebels is moving slowly due to
lack of troops.
</P>
<P>
The enlistment of 15,000 additional soldiers would help offset
a shortfall caused by desertions and casualties.
</P>
<P>
The number of deserters is estimated to be over 19,000,
according to local press reports.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Equates Winning Youth To Winning the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese Communist Party and
State leader Hu Jintao today equated winning young people to
winning the future.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that three generations of Chinese leadership with Mao
Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin at the core have placed
priority on issues related to youth as part of the strategic view
concerning the destiny of the state and Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Hu, China's vice-president and member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, made the remarks during a meeting with
representatives of young award winners and volunteers in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed to the forthcoming May 4th celebrations marking
the Youth Day, and expressed hope that young people will inherit and
display the glorious traditions of the May Fourth Movement to make
greater contributions to China's reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Young students launched a nationwide anti-imperialism campaign
on May 4, 1919, as part of an effort to pressure the then Chinese
government into boycotting the foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged young Chinese to study hard, work diligently, be
willing to sacrifice and join in practical work. "Studying hard
is a major step enabling young people to make progress", said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He called on youngsters to study Deng Xiaoping Theory and learn
modern science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Forms Wage Commission for Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has set up a wage
commission for industrial workers, the independent United News of
Bangladesh (UNB) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A wage and productivity commission for public sector workers
would also be set up soon, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said while
addressing a discussion.
</P>
<P>
She said steps would be taken to solve the existing problems
faced by workers in jute, textile and yarn mills in the private
sector through tripartite consultations among the government,
owners and workers.
</P>
<P>
"Our law provides equal wages for men and women for equal labor
as we are respectful to all the provisions formulated by the ILO
(International Labor Organization) for the welfare of laborers,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are loyal to the policy that 'labor is not a commodity' and
our aim is to improve the living standard of the workers," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The government was implementing five development projects to
ensure the welfare of the workers and imparting training in 21
labor welfare centers to maintain an "excellent" working
relationship between the workers and the employers, Hasina told
the meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 180 labor disputes had been resolved since her government
was formed in June 1996, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also said the government had taken effective measures to
resolve the issue of child labor in the country. Child workers
were gradually being withdrawn from mills and factories, and the
readymade garment industries were already free of child labor, she
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel is due to increase
expenditure on infrastructure projects, Israel Radio reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the new infrastructure program, which
will be unveiled by Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman in the near
future, calls for adding 1 billion shekels (about 270 million
U.S. dollars) to infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the funding will be spent for
accelerating the construction and upgrading of roads, railroads
and major ports.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the funding is to be set aside for the housing
improvements in development towns and the improvements of tourism
infrastructure of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the program is aimed at easing bureaucratic
restrictions on economic development, including removing water and
sewage management from local authorities and creating designated
companies to run these utilities.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Treasury expected that the program would lower the
unemployment rate, which had reached 8.3 percent by February,
the highest rate since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Professor Urges Further Emancipation of Minds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing University Professor Hu
Fuming, 62, never expected that the article he drafted in a
hospital bed some 20 years ago would once again emerge as a hot
national political topic.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, 1978, Professor Hu bravely published an article
entitled "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Verifying Truth" in a
 national newspaper. The article challenged leftist thinking
centered on the "two whatevers," or "resolutely upholding whatever
policy decisions made by Chairman Mao and unswervingly following
whatever instructions issued by the late leader."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese press has showered Hu with interviews in recent
weeks and he has published a dozen of articles in the country's
official leading newspapers and magazines recalling the political
event which took place 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese press has described the professor as one of the
pioneers advocating China's emancipation of minds in the late
1970s and noted that his article helped Chinese people escape the
blind worship and rigid thinking modes characteristic of the
"Cultural Revolution" period (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Hu has spent the period leading up to the 20th anniversary of
publication of his article in the Guangming Daily in his office in
Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu Province, fully occupied with
interviews and writing essays for a dozen-odd news and theoretical
magazines.
</P>
<P>
The professor, a diabetic with gray hair, exhibits great vigor
when recalling his accomplishments in 1978. "Furthering the
emancipation of minds has been a pleasing aspect of my work," said
Hu.
</P>
<P>
He produced the original copy of the Guangming Daily which
carried the article and noted that the essay was initially carried
in "Theoretical Trends," the internal journal of the Party School
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
following revisions made by the school's theoretical research
office. The article was carried on the front page of the Guangming
Daily in early May 1978.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, Liberation Army Daily and Xinhua News
Agency carried the essay over the next few days, with the work

<P>
Over the following two years, Chinese people followed Deng
Xiaoping's guidelines regarding emancipation of the mind and
seeking truth from facts and succeeded in breaking through the
rigid thinking mode of the "two whatevers."

<HEADLINE> Professor Urges Further Emancipation of Minds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu recalled his preparations for writing the essay in the late
1970s by noting, "The Cultural Revolution was over and China was
at a critical stage in setting things right. I felt the crux of
matter was emancipation of the mind at a time when country was
calling for reestablishment of the guidelines for seeking truth
from facts."
</P>
<P>
"My wife was diagnosed with a tumor and was hospitalized just
as I was preparing to write the essay. It was a very hot summer,
and I drafted the framework for the essay while spending time with
my wife," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years have passed since the debates on the criterion for
verifying truth, and the convening of the Third Plenary Session of
the 11th Central Committee of the CPC has promoted the great
emancipation of minds in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the past two decades have witnessed great
achievements in China's reform, opening-up, economic construction
and social development.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's speeches during his 1992 south China tour was
another drive for emancipation of minds and finally settled
disputhes over whether development was on a socialist or
capitalist road and laid a theoretical basis for China to shift
from the planned to a market economy, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that the 15th National Congress of the CPC held last
year has set forth political, economic and cultural programs for
the preliminary stage of socialism. The congress made major policy
decisions on adjustments and improvements in the ownership
structure and on restructuring state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted that related efforts call for continuous emancipation
of minds to realize the Party's policy decisions and fulfill
China's magnificent cross-century objectives and tasks.

<P>
Hu said the reform, opening and modernization drive are a
historical process which needs continuous development and just as
the emancipation of minds cannot be finished all at once.
</P>
<P>
"At each major historic junctures, The emancipation of minds
and seeking truth are necessary at each major historic juncture to
enable people to make a breakthrough in outdated concepts and
smash the shackles of the old system in order to promote reform
and opening."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that boldly developing a non-public ownership
economy on the premise of taking public ownership as the mainstay
is conducive to the development of productive forces and social
stability and consolidation of political power.
</P>
<P>
"Some people mistake the introduction of the shareholding
system in state-owned enterprises for privatization, and believe
that the growth of foreign-funded enterprises will shake the
public ownership economy," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
"Such concepts must be changed through the further emancipation
of minds," according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the adjustment in China's ownership structure is
conducive to the growth of the private economy and the
introduction of overseas funds, but will do even more good for
development of the state-owned economy.
</P>
<P>
"Emancipating public ownership from its original single form
will help the country focus on the development of sectors and
enterprises which have a decisive bearing on the national economy,
and will in turn help to give full play to the leading role of the
public ownership economy," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu, philosopher and an economist, was born into a poor farm
family south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"My family received 0.2 hectare of land following the founding
of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and I was able to
have received an education thanks to the new government's
establishment of the first middle school in my hometown.
</P>
<P>
"I belong to the first generation of intellectuals fostered by
New China, and have a profound affection for New China," said Hu,
who graduated from Beijing University and then studied
philosophy at the People's University of China.
</P>
<P>
"I have the responsibility as researcher on Marxism to
contribute my efforts to the modernization of China."
</P>
<P>
Hu has written and edited numerous books, including "The Rise
of Township Enterprises in Southern Jiangsu Province" and
"Modernization of Southern Jiangsu Province".
</P>
<P>
The professor, who also serves as vice-chairman of the Jiangsu
Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is currently organizing some 20
researchers to write the book entitled "Study of China's
Modernization."

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A bronze statue of Yan Fu
(1854-1921), one of the first presidents of Beijing University,
was unveiled today as part of activities to celebrate the
university's centenary anniversary.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators in Gulf for Troops Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member U.S. senator
delegation ended a two-day visit to Kuwait Sunday and left for
Saudi Arabia on a Gulf tour to carve out financial support for the
U.S. troops deployed in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The senators, headed by Chairman of the U.S. Senate
Appropriations Committee Ted Stevens arrived here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They have visited U.S. ground troops and airmen deployed in
Kuwait and met with Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the visit, Stevens said their Gulf tour
was aimed at finding "the answer to the problem of costs" for
U.S. military deployment in the region.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that over half of the U.S. forces are deployed
overseas in places such as Bosnia, Somali, Korea and the Gulf,
thus putting "a tremendous strain on the system to keep the
rotations and keep the deployments."
</P>
<P>
"This is the main reason why we are here, to make some
suggestions for change which will help us maintain the
commitments we have made," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Stevens said in Washington that his group's
Gulf tour was going to push U.S. allies in the Middle East to
provide funds to maintain the U.S. military missions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currently has 37,400 troops in the Gulf, which
include 18,000 sailors and Marines, 9,000 Air Force troops, 7,800
Army soldiers and 2,600 other personnel. Half of the troops were
deployed during the U.N.-Iraq crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Washington has decided to keep the military presence in the
region to monitor a test of Iraq's compliance with a
Iraq-U.N. deal on allowing U.N. inspectors in charge of
dismantling weapons of mass destruction in Iraq access to all
sites, including presidential compounds.
</P>
<P>
The deal signed between Baghdad and U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan in February has averted a U.S.-led military strike against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Stevens said that to maintain the increased U.S. military
deployment in the Gulf region, Washington needs more financial
support from its Gulf allies.
</P>
<P>
"We assume we are going to be here for a very long time and
that we need greater support," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that just like the case of Desert Storm (code name
of the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait), we should
have a coalition support for the forces that are here," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, it was reported that most of the Gulf countries are
reluctant to share the billion-dollar-worth bills for the U.S.
military deployment. Some of the countries are still ridden under
financial pressure caused by huge payments to the U.S.-led
military operations in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
So far, Kuwait, which was liberated by the U.S.-led allied
troops from Iraq's occupation in 1991, was known as the only Gulf
state willing to fund the U.S. military presence in the region.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Appoint New Chief of General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to appoint the next
chief of general staff of its army to replace the incumbent Amnon
Lipkin Shahak, who will step down on July 9, Israel Radio
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two top candidates are General Matan Vilani, a former
deputy chief of general staff, and General Shaul Mofaz, who is
the incumbent deputy chief of general staff.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
has made decision on his choice and would report it to the next
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said Mofaz, 50, is Mordechai's candidate. But
defense sources noted that Mordechai has never publicly backed
Mofaz, and has expressed support for him only in a very few
forums in private.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who will meet the
two candidates before he leaves for London on Sunday, is also
reportedly leaning toward Mofaz, though Vilnai, 54, is one of his
childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the general staff have kept quiet about
who they favor to be the next chief of staff. But one general
said it was widely believed that Vilnai deserves the job.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said that any decision would require cabinet
approval.

</P>
<P>
Of the total German imports from Nigeria, crude oil accounted

worth of goods to Nigeria in 1997, 11.5 percent more than the

<HEADLINE> Taliban Accuse Opposition of Sabotaging Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia on
Sunday accused the rival Northern Alliance of sabotaging the
intra-Afghan peace talks, ignoring "certain concessions" made by
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Intra-Afghan peace talks, or the first meeting of the newly
formed Afghan Joint Steering Committee, broke down here Sunday
because of sharp differences between the two sides over certain
issues.
</P>
<P>
The ostensible reason for the breakdown was the refusal by the
Northern Alliance to talk with the Taliban because of the changing
of the Taliban delegation.
</P>
<P>
The previous five-member Taliban delegation led by Abdul Wakeel
failed to return to Islamabad for the scheduled meeting with the
Northern Alliance on Sunday. The Northern Alliance raised
objections to the authority of the three-member Taliban delegation
led by Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban representative based in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The new Taliban delegation to the proposed meeting on Sunday
also consisted of two other Taliban officials based in the
Pakistani capital.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the Taliban delegation accused the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance of "openly and practically"
expressing its "dislike with efforts being made for seeking a
peaceful and negotiated solution to the on-going crisis in our
war-ravaged country by refraining from participation in the
meeting."
</P>
<P>
The refusal by the Northern Alliance "thus inflicted a damaging
blow to the success of the talks, and to the hopes and
expectations of the people of Afghanistan in general," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also accused the Northern Alliance of sending to
the meeting "a low profile nine-member delegation instead of five
members."
</P>
<P>
"The composition of the opposition delegation looked unnatural
from the very beginning as it lacked representation from other
factions such as Hekmatyar, Sayyaf, Masud and Naderi," the Taliban
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two Afghan warring factions agreed last Wednesday to form
the proposed Ulema (religious scholars) Commission with 40
representatives by equal participation of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, their positions are divergent on which organization
should deal with the remaining issues of the agenda, including the
lifting of the blockade of humanitarian assistance, the cease-fire
and an exchange of POWs.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban insisted that these issues be discussed by the
Ulema Commission. But the Northern Alliance held that it was up to
the Steering Committee to consider the issues.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban statement said the Northern Alliance's stance
towards the Ulema Commission was "unprincipled and unreasonable,"
and was "intending to damage the idea of the Ulema Commission."
</P>
<P>
Holding the Taliban responsible for the stalemate of the talks,
Rasool Talib, spokesman for the Northern Alliance, said the Afghan
nation has "lost another opportunity for peace because of the
negative attitude of the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban are still dreaming of a military solution for the
Afghan conflict. We have accepted the Taliban's first demand to
form the Ulema (religious scholars) Commission)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban have political ambitions, and are not even ready
to remove the blockade for delivery of humanitarian assistance to
central Afghanistan," said Talib.
</P>
<P>
If the Taliban open the roads leading to central Afghanistan
for delivery of humanitarian assistance, "it will be a good
gesture for confidence building measures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talib also accused the Taliban of violating the agreement
reached by the two sides earlier in the talks by changing their
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"We have come here with full guarantee, but they (the Taliban)
did not. We gave them two days to go back to consult their
leaders, but they did not come back," Talib said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance was "working for peace," said Talib,
adding that "We will defend the Afghan nation against any military
aggression."
</P>
<P>
"There is no military solution for the Afghan problem," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting chief of the U.N. Peace Mission on
Afghanistan, James Ngobi, who is also co-chairman of the meeting
of the Afghan Steering Committee, announced that there would be no
session between the two Afghan warring factions Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the breakdown of the talks, Ngobi said the two
warring factions were unable to meet because of their sharp
divisions on certain issues.

<HEADLINE> Army Not to Tolerate Actions to Disrupt Elections: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos said
Sunday that the armed forces will not tolerate any actions to
disrupt the May 11 national and local elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Clark Special Economic Zone, the
northern Philippines, Ramos warned that the army will deal with
"all groups with evil designs, intentions and plans" to
destabilize the nation "whether during the elections or during
some other time."
</P>
<P>
"The Armed Forces of the Philippines, supported by the
Philippine National Police, the entire government and the people,
will not tolerate actions which will break the unity of the nation
and the peaceful conditions of the country," he said
</P>
<P>
Ramos was reacting to reports that the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front will disrupt next week's presidential,
congressional and local elections if the polls will be conducted
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is limited to a single six-year term by the
constitution, called on all the people, "regardless of their
political affiliation or learning," to help establish and solidify
national unity, political stability and peace, and to ensure
honest, orderly, and peaceful elections on May 11.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever has designs, intentions or plans to create or foment
(troubles) in the country will just be hurting themselves," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the government forces, supported by the police and
with the full backing of the entire government machinery and the
civilian communities, will "be together in maintaining our unity,
our peaceful conditions."
</P>
<P>
On May 11, the nation will elect a new president, as well as a
vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, all the 256 members of the
House of Representatives, 78 provincial governors and 1,608
mayors.
</P>
<P>
But last week, the Commission on Elections warned of an
election failure in many parts of the country, particularly in
Mindanao due to potential election-related violence on polling
day.
</P>
<P>
Since the election period started in January, at least 15
people have been killed in election-related violence in the
country.

COLOMBO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An explosion ripped through an army

</P>
<P>
The sources said the blast occurred near the headquarters of an
army brigade in Vavuniya District, about 260 km from Colombo.
</P>
<P>

destruction, said the sources, adding that only one soldier was
injured, and there was no immediate estimate on the loss of
weapons.

<P>
The sources also said the weapons were to be issued to combat

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Press Freedom Abuses Most Serious in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has recorded the highest
press freedom violations in southern Africa in the past
12 months, the regional media institute said.
</P>
<P>
State of the Media in Southern Africa 1997 published by the
Media Institute of Southern Africa last week said that Zambia
recorded 51 entries of abuses as compared to South Africa with
44, Swaziland with 14, Tanzania with 12, Lesotho with nine,
Botswana with eight, Namibia with seven, Zimbabwe and Malawi with
six, Mozambique with three, and Angola with one, Zambia Daily Mail
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About Zambia, the publication said, "Zambia needs to be
singled out, not only for leading the pack in the number of
alerts it attracted, but also because of the nature of these
alerts."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that these alerts deal with "arrests,
detentions and imprisonment of journalists; journalists in
hiding; journalists being taken for questioning by the police and
physical attack by supporters of both the ruling and the
opposition parties."
</P>
<P>
Frequent government threats to close down or ban newspapers
are some of the violations, said the publication.
</P>
<P>
On South Africa, it indicated that the country's press freedom
abuses are on the increase.
</P>
<P>
For Zimbabwe and Angola, the publication said that they
recorded low figures because of weak monitoring.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Invest 700 Million Dollars to Boost Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran will invest 700 million
U.S. dollars during the current Iranian year (started March 21)
to boost its steel production and exports, the daily newspaper
Iran News reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an inspection to the Iran International Engineering Company
on Saturday, Iran's Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri
said the investment would be used to develop steel mills in Iran
to boost the export of 1.3 million tonnes of steel products during
this Iranian year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Jahangiri announced that Iran had exported 830,000
tonnes of steel products during the past Iranian year, showing a 85
percent increase over the year before.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry planned to increase the capacity
of steel production to 12 million tonnes annually by the end of the
second five-year development plan (1995-2000).
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no official figures about Iran's steel
production during the past Iranian year, but it was reported that
the production reached 6 million tonnes in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Blames Taliban for Afghan Talks Breakdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan nation has lost another
opportunity for peace as the intra-Afghan peace talks between the
two warring factions broke down here Sunday, said Rasool Talib,
spokesman for the Northern Alliance delegation.
</P>
<P>
"I am announcing with heavy hurt that the Afghan nation has
lost another opportunity for peace because of the negative
attitude of the Taliban," Talib told the waiting reporters at the
Punjab House, the venue of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban are still dreaming of a military solution for the
Afghan conflict. We have accepted the Taliban's first demand to
form the Ulema (religious scholars) Commission)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance had prepared a list for the proposed
Ulema Commission in December last year, but it was rejected by the
Taliban, Talib noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban have political ambitions, and are not even ready
to remove the blockade for delivery of humanitarian assistance to
central Afghanistan," said Talib.
</P>
<P>
If the Taliban open the roads leading to central Afghanistan
for delivery of humanitarian assistance, "it will be a good
gesture for confidence building measures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talib accused the Taliban of violating the agreement reached by
the two sides earlier in the talks by changing their delegation.
</P>
<P>
"We have come here with full guarantee, but they (the Taliban)
did not. We gave them two days to go back to consult their
leaders, but they did not come back," Talib said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance was "working for peace," said Talib,
adding that "We will defend the Afghan nation against any military
aggression."
</P>
<P>
"There is no military solution for the Afghan problem," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance spokesman appreciated the peace efforts
made by the U.N., the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
Pakistan, Iran and other countries in organizing the talks between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting chief of the U.N. Peace Mission on
Afghanistan, James Ngobi, announced that there would be no session
between the two Afghan warring factions Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the breakdown of the Afghan peace talks, Ngobi said
the two warring factions were unable to meet because of sharp
differences over certain issues.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the Northern alliance blamed each other before
the reporters for the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance raised objections to the authority of the
three-member Taliban delegation led by Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the
Taliban representative based in Islamabad, and refused to talk
with them.
</P>
<P>
Mujahid, however, said the delegation led by him had the full
authority and was representing "the Afghan government."
</P>
<P>
Mujahid, who was leading the three-member Taliban delegation
consisting of Taliban officials in the Pakistani capital, said
earlier before proceeding to the meeting room: "I am representing
the Afghan government with full authority."
</P>
<P>
The previous five-member Taliban delegation led by Abdul Wakeel
failed to return to Islamabad for the scheduled meeting with the
Northern Alliance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mujahid said late Saturday afternoon that "there is no need for
the Taliban delegation to return to Islamabad. We have already
discussed all the issues."

<HEADLINE> El Nino May Lure Sharks into HK Waters Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Sharks might make an early
appearance in Hong Kong waters this summer if the El Nino
phenomenon increases the temperature of the sea, a marine expert
has warned.
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Sadovy, associate professor of the University of Hong
Kong's Ecology and Biodiversity Department, told English-language
newspaper South China Morning Post that sharks were drawn by warm
water in the summer months - from May to September. And an early
rise in water temperatures could attract sharks early in the
season.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Sunday quoted the associate professor as saying
that if the water temperature is changing differently this year
from others, it can definitely affect the appearance of the
sharks.
</P>
<P>
There had been little obvious evidence that other environmental
factors such as rainfall had affected the behavior of shark, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Seven people have been killed in shark attacks in Hong Kong
waters in the past six years. Four of the deaths occurred in 1993
and the rest, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sadovy called for more in-depth studies of sharks off Hong Kong
 waters and make the public more aware of the patterns of
appearance of sharks especially when divers and swimmers want to
use waters outside the protected areas.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Army Nets 23 ADF Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda army has netted 23
members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in a series of
search and hunt operations carried out recently in the western
Kasese District.
</P>
<P>
" We have made a lot of success in our current operations
against the ADF rebels in the district," the New Vision newspaper
Sunday quoted Ugandan army Zonal Commander Nathan Mugisha as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The zonal commander based in Kasese town said: "We are doing
everything possible to eliminate the ADF rebels." Rebel suspects
will be prosecuted on charges of treason, he added.
</P>
<P>
The hunt operations followed two attacks by the rebels on an
army camp in Muhunga in which at least two soldiers were killed
and another injured.
</P>
<P>
The number of the ADF rebels, estimated to be round 1,500 in
november 1996, has been reduced to some 350 after a series of
heavy blows from the government forces.
</P>
<P>
The recent security pact signed between Uganda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo made it still harder for the rebels
to survive in the region.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. Announce Trade Framework Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- During U.S. Vice President Al Gore's
visit to Egypt, Egypt and the United States announced here Sunday
that discussions will begin on a Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA).
</P>
<P>
The Agreement will fall under the U.S.-Egypt Partnership for
Economic Growth and Development, according to an official press
release issued the U.S. Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
It said that the TIFA is a framework for regular discussion on
trade and investment issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. also signed four agreements here
Sunday. They are The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, The Small
Business Administration Memorandum of Understanding, Environment
Memorandum of Understanding and Education Memorandum of
Understanding.
</P>
<P>
Gore arrived here early Sunday morning on a one-day visit to
Egypt within the context of his current Mideast tour which has
taken him to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
He is holding talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
add a fresh impetus to bilateral ties and the Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Gore will get acquainted with Egypt's evaluation of the current
Mideast situation in advance of Monday's London meetings of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The London conference is meant to break the 14-month stalemate
in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which have been stalled
since March 1997 over Israeli settlement buildings in Arab East
Jerusalem and long-delayed redeployment from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Gore will also brief the Egyptian leader on his talks with
Netanyahu and Arafat during his tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the main peace-broker in the Mideast peace process,
has so far failed to persuade Israel to give in to a 13.1 percent
withdrawal plan after the Palestinians have endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the peace-making, Egyptian and U.S. officials expect
the Mubarak-Gore meetings to invigorate bilateral economic
relations and the four sub-committees of the Egyptian-American
Presidential Council which "move at a slow pace and need a push."
</P>
<P>
The meetings between both sides will focus on means of
encouraging U.S. investments in Egypt and facilitating the entry
of Egyptian exports into the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Drug Addicts Double in Iran in 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of drug addicts in Iran
has doubled over the past four years to around one million, the
English daily Tehran Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a press release from Iran's anti-drug
headquarters as saying that the sharp growth has forced the
government to consider creating more special camps for
drug-related prisoners.
</P>
<P>
It gave no further details, but serious economic hardship with
high inflation, unemployment, and the country's adjacency to drug
producing areas was believed to be the main reasons behind the
involvement of the young and poor people in drug trafficking and
addicting.
</P>
<P>
Iran neighbors the "Golden Crescent" drug-producing center
located in the border areas between Afghanistan and Pakistan and
in recent years, it has become an important transit point for drug
trafficking from the areas.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been carrying out strict anti-drug campaigns since
January 1989 with the imposing of tough laws against drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 191 tonnes of various narcotics had
been seized in Iran during the past Iranian year (ended March 20)
while 2,500 people lost their lives in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Lawyer Entrusted to Sue Israeli Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian lawyer has been entrusted
by the Arab Lawyers' Union (ALU) to file a lawsuit against Israeli
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon for his threat to kill
anti-Israel Hamas leader Khaleed Misha'al.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, Hussein Mjalli, will soon start to prepare the case,
which includes a request to indict Sharon, two Israeli
intelligence service Mossad's members as well as the Israeli
government, semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the ALU, Majlli will ask at the International
Court of Justice at the Hague Israel to pay compensation to
Misha'al for material and other damages incurred by Sharon's
threat.
</P>
<P>
Sharon stated on March 14 on Israeli television that Israel
still intended to assassinate Misha'al despite the failure of its
former attempt by two Mossad agents on September 25, 1997 in Amman.
</P>
<P>
In a case sheet handed to the Jordanian lawyer, the ALU said
that "this open threat, which was carried by news agencies and the
media, is an act of terrorism, a flagrant violation of
international laws and an unprecedented violation of human rights
and the United Nations charter."
</P>
<P>
The sheet also insisted that Sharon's remarks are "violation
of international relations and an act against peace and
humanity."
</P>
<P>
The ALU has referred the case to a group of Arab legal experts
for endorsement before filing it at the international court.

<HEADLINE> "Normal" Triglyceride Levels Still Risky, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- People with "normal" levels of
cholesterol and triglycerides may still be at risk of heart
disease, American researchers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So-called normal levels of triglycerides are anywhere between
100 and 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood. This is a standard
measurement used around the world.
</P>
<P>
But a team, headed by Dr. Michael Miller, a cardiologist at the
University of Maryland, has followed 350 men and women for 18
years and found that those with triglycerides at normal levels
also have heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Any level above 100 appeared to increase the risk," said
Miller, who recommended that guidelines for desirable triglyceride
levels be set lower.
</P>
<P>
Miller also recommended people to do regular exercise, eat food
rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as linseed oil and fish, which
he said can break down triglycerides.

<HEADLINE> Teenage Pregnancy: A Serious Problem in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Fund for
Population Activities (UNFPA) has said teenage pregnancy is a
serious problem in some African countries.
</P>
<P>
In some African countries, teenage pregnancy rates are
extremely high and girls under 20 years of age often have
children, some of them as many as three, the Ethiopian Herald
Sunday quoted UNFPA Executive Director Nafis Sadic as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Friday at the Ethiopian
Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation, Sadic said that
birth expectancy is also as low as 12 and 13 years of age in most
countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the other major problem for teenagers is that
of sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS are engulfing the
continent at an alarming speed with 50 percent of the victims
being teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Sadik stated that for teenagers reproductive health has become a
serious issue and an important problem to address.
</P>
<P>
she said the UNFPA is taking steps and devising ways to curb
the problems as it has been doing over the years.
</P>
<P>
Reproductive health including family planning and sexual
health, population and development strategies and advocacy for
population issues are the three major areas under scrutiny, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Gore Holds Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Vice President Al Gore
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Sunday to add a
fresh impetus to bilateral ties and the Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Gore arrived here early Sunday morning on a one-day visit to
Egypt within the context of his current Mideast tour which has
taken him to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
He will get acquainted with Egypt's evaluation of the current
Mideast situation in advance of Monday's London meetings of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The London conference is meant to break the 14-month stalemate
in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which have been stalled
since March 1997 over Israeli settlement buildings in Arab East
Jerusalem and long-delayed redeployment from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Gore will also brief the Egyptian leader on his talks with
Netanyahu and Arafat during his tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the main peace-broker in the Mideast peace process,
has so far failed to persuade Israel to give in to a 13.1 percent
withdrawal plan after the Palestinians have endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the peace-making, Egyptian and U.S. officials expect
the Mubarak-Gore meetings to invigorate bilateral economic
relations and the four sub-committees of the Egyptian-American
Presidential Council which "move at a slow pace and need a push."
</P>
<P>
The meetings between both sides will focus on means of
encouraging U.S. investments in Egypt and facilitating the entry
of Egyptian exports into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said two agreements will be signed on the
sidelines of the meetings to promote cooperation in environment
and the medium and small industries.

<HEADLINE> CPC Senior Official Meets Romanian Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ding Guangen, member of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China(CPC), met with a delegation of the Romanian Socialist
Labor party here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by the party's chairman Ilie Verdet, is
visiting China at the invitation of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Ding, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, briefed the delegation on China's present situation,
saying China enjoys rapid economic development, social stability
and unity of nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress held last year upheld Deng
Xiaoping Theory and elected the party's new collective leadership
with Jiang Zemin at the core, and the state trans-century
leadership has also been elected at this year's National People's
Congress meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic development over the past years has
proven that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, have opened a road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and China will keep along with the track
in accordance with the spirit of the 15th CPC National Congress,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Verdet said members of the delegation have seen with their own
eyes the drastic changes brought about by the reform and opening
up policies to various sectors of the Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
He said the Socialist Labor Party is willing to expand
co-operation with the CPC, and expressed the hope that bilateral
ties between the two countries will also grow.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raps U.S. for Charges of Supporting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lashed out at the Untied
States for including Iran in "the list of countries supporting
terrorism," the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Mahmoud
Mohammadi as saying Saturday that Iran itself is a victim of
terrorism and it can not close eyes to such violence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently announced a list of seven
countries, including Iran, condemning them for sponsoring and
supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accusations are incredible, Mohammadi said, adding
that Iran was confused by "the U.S. duplicity in its deeds and
words" when it talks of the undergoing transformations in Iran
during the past year on one hand and on the other it condemns Iran
as a terrorist supporting nation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. allegations showed Washington's double
standard policy, saying such a policy from the point of view of
the international community will naturally be outright refuted.
</P>
<P>
Washington have repeatedly accused Iran, Libya and several
other nations of providing hotbeds for terrorists. It has been
pursuing the containment policy against Tehran since the 1979
Islamic Revolution in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Hopes to defrost the icy Tehran-Washington relations surfaced
after the forming of the moderate Iranian government led by
President Mohammad Khatami in August last year. The two sides have
expressed their willingness to "break the wall of mistrust"
between them.
</P>
<P>
However, the vendetta between the two sides saw little
relaxation when Tehran and Washington continued to exchange
charges against each other on many political and cultural issues.

Both the Taliban and the Northern alliance accused each other

</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance raised objection to the authority of the
three-member Taliban delegation led by Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the
Taliban representative based in Islamabad, and refused to talk
with them.
</P>
<P>
Rasool Talib said the Northern Alliance came here with
sincerity for Afghan peace and expected Sunday to talk with the
previous five-member Taliban delegation which attended the peace
talks from April 26 to 30.
</P>
<P>
Mujahid, however, said that this delegation (led by him) has
the full authority and is representing "the Afghan government."
</P>
<P>
Mujahid was leading the three-member Taliban delegation
consisting of Taliban officials in this capital city, said earlier
before proceeding to the meeting room, "I am representing the
Afghan government with full authority."
</P>
<P>
The previous five-member Taliban delegation led by Abdul Wakeel
failed to return to Islamabad for the scheduled meeting with the
Northern alliance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mujahid said late Saturday afternoon that "there is no need for
the Taliban delegation to return to Islamabad. We have already
discussed all the issues."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Consults with Israel on Why Jordanian Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Officials from national carrier Royal
Jordanian (RJ) Sunday continued the consultation with their
Israeli counterparts on why the RJ flights to and from Europe and
North America were not allowed to fly over Israel Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No progress has been reported up to now and the Israelis have
not given reasons for their action, Jordan's official news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
RJ officials started the consultation right after the RJ
flights were barred from using Israeli airspace and diverted to
fly through Syrian airspace on Saturday, semi-official Jordan
Times Sunday quoted a senior RJ official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nader Dahabi, the RJ's president, said that "the Israelis have
closed their airspace for reasons which until now are not clear to
us," adding that "therefore, our planes were not able to fly over
Israel and were forced to use other routes."
</P>
<P>
The ban was in force until Saturday night and "we are making
contacts with them to find out the reasons behind the closure of
their airspace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israel Radio reported earlier that the Israeli
"controllers" restricted the number of RJ flights because the
number of controllers on duty Saturday had been cut by half.
</P>
<P>
The decision to cut the staff of controllers by half was
taken by the Israeli airport authority and the Transportation
Ministry, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed to allow Jordanian civil airplanes to fly
through its airspace shortly after the October 1994 peace treaty
between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's media and ideological
circles have been launching various activities lately to mark the
20th anniversary of the publishing of the article "Practice Is
Sole Criterion of Testing Truth". The article had sparked a
nationwide debate and later helped lay the ideological foundation
for the country's economic reform after decade-long disastrous
cultural revolution.
</P>
<P>
"Criterion of truth" that were repeatedly referred to in
discussions 20 years ago once again become catch phrase in newspapers,
on television and radio. China Central Television and many local
television stations are busy shooting documentaries of the
three-year long debate. Various seminars on theory are now
underway.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration is expected to reach the climax on May 11,
the day on which the famous article was published in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Leading the activities are Chinese acdemic and ideological
circles which have run a series seminars to commemerate the
event.
</P>
<P>
But in the words of Liu Ji, vice-president of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, the commemoration of the debate is
never meant for reviewing the past, instead, it calls for the
promotion of spirit of judging truth from practice and moving ahead
with the present reform.
</P>
<P>
Gong Yuzhi, vice-president of the Party School of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), pointed out that
the significance of the debate on the criterion of truth lies in
the fact that it laid an important ideological basis for the Third
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which ushered
the country onto the road of reform and opening up and initiated
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, or
Deng Xiaoping's Theory.
</P>
<P>
Other academics agreed that the principle of the criteria of
truth witnessed a further progress 14 years later, when Deng
Xiaoping put forth a set of criteria called "three favorables"
during his tour to south China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In view of the timid attitudes taken towards reform and opening
up then, Deng pointed out straightforwardly, "the reason why some
people hesitate to move ahead with the reform is as a matter of
fact that they are afraid of being accused of introducing too many
elements of capitalism or taking the capitalist road.
</P>
<P>
Deng said when judging a policy right or wrong, the following
should be taken into accont: whether it is favorable to the
promotion of the growth of the productive forces of a socialist
society, favorable to the increase of the overall strength of the
socialist state and favorable to the raise of people's living
standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
Xiao Qian, a professor with the Chinese People's University,
said the "three favorables" signified further emancipation of the
mind in China, and it made people come to realize that socialism
can make use of market mechanism, introduce foreign funds and
allow a proportion of people to get rich first.
</P>
<P>
The principle broke new ground and pushed forward China's
reform and opening-up drive in a big way, Xiao noted.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese media hold that the reform and opening-up are now
entering a critical stage, and it requires people to further
emancipate the mind and steadfastly move forward the reform.
</P>
<P>
Gong Yuzhi said the report of the 15th CPC National Congress
set out new tasks in various fields including economy, politics
and culture, and demanded an all-round emancipation of mind.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the system of public ownership can be
realized in various forms; the share-holding system is capital
organization means of modern enterprises and is fit for both
socialism and capitalism. He stressed that all these need further
study with an open mind.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wu Shuqing, former president of Beijing University,
said the reform and opening up, or the establishment of a new
socialist economic system and its operation mechanism, will
definitely break the traditional way of operation in existence for
decades, and it is sure to bring conflict with the old way of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
He noted that only when people's minds are emancipated and
testing truth from practice are sincerely pursued, can a smooth
progress of the socialist modernization be ensured.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crime Rate Increases in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 46,713 crimes was reported
in Jordan last year, an increase of 1.94 percent from the 45,823
cases recorded in 1996, said a Public Security Department (PSD)
report issued here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The increase could be attributed to many demographic and social
changes that had affected Jordan over the past decade,
semi-official Jordan Times Sunday quoted Lieutenant Colonel
Ahmad Qudah, acting chief of the criminal information section of
the PSD, as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, high unemployment rate and juvenile
mis-conducts seemed to be most prominent factors that attributed
to the increase.
</P>
<P>
The 18-27 age bracket were responsible for the greatest number
of crimes, while 56.9 percent of persons arrested were
unemployed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qudah said that 35.14 percent of the crimes in 1997
were misdemeanor cases, 14.39 percent petty theft, 8.9 percent
acts of violence following drunkenness and 4 percent cases of
immoral acts.
</P>
<P>
Other crimes included premeditated murders, attempted murders,
forgery cases and rape cases, Qudah said.
</P>
<P>
The number of premeditated murders last year dropped by 2.78
percent over the 1996 figures, but that of attempted murders rose
by 38.58 percent, according to Qudah.
</P>
<P>
The number of forgery cases increased by 34.81 percent and
rape cases by 46.03 percent in 1997 over 1996, Qudah added.
</P>
<P>
By geographic way, the highest crime rate in 1997 was
registered in the capital city of Amman. The crimes that happened
here in 1997 accounted for 43.86 percent of the kingdom's total,
the PSD report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 1.94 percent increase, the PSD report said,
Jordan's crime rate is low in comparison with other Arab
countries and, most importantly, "organized crime does not exist"
in the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Australia Announces Large Food Aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Affairs Minister
Alexander Downer announced on Sunday a
30-million-Australian-dollar (19.5 million U.S. dollar) aid
package to its largest neighboring nation Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the humanitarian assistance package would help feed
more than 4 million people who would not able to feed themselves
during the coming dry season because of some of the country's
worst drought conditions in decades and fallout from the country's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The main part of the package is 40,000 tons of grain to feed
malnourished and vulnerable groups in the poorer areas of eastern
Indonesia, the foreign minister said in Australia's southern port
city of Adelaide, where his family live.
</P>
<P>
The grain, special food for children and pregnant women, and
emergency medical supplies will be distributed through
international agencies, non-governmental organizations and
Australian aid project teams in the eastern islands.
</P>
<P>
Innes Willox, a spokesman for the foreign minister, told Xinhua
the package is probably the biggest single donation in the history
of Australia's overseas humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
He said the 40,000 tons of grain, mainly wheat, will be
channeled to Indonesia through the United Nations' World Food
Program, to which the United States and Japan also contributed,
Willox said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the special package was in addition to Australia's
1 billion U.S. dollars contribution to helping Indonesia as part
of the International Monetary Fund loan program.
</P>
<P>
It is also on top of 585 million U.S. dollars in Australian
government's trade insurance cover and nearly 58.5 million U.S.
dollars in an annual aid program to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Downer said 40 million Indonesians, about 20 percent of the
country's population, were living in poverty and it would be
irresponsible for the Australian government to ignore their
plight.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia was one of a number of countries sending
Indonesia relief packages, including the United States and Japan
and countries of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In terms of its national interest, Australia regards Indonesia
as its third most important nation in the world after the United
States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Urged to Postpone Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's General Agriculture and
Plantation Workers' Union (GAPWUZ) has called on the government
to delay the resettlement process pending enactment of the
legislation regarding the payment of terminal benefits to workers
on designated farms.
</P>
<P>
GAPWUZ Secretary-General Philip Munyanyi said in an interview
earlier that after last November's designation of nearly 1,500 farms
by the government for resettlement purposes, much attention had been
placed on the acquisition of the land without carefully examining
how the workers would receive their benefits, Zimbabwe's Sunday
Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was not clear who should pay the workers as
farmers were contending that whoever was taking over the farms,
should pay the benefits as they would be made redundant and
unproductive while on the other hand, the government had not made
a commitment to pay the workers.
</P>
<P>
According to the law of Zimbabwe, Munyanyi said, a person who
inherits a business entity must also inherit such things as debts
and other costs. " The government, through the Ministry of Lands
and Agriculture, is inheriting the farms but it is not clear who
should pay the workers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The union estimated that about one million people, including
workers and their dependants, are going to be affected by the
loss of the farm jobs.
</P>
<P>
Munyanyi said the state has an obligation to help workers in
the agricultural sector as they have contributed immensely to the
national economic development. ''Our economy is agro-based and
it is mainly through the hard work of farm workers that we are
earning foreign currency,'' he stressed.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Cruzeiro
of Brazil was eliminated at the South American Libertadores Cup
after being held to a goaless draw at home by Brazilians Vasco da
Gama on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The result in Saturday's second round, second leg means that
Vasco went through 2-1 on aggregate and will face Gremio, the
third Brazilian team in the tournament, in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Cruzeiro, who had qualified automatically for the second round
as holders, dominated the game, winning ten corners to Vasco's
none, but lacked the guile and creativity to break down their
opponents' massed defense.
</P>
<P>
There were 57 fouls, eight yellow cards and numerous instances
of players faking injuries, pretending to have been fouled and
arguing with the referee.
</P>
<P>
The only high point was a majestic performance by 36-year-old

defence.
</P>
<P>
Vasco joined Gremio, Colon of Argentina, Bolivar of Bolivia,
Cerro Porteno of Paraguay, Barcelona of Ecuador and Penarol of

<HEADLINE> Water-saving Wheat Developed in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A new species of wheat specially
tailored for the dry Australian climate has been developed in the
country, experts said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Richards, an expert with Australia's Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), said:
"The new wheat grows leaves earlier in its life than other
Australian wheats -- it creates its own 'sunshade' to prevent the
soil around it from drying out."
</P>
<P>
"Saving soil moisture early in the season means there is more
water for the wheat plant to fill its grains, giving a bigger
harvest," said Richards at the CSIRO, a leading research center in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The wheat was tailored by Richards and has been developed by
Dreg Rebetzke, also of CSIRO Plant Industry with support from
growers through the Grains Research and Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"We have discovered genes that increase early leaf growth by
150-190 percent that will make our current wheats faster-growing
and higher-yielding," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
Genetic material from as far afield as China, India and Canada
was drawn and incorporated into traditional Australian wheats.
</P>
<P>
"The overall result is a bigger crop by the time flowering
comes around, yet soil moisture reserves are preserved for later
use by the grain, giving potential for significant yield gains,"
the expert said.
</P>
<P>
Wheat breeders around Australia are collaborating with the
CSIRO team and are now testing the new wheats in a series of field
trials, confident that they will deliver promising new varieties.

WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras of the
United States entered the final of the tennis challenge tournament
in Duluth, Goergia with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 win over Alex Calatrava
of Spain.
</P>
<P>
The world's No. 1 player will play second seed Jason
Stoltenberg of Australia in Sunday's championship match.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, a finalist here last year, was a 6-2, 6-4 winner
over Romania's Andrei Pavel on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Sampras took a 4-0 lead in the
tiebreaker. Calatrava battled to 5-all and then saved a set point
at 5-6 when Sampras' backhand flew deep. Calatrave's miss on an
easy forehand on the next point, however, gave the American
another set point at 7-6 and he won the set with a
serve-and-volley point.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Peace Talks Remain in Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The intra-Afghan peace talks
between the Taliban militia and the rival Northern Alliance remain
in stalemate here Sunday morning as the two sides have not agreed
as to what issues should be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the Taliban and the Northern Alliance have
entered the meeting room. Officials from the U.N. are now
mediating between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
As agreed on Thursday, the two Afghan warring factions are to
resume their peace talks Sunday after a two-day recess.
</P>
<P>
Before entering the meeting room, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the
Taliban representative in Islamabad, told the reporters: "I am
representing the Afghan government with full authority."
</P>
<P>
Mujahid is leading a three-member delegation from the Taliban
side to the peace talks Sunday. The previous five-member Taliban
delegation which attended the five-day peace talks here from April
26 to 30 has not returned to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
It is not a "violation" of the agreed agenda, said Mujahid,
adding that "it is the violation by the opposition side because
they don't have full representation in the meeting (Sunday)."
</P>
<P>
"We have already agreed on the formation of the Ulema
(religious scholars) Commission, so now only the issue of date and
venue of the Ulema Commission meeting is to be discussed," said
the Taliban representative.
</P>
<P>
Mujahid said on Saturday that "there is no need for the Taliban
delegation to return to Islamabad. We have already discussed all
the issues."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rasool Talib, a senior representative from the rival
Northern Alliance delegation said Sunday before proceeding to the
meeting room: "We will discuss the issues relating to lifting of
blockade and ceasefire."
</P>
<P>
Since the two sides have different opinions on the agenda. It
is most likely that the peace talks will end soon without any
positive results.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Post-Cultural Revolution Ideological Debate (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the closing ceremony of the conference, Deng Xiaoping called
on the whole country to "emancipate the mind, seek truth from
facts, be united as one and look to the future", and spoke highly
of the significance of the debate on the criterion of truth.
</P>
<P>
"This debate is an issue concerning the ideological line, as
well as a political issue that has a bearing on the future and
destiny of both our Party and country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which was
held shortly after the conference, formally commended the debate
on the criterion of truth, and pointed out that the ideological line
of "seeking truth from facts and proceeding from reality in
all cases" initiated by Mao Zedong must be restored. This
announced the complete bankruptcy of the "two whatevers" theory.
</P>
<P>
Following the Third Plenum, the CPC Central Committee decided
to spread the debate on the criterion of truth to all parts of the
country. In 1979 and 1980 the debate was carried out in all 29
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China, helping
the broad masses of officials and ordinary people to shake off the
influence of the personality cult, emancipate their minds and
grasp the correct criterion for judging truth.
</P>
<P>
In June 1981, taking practice as the sole criterion for judging
truth, the 11th CPC Central Committee adopted the "Resolution on
Certain Historical Issues Concerning the Party Since the Founding
of New China" at its Sixth Plenum, marking a satisfactory end to
the great three-year great debate on the criterion of truth in China.
</P>
<P>
Though two decades have elapsed, this great debate, which
helped make ideological preparations for the epoch-making Third
Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, will never be forgotten
because of its profound impact on and tremendous contribution to
Chinese history.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Urged to Solve Banking Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Bangladeshi garment sector
have called on the government to help solve the banking problems
for the survival of the country's top exchange earner, The
Independent daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The banking problems was the number one hurdle the sector is
facing, President of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (MGMEA) Mostafa Golam Quddus was quoted as
saying at a round-table on "Problems and Prospects of Garment
Industries" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If the non-cooperation of the banks continue the sector will
collapse," he said, adding "It is unfortunate that the
manufacturers are being held hostage by the bankers and they are
taught by the clerks what is export."
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not redress the problems, our next
generation will not feel encouraged to come for setting up
industries," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Another MGMEA leader cautioned that "if the garment sector
collapses due to lack of policy support of the government, Dhaka
city would turn into a ghost city and the total social stability
will tumble as million of people directly or indirectly make their
living from the sector.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's garment manufacturing sector earns 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign exchange annually, counting for about 70
percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings. And it
generates the largest employment opportunity with over 1.3 million
people working now in the sector.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Economy grows by 6.4 PCT Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economy grew by 6.4
percent last year compared with a growth rate of 3.8 percent in
1996 when the country underwent depressed conditions, the Central
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The higher economic growth rate of 6.4 percent in 1997 reflects
not only the recovery of economic activities from the slump
experienced in 1996, but also a significant improvement in
business confidence, mainly due to the improvement of economic
fundamentals, the bank's annual report for 1997 released Friday
said.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit also declined to 387 million U.S.
dollars last year from 683 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The significant achievement of the economy is mainly due to the
increase in earnings from exports, tourism, higher private
transfers and capital inflows last year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, agricultural and services sectors have recorded
growth rates of 10.3 percent, 3 percent and 7.8 percent
respectively last year and their contribution to the GDP was 29
percent, 8 percent and 55 percent respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation dropped to 9.6 percent last year from
15.9 percent in 1996, mainly due to the improvement of the
domestic supply situation and reduction in demand pressure as a
result of the moderation of monetary expansion.
</P>
<P>
The stock market showed some improvements during last year. The
all Share Price Index increased by 16 percent in 1997 while the
Sensitive Price Index rose by 19 percent. There were net inflows
of foreign funds of 13 million U.S. dollars through the stock
market in 1997, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Post-Cultural Revolution Ideological Debate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years ago, a debate
concerning China's future and destiny swept the country. The theme
was what is the criterion of judging truth, practice or leader's
words?
</P>
<P>
The debate helped people get rid of their blind faith in late
Mao Zedong who had mistakes in his late life and was regarded as a
major ideological breakthrough in the history of the Communist
Party in decades. It was also considered an ideological
preparation for the third Plenary Session of the 11th Chinese
Communist Party Congress in late 1978 which ushered the country
into a new eara of economic reform and opening up after 10 years
of chaos.
</P>
<P>
Shen Baoxiang, professor with the Party School of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, has just completed his ten-year
study of the debate and published a book on it. He revealed new
details of the event in an interview with Xinhua reporters.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, two years after the Cultural Revolution, people were
looking into the cause of the disastrous event led by the late
leader Mao Zedong. But the leadership in charge of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee then reiterated that people
should firmly uphold whatever decisions Chairman Mao made, and
steadfastly follow whatever instructions he gave, which was later
on referred to as "two whatevers."
</P>
<P>
Therefore an ideological confrontation between those for "two
whatevers" and those against took place. And the debate focusing
on the criterion of truth evolved against this backdrop.
</P>
<P>
In April 1977 Deng Xiaoping who had not yet resumed leading
position, detected the innate error in the much publicized idea of
the "two whatevers" and wrote to the Party Central Committee,
pointing out that "Mao Zedoong Thought must be accurately and
thoroughly understood, initiating the emancipation of the mind
within the CPC. Later on he said "'two whatevers' does not conform
to Marxism. If we cannot change whatever Mao Zedong said and done,
we will do harm to the Mao Zedong Thought."
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, some cadres and theorists advocated that practice
is the sole criterion for testing truth, igniting a three-year
debate nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The fuse which sparked the debate was an article in the May 10,
1978 issue of a periodical for internal circulation run by the
Party School of the CPC Central Committee. The article was checked
by Hu Yaobang, who was then the deputy head of the school. It was
published the second day on Guangming Daily, a national paper for
intellectuals. The article was then re-run by Xinhua News Agency,
People's Daily, Liberation Army's Daily and major local
newspapers.

<P>
With the theme that practice is the sole criterion for testing
truth, as well as for testing guidelines and policies, the article
criticized the "two whatevers" in an implicit way. It instantly
won wide support among the public, while arousing the disputes
among people in the higher leadership. A major debate broke out
and soon became heated and tense.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial moment, Deng Xiaoping who just resumed the
leading position, openly voiced his support for a debate to be held
on the criterion for testing truth, at a army conference on June
2, 1978.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Some comrades talk of Mao Zedong Thought all the
time, while in fact they often forget about, give up and even oppose
the fundamental Marxist viewpoint and method that emphasizes
seeking truth from facts, proceeding from reality and combining
theory with practice, which was embraced by Mao."
</P>
<P>
He quoted from Mao's writings to attack the "two whatevers" and
expound the criterion for testing truth.
</P>
<P>
Deng's speech came as an encouragement for those approving of
the principal, but the pro-"two whatevers" faction refused to back
off and tried to stifle further debate.
</P>
<P>
In the face of great pressure, those organizing the debate
demonstrated great courage. On June 16 an article on the criterion
for truth authored by Xing Bensi, a leading theorist, was
published in the ``People's Daily'' and simultaneously carried by
Xinhua News Agency, Guangming Daily and Liberation Army's
Daily. On June 24 another, titled ``The Most Fundamental Principle
of Marxism'', was launched by the army's daily and carried by all
other major media.

<P>
In August 1978 the debate reached a significant turning point
with the backing of local party leaders. The August 4 edition of
the "People's Daily" carried a news story on its front page,
titled "The Standing Committee of the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial
Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting to Discuss the Problem of Truth
Criterion".
</P>
<P>
The fact that a provincial Party committee openly supported and
took part in the debate on the criterion of truth in the news
media marked the beginning of a new stage in this debate.
Leaders in Xinjiang, Guangdong, Fujian and other regions
immediately followed suit and voiced their approval of the debate.
</P>
<P>
When the Central Work Conference was convened later in the
year, the debate had won the open backing of the principal leaders
in 21 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, more than
two-thirds of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
By that time, the preachers of the "two whatevers" found
themselves in a very isolated position, things labeled "Left" had
been losing popularity gradually, and the major debate on the
criterion of truth had become irreversible.
</P>
<P>
In the words of Shen Baoxiang, who has truthfully recorded the
whole debate, this new situation should be attributed to the
direct support of Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionary veterans,
careful organization by Hu Yaobang and other comrades,
participation of the broad masses of officials, especially senior
officials in various provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions, as well as joint efforts of many theoreticians and journalists.
</P>
<P>
As the major debate on the criterion of truth developed
rapidly, the Central Work Conference was convened in Beijing on
November 10, 1978. Chen Yun, who spoke first at the conference in
line with the principle that practice is the sole criterion for
testing truth, raised some tough questions, including correcting
wrong decisions made by the late Mao Zedong, and won a warm
response from the participants.
</P>
<P>
On November 25 the CPC Central Committee decided that the CPC
Beijing Municipal Committee should announce the rehabilitation of
those involved in the "Tiananmen Incident", and that all
documents concerning "Counterattacking the Right Deviationist
Attempt to Reverse Correct Verdicts" aimed at Deng Xiaoping should
be annulled.
</P>
<P>
The Central Work Conference turned out to be a great success,
developing from a simple economic conference into a meeting that
helped bring order out of chaos.

<HEADLINE> Theoretical Articles Review Emancipation of the Mind (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest issue of Qiushi published an article titled "On 'Two
Whatevers' and Emancipation of the Mind."
</P>
<P>
It says that 20 years later, we once again review and
commemorate the "grand discussion of the criterion of truth"
because it still bears practical significance.
</P>
<P>
The "two whatevers" as a phrase might never be used, the
article says, but as a kind of mode of thinking, it may continue
to exist.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that, on the one hand, government
officials are entitled to shoulder the responsibility of
publicizing Marxism and the Mao Zedong Thought among the people,
as well as implementing the Party's lines, principles and policies.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, government officials also have the
obligation to sum up people's experiences and report genuine
information to the people's government to facilitate senior
government officials' decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
The article says that only those who can both master the cream
of Marxism and sum up experience from practice could truly be
regarded as emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
History has proved many times that each false political
movement always goes hand in hand with a false wave of
philosophical thought, it says.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Party in 1921, the Party has
cultivated such styles as seeking truth from facts, maintaining
close links with the masses, as well as democracy and
selflessness, which were all been greatly damaged during the
Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) under the guise of "the two
whatevers."
</P>
<P>
Today, as we commemorate the 20th anniversary of the grand
discussion and embrace the achievements of the reform and
opening-up campaign, the great banner of emancipation of the mind
and seeking truth from facts, which was held up by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, have proved to be essential in the
future establishment of a socialist country with Chinese
characteristics, the article states.

<P>
DHAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's raw jute export may
exceed 2.2 million bales (396,000 tons) this year, said a press
release from the Bangladesh Jute Association (BJA) available here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Up to April 15, 1998, the country had exported over 2 million
bales (360,000 tons) of raw jute, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that comparatively earning was less in
view of the reduced ruling prices prevailing in the internal and
external markets.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the BJA Executive Committee was held recently, the
release said, adding the meeting also discussed the situation of
raw jute production for the 1998-99 jute season, and assumed from
the available information of sowing position that the country's
raw jute production might not exceed 4 million bales this year due
to lower prices and climate condition.
</P>
<P>
Jute production is the major agricultural sector of this South
Asian country, and the export of jute and jute products is a major
foreign exchange earner.

<HEADLINE> Theoretical Articles Review Emancipation of the Mind (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest issues of "Outlook"
and "Qiushi" (seeking truth) magazines include articles reviewing
the emancipation of people's minds during the last 20 years of
China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"The emancipation of the mind started from discussions on the
argument that practice is the only criterion of truth," the
"Outlook" article said.
</P>
<P>
Guided and advocated by Deng Xiaoping, the discussions laid an
ideological and theoretical foundation for the country to launch
its significant reform, opening-up and modernization drive after
the third plenary session of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in late 1978.
</P>
<P>
"In the arduous process of reform and opening-up, people's
minds were unshackled. On the basis of mind emancipation, reform
and opening-up in turn scored even bigger progress," the article
said.
</P>
<P>
In the period from the third plenum to the 13th National
Congress of the CPC, the people's commune system in rural areas
was abolished, China opened itself up to the outside world and an
economic structure took shape with public ownership at the core
along with the co-existence of varied forms of ownership and
operating mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the CPC Central Committee put forward the
theory of a socialist market economy, made it clear that China is
in the primary stage of socialism during which the fundamental
task is to develop productive forces, and formed the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The article stated that mind emancipation enabled the
establishment of a socialist market economy. After the serious
political turmoil in China in 1989 and drastic changes in the
former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, the article stated, some
people held the wrong view that China's economic difficulties and
political disturbances were a result of the reform and opening-up,
and that reform brought about polarization and market-oriented
reform was a development of capitalism.

<P>
The incorrect view seriously undermined the deepening of reform
and wider opening of China to the outside world, the article
stated. Under such circumstances, Deng Xiaoping pointed out time
and again that the difference of socialism and capitalism does not
lie in overall planning and the role of the market concerning
economic affairs. Socialism should not be separated from
developing a market economy and there is also planned control in
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
The major criterion to discern socialism from capitalism is to
see whether socialist productive forces can be developed, whether
the overall national strength of socialist China can be raised,
and whether the living standard of the people can be improved.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 14th National Congress of the CPC in 1992,
CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin said clearly
that the goal of China's economic restructuring was to establish a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
And the report urged all Party members to further liberate
their minds, quicken the pace of reform and opening-up, and not to
shackle their minds with abstract debate on the directions of
either socialism or capitalism.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Congress of the CPC, China has carried
out a comprehensive economic restructuring. A series of key
reforms was conducted in the fields related to overall planning,
fiscal systems, taxation, finance, foreign exchange, foreign
trade, overseas investment and state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Jiang Zemin also
pointed out that, in addition to the traditional public ownership,
various business forms which can reflect the rules of socialist
production can be boldly utilized.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, every key breakthrough in reform over the past 20
years was guided by the emancipation of the mind, and deepened
reformed in turn provided the conditions for further mind
emancipation, the article stated.
</P>
<P>
The powerful weapon to unshackle people's minds is "seeking
truth from facts," which is the essence of the Deng Xiaoping
Theory, according to the article.

<HEADLINE> Fiscal Reforms Top Agenda for New Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance has put the
transformation of China's numerous administrative charges and
other governmental fees into taxes at the top of the fiscal reform
agenda, says newly appointed finance minister Xiang Huaicheng.
</P>
<P>
Given that the number of fees charged by government
institutions places heavy burdens on Chinese people and
enterprises, the ministry has determined to standardize these
charges.
</P>
<P>
"We will abolish administrative charges and a large number of
unjustifiable fees," today's China Daily quoted Xiang as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that some forms of necessary charges will be brought
within the realm of the taxation system rather than lying in the
wallets of government departments or local governments.
</P>
<P>
But items such as park admission fees and charges for services
provided on demand, such as the issuance of documents, are
expected to be retained.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the Ministry of Finance is collaborating with
the Economic Restructuring Office and the State Administration of
Taxation on the elaboration of the reform program.
</P>
<P>
"In the next five years, I will spare no efforts to improve the
management of the State coffers and upgrade the fiscal system,"
said Xiang, the former deputy director of the State Administration
of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, the finance ministry will aim to gradually
reduce the budget deficit, raise the ratio of fiscal revenue to
gross domestic product and increase the proportion of the central
government's income to the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, fiscal work should concentrate on ensuring
the public fiscal target be met, guaranteeing social stability,
revitalizing China through science and education, and promoting
social and economic progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance will employ fiscal policies as macro
control measures to increase domestic demand and spur steady
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set up Network for AIDS Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Red Cross Society's AIDS
research center is planning to establish a multi-center network
with various research bodies across the country, the Bangkok Post
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Praphan Phanuphak, director of the
society's AIDS research center, as saying that the ultimate goal
of the center is to become a leading authority in AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
By setting up the network, the center also intends to have
enough clout to bargain with foreign drug and vaccine
manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
To become a multi-center network, cooperation would be sought
from hospitals and research institutions throughout the country,
Praphan said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Thai center has already established ties with such
international research Bodies as the Netherlands' National AIDS
Therapy Evaluation Center and the Australian National Center in
HIV epidemiology and clinical research.
</P>
<P>
The HIV Netherlands-Australia-Thailand research collaboration
(HIV-NAT), established in 1996, will soon begin a triple-drug
combination treatment on trial basis on HIV-infected patients in
Thailand. enditem

<HEADLINE> Investment Recovers Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Contractual foreign investment in
China has reversed last year's pessimistic trend to achieve a
significant 10.07-percent increase during the first quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The whole year of 1998 will also see a steady development of
the direct foreign investment flowing into China," today's China
Daily quoted Zhang Shangtang, vice-chairman of the China Assn of
Enterprises with Foreign Investment, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang dismissed the prevailing worry that China's foreign
investment inflow will suffer a sharp reduction this year as a
result of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthened emphasis put on foreign investment absorption
by governments at different levels will greatly propel the drive,"
said Zhang, who is also vice-chairman of the International
Investment Research Center under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The National Conference on Foreign Investment Administration
held last year reaffirmed the priority status of foreign
investment absorption, smoothing over criticism on this issue.
</P>
<P>
High demand on the domestic market, buoyed by the large-scale
reform of the State enterprises and the large increases in
government investment in infrastructure, offers abundant
opportunities for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to achieve 8-percent growth this year, the Chinese
Government has announced a US$750-billion investment in
infrastructure projects in a bid to ginger up domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"The improvement of the relationship across the Taiwan Straits
has also considerably pushed forward the mainland's foreign
investment inflows," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Taiwan has undergone tremendous development
during the first quarter this year, with contractual investment
capital tripling compared to the same period last year and
actually utilized capital multiplying 14 times.

CARACAS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency reserves in
Venezuela were 14.61 billion U.S. dollars at the end of April, a
4.3-billion-dollar drop from 18.91 billion dollars in November
last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to a strong demand of dollars in the
market, which has forced the Central Bank of Venezuela to put into
circulation nearly 100 million dollars a day to protect the value
of its national currency bolivar.
</P>
<P>
The current electoral climate has also increased the demand of
the dollar, because major investment funds have been ordered to
leave the country until the end of the campaign when the political
situation is clear.

The total cost of introducing the euro is estimated to be 1 to
1.5 percent of the gross domestic product of the 11 euro founding

</P>
<P>
The launch of the euro, however, would be deemed incomplete if

<HEADLINE> japan to Recover in Two Years: Japanese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy may recover within
two years if the measures adopted adhered closely to the stimulus
package announced last month, the Sunday Nation quoted visiting
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said Japan is undergoing a major restructuring program
amidst a wide range of problems facing the country, such as
chronic economic difficulties, corruption in the administrative
system and increasing pressure to liberalize its markets and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, the Japanese government announced its largest-ever
economic package, including more than 12 trillion yen (92.3
billion U.S. dollars) in tax cuts to stimulate demand to boost its
beleaguered economy.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also stressed the importance of interdependency among
nations, saying Japan could not progress alone.
</P>
<P>
The sluggishness of the Japanese economy has been a major
concern to many Asian nations, which are struggling to recover
from the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's three-nation tour, starting from Thailand on Friday,
aimed to demonstrate Japan's commitment in the southeast Asian
region and its support for crisis-hit nations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Japanese foreign minister pledged a
151.7- million-U.S.-dollar loan for employment and agriculture
schemes in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The "fast-disbursing" loan would be co-financed by the World
Bank and attract interest of one percent, Japanese Foreign
Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister Saturday witnessed the signing ceremony
of an agreement to offer grant-in-aid totaling 168,200 dollars
directly to Thai welfare groups to support their grass-roots
schemes aimed at helping the poor hit by the country's economic
downturn and emergency assistance to Thai students in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi left Thailand later Saturday for Malaysia. After the
visit there, he will head for Singapore to discuss the region's
economic problems ahead of the group of eight industrial powers
summit in Birmingham, England in mid-may.

<HEADLINE> PNA Supports U.S. Middle East Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) supports the U.S. initiative for breaking the deadlock of
Middle East peace process, said PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after holding talks with U.S. Vice
President Al Gore, Arafat said the U.S. initiative could help
bring the Middle East peace process back on track and the United
States should put more pressure on Israel and ask it to accept
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
In the new initiative, the U.S. reportedly asks Israel to hand
over 13.1 percent of the West Bank territories to the PNA during
the next stage troop redeployment. But Israel refuses to accept
it, saying it could only withdraw no more than 9 percent of the
lands in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Due to Israel's refusal, the U.S. has not announced the
initiative so far, which is also said to ask Israel to have a
"time-out" over settlement activities, both Israel and the PNA to
strengthen security cooperation and the two sides to reach an
agreement on how to move onto the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that some progress has been made in bringing
the peace process back on track, but more efforts are needed
to move it forward.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat and Gore exchanged views on how to
break the impasse of the process and Arafat briefed the guest
about PNA's stands concerning the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, a PNA official close to Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed his grave concern over the deadlocked process
and asked the U.S. to officially announce its initiative and put
more pressure on Israel to implement the signed agreements, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
Gore arrived here Saturday midnight from Saudi Arabia for
talks with arafat and left for Cairo early Sunday morning. He
paid an official visit to Israel before he went to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will visit Cairo on Sunday before flying to London
to attend the London meetings at which U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will meet him and Israel Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu respectively on the mideast peace process.

Australian national title on the final night of competition at the
Australian Commonwealth Games swimming trials on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, a world and Olympic champion, won the women's 200

Olympic and world championship runner-up Petria Thomas.

champion Grant Hackett, who recorded his second sub-15 minute swim
with a time of 14:56.23.
</P>
<P>
A number of proven performers were left out of the team,
including women's 200 meters breaststroke world record holder
Rebecca Brown and backstroker Matt Welsh, a member of the
Australian medley relay that won gold at January's world
championships in Perth .
</P>
<P>
Brown finished third in her event while Welsh was left out
despite finishing second in the 200 backstroke and fourth in the
100.
</P>
<P>

medley swimmer Jennifer Reilly. Veteran breaststroker Phil Rogers,
27, is the oldest.

<HEADLINE> ECB President Appointed With Much Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The official launch of the single
currency ran on Saturday into nail-biting delay, with the summit
of European heads of state and government dragging on without a
definite decision.
</P>
<P>
Finally at a press conference delayed for more than five hours,
a spokesman instead of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, chairman
of Saturday's summit, announced that the meeting had appointed Wim
Duisenberg to a full eight-year term as the head of future
European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
But he added that the Dutch chief of the European Monetary
Institute promised to step down before his term expires though he
indicated that he would stay long enough to see through the
introduction of euro bank notes and coins being put into
circulation. That will be the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
This means that Duisenberg would not be able to complete his
eight-year mandate and retire early as a pre-arranged compromise
so as to leave vacancy for someone else.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that this succeeding man should be a French
but he added that Duisenberg is the one to decide when to step
down instead of by other politicians.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that the formation of the ECB executive
board of six was so important that it had to be done fully and
properly and it took time.
</P>
<P>
What caused the delay, however, was believed to be a
German-French row over the ECB chief candidate.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the Netherlands were backing Duisenberg whereas
France wanted its own central banker to serve as the ECB
president, a very important position, equal to that of the
chairman of the United States Federal Reserves.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Saturday's summit, according to sources close to the
commission, several compromises had been tried. One compromise
tried to arrange a half-term succession by Bank of France governor
Jean-Claude Trichet to Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
French president Jacques Chirac asked the commission to make it
an explicit guarantee when Duisenberg would make his premature
step-down to make room for Trichet.
</P>
<P>
This was described as a face-saving attempt by France to offset
the location of the ECB in Germany's Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the meeting was close to agreeing on
the other members of the ECB executive board but said no when
asked whether the meeting had set itself a deadline.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Agrees to Carry U.N. Relief Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of Social
Planning El-Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Kheir said Saturday Khartoum
agreed to four additional U.N. aircraft of relief supplies to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has distributed 40,000 tonnes of
foodstuffs provided by the United Nations and other organizations
to the hunger-stricken areas in south Sudan, Kheir told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered all facilities possible, such as customs
exemption and approval of the movements of U.N. planes and staff,
in the life-line operation, he added.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his government's commitment to ensuring a success
of the operation and opening all the agreed-upon routes for
delivering the relief supplies to the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Funds for relief program needs 109 million U.S. dollars while
the donor countries have only provided 7 million dollars so far, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to pressure the
rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) to accept a
ceasefire for humanitarian considerations.
</P>
<P>
He accused the SPLA of planting obstacles on the road of relief
supplies and exacerbating the sufferings of the 15-year civil war
between the Sudanese government and the SPLA.
</P>
<P>
Kheir confirmed that the foodstuffs were available in the
government-controlled areas in Bahr El-Ghazal, dismissing the
allegation by the SPLA that 350,000 people were suffering from
huger in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The allegation aims to serve as a pretext for foreign
interference in the affairs of Sudan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it accused the SPLA of attacking some
government-controlled areas that opened to relief workers, adding
that most of the hunger-stricken areas were under the control of
the SPLA.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's positive response to more U.N. relief came among
accusations by some western countries that Sudan violated the
human rights and laid some 350,000 hungry people open to death.
