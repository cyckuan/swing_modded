Russian Navy Must Strengthen Presence in World Ocean: Putin
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Navy must
strengthen its presence in the World Ocean, which is necessary for
upholding Russia's interests at far-away approaches, said Russian
Premier Vladimir Putin here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The trend of driving Russia out from the World Ocean is
obvious. Today, Russia's position has worsened from the viewpoint
of approaching sea communications, especially in the southern and
Baltic directions," said Putin at a State Security Council
conference on the general strategy of shipbuilding in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Our Navy is no longer present in those parts of the World
Ocean, where it used to be present in the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded that Russia "became a great power only after
becoming a sea power."
</P>
<P>
He said that 60 percent of Russians live in littoral areas and
"our seas contain up to 30 percent of the geological resources of
the oceans."
</P>
<P>
Although the Russian navy now is not present even where "it has
always been," it should be in such places "not in order to
threaten anyone, but to protect our national interests in the
distant approaches," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of a recent trend toward "pushing" the Russian fleet
from the seas. "You all know what illegal fishermen are doing in
our own waters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed the need to resolve shipbuilding problems, which
"have worsened during the past decade, largely due to the
complicated socioeconomic situation in the country."
</P>
<P>
"We have come close to the line, beyond which the situation
will be really dangerous and alarming. There are such problems
with the sea fleets that in their development may lead to
irreversible consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tuesday's Security Council conference should
result in a decision on the general strategy and program of urgent
steps in shipbuilding as well as a draft presidential decree on
improving Russia's sea-going potential and a long-term strategy
for naval and fleet activities.
</P>
<P>
Security Council secretary Sergei Ivanov told the press after
the ninety-minute conference that it had resolved to submit to the
president a draft of the sea doctrine in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Kuroyedov told
reporters that financial reserves can be freed with the
development of a single shipbuilding program.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Says Uganda Airlines Should Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Immediately
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has told the Parliament that the Uganda Airlines
Corporation (UAC) should be sold right away to avoid more losses
it can cause to the country.
</P>
<P>
The national flag carrier, which has only one plane, should be
sold to South African Airways (SAA) at whatever cost, he told the
MPs here Tuesday evening, urging them not to delay the
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
Bill related to economy should be considered before bills
concerning politics such as the bill on political parties and the
amnesty bill, he explained, because Uganda as a landlocked
country has a number of disadvantages in addition to other
infrastructure problems that necessitate decisions by policy
makers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of privatization is not simply to
sell public assets at the highest prices, but primarily to enable
those assets to create wealth. The impress achievements and
benefits of privatization should include increased employment
opportunities and higher industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Museveni blew the whistle on UAC privatization in March 1998,
 attracting four bidders including British Airways, SAA, Air
Mauritius and Sabena Airlines. On April 23 of 1999, three bidders
pulled out of the deal, leaving SAA as the sole buyer.
</P>
<P>
Government was supposed to sign the agreement of the sale of
49 percent shares in the UAC to SAA as a strategic equity partner
after 18 months of tough negotiations on September 30, but it hit
a snag when MPs contested the fairness of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president got angry over the sale of the national
airline and ordered that the UAC be sold within two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Downplays Attack Outside Israeli Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian officials downplayed a
shooting incident Tuesday afternoon outside the Israeli Embassy
here, saying the gunman might have mental problems.
</P>
<P>
The 20-or-so pistol-wielding gunman, whose name was not given,
fired several shots at policemen guarding the Israeli mission in
Amman, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official from the Interior Ministry told the
official news agency Petra that the man could be suffering lunacy
of family origins, and the bullets he fired had no projectile
noses. He was arrested on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The official was apparently dismissing a statement from the
Israeli Foreign Ministry, which said the attack was targeted at
its mission.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian police have apparently beefed up s of the militant Palestinian group
Hamas earlier this week, including its political chief, Khalid
Mashal, to contain its anti-Israel activities on the Jordanian
soil.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or the Mulism Resistance Movement, remained opposed to
the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, and it is
also critical of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The group has claimed responsibilities for several deadly
attacks on Israeli targets in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The government decision to expel Hamas leaders met with
protests from the predominantly Palestinian population of the
desert kingdom, particularly from political groups with a strong
anti-Israel sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Police are further investigating the shooting incident.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Calls for Japanese Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Tuesday called for Japanese investments in response to Egypt's
policy on a free economy.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told Japanese businessmen that Egypt's door is open for
Japanese investors and that he expects good results in a short
period of time, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif
told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has taken various measures and passed many legislations
that help the country orient toward a free economy, el-Sherif
quoted Mubarak as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president underlined Egypt's keenness on providing
opportunities to Japanese investments in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese businessmen arrived in Cairo on Sunday to take
part in meetings of the Egyptian-Japanese Business Council. They
will also tour Egypt's mega-projects in the south to get
acquainted with the country's investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Japan has granted large amounts of aid to some of Egypt's major
projects, including the development of the Suez Canal in the
1970s, construction of the Opera House and a children's hospital
in Cairo. It is assisting Egypt in the construction of a bridge
across the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
But its investment in Egypt remains at a low level, with only 8
million U.S. dollars in 31 ventures, according to Egypt's official
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak briefed the Japanese delegation on Egypt's stance on
the Mideast peace process, saying his country has long committed
to a strategy for peace.
</P>
<P>
Egypt honors its pledges and continues to work for the
realization of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East
that will promote regional economic cooperation and help raise
people's living standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Moneim Saudi, head of the Egyptian side of the joint
council, said discussions were held on ways of boosting Egypt's
exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian annual export to Japan stands at less than 100 million
dollars while its import amounts to 1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Women's Efforts for Political Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Efforts by Kuwaiti women
to gain political rights in the male-dominated Islamic state were
thwarted once again on Tuesday as the Parliament rejected an Emiri
decree franchising women.
</P>
<P>
Forty one out of the 62 lawmakers and cabinet members
attending Tuesday's session approved the recommendation by the
parliament's Interior and Defense Committee, which called on the
parliament to vote against the Emiri decree.
</P>
<P>
The committee itself voted against the decree during a meeting
on November 1, on the ground that it did not fall under the
"necessary conditions" listed in the Constitution, which
stipulates decrees be issued by the Emir in case of urgency.
</P>
<P>
The decree, along with several other decrees, was issued by
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah when the parliament was
absent between May and July.
</P>
<P>
Jaber dissolved Kuwait's last parliament on May 4 after an
irreconcilable rift erupted between the government and the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The decree was widely applauded by Kuwaiti women and received
very positive reactions from the outside world. But it met fierce
opposition from Kuwait's Islamic groups, which have repeatedly
vowed to fight against the decree.
</P>
<P>
As the Emiri decrees are considered valid laws under the
Constitution, the women rights decree could not be changed,
unless be rejected by the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Before the Parliament vote on the decree, however, the
government expressed its readiness to present a draft law similar
to the decree.
</P>
<P>
A statement read by First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah said the government will seek
approval by the parliament of a proposal to amend the election
law banning political rights for women.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti constitution grants equal rights and obligations for
women and men. But the election law denied the women their rights
to vote and run for parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti women, who at present constitute a little more than 50
percent of the country's 740,000 population, first raised their
demand for political rights 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Several proposals calling for amending the election law were
submitted to the previous parliaments, but none of them were
accepted.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Officials in Jordan After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel has sent a team of
security officials to Jordan Tuesday following a shooting incident
outside its embassy in Amman, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The security officials will help provide security protection to
the Israeli mission in the Jordanian capital and take part in the
investigation of the incident.
</P>
<P>
"There was an attempted attack at 12:00 a.m. (1000 GMT) on the
Israeli Embassy in Amman, but there were no casualties," the
ministry earlier announced, adding that the embassy was back on
normal working Tuesday and all Israeli security officials there
were on duty.
</P>
<P>
According to news reaching here, a car suddenly stopped at the
entrance of the Israeli embassy and an Arab man came out of the
vehicle and started firing at embassy, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The attacker was immediately overpowered and pushed to the
ground by the Israeli and Jordanian security personnel. No one was
hurt and nor was the building damaged in the incident, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the attack was targeted at
its mission, but Jordan said Tuesday that the attacker might have
mental problems.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official from the Jordanian Interior Ministry said
the man could be suffering lunacy of family origins, and the
bullets he fired had no projectile noses.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian police have apparently beefed up security
outside the Israeli mission after the shooting incident, sending
two armed jeeps with heavy machine guns to guard the diplomatic
complex even for off-office hours Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Annan Launches Year 2000 Consolidated Emergency Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Our hope is to send a signal of hope to more than 34 million
souls," said Annan at a gathering marking the Global Humanitarian
Day at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"These are also the last Consolidated Appeals we shall launch
in the 20th century," he said. "It is a century that has seen the
very best and worst of human behavior. It has seen humanitarian
principles take form and take hold, and it has seen them
egregiously violated and ignored. Its history will be written in
blood as much as in the ink of our United Nations Charter."
</P>
<P>
As this century draws to a close, Annan said, the international
community have to cope with crises in areas like Kosovo, East
Timor, Turkey and the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
"Today, as we struggle to catch up and provide the assistance
needed in those places, crises are lingering, emerging, resuming
or intensifying in many other places across the globe," the UN
chief said. "Failure in the duty to help the victims of these
crises will take away the hope of millions of people: the hope
that something called the international community will uphold the
basic dignity of humankind."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the world should meet the demand easily
because "the 2.3 billion dollars we are asking you for today is
far less than what the world spends on military purposes in a
single day".
</P>
<P>
However, Annan said, the consolidated inter-agency appeal for
Sierra Leone for 1999 has so far received only some 40 percent of
the amount and the funding levels in 1999 for Southeastern Europe
and for Africa are under 80 percent. He urged the world to do
better.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Barak Promises to Promote Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said here on Tuesday that he would "do everything possible"
to promote the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Barak told reporters that he expected a dispute with Palestinians
over a delayed West Bank land handover to be resolved within days.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the present (transfer), the one that should be
ended on 15 November, I believe will be ended in a few days,"
Barak said in English.
</P>
<P>
"It has been approved by the Israeli government... We are ready
to implement it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, speaking in outside Blair's Downing Street official
residence, said the deadlock over the transfer of five percent of
West Bank land to Palestinian rule could be quickly overcome.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Israel would implement a further withdrawal
from the West Bank, due to begin in January, "exactly according to
the agreement, exactly on time".
</P>
<P>
Barak said he had held "very friendly and fruitful talks" with
Blair and their discussions focused on relations between London
and Tel Aviv and progress in the Middle Eastern peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, who arrived Britain on Tuesday morning
after
finishing a week-long trip to Turkey and the United States, is
also due to have talks with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
and opposite Conservative Party Leader William Hague.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Angola's Annihilation of UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States supports the
efforts made by the Angolan government to annihilate the war
machinery of rebel UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, U.S. Ambassador to
Angola Joseph Sullivan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to Angola's southwest province of Namibe, Sullivan
stressed that Savimbi, head of the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), should disarm his troops according
to the 1994 Lusaka protocol.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat considered that the violation of the Lusaka
protocol by the rebels legitimized the government's resort to
force for the consolidation of peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in Angola can be expected soon," the official Angolan
news agency Angop quoted the U.S. ambassador as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the 25 years of civil war in Angola, the U.S. has been
opposing the military solution to the conflict between the
government and the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The civil war has killed thousands of civilians and soldiers
and caused grave humanitarian crisis in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
But it was reported that the U.S. had recently provided the
Angolan government troops with non-lethal weapons which had been
used in the 38-day general offensive launched by the government in
September against the rebels in the central highlands.

<HEADLINE> Schroder Pledges to Rescue Troubled German Construction Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 23 (Xinhua)-- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder Tuesday offered his personal effort to rescue Philipp
Holzmann AG, the country's second biggest construction firm that
has been ruled into insolvency.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder promised to contact with the banks leader Wednesday
to seek a rescue solution while meeting in Berlin with workers and
labor union representatives of the company.
</P>
<P>
"The goal must be to prevent the 150-year-old company from
collapsing," said Schroeder, adding that the sum needed for a
rescue package "is not impossible to raise".
</P>
<P>
On the same day, a court in Frankfurt appointed lawyer Ottmar
Hrtmann as the interim insolvency administrator for Holzmann after
major creditors of the company had rejected to cover its debts.
</P>
<P>
Roland Koch, premier of Hesse State where the company is based,
held an emergent session with bank leaders early Tuesday morning
in a futile last-minute endeavor for a rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Eight days before, Holzmann shocked the market by announcing
further 2.4 billion marks in debts in its internal audit. The
company blamed the real estate deals in east Germany by its
previous management for the problems.
</P>
<P>
With debts over assets, the company, which links with some 60,
000 jobs in Germany, has appealed its creditors for rescue package
of 3 billion marks. The attempt was thwarted after the 20
creditors failed to reach an agreement on such a big sum.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Political Leaders Cautious Over Proximity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot political leaders
Tuesday expressed cautious optimism over the possibility of a
breakthrough in the forthcoming U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary party leaders called on President Glafcos
Clerides to report his meetings in Istanbul, Turkey, on the
sidelines of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) summit and his talks in Athens.
</P>
<P>
After meeting the president, left-wing AKEL party leader
Dimitris Christofias said President Clerides was also not very
optimistic about the outcome of the proximity talks because of the
stance held by the Turkish Cypriot side and its staunch supporter
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Cypriots, who walked out of the peace talks in
1997, conditioned the resumption of the peace negotiations on
international recognition of their breakaway republic in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. involvement in the Cyprus peace effort,
Christofias said "we have been hearing assurances since 1974, but
we have not seen any deeds."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Rally party leader Nicos Anastasiades
said the Greek Cypriot side fully backs a dialog to reach a
settlement and the effort is to bend Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the U.N. chief is forced to cut off the talks
because of Denktash's intransigence, the European Union (EU)
countries, the U.S. and Greece should reconsider the position
regarding the upgrading of EU-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Socialist EDEK party leader Vassos Lyssarides said Greece must
set "other preconditions" regarding the Cyprus issue if it is not
going to veto Turkey's EU candidate status, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
"It would be naive for someone to believe that progress can be
achieved in the Cyprus issue from the start of the proximity talks
until the Helsinki summit, unless the unexpected occurs and Turkey
publicly reconsiders its position," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit will take place in Helsinki on December 10-12,
only a week after the Cyprus proximity talks start.

<HEADLINE> UK Police Warn of N.Irish Guerrilla Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- British police warned on
Tuesday of an "increased threat" that republican guerrilla
splinter groups seeking to derail Northern Ireland's peace process
may launch attacks over the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
"There is genuine and credible concern about the increased
threat of violence, not only in Ireland but also on the(British)
mainland, from breakaway renegade groups," the Reuters quoted a
Scotland Yard spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Police said any suspicious telephone calls or threats should be
brought to their attention immediately, and urged organizations
using closed-circuit television cameras to ensure they were
operating properly.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have reported that police were on a national
security alert over fears of attacks as peace talks in the British
province enter a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
The police spokeswoman declined to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
Police fear that splinter groups from the Irish Republican Army
and other anti-British guerrilla organizations-- who seek an end
to British rule and a united Ireland -- could be planning an
attack.
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be wise to anticipate that violence could
happen anywhere," the Times newspaper quoted a senior police
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said attacks could be launched by guerrillas
from the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA, the Irish National
Liberation Army and some disaffected members of the IRA itself.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, another critical point in the peace process,
the Real IRA set off Northern Ireland's single most deadly attack
in 30 years of the "Troubles", killing 29 people with a car bomb
on a busy shopping street in the town of Omagh.

<HEADLINE> Proximity Talks Insufficient to Justify Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said Tuesday the start
of the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on the Cyprus issue is not
sufficient to warrant a European Union (EU) decision to grant
Turkey the status of EU candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said that at the
coming EU Helsinki summit, other signs and moves must be made to
satisfy Greece, an EU member, before Turkey becomes an EU
candidate.
</P>
<P>
"We have made it clear, here in Cyprus and in Greece, that the
start of talks is not regarded substantive development to justify
giving Turkey candidate status," Papapetrou said in his daily
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks, under the auspices of the United Nations,
between the two sides are scheduled to start in the
U.N.-headquarters-based New York on December 3. The EU in its
Helsinki summit on December 10-12 will decide whether to accept
Turkey as its candidate state.
</P>
<P>
"The proximity talks are not taking place for the sake of
moving Turkey closer to Europe," Papapetrou said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Forces Advance in Chechnya While Strikes Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian forces are advancing
deeper into Chechnya while Russian artillery and aviation strikes
against the militants continue, said the Russian Defense Ministry
press service Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The federal troops are closing the circle around Chechnya's
capital, Grozny, and advancing to the south of the breakaway
republic, the ministry quoted the Russian North Caucasus command
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russians have moved into the Shali and Vedeno districts,
approached the village of Serzhen-Yurt and are coming closer to
Vedeno, a town 50 kilometers southeast of Grozny, said the command.
</P>
<P>
The federal units blocked off Argun, the third biggest city of
Chechnya, from the south, east and north, giving guerrillas a
chance to leave the town, situated 15 kilometers east of Grozny,
through a gap in the west.
</P>
<P>
The command of the Russian group that is taking positions south
of Grozny said it expected the stiffest resistance in Urus-Martan.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas holding the town, which lies 20 kilometers south
of the capital, number up to 3,500 and are receiving
reinforcements and weapons, according to the latest Russian
reconnaissance reports.
</P>
<P>
The Russians said their immediate plans included taking control
of the city of Goity, 5 kilometers north of Urus-Martan. The
Russian command said it was ready for "mopping up" the village,
from which the guerrillas had pulled out, and for talks with local
elders.
</P>
<P>
The command said Su-24 bombers and Su-25 attack planes had
carried out more than 30 missions in Chechnya on Tuesday, pounding
guerrilla positions in Bamut, Urus- Martan, the Argun gorge and
the outskirts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Part of the militants are retreating to Chechen mountain areas
hoping to save men and guns for further fighting against the
combined Russian force, reported the Russian military.

<HEADLINE> More Egyptian Experts to U.S. for Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Several Egyptian technical
experts left here Tuesday for the United States to join the
investigations into the crash of EgyptAir flight 990 last month, a
civil aviation official said.
</P>
<P>
The team includes officials from the Egyptian safety board,
EgyptAir technical experts and voice recognition experts, the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Egypt's Middle
East News Agency. He did not say how many people were in the team.
</P>
<P>
The experts will join U.S. investigators and other Egyptian
experts led by Civil Aviation Authority Chairman Abdel Fattah Qato
to help decipher the mystery behind the crash, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Qato has asked a psychologist and voice specialist to join his
team to help with the investigations, Egyptian Minister of
Transport, Communications and Civil Aviation Ibrahim el-Demiri
told the People's Assembly (parliament), on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the
U.S. eastern coast less than an hour after taking off from New
York on October 31, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians did not take part in the investigations immediately
after the crash. Egyptian officials and experts began stepping in
as speculative reports saying that a suicidal co-pilot forced down
the plane shocked and angered Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
In the government's first assessment of the circumstances
surrounding the crash, el-Demiri criticized the speculative
reports. But he did not say what the Egyptian government thought
may be behind the crash.
</P>
<P>
He said it may take one year or more to find out the mystery of
the tragic incident.

KIEV, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said Tuesday that strengthening the strategic partnership with
Russia and the United States is of the highest priority as the
country's security and future are dependent on relations with
these two partners.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine Should adopt a constructive, coherent and re-adjusted
foreign policy in order to build equal and civilized relations
with the outside world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president made this statement at a ministerial meeting on
defense affairs, according to a report from the Ukraine Interfax
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also said that Ukraine will move ahead in its
cooperation with NATO but will also adhere strictly to its own
national interests.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Ukraine's entry into NATO has been left off the
agenda does not mean that Ukraine will automatically break off all
cooperation with the Western military organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, a moderate reformer, convincingly won a second term in
the November 14 election.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The 44th Asia-Pacific Film
Festival was officially opened here Tuesday evening with the
participation of up to 400 delegates from 14 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Some 42 feature films, four animations and 12 short films and
documentaries will participate in the competition for the 15
awards set up by the festival.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nine prestigious films will be shown during the
five-day festival to mark the 6th cycle, or the 72nd birthday, of
Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej on December 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
Being held in late 1999, when a new millennium is about to
begin, the film festival provides an opportunity to review the
past and look into the future of the film industry in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Cinemasia 2000: Creating Global Market
Appeal for Asia-Pacific Film," the festival aims to "push the film
industry of the region to a period of prosperity in the 21st
century," according to a film festival press release.
</P>
<P>
Participants are also expected to discuss the global marketing
of local films in a bid to counter the impact of imported
Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
Film industries in Asia-Pacific countries and regions are at a
low ebb as a result of the increasing competition from Hollywood
blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1954 in Tokyo, the Asia-Pacific Film Festival is
held annually in turn in different cities of the Asia-Pacific
region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders fall in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
for durable goods declined in October for the second straight
month because of the biggest drop in demand for electronic and
electrical equipment in more than two years, the Commerce
Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that orders for big-ticket manufactured
goods dropped by 1.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted
200.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
October's performance, worse than many analysts' expectations,
followed a sharper drop of 1.9 percent in September. It marked the
first back-to-back monthly declines since February-March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that orders for electronic and other
electrical equipment including semiconductors, circuit boards,
telecommunications equipment and home appliances fell 15.3 percent
in October, the worst showing since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for transportation equipment, which fell
sharply in September, jumped 3.4 percent in October, reflecting
stronger demand for airplane and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
Transportation often is volatile from month to month because it
includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. If excluding
transportation, overall orders for durable goods fell 2.6 percent
in October, the largest drop since a 2.7 decline in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Orders for industrial machinery, including computers and
machine tools, increased a strong 2.8 percent in October,
following a 0.4 percent drop the month before.
</P>
<P>
The report said primary metals, the category that includes
steel, saw orders fall by 0.7 percent in October, the third
monthly decline in a row.
</P>
<P>
But shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good signal of
current demand, picked up 0.7 percent in October after falling a
sharp 1.9 percent the month before.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Closes Pristina Airport for Civilian Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), has announced the
temporary closure of Pristina airport to civilian aircraft, U.N.
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was recommended by the French investigation team
looking into the cause of the November 12 crash of a plane
chartered by the World Food Program in northern Kosovo, the Serbian
province, in which 24 were killed.
</P>
<P>
Describing the move as "a cautionary measure," U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard told a press conference here that a team of experts
from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will
arrive in Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, Tuesday to
review the situation.
</P>
<P>
The ICAO experts will then make further recommendations in
about a week's time regarding the operation of the airport.
</P>
<P>
At present, the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
KFOR, operates the Pristina airport.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to close the airport for civilian aircraft
arises from the possibility of misinterpretation between NATO
military air traffic procedures and terminology and the ICAO
equivalent that is used in purely civilian operations, KFOR said
in a press statement issued in Pristina, Military aircraft will
continue to use the airport.
</P>
<P>
"Having considered the interim recommendation carefully, UNMIK
and KFOR believe it prudent to implement it immediately," the
statement said. "Civilian flights will remain suspended until a
review has been carried out of the procedures in use at the
Pristina airport."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the full investigation into the cause, or
causes, of the accident is under way, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations has lodged repeated
and strong protests against the U.N. Mission's decision to open
the Pristina airport to civilian aircraft and the flight into
Yugoslav airspace by the crashed U.N.-chartered plane, saying both
the moves violated the Security Council resolution 1244, adopted
on June 10, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of

<HEADLINE> Canada to Introduce New Anti-Smoking Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada will introduce new
packaging legislation in the new year to counter intensified
tobacco research and marketing, which are targeting kids as young
as nine years old.
</P>
<P>
No option has been ruled out, Canadian Health Minister Allan
Rock said here Monday after releasing 1,200 pages of documents
showing tobacco firms trying to fortify nicotine to hook smokers.
</P>
<P>
The minister charged some companies as being deceitful in
Canada as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The federal government will step up its tough, anti-smoking
advertising campaign centering on young Canadians before
introducing new legislation, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian-based Imperial Tobacco Ltd. (ITL) was believed one of
the firms involved in the research, which was mostly generated by
ITL's British parent, British American Tobacco (BAT).
</P>
<P>
There are up to 6 million research documents dating from the
1970s to the 1990s for public viewing at a BAT depository in
Guildford, England
</P>
<P>
The 1,200 pages released in Canada account for about 1.2
percent of the file, or a "tip of the iceberg" in the words of the
Health Minister.
</P>
<P>
Smoking among young Canadians has been on rise for the past
five years, with the latest statistics showing a percentage at
about 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada reports a year 45,000 cases of smoking related
deaths.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Int'l Support for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has called on the international community for more support
for African development as the world is entering the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the call in Lusaka Tuesday when officially opening
the Sub- Regional Review Meeting for Eastern and Southern Africa
of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD
II).
</P>
<P>
The president said debt reduction for African countries is
important because it will provide Africa the opportunity to direct
more of the resources towards development and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Initiatives such as the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
Initiative (HIPC) should therefore be supported, and more
importantly, be implemented quickly and for many more countries,
Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge as we enter the new millennium is to seek
resources for poverty reduction," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that in 1991, the United Nations General
Assembly adopted the new agenda for the development of Africa in
the 1990s which was a declaration by African countries and the
international community to foster African development during the
decade.
</P>
<P>
The first Tokyo International Conference on African Development
was held in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The second Tokyo International Conference on African
Development (TICAD II) took place in the Japanese capital in
October 1998, adopting an action agenda seeking to reduce poverty
in Africa by 50 percent by the year 2015.

<HEADLINE> UK Economy Still Growing Strongly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) - The UK's economy is still
growing strongly, according to the figures for third quarter
economic growth released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Output in the three months to the end of September was 0.9
percent up on the previous quarter, unchanged from provisional
estimates released last month.
</P>
<P>
Economists had forecast an upward revision in the figures to
show a quarterly growth rate of 1 percent and annual growth of 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the figures did not meet expectations, they still mean
the economy is growing at its fastest rate for two years and at an
annualized rate of nearly 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said upward revisions to
production output were offset by downward revisions to service
industries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year the service sector was driving the economy
as the manufacturing and industrial sectors remained in the
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector was revised down to 0.9 percent largely due
to new information from the financial and business services.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Reiterates Support for UAE's Claim on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League supports the
efforts of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to restore sovereignty
over three islands in the Gulf, the assistant secretary-general of
the pan-Arab forum reiterated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League and the Arab world have reached a common stand
that the UAE has "undisputed sovereignty" over the islands of
Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, Ahmed Ben Helei told a
symposium organized by the Egyptian Press Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
The UAE claims sovereignty over the islands, which Iranian
troops occupied after British troops pullout in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The islands are close to the strategic Hormuz Straits. Rich oil
resource has been found in recent years around the islands.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation forum also supports all peaceful measures that
the UAE will take to restore its sovereignty over the islands,
Helei was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the league's "rejection of all Iranian measures
aimed at imposing a fait accompli and consecrating its occupation
of the islands."
</P>
<P>
The league will continue its endeavors to persuade Iran to settle
the problem with the UAE peacefully, either through negotiations
or international arbitration, he added.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran have expressed readiness to solve their
dispute by peaceful means. The UAE has called for a solution to
the issue through international arbitration while Iran insists on
direct talks.

BEIRUT, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group was killed in an armed confrontation
with Israeli forces in south Lebanon, the group's statement said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aamzy Abdel-Moneim Mishaymish, 24, died on Tuesday of injury
sustained in attacks against an Israeli outpost inside the
Israel-occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the statement said

<P>
Since the start of this year, a total of 33 Lebanese
guerrillas, mostly from Hezbollah, have been killed in the region
while 13 Israeli soldiers were also killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust Israeli

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid Tuesday discussed with Minister of Industry Moustafa
el-Refay a program aimed at modernizing the country's industry.
</P>
<P>
Obeid and el-Rafay made final touches on the program prior to
referring it to the cabinet for approval, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The program will be financed by the European Union, which has
pledged to provide Egypt with 470 million U.S. dollars in aid and
400 million dollars in loans to help Egypt face up to the
international competition, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Egypt will first set up an unspecified
number of national companies for the study of the world markets of
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
It will go ahead with preliminary feasibility studies of
investment in the industrial sector, and form specialized
companies for modern industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The program demands that Egypt set up a center to follow up
up-to-date knowledge, information and technology in the world
industrial sector, and introduce them to national companies.
</P>
<P>
Industrial development zones will be established, with
government's preferential measures, advanced management and
ready-to-use infrastructure of water, electricity and road.
</P>
<P>
Egypt plans the optimum distribution of factories and their
specializations in each zone so that they may be compatible with
the needs of production.
</P>
<P>
The country intends to overhaul its industry over the next 15
years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Tuesday the approval of a loan of
25 million U.S. dollars to Communication y Telefonia Rural S.A. to
provide fully functional telephone service in areas of southern
Chile where service is now minimal.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the first to a telecommunications company and the
first to Chile from the IDB's Private Sector Department, which was
established in 1995 to provide greater resources for
infrastructure development, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The loan will enable Communication y Telefonia Rural, which is
owned by SR Telecom Inc. of Canada, to develop a rural
telecommunications network in nine zones in southern Chile that
will include 22,500 lines, of which approximately 1,650 will be
public pay phones installed under the terms of Chile's special
rural Telecommunications Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The nine service zones are around Talca, Linares, Chillan,
Concepcion, Los Angeles, Temuco, Valdivis, Osorno and Puerto Montt.
</P>
<P>
The Export Development Corp. of Canada is providing a 25-
million-dollar loan for the project, while investors are providing
a minimum of 52 million dollars in equity and 11.9 million dollars
in investments from the revenue stream, the IDB said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid on Tuesday received a message on bilateral relations from
his Macedonian counterpart Ljubco Georgievski.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered to Obeid by Macedonian Foreign
Minister Alexander Dimitrov during a meeting to exchange views on
economic relations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The message called for joint efforts to seek ways of fostering
cooperation in the political, economic, trade and investment
fields, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade
Youssef Boutros-Ghali held talks with Dimitrov. The two officials
reached an agreement on forming a joint team to discuss ways of
enhancing economic and trade relations, it added.
</P>
<P>
The team, which is to start its work before June, will report
proposals periodically to top officials of the two countries about
boosting economic cooperation, Boutros-Ghali told reporters after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said he was looking forward to a visit to Macedonia with a
delegation of Egyptian businessmen for talks on means of
bolstering bilateral trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Dimitrov spoke highly of the strong ties between
his country and Egypt, expressing hope that the economic ties
would match the political relations.
</P>
<P>
He spelled out Macedonia's interest in setting up a free trade
zone with Egypt, similar to those that Egypt has established with
some of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, after he arrived in Cairo for the visit, Dimitrov
held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa. The tow men
then signed five agreements on stepping up economic and investment
cooperation, including one on preventing double taxation and
protecting reciprocal investment.

<HEADLINE> Report: 135,000 Israelis Suffer From Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 135,000 Israelis are
suffering from hunger, according to a report handed over to the
Prime Minister's Office by the Israeli Union of Local Authorities
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was based on data of social workers from 65
communities, was also presented to the Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report is the latest statistics pointing to the growing gap
between the rich and the poor in Israel - a gap that is second
only to the United States in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government welfare agencies revealed last week that
one in every four Israeli children is living below the poverty
line, a fourfold increase within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has urged social workers to
go out and locate hungry persons throughout the country, but he
didn't take major steps to increase the state budget for welfare
and health, which invited criticism from the masses and the
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
A poll published Tuesday by the local newspaper Ma'ariv showed
that the majority of Israelis believe Barak has not dealt properly
with unemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party on Tuesday also called on Barak to
cut short his visits abroad and return home immediately to face
the serious situation.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (parliament) debated three no-confidence motions
against Barak's government over the problem of unemployment,
poverty and other issues on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although these motions were rejected finally, legislators took
the chance to blame the government for turning a blind eye to the
poverty and unemployment in the country.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has made
progress in implementing the Platform for Action adopted on the
fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a country report presented to the sixth African
Regional Conference on Women in Addis Ababa and seen here on
Tuesday, Tanzania's constitution guarantees 15 percent seats in
parliament to be occupied by women since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report says the Tanzanian government has enacted Sexual
Offences Special Provisions Act (1998) and the Land and Village
Act (1999).
</P>
<P>
The former act protects women and children from sexual abuse
while the latter act guarantees women of equal rights with men in
land ownership.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, says the foreign debt repayment in
Tanzania has disrupted social services and women have suffered
more than men.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing U.N.
special representative in Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo, Tuesday
condemned human rights abuses committed against civilians by
former rebels, mostly in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone, a
U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told a press conference here
that a United Nations human rights assessment mission went to Port
Loko last week and received reports of daily killings, rapes,
abductions and house-burning by former rebels.
</P>
<P>
Okelo called on all parties to the Lome agreement to order the
immediate release of all detainees, and to ensure that their
followers abide by commitments to respect the fundamental rights
of all Sierra Leoneans, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, a U.N. human rights officer went to Kabala,
northern Sierra Leone, where a high incidence of abduction,
looting, rape and physical attacks against civilians has been
reported this month.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, Okelo welcomed the registration as a political
party of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), one of the former
rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Okelo said that with this registration, the government of
Sierra Leone has now completed all the necessary steps envisaged
by the Lome Peace Accord, signed by the Sierra Leonean government
and the RUF leader, to enable the RUF to participate fully and
lawfully in the political life of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Lome peace accord, signed on July 10 in Togo's capital of
Lome, ended the eight-year civil war in the west African
country.

<HEADLINE> EU Defends Farm Policy Before WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Tuesday that more negotiating chips there are on the table,
the easier it is to agree on a package when ministers of the World
Trade organization (WTO) members hold global trade talks in
Seattle from November 30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive arm's agricultural chief
Franzs Fischler said If negotiations only covered agriculture and
services,which EU totally reject, there would be winners and
losers. "But WTO decisions are reached by consensus, and
politicians do not tend to clinch deals by which they come off
losing," he told a news briefing in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The EU has said time and again that it is in favor of a
comprehensive WTO round covering all trade areas, but the United
States offers a much limited round of talks focusing on
agriculture and services.
</P>
<P>
Apparently giving a hint about differences on farm policies
between the EU and the United States, Fischler said within the
space of eight years, the EU has pushed through two radical
reforms which have reduced expenditure on trade-distorting export
refunds and intervention from 90 percent of the agricultural
budget to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"And with the 1992 reform and Agenda 2000 we have lowered
guaranteed prices by a total of 45 percent for cereals and by 40
percent for beef," he said, adding that the EU agriculture thus
can hardly be accused of not being open to reform.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner for agriculture also pointed out that
convenient the oft-used tag "farm fortress Europe" may be, it is a
misnomer. "This is proved by the simple fact that the Community is
the world's largest importer, and second-largest exporter, of farm
produce, with our imports increasing by 250 percent between 1991
and 1997 alone. In other words, the Community has every interest
in adjusting and strengthening the international rules of play in
farm trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischler also said he believes the new WTO round which may be
launched in Seattle early next month will have to go beyond purely
market-related issues and cover areas of social concern such as
environmental protection, animal welfare, quality and food safety.
</P>
<P>
"We must realize that suspicion of the WTO is already running
high. If people's impression that the WTO puts trade before health
issues is confirmed, it will not become stronger in the future,
but weaker," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Downplays Attack Outside Israeli Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian officials downplayed a
shooting incident Tuesday afternoon outside the Israeli Embassy
here, saying the gunman might have mental problems.
</P>
<P>
The 20-or-so pistol-wielding gunman, whose name was not given,
fired several shots at policemen guarding the Israeli mission in
Amman, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official from the Interior Ministry told the
official news agency Petra that the man could be suffering lunacy
of family origins, and the bullets he fired had no projectile
noses. He was arrested on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The official was apparently dismissing a statement from the
Israeli Foreign Ministry, which said the attack was targeted at
its mission.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian police have apparently beefed up security
outside the Israeli mission after the shooting incident, sending
two armed jeeps with heavy machine guns to guard the diplomatic
complex even for off-office hours Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Attacks on Israeli targets remained a sensitive subject in the
kingdom, and police officers kept tight-lipped over the shooting
incident while keeping journalists and bystanders off the Israeli
mission in northern Amman.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident occurred at a sensitive time as the
government expelled four leaders of the militant Palestinian group
Hamas earlier this week, including its political chief, Khalid
Mashal, to contain its anti-Israel activities on the Jordanian
soil.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or the Mulism Resistance Movement, remained opposed to
the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, and it is
also critical of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The group has claimed responsibilities for several deadly
attacks on Israeli targets in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The government decision to expel Hamas leaders met with
protests from the predominantly Palestinian population of the
desert kingdom, particularly from political groups with a strong
anti-Israel sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Police are further investigating the shooting incident.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli archeologists have excavated artifacts
along the banks of the upper reaches of the Jordan River, which
indicate that there was one of the migratory routes of prehistoric
man out of Africa.
</P>

Professor Na'ama Goren-Inbar of the Hebrew University's
Department of Prehistoric Archeology said that flint and stone
tools uncovered in the region of the B'not Ya'akov bridge showed
many similarities to those used by African hominid and could date
back 700,000 to 800,000 years, The Jerusalem Post newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most archeologists believe that the origin of human beings is
in Africa, and then the hominid left Africa through what is known
as the Levantine Corridor.

The B'not Ya'akov discovery, as another one made southwest of

<HEADLINE> Israel Promises Land Hand Over in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barak, speaking after talks in London with Prime Minister Tony
Blair, said the deadlock over the transfer of five percent of West
Bank land to Palestinian rule could be quickly overcome.
</P>
<P>
"I believe (the transfer) will be ended in a few days," Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been approved by the Israeli government... We are ready
to implement it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli pullback is already a week overdue, as the sides
wrangle over the areas to be handed over. Palestinians say they
want more populated areas near Jerusalem. Israel says it has the
right to decide which land it will transfer to Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, Blair gave Barak a warm bear-hug on the
steps of his Downing Street residence.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Barak's efforts to reach permanent peace with
Palestinians offered hope for other strife-torn regions of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"It is a beacon of hope for people facing conflicts, that these
conflicts can be resolved if there is political will," said Blair,
who is hoping to wrap up soon a historic peace deal in Britain's
troubled province of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who is on his way back home from a week-long trip to
Turkey, the United States, was due to leave Britain after
addressing a meeting of the United Jewish Appeal fund in London.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Barak briefed Blair on his long-term strategy
for negotiations with the Palestinians, with an eye to shoring up
international support as the talks head towards the most difficult
and contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
"I know there will be difficult times, but I am quite sure you
have the support of the entire international community," Blair
told the Israeli premier.
</P>
<P>
Barak said his talks with Blair were "very friendly and
fruitful".

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Former Army Chief Charged with Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former army chief,
retired General Ishaya Bamaiyi, Tuesday appeared at a Lagos court
charged with murder of a newspaper publisher in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi was accused with four others of shooting in Lagos of
Alex Ibru, publisher of the independent and popular Guardian
newspaper in February 1996 and former interior minister who fell
foul of then dictator Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial with Bamaiyi was also James Danbaba, Abacha
regime's former security chief. Danbaba is already on trial for
the murder of opposition leader Moshood Abiola's wife.
</P>
<P>
Ibru was seriously wounded and was flown to London for
treatment, where he remained until Abacha's death.
</P>
<P>
The case was on Tuesday's court opening to be adjourned to
December 10 and the accused were ordered to be remanded in
custody.
</P>
<P>
No pleas were taken from the accused, who also included James
Danbaba, punishment for the alleged offences could range from a
long prison term to death by hanging.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi, who was appointed army chief in 1993, retained the
position after Abacha's death last year but was sacked hours
after President Olusegun Obasanjo took office on May 29 to end
more than 15 years of military rule.

<HEADLINE> Russia Achieves 14-Month Economic Growth: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian economy has grown
steadily for the past 14 months and the positive trend will
continue, said Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There have formed positive dynamics of the country's
industrial growth, which amounted to 7.5 percent over the first 10
months of 1999 against the same period last year," said Putin at a
meeting of the Coordinating Council of Domestic Producers.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP)
would reach over 2 percent by the end of this year "despite the
adverse conditions in agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Russia expects a positive balance of foreign trade for 21.2
billion U.S. dollars, while positive changes are emerging in the
social spheres, said Putin.
</P>
<P>
"The will for stability has become more evident recently,
extremist and radical parties have lost much of their influence in
Russian society," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"But it is absolutely incorrect to say that we have reached a
fundamental breakthrough in economy," he said, noting that the
current growth is based on the ruble's devaluation, the
development of domestic production, substitution of import and the
favorable situation for Russian primary fuels on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars leaves Russia every
month, he said, citing law-enforcement agency figures.
</P>
<P>
"We have formed the main institutions and mechanisms for market
relations" and they must be reinforced in the near future, said
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
If Russia's GDP grows between 6-7 percent annually in the next
two or three years, it will reach the 1990 level in at least five
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half, 49 percent, of the country's enterprises evaluate
their current situation as stable and good, the best indication
since 1993, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a pre-crisis standard of living is "unlikely to be
achieved this year. This could happen by late 2000 in the best
case scenario," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The positive economic dynamics will continue next year unless "
an emergency situation of a domestic or external nature arises,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the international arena failed to develop
according to the scenarios some politicians envisioned in the
early nineties. We must respond to this," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of supporting the military
industrial complex and defense sector research.
</P>
<P>
"Russia needs a development strategy for 10 to 15 years ahead.
It has no such program at present, which is now one of the factors
impeding the state's development," according to the premier.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Tuesday the approval of a loan of
250 million U.S. dollars to Brazil to expand the coverage and
improve the quality of secondary education.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a two-phase plan, to be carried out by
the Department of Secondary and Technical Education, that is to
eventually receive a total of 1 billion dollars in investments.
</P>
<P>
The IDB is expected to eventually provide 500 million dollars
in financing, an amount that will be matched by Brazilian
counterpart resources.
</P>
<P>
Among the benefits of the program will be a reduction in grade
repeater and dropout rates and improvements in learning
performance as measured by achievement tests, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to encourage individual states, by
offering them matching grants, to undertake reforms and
investments to improve and expand secondary education.
</P>
<P>
The current IDB loan, to be matched by 250 million dollars in
counterpart funds, is for a 25-year term, with a 4-year grace
period, at the variable interest rate, now 6.84 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The head of the U.N.
Mission in Kosovo said that he and visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton had discussed what the U.N. Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK) has achieved, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. special representative in Kosovo, the
Yugoslav province, said, "Step by step, UNMIK has helped rebuild
local power plants, schools and rebuild homes."
</P>
<P>
"In five months, we have achieved more than five years in
Bosnia," Kouchner said, referring to a U.N. peacekeeping operation
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was very supportive of the UNMIK and the international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the Serbian province, and was "very
tough on the topic of American money," Kouchner said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president was particularly interested in UNMIK's work
to reorganize Kosovo, build the administration, organize local
elections and protect minorities, Kouchner said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. mission is short of fund at present. Russia
demands that the U.N. mission, together with KFOR, do more to
honor the Security Council resolution 1244 to fully respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and ensure
security for all ethnic groups in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
Britain announced Monday that it expected to send an ambassador
to Libya next month, restoring full diplomatic relations after
nearly 16 years.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said that would
not be the case for Washington.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the British decision is concerned, that's really for
the British government to decide," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Libya must stop what the U.S. said its support for
terrorism, cooperate with the investigation of the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 in 1988, and pay compensation for the 270 people,
including 189 American victims.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Libya handed over two suspects of the Pan Am
flight bombing for trial next year and U.N. economic sanctions
have thus been lifted.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Libya's opposition to peacemaking between the Arabs
and Israel was "in and of itself not a reason" for withholding U.S.
recognition from Libya. He said the United States had relations
with several governments that do not support the peace process.

A Panamanian official, member of the official commission which

Recently, the supposed secret negotiation between Panama and
the United States to extend U.S. military presence over the year
2000 deadline has caused a wave of criticism and violent protests

Groups of union members made a series of protests Monday in the

troops to stay within Panamanian soil.

According to the Torrijos-Carter agreements of 1977, signed by

<HEADLINE> EU Forecasts Economic Growth for 1999-2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation European Union (EU), published the
autumn economic forecast Wednesday, saying the EU economy will
move into high gear in the second half of 1999 as a result of an
improved international environment and domestic demands.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said the real GDP growth rate in the EU, and the
euro-area, is expected to accelerate from 2.1 percent in 1999 to 3
percent in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 outlook is consistent with the spring forecast, but
the 2000-2001 forecast is revised upwards, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to remain well below two percent in both
2000 and 2001, despite the adverse effects of higher oil prices,
according to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
In both economic growth and inflation, the development among EU
member states is forecast to be more homogeneous than in 1999, the
Commission added.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Briefs Jordanian Leaders on Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Wednesday met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat who
arrived here earlier in the day to brief the monarch on the latest
developments in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During their 20-minute talks, King Abdullah reaffirmed Jordan's
support for a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region
which will help the Palestinians to regain their legitimate
rights, including the establishment of an independent state,
Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Amman was part of his efforts to coordinate
stands on the middle east peace process, particularly with regards
to the final status talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government said the kingdom's interests must be
protected in the ongoing final status talks, which touched upon
issues of border, refugees and water-sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Arafat were later joined by Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid, who arrived in Amman Tuesday for a three-day
friendly visit.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders reviewed the latest developments in the
Middle East process and discussed ways of strengthening relations,
Petra said, without giving further details of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that Arafat's visit to Amman was partly
aimed at meeting Wahid to discuss the establishment of an
Indonesian liaison office in Palestinian territories in the near
future, but no timetable appeared to be set after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left here for home Wednesday evening after the talks.

<HEADLINE> Manila Creates One-Stop Housing Assistance Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it has created a one-stop housing assistance center
to provide a coordinated and speedy response to the housing needs
of low-income Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the Presidential
Housing Assistance One-Stop Center is mandated to address the
needs and concerns of the beneficiaries and developers of the
government's low-cost and socialized housing program.
</P>
<P>
The center, which will be under the direct supervision of the
Presidential Commission on Mass Housing, shall be manned by a
composite team of representatives from other concerned housing
agencies, Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has also formed regional and
provincial housing centers to assist developers and intended
beneficiaries of mass housing projects at the local level.
</P>
<P>
According to Barican, the Philippine government will allocate
at least 90 billion pesos (2.25 billion U.S. dollars) to complete
its target of building 350,000 housing units next year.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has expressed confidence that his
administration's target of building 350,000 units each year until
2004 will become the foundation of a "sustainable housing system"
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada lowered interest rates for socialized housing
loans from 16 percent to 9 percent and extended the amortization
period from 25 to 30 years to make housing more affordable to the
masses.
</P>
<P>
He has also assumed the post of "housing czar" to personally
oversee the progress of the government's mass shelter program,
which he has declared as a centerpiece program of his
administration.

ISLAMABAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Afghan opposition

<P>
The death of Najmuddin Khan, an important ally of opposition
leader Ahmad Shah Masood in Badakhshan which lies on the border

Badakhshan province is currently under the control of the
opposition although the ruling Taliban have captured over 80
percent of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban enjoy some support in the province, where white
flags, the militia's trademark, were once hoisted in several
districts but later removed by opposition troops led by Najmuddin
Khan.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Opposition Chief Denies Conspiracy Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
leader on Wednesday denied that he had involved in any alleged
conspiracy to discredit the government ahead of the presidential
poll next month.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the main opposition United National Party (UNP) Ranil
Wickremesinghe said his party had no connection with the recent
military debacles which had been reportedly caused by a conspiracy
against President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Government troops suffered one of their worst defeats in the
16-year-old fight against the separatist Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) earlier this month when the military lost 10
key towns and a large chunk of territory which they captured from
rebels over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate state for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election rally in the southern town of
Bulathsinhala late on Tuesday, President Kumaratunga said a probe
into the military's debacles in the war against Tamil rebels had
shown some officers had conspired with the UNP to flee their
posts.
</P>
<P>
She said some former military officials close to the UNP were
seen in the war zones just before LTTE rebels' attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The people can infer for themselves whether there was a
conspiracy or not," the official Daily News quoted the president
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe, the main challenger to Kumaratunga in the
December 21 presidential poll, denied Kumaratunga's charges and
said the president must accept responsibility for the debacles and
quit.
</P>
<P>
He said he was also planning legal action against Kumaratunga
and the state media for what he called the smear campaign.

<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 10-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its three
dialogue partners will gather in Manila on Sunday for the Third
ASEAN informal summit and informal meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third ASEAN country to host an ASEAN
informal summit. The upcoming Third ASEAN informal summit, to be
held in Manila on November 28, is expected to be dominated by
discussions on issues of economic reforms, consensus building and
cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the Fifth ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in 1995, the ASEAN
leaders agreed to meet informally every year between the formal
summits, which are held every three years.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN informal summits provide an opportunity for Asian leaders
to engage in free-wheeling discussions on issues of common concern
without need for formal agenda. A list of topics, however, is
usually prepared to serve as guide for the discussions by the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The first ASEAN informal summit was held in Jakarta, Indonesia
on November 30, 1996. ASEAN leaders exchanged views on the
proposed ASEAN Vision Beyond 2003 when the ASEAN Free Trade Area
would come into being.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed regional matters such as the ASEAN-Mekong
Basin development cooperation and the Asia-Europe meeting.
</P>
<P>
The second ASEAN informal summit was held in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia on December 15-16, 1997. ASEAN ministers signed two
documents -- the Memorandum of Understanding to establish the
ASEAN Foundation and the Protocol to Implement the Initial Package
of Commitments Under ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services.
</P>
<P>
At the Manila informal summit, the leaders of the ASEAN member
states will be joined by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung.

MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will gather in Manila on Sunday
for an informal summit, which is expected to be dominated by
issues of economic reforms, consensus building and cooperation in
the region.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN was established on August 8, 1967 with the signing of the
ASEAN Declaration, also known as the Bangkok Declaration, by the
foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN later expanded to include Brunei on January 8, 1984,
Vietnam on July 28, 1995, Laos and Myanmar on July 23, 1997, and
Cambodia on April 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Papua New Guinea became an observer of ASEAN in 1995.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has 10 dialogue partners -- Australia, Canada, China, the
European Union, India, Japan, Russia, New Zealand, South Korea and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN region spans an area of some 5.48 million square km
where 14 official languages are spoken and about seven religions
are adhered to. Its population is estimated at 494.84 million.
</P>
<P>
Organization structure of ASEAN comprises summit meetings (the
highest authority of ASEAN bringing together the heads of
government of the member countries), ministerial meetings, the
Standing Committee, secretariats, committees and senior officials'
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Declaration united the ASEAN members in joint
efforts to promote economic cooperation and the welfare of the
people in the region. The Bangkok Declaration set out guidelines
for ASEAN's activities and defined the aims of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN nations came together with three main objectives in
mind: to promote the economic, social and cultural development of
the region through cooperative programs; to safeguard the
political and economic stability of the region against big power
rivalry; and to serve as a forum for the resolution of
intra-regional differences.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder (3): ASEAN Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Third Informal Summit of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is to be held
here Sunday to discuss various political and economic issues,
among which the promotion of regional free trade is expected to be
high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The most significant step in enhancing trade in ASEAN was the
decision of the fourth ASEAN summit in 1992 to establish the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of AFTA was to enhance ASEAN's position
as a competitive production base geared towards servicing the
global market.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN plans to achieve this goal through expanding intra-ASEAN
trade and making possible both greater specialization and
economies of scale, as well as through more foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
Later, ASEAN leaders decided to accelerate the realization of
AFTA. They reduced the initial time frame twice -- in September,
1994 and December 1998 -- to the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
This new schedule was tailored for the six original ASEAN
members, namely Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand. By 2002, all of items in the AFTA
inclusion list will have tariffs of 0-5 percent with some
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The newer members of Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar have deadlines
to bring tariff lines between 0-5 percent before the year 2005.
Cambodia, the last to join ASEAN only last April, also made
efforts to meet its AFTA requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme, which
is the main mechanism for realizing AFTA, was launched on January
1, 1993. The scheme covers both manufactured and agricultural
products. The product coverage in the scheme is the most
comprehensive ever in any ASEAN trading arrangement.
</P>
<P>
According to latest ASEAN statistics, the average regional CEPT
rate for products in the AFTA inclusion list has now fallen to
4.59 percent from 12.76 percent in 1993. As of 1998, no product in
the inclusion list of the first six ASEAN members has the CEPT
tariff rate higher than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average CEPT rate for the region is scheduled to fall to
3.74 percent by the year 2000 and then to 2.63 percent by the year
2003.

the present economic reforms and must express concern and carry
out practical deeds for ordinary Chinese people.

of their responsibilities and the challenges they will encounter

<HEADLINE> African Govts Urged to Look Inward for Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- African governments should
become inward- looking to create employment rather than look up to
foreign investment, a Zimbabwe-based inter-governmental
organization said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Africa has an abundance of resources which need to be developed
by the governments to solve the unemployment problem without
depending on foreign help, Jobs for Africa coordinator Jesimen
Chipika said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment came to Africa a long time ago, but
unemployment levels continued to rise, the Zimbabwe News Agency
quoted Chipika as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only foreign investment that will solve the problem
of employment," she pointed out, adding that "we need to
re-package our own sponsorship for grassroots projects."
</P>
<P>
The Jobs for Africa program was launched in Zimbabwe early
this year to sponsor micro projects and it operates in at least 16
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The program is composed of more than 70 stakeholders in job
creation, including government ministries.
</P>
<P>
Chipika welcomed the proposal of establishing the Employment
Creation Act in Zimbabwe, saying that efforts to create jobs would
be futile without a policy framework to follow.
</P>
<P>
She said the policy should specify the needs for a national
strategy for the speedy creation of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Zimbabwe is estimated to range between
35 percent and 50 percent with more than 300,000 school leavers
failing to get jobs every year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand, Myanmar Mend Fences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar have
mended fences after the latter reopened its land border with
Thailand Wednesday morning, ending nearly two months of strained
relations triggered by what Myanmar saw as Thailand's improper
handling of the Myanmar Embassy hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached in Yangon on Tuesday after Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan paid a day-long visit there,
during which he held a series of meetings with Myanmar leaders.
</P>
<P>
"It's in our mutual benefit to maintain the relationship well
and effective. We've agreed that from now on our relations will be
carried on within the framework of bilateral agreements,
international laws and diplomatic practices," Surin told Xinhua
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Either side will be informed of any future disruption along the
Thai-Myanmar border rather than taking unilateral action as has
been in the case, Surin said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever issue that will affect our relations will be managed
and contained in such a way that it will not affect the entire
relations, the entire 2,400-kilometer border, the border trade and
the border crossing," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar unilaterally closed its land border with Thailand and
suspended the fishing rights of Thai fishing vessels in its waters
after five Myanmar gunmen took over their country's embassy in
Bangkok on October 1 and held 89 people hostage for 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully with the gunmen flown by the Thai
side to the border with Myanmar and allowed to go free.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Myanmar government was not happy about
the way the hostage-takers were treated and was annoyed by a
senior Thai official's description of the gunmen as fighters for
democracy rather than terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Surin told reporters Tuesday that Myanmar said it had closed
the border in order to reduce tensions stemming from the embassy
siege and ensure calm in the area.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Surin and Myanmar leaders also covered
fishing issues, the return of illegal Myanmar workers in Thailand
and the five Myanmar hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
Surin said Myanmar will invite Thai fishing operators for talks
in Yangon in order to clarify concessions. The invitation would be
extended when the fishermen are ready, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai fishermen, who say they have suffered huge losses from
Myanmar's closure of its waters, earlier tried to negotiate
independent deals.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also gave assurances that illegal Myanmar immigrant
workers in Thailand could return in safety, provided they re-enter
at the point where they left the country, Surin said.
</P>
<P>
As for the five gunmen, Myanmar left it to Thailand to proceed
with the case according to Thai law, Surin said.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen have been charged with illegal detention, illegal
possession of firearms, robbery and hijacking by Thai police.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that business operators in several Thai border
provinces welcomed Myanmar's decision to reopen the border,
expecting that business will soon return to normal.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the Thai-Myanmar border came one day before
Surin and his Myanmar counterpart join other regional ministers in
Manila for a preparatory meeting for an informal summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations to be held there on Sunday.

year's World Junior Championships, in 15-5, 8-15 and 15-5.

to the court and lights," explained Chan, who ranked 30 in the
world.
</P>

works of their opponents, including 5th seed Lee Soon Deuk of

<HEADLINE> Franchise Exhibition Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Franchise companies attending
the 1999 International Franchise Exhibition were astonished to
learn that more than 800 million yuan worth of contractual deals
were made during the four-day exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Norman Wan, president of the famous Italian ice-cream company
Pregrel (China), said, "I did not expect so many people to attend
the exhibition, and more surprisingly, most of the participants
expressed willingness to run franchise businesses."
</P>
<P>
Wan said that during the four days, over 7,000 visitors stopped
at his stall, asking about qualifications to become a franchisee.
Some 80 million yuan of contracts were signed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ms Denis Hoogenboom, director of Worldsites Franchise
Development Department, said even though the company's
requirements for franchisees is very high, the company signed 20-
million yuan worth of contracts.
</P>
<P>
Although not present at the exhibition, French and Belgium
franchise associations have expressed willingness to attend the
next exhibition, said Dr. Hans Lang, president of the German
Franchise Association.
</P>
<P>
China's chain store industry is growing at an astonishing 30
percent annually, with sales exceeding 100 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predict that annual sales of franchise businesses
will account for 10 percent of China's total retail sales from the
current one percent level.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted during the exhibition revealed that 40
percent of investors invest 50,000 to 120,000 yuan in opening a
franchise store while 18 percent are willing to invest more.
</P>
<P>
Deposit accounts of urban and rural Chinese have exceeded 6
trillion yuan. Observers say that the low-cost and low-risk
franchise market is a very sound investment.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Raise Mekong Agenda on ASEAN Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to raise
the so-called Mekong Agenda during the upcoming summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong Agenda, which has been accepted as part of the ASEAN
agenda, is aimed at helping the four new ASEAN members, namely
Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, which are located in the
Mekong River basin, to develop "physically," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
To develop "physically" means to develop in the physical part,
including roads, bridges, telephone, irrigation, transport, health
care and others, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we could develop the Mekong River basin, the new
members will have to wait for a long time before being integrated
into (ASEAN), interacting on (each other) and benefiting from the
membership of ASEAN," Surin said in an interview with Xinhua
before heading for Manila Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand will also propose a plan for human resource
development for the four new ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
"Without human resource development, you can not expect the
countries to move forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
By promoting human resource development, the new members will
be able to "think the same thing, dream the same dream and work
toward the same goal," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
In respect of helping the new ASEAN members to develop, the
three dialogue partners of the organization, namely China, Japan
and South Korea, can help, Surin said.
</P>
<P>
Surin also noted that the ASEAN-plus-three structure is
expected to be formalized at this summit as a joint statement will
be issued among the 13 countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that at this upcoming summit, ASEAN leaders
are expected to look inside the organization itself.
</P>
<P>
The dream of including all 10 Southeast Asian countries in the
bloc has been realized, but it is not the final purpose of ASEAN,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make the (ASEAN) family effective, prosperous,
cooperative and well-integrated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been proposing a so-called flexible engagement
policy instead of the traditional non-interference policy in
ASEAN. But the proposal has met with rejection from most fellow
ASEAN members.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif Wednesday again appeared in a special
anti-terrorist court in the southern port city of Karachi when
statements of three more prosecution witnesses were recorded.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time Sharif had been produced to the court
after he was charged with attempted murder, hijacking and criminal
conspiracy and arrested earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
So far statements of nine prosecution witnesses have been
recorded against the former prime minister in the court.
</P>
<P>
Three of the co-accused, former advisor to Sharif on Sindh
affairs Syed Ghous Ali Shah, former Chairman of Pakistan
International Airlines (PIA) Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and former
police chief of Sindh province Rana Maqbool were also present
during the recording of statements, according to the semi-official
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
However, the fifth accused, former head of Civil Aviation
Authority Aminullah Chaudhry, was not produced as he has become an
approver, APP said.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry has confessed that Sharif ordered him to refuse a PIA
plane which General Pervaiz Musharraf, now chief executive of
Pakistan, was aboard, to land at the Karachi international airport
on October 12.
</P>
<P>
The plane finally touched the ground after the army took
control of the airport and within hours General Musharraf
dismissed the Sharif government in a bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
The deposed prime minister is currently under judicial custody
and he will be produced to court on Saturday before which the
prosecution is asked to provide the charge list.

<HEADLINE> HK Labor Department to boost harmonious labor relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department of Hong
Kong special Administrative Region (HKSAR) announced Wednesday
that it is committed to promoting harmonious employer-employee
relations, with a view to minimizing labor disputes and employee
claims.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, we are stepping up our efforts in promoting
effective communication between employers and employees, as well
as direct and voluntary consultation at the enterprise and
industry levels on employment issues," Commissioner for Labor
Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address at the 19th Institute of Human Resource
Management Annual Conference, Cheung said Hong Kong's economic
success had been firmly underpinned by its harmonious labor
relations.
</P>
<P>
"The department seeks to facilitate good employer and employee
relations by promoting public understanding of labor laws and
encouraging good labor management practices and communication
together with good human resources management," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said tripartite consultation involving employers, employees
and the government was an effective means of promoting partnership.
</P>
<P>
"So far, five tripartite committees have been set up in
catering, construction, theater, warehouse, cargo transport and
property management. We will continue to assist more industries in
setting up such consultative committees," he said.
</P>
<P>
The department provides a framework for resolving disputes,
which includes the provision of conciliation service for employers
and employees.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, over 60 percent of the 30,541 employment claims and
labor disputes handled by the department were resolved amicably by
conciliation efforts.
</P>
<P>
"In the first nine months of this year, only 12 working days
have been lost due to industrial conflicts," he said, adding that
the quarterly figures on disputes and claims showed a downward
trend so far this year when compared with the same period last
year.

<HEADLINE> HK Polling Station to Be Open for Public Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A polling station will be
open for public visit two days before Hong Kong's district
councils election on Sunday in a bid to make all arrangements open
and transparent.
</P>
<P>
Located at Wong Tai Sin Community Center, 104 Ching Tak Street,
the polling station will be open for public visit before the
electorate go to the polls of district council election on
November 28, a spokesman for the Registration and Electoral Office
said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public, especially electors, may be interested
in seeing the set-up of a polling station before they cast their
votes," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"As the ballot is secret, no one is allowed to enter a polling
station during polling hours except electors who have to vote in
that polling station, candidates and their agents who have to
observe the conduct of the poll, and officials on duty," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"Thus we make this special arrangement to enable the public to
see in advance the facilities in a polling station. It is our duty
to make all electoral arrangements open and transparent," he added.
</P>
<P>
For the first time this year, a chop is introduced to replace a
pen to mark a ballot, the spokesman said, adding that polling
staff will give each elector a ballot paper together with a
paperboard attached with a chop after checking his identity card.
</P>
<P>
Electors are asked to use the chop to stamp a "tick" in the
circle opposite the name of the candidate of his choice, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, a total of 432 polling stations
throughout Hong Kong will be open on Sunday for 2.28 million
registered electors to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 798 candidates are running in the election. As 76 of
them have already been elected unopposed, 722 candidates will
compete for 314 seats.
</P>
<P>
After polling closes at 10.30 p.m., ballot boxes in each of the
18 districts will be delivered to the respective District Counting
Station where staff will count the votes overnight until results
are known.
</P>
<P>
A public area will be designated at each district counting
station for members of the public to observe the counting of votes
and the announcement of election results.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Achieve Common Prosperity with Inland Areas: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese economic official said
at a seminar here Wednesday that Macao will achieve common
prosperity with the inland areas of China on the basis of mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade cooperation between Macao and the inland
areas of China will be strengthened after Macao's return to the
motherland on December 20 this year, said An Min, assistant
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation of China.
</P>
<P>
"The healthy economic development and growing national strength
in the inland areas are a kind of powerful backing for the
economic expansion in Macao, and the huge market and abundant
business potentials in the inland areas will offer great
opportunities for Macao's economic growth," An Min said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the inland areas are the leading source of
imported goods of Macao, and the fourth biggest destinations for
Macao's exports. Up to the end of October this year, Macao
business people had set up 6,357 projects of direct investment in
the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
After Macao's return to the motherland, the scope of economic
cooperation between Macao and the inland areas will be expanded,
he said, noting that a better mechanism will be established to
promote mutual development and resolve economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"Relevant departments of the central government will encourage
enterprises, research institutes and institutions of higher
learning to develop new products together with their Macao
counterparts and invest in Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
After its return, Macao's role as a bridge between the inland
areas and the European Union will become more outstanding.
</P>
<P>
An Min reiterated that the future Macao Special Administrative
Region will retain its status as a free port and enjoys a high
degree of administrative and legislative powers in the economic
and trade fields, and it can develop economic and trade relations
with other countries and regions in the name of Macao, China.

<HEADLINE> Number of Killed in Indian Cyclone Remains Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly four weeks after a
super cyclone hit India's east coast with devastating
consequences, nobody can tell how many people were actually killed
in one of the worst calamities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The death toll in the east state of Orissa ranges between
10,000 and 200,000 but most people here feel that it was any
body's guess.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics put the toll at 9,803 till now, a figure
not accepted by non-governmental organizations, relief workers and
the survivors themselves.
</P>
<P>
An action plan worked out by the central government on dealing
with the aftermath of the cyclone last week was based on the
estimate that around 25,000 people had died.
</P>
<P>
The 10-meter tidal waves which rushed nearly 25 kilometers
inland with a speed of 257 kilometers per hour in a block in the
Jagatsinghpur district reportedly killed thousands of people with
some villages wiped out.
</P>
<P>
It happened during the daytime, hence a few had managed to
escape in these villages, Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted a
survivor as saying, adding that the overall toll could be very
high.
</P>
<P>
However, the central government had formally informed the state
government that there was "no procedure or code" laid down for the
calamity to be declared a national disaster, a demand by the
state.

<P>
CAIRO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa flew to London on Wednesday for talks on bilateral
relations and regional issues, the Middle East peace process in
particular, within a four-nation tour.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Britain, Moussa will hold talks
with his British counterpart Robin Cook, Defense Secretary Geoff
Hoon and other senior officials on the latest developments in the
Arab-Israeli peace talks, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to discuss the role played by the
European Union (EU) in helping push the peace process forward,
MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to conceive peace with Israel
in 1979 and has been an active mediator in the peace process since
it was kicked off in 1991. Britain, alongside the EU and its other
members, is also keen on exerting efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will discuss with the British officials ways to boost
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries and seek
more British investments in Egypt, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with members of the British-Arab Chamber of
Commerce to brief British businessmen on Egypt's investment policy
and environment.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the first stop of Moussa's European and Arab trip,
which will also take him to Yemen, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
In Sanaa, Moussa will meet with Yemeni Prime Minister
Abdul-Karim al-Iryani and Foreign Minister Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal,
and convey a message to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh from
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In Manama and Doha, Moussa is to lead his delegation to
separate meetings of joint committees with the two Gulf states to
discuss the situation in the Gulf and bilateral economic and trade
ties.

Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met today with a delegation from
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan led by its acting

</P>
<P>
Nonaka is a noted Japanese politician who has actively promoted

</P>
<P>
Li, who is also chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, pointed out
that consolidating and developing Sino-Japanese relations is
fundamental to the interests and wishes of the Chinese and
Japanese people and is significant in safeguarding regional and
global peace.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we continue to honor the principles enshrined in
the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship between China and Japan, and the Sino-Japanese Joint
Declaration, take a salutary lesson from history, and emphasize
future exchanges between the youth of China and Japan, Sino-

At the invitation of the Japanese government, Li will pay a
good-will visit to Japan in December. Li hopes to make numerous
contacts with Japanese politicians and people from all walks of

understanding and promote deeper bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka congratulated China on its achievements and enormous
progress since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 and
extended Prime Minister Obuchi Keizo's warm welcome for Li's visit
to Japan in December.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 fish fry were
released today in the famed Lijiang River in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the water route traveled by U.S.
President Bill Clinton during his visit to China last year.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tourists and local residents witnessed the release
this morning. It was the third time for the activity, which has
sent a total 500,000 fish fry to the water.
</P>
<P>
The renowned scenic city hosts tens of millions of tourists
from home and abroad every year. Pollution, however, has become
more serious with the development of tourism. In addition, illegal
fishing has threatened the fish resources in Lijiang.
</P>
<P>
The city government has made resolute measures to treat the
river contamination. Efforts in recent years have helped purify
the river, which has again become an ideal natural habitat for a
variety of fish.
</P>
<P>
Hal Sumrall, a tourist from Orlando in the U.S. state of
Florida, said that people in his hometown also release fish into
rivers to sustain the fish resources.
</P>
<P>
"This will be an effective way of sustaining Lijiang's
beautiful ecological environment. This is my third trip to the
city, and each time I have seen a great improvement in the city's
environment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition Files No-Confidence Motion Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's opposition filed a
joint no-confidence motion Wednesday against the government of
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, accusing it of mismanaging the
economy and condoning corruption.
</P>
<P>
Wan Muhammad Nor Matha, speaker of the House of
Representatives, accepted the motion filed by leaders of three
main opposition parties. He told them that the date for the debate
will be set later.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said the two-year-old government has
disappointed the public as it lacked vision, efficiency and
capability and ignored the plight of the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan administration also failed to address key problems,
such as corruption, unemployment, cross-border drug trafficking
and crimes, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
The government was also accused of abusing press freedom,
restricting the rights and freedom of the public and failing to
pursue good foreign policies, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that with the economy showing signs of
recovery, Chuan's seven-party coalition is expected to survive the
motion, the third brought against it in two years. The coalition
holds 255 seats in the 387-seat House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the opposition's move, the prime minister
appeared on national television Tuesday to assure the public that
there will be more good news in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Chuan noted improvements in the battered financial sector and
ruled out dissolution of the lower house of parliament for fresh
elections until some time next year.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion will focus on Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda's handling of the state-owned Krung Thai Bank. The
minister has been accused of protecting his younger brother, who
had been president of the bank for seven years while the bank
piled up massive non-performing loans.

<HEADLINE> Britain Expects France to Import British Beef Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday there
had been "real progress" in resolving a row over France's refusal
to lift a ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said he expected to see the
resumption of beef exports into France in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give any forecasts for time but I think it is
real progress that we've made and I hope to see the resumption of
beef exports into France very soon," Brown told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a response from the French food standards
agency...by the beginning of December," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France on Tuesday agreed on a "protocol of
understanding" on five key issues concerning British beef and
France submitted the protocol to its food safety agency for
reference.
</P>
<P>
But there was still no firm date for resuming British exports.
</P>
<P>
Conservatives in Britain have strongly criticized that Blair's
government had made a damaging concession to France when it agreed
last week to label British beef in the European market. Critics
said French consumers would be able to shun beef clearly
identified as British.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany are the only two European Union member
states which have not yet lift their bans on the imports of
British beef after the EU ruled out earlier this year to end the
ban imposed in March 1996.

need for such," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
But the president also maintained that he is satisfied with the
performance so far of his cabinet members who, he said, helped him
improve the economy and restore peace and order during the 17
months of his administration.

<HEADLINE> GCC Mulls Project to Build Gas Transport Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) has entrusted the Gulf Industrial Consultation
Organization (GICO) to conduct a feasibility study on a project
to build a gas pipeline linking the six GCC member states.
</P>
<P>
An agreement in this regard was signed in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh on Wednesday by secretaries general of the GCC and the
GICO, Jamil al-Hujailan and Ihsan Buhalika, said a statement
issued by the GCC General Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The study is to involve the marketing, financial, technical
and engineering aspects, the statement said, quoted by Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the GCC gas network will be made
up of two pipelines. The first one will link Qatar, Bahrain,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, while Oman and Dubai of the United Arab
Emirates will be connected by another pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The idea of this project reflected the GCC leaders' persistent
support to the strengthening of inter-GCC economic relations, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
All the GCC members are oil and gas-rich states, which sit on
465.41 billion barrels of crude reserve, or about 46 percent of
the world's total reserve. Their total gas reserve amounts to
25.133 trillion cubic meters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Council for the
Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund (MPMF) held its 29th
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The MPMF was an environment fund set up by contractual
developed countries with the aim of helping the contractual
developing countries to carry out their duties.
</P>
<P>
The fund is earmarked for planning national programs of
developing countries, strengthening their institutions, supporting
investment projects and providing technological back-ups.
</P>
<P>
The executive council meeting is held in March, July and
November each year to discuss issues on ODS phase-out policies,
investment items and related supporting efforts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 member countries have attended the conference
this year, including China and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Administration of
Environmental Protection, made positive remarks on the role the
fund played in protecting the ozone layer. He said that the fund
has helped China accomplish the goal of freezing up ozone
depleting materials in the ozone layer this year.

China will make continuous efforts in this regard to reach
Montreal Protocol's targets to replace ozone-depleting materials
in 2005 and 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton came to Kosovo Tuesday to implore ethnic
Albanians to abandon acts of revenge against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
-- Hillary Rodham Clinton announced Tuesday that she definitely
will be a Senate candidate in New York and that she intends to
scale back her duties as first lady so she can move to the state
and campaign "as vigorously as possible."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton has failed to persuade leaders of major
countries to attend the huge trade meeting in Seattle next week.
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq continued to close down its oil export operations in
protest over a shorter-than-expected extension of a program that
helps offset the hardships of international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- WTO logging-tariff plans are drawing the particular ire of
the thousands of environmental protesters expected at next week's
Seattle trade summit. A U.S.-backed proposal would eliminate most
import duties on forest products around the world, boosting
incentives to log.
</P>
<P>
-- Global AIDS deaths are surging and will end the year showing
a rise of 18 percent to 2.6 million, a U.N. agency that tracks the
disease said. Southern Africa is home to 70 percent of the
world's infected people, and the disease has spread far wider
among women than among men.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Privatize its Telecom Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has adopted an
aggressive marketing strategy to privatize the state-owned
Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL) to end its
monopoly in the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
"We will protect TTCL and make sure we privatize it very, very
intelligently and cautiously," Chairman of the Tanzania
Communications Commission (TCC) Ahmed Hassan Diria was quoted by
Wednesday's "The Guardian" newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government would ensure that TTCL be sold at a prmmium
according to the agreed diversity strategy of a joint venture
between the government and private investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to pull off its privatization, the giant company would
be given a monopoly on international calls for four years aimed at
atdracting foreign investors into a joint venture, Diria said.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable set by the Presidential Parastatal
Sector Reform Commission (PSRC), TTCL is expected to be privatized
by next February.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to sell 35 percent of its shares in TTCL
to a strategic partner, 14 percent to ijternational financial
organizations and associated investors, fiv e percent to TTCL
employees and up to 10 percent to Tanzanian financial investors.
</P>
<P>
UTCL's existing network is 90 percent digitized, and has
benefited from some 250 million U.S. dollars of investment over
recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, teledensity in the count| remains low and the
government is looking to an external investor to bring capital and
expertise to exploit TTCL's potential fully.
</P>
<P>
Apart from TTCL, other utility companies also earmarked for
privatijation include the Tanzania Electric Supply Company, the
Tanzania Harbors Authority, the Tanzania Railway Corporation and
Air Tanzania Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Closes Another Commercial Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, central
bank of the country, announced here Wednesday that it has closed
Trust Bank Uganda Limited for mismanagement and insolvency.
</P>
<P>
"The closure is necessary to protect the interests of the
bank's depositors," Charles Kikonyogo, governor of the central
bank, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The bank is said to have a total deposit of 5.3 billion
shillings (3.5 million U.S. dollars) deposited by some 700
depositors.
</P>
<P>
The central bank promised that the insured deposits would be
paid up to three million shillings (2,000 dollars) and the
payments would be done as soon as necessary administrative
arrangements have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank, a subsidiary of Trust Bank Uganda, has
accumulated loss of some 700 million shillings (500,000 U.S.
dollars) because of lack of revenue collection and loss on bad
loans.
</P>
<P>
"The closed bank is a relatively small bank and its closure
will not trigger a new wave of withdrawals," Kikonyogo said.
</P>
<P>
This is the third commercial bank that the Ugandan central bank
has closed for insolvency this year.
</P>
<P>
The Greenland Bank Limited and the Cooperative Bank were closed
for similar reasons in early April and mid-May.

<HEADLINE> China Launching Reforestation Project in Western Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central government will allocate financial compensation and
ration grain reserves for farmers in the region who will sacrifice
their own land and replace the use of timber as cooking and
heating fuel with coal and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Part of the plan, known as "Grain for Timber Project," for
China's economic growth is to optimize the environment in the
country's inland regions while tapping its potential in order to
bridge the gap between the eastern and the western regions.
</P>
<P>
This will the way of life for common folks, many of whom still
live below the country's poverty line, said economists attending a
national workshop on developing the western region held here in
the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This vast land that provides the raw materials necessary to
boost the coastal areas' robust economic growth is the cradle of
China's largest rivers -- the Yangtze, the Yellow, and the Pearl.
</P>
<P>
The frequent flooding of these major rivers in recent years,
which is partly to blame for soil erosion at the upper reaches,
has set off an alarm that the region's rich resources can not be
exploited in a haphazard way. Maintaining the ecological
environment is not only vital for providing food for the local
inhabitants, but is also necessary for ensuring the fast economic
development at the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive strategy to promote sustainable development in
western China is already being designed by the central government.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting on this topic, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed that the work of improving environmental conditions in
the western region is a life-and-death matter for the success of
the strategy.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year the Chinese government imposed a ban on irrational
logging in many forest areas, particularly those at the upper
reaches of major rivers, in a bid to curb soil erosion. Statistics
from the National Bureau of Statistics show that China's output of
timber in the first seven months this year plummeted 22.2 percent
on an annual basis to 14.77 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
"A price must be paid for greenery in the western region,"
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told officials in Yunnan Province
during his recent inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
He said China has a grain surplus to pay the price of returning
farmland to forest and grassland, and called on people in the
region to be far-sighted enough to see that an improvement of the
environment will ultimately be beneficial for agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
So far, the autonomous regions of Xinjiang Uygur, Ningxia Hui
and Tibet, and Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and
Sichuan provinces and Chongqing Municipality are involved in the
project.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has set a two-year target to increase its forest cover
by 200,000 ha, and Yunnan intends to cooperate with the American
Nature Preservation Association to establish the world's largest
national park in the river valley along the mighty Jinshajiang
River. The 15-km-long river canyon is one of the deepest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Zhoima, a villager in Zhongdian County in Yunnan, which is
famous for its vast stretch of snow-capped forest, told Xinhua
that people in her village are changing from their herding
tradition to promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
"There are not many trees left near the village after
generations of logging. It is time for a change in our lives," she
said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Australia
entered the final of the world under-17 soccer championships after
defeating Ghana and the United States respectively in Wednesday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Ghana, who met twice in the last two finals of the
tournament and won each of the titles, failed to conquered the
opponents in the 90-minute regular and 30-minute extra time before
defending champions Brazil claimed their third consecutive final
berth on penalty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
In Auckland, the Brazilians coped better with the pouring rain
and the slippery pitch and took a 2-0 lead after 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Ghana failed to deliver the goods in the first half, being
unable to put their opponents under pressure and to set up goal-
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
It took a beautiful header by Lamptey to bring the Africans
back into the game. All of a sudden, their performance picked up
and they managed to equalize nine minutes from the end of the
regular time.
</P>
<P>
Extra-time brought another exciting 30 minutes, but no
additional goal, before Brazil took it all with a 4-2 victory in
the shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
Another semi-final game was also decided by penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
In Christchurch this afternoon, as almost in every match in
this competition, the U.S. team let their opponents score first
when the Aussie took a 2-0 lead 35 minutes into the match.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pulled one back in the 37 minutes and equalized
shortly after the break, but fell short in the breath-taking
penalties. Australia won 7-6.
</P>
<P>
The final and third-place play-off will be held at Auckland's
North Harbor Stadium on November 27.

<HEADLINE> China Awards Japanese Experts for Helping Control Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China today awarded its
highest official honor to Japanese medical expert Yasuo Chiba,
lauding his outstanding efforts over the past nine years to help
the country control polio.
</P>
<P>
Minoru Hara and Ryuji Iriyama, both experts with the same
project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), were
also granted the award for outstanding experts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the JICA donated another 30 million vials of oral
poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to China.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the JICA, the Chinese government launched the
Poliomyelitis Control Project in 1990 in Shandong, Henan, Hebei,
Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which have had a high incidence of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the project was further expanded to Yunnan, Sichuan,
Guizhou, Jiangxi, Guangxi provinces and Chongqing municipality.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Appreciates Malaysia's Policies in Facing Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday expressed
its appreciation of Malaysia's policies in braving the financial
storm and tiding over economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has responded to the crisis and overcome the
difficulties it had caused with a cool head and a unique approach,
demonstrating the wisdom and courage of the Malaysian government
and people, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As your friendly neighbor who is prepared to pull together
with you in time of difficulty, we are happy to see Malaysia enjoy
social stability, ethnic harmony and gradual economic recovery,"
Zhu said at a luncheon hosted in his honor by the National Chamber
of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said Malaysia's experience has further
testified that developing countries should formulate economic
policies in light of their own national conditions and take the
road of development suitable to them.
</P>
<P>
Zhu believed that the Malaysian people who are determined to
get strong on their own will soon return their economy to a
healthy and steady growth and create splendor again in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial crisis has made it clear to us that today
as the process of economic globalization picks up speed, how to
safeguard economic security and forestall financial risks has
become a pressing issue for all countries in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
To rise to this new challenge, the Chinese premier said, it
requires not only concerted and unremitting efforts by all
governments but also close cooperation and active involvement by
the business and financial communities of all states.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that crisis presents opportunities as well
and so long as Asian countries make courageous and concerted
exploratory efforts and strengthen cooperation, Asia is bound to
have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said the Asian financial crisis has also put
the Chinese economy to severe tests.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the situation, the Chinese government has
resolutely decided to maintain the value of RMB (Renminbi) and at
the same time adopted a series of policies and measures such as
increasing input in infrastructure development and upgrading the
technology of enterprises so as to stimulate domestic demand and
pull along national economic growth. Generally speaking, these
measures have generated the intended results," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China will further implement policies and measures to
stimulate domestic demand and continue to increase input in the
development of infrastructure and the technological upgrading of
enterprises as well as continue to readjust the economic
structure, improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth
and maintain a sustained and fairly rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"China will unswervingly press ahead with reform and opening-up
and keep to the road that suits its national conditions," he said.
He added that as China and the United States signed on November 15
a bilateral agreement on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization, China's WTO accession process will pick up speed and
an expanded opening-up program in China will offer many more
opportunities for foreign businessmen and entrepreneurs to make
investment and develop market in China.
</P>
<P>
As China's economy develops further, one can expect to see ever
closer economic and trade links and increasingly broader
cooperation between China and Malaysia and other Asian countries,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that over the past 25 years, China and
Malaysia have made significant progress in friendly exchanges and
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
To bring into the new century a deeper, broader, more solid and
closer China-Malaysia relationship represents the shared
aspiration of the two governments and peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu held the view that the Joint Statement on the Framework for
Future Bilateral Cooperation that the two governments signed this
year has laid out the blueprint for an all-round relationship of
good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation based on mutual
trust and support between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To build a splendid future for China-Malaysia relations, the
bilateral economic relations and trade in particular, the Chinese
premier said there is a need to work together with a pioneering
spirit and creativity.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that through the vigorous efforts of the
business communities of the two countries, the mutually beneficial
cooperation will scale new heights and make greater contribution
to the growth of all-directional good neighborly and friendly
relations and cooperation between China and Malaysia.

<P>
PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The deadly disease of AIDS is expected to kill 2.6 million
people in 1999 in the world, higher than any previous year since
the epidemic began to rage, said a United Nations report published
on Tuesday in London and Paris. Over the past 12 months, 5.6
million people have been newly infected with AIDS around the world,
at a rhythm of 16,000 each day.
</P>
<P>
-- From 2,000 to 3,000 Algerians attended the funeral on
Tuesday for Abdelkader Hachani, the leader of the Islamic
Salvation Front who was killed on Monday in central Algiers. A
majority of Algerian newspapers have accused the Islamic extremist
group, Armed Islamic Group (GIA), of making the assassination,
which has re-awakened an atmosphere of fear in the country.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Vatican has accused Israel of sowing disputes between the
Christians and Muslims in Israel and Palestine by agreeing to the
construction of a mosque next to the Church of Annunciation in
Nazareth. Israel has rejected the accusation. Under pressure of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the Muslim leaders of Jerusalem
have ordered the Muslims of Nazareth to postpone the ceremony of
laying the first stone of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
-- The 135 member countries of the World Trade Organization (
WTO) failed on Tuesday to agree upon a common text to be submitted
to the WTO summit to be opened on November 30 in Seattle. The

discussion at the summit.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Sir Donald Bradman and Dawn
Fraser were named Australia's athletes of the century on Wednesday
at an Australian Sport Hall of Fame dinner in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Mile runner John Landy won the award for the finest sporting
moment of the century while the 1948 cricket team to England,

Fraser, who was named last week as the best female swimmer in
history, won the 100 meters freestyle title at the 1956, 1960 and

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Between Somali Rival Clansmen Kills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting flared up
between rival subclan fighters in North Mogadishu, Somalia
Wednesday morning, killing at least three and wounding dozens of
others.
</P>
<P>
The Warsangeli clan and the Ujejen clan, both belonging to the
main Muddullod clan loyal to Ali Mahdi Mohamed, went into fighting
with more than ten battle wagons including anti-aircraft heavy
machine guns, rocket- propelled grenades, anti-tank Russian-made
B-10 guns and mortar rounds.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which became less intensified just before noon,
was mainly concentrated around the old seaport in Shangani
district of North Mogadishu controlled by faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available at this stage.
However, the International Committee of the Red Cross run Keysaney
hospital of North Mogadishu has received more than ten wounded
militiamen, one of them died just when reaching the gate of the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to the death of two more militiamen
confirmed by an eyewitness who fled the area of the fighting in
Shangani.
</P>
<P>
A nearby privately owned treatment center has also received
six wounded fighters, while more casualties are still being taken
to pharmacies and other treatment centers.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not stated officially. However,
it is known that the Warsangeli and Ujejen clansmen are fighting
for control of the old seaport which is strategic in North
Mogadishu. Whoever controls the old seaport can also monitor the
movements in the main seaport, which remains closed and out of use
since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the warring sides, the militiamen
of the Ujejen clan have been living in the area surrounding the
old seaport but the Warsangeli militiamen moved in just two days
ago without the consent of the Ujejen politicians.
</P>
<P>
There had been serious talks over the problem in the past two
days. However, all talks seemed to have deadlocked last night and
as usual the respective clansmen opted for armed confrontation as
the only alternative for settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Mohamed Hussein Addow, the acting chairman of faction
leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed who is himself an Ujejen man, has
characterized the confrontation as an unfortunate event taking
place between two brotherly clans in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
He said the politicians from both sides including himself and
the clans' traditional leaders are seriously working in curbing
down the hostility.
</P>
<P>
Some fruits seem to be showing up as the fighting had died down
at noon Wednesday even though the opposing militiamen are still in
place and the situation still remains very tense in the area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place only a week after all the clan
politicians and traditional leaders of the various Abgal subclans
dominating North Mogadishu met at a large gathering in the
compound of Sheikh Muhidin Eli for general forgiveness and
reconciliation among all Abgal subclans.
</P>
<P>
It also took place at a time when the main Imam of the Abgal
clan, Imam Mohamud Imam Omar, is in Mogadishu for arrangements
relating to the overall clan reconciliation efforts.

LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved "emergency measures" to embark on development projects in
the troubled Niger Delta region before the National Assembly
passes a bill on Niger Delta Development Commission, local media
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the measures include the resumption of a
five-billion- naira (about 50 million U.S. dollars) sand filling

of a technical training institute in Rivers State, Special
Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Doyin Okupe,
has said.
</P>
<P>
The government could not wait for the National Assembly to pass
the bill as the region had been rocked by crisis in the past four
weeks, resulting in the deployment of troops to the region.
</P>
<P>
The special assistant also disclosed that Power and Steel
Minister Bola Ige was ordered to ensure that Bayelsa State,
currently not joined to the national grid of electricity, be
connected as soon as possible.
</P>

measures and some interim arrangements to attend to some of the
problems in the Niger Delta," Okupe noted.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-Thai Relations Return to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The recent strained
Myanmar-Thai relations, following the seizure of the Myanmar
Embassy in Bangkok on October 1 by five Myanmar gunmen, have
returned to normal, said a government statement here Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The statement came a day after the conclusion of a one-day
visit to Myanmar by Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The situation between the two countries has returned to
normalcy from November 24, 1999, the government said in its
Information Sheet.
</P>
<P>
During his short stay in Yangon, Surin had a fruitful and
successful discussion with his Myanmar counterpart, U Win Aung,
and was also received by Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were marked by mutual sentiments of goodwill,
respect and understanding and both sides expressed great
satisfaction at the results," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities were compelled to take certain
administrative measures in order to calm down the situation
following the Myanmar Embassy siege incident, it added.
</P>
<P>
Five Myanmar gunmen, who are all students, raided their
country's embassy in Bangkok and held embassy staff, their
families and some foreigners as hostages on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully on the next day with all the 89
hostages freed before the gunmen were flown by the Thai side to
the Thai-Myanmar border and allowed to go free.
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the way of handling the incident by the Thai
side, Myanmar reacted by closing its border with Thailand and
temporarily banned Thai fishermen in the Myanmar waters since
then.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Devaluate Its Currency Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government may
devaluate naira soon against the local currency's current trend of
appreciation, the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government may push the exchange rate of one U.S. dollar to
 100 naira up from the present market rate of one dollar to 97
naira, the paper quoted presidency source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Nigeria has been directed to effect this in
December this year through gradual depreciation of the domestic
currency at the newly introduced Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange
Market, the unidentified source said.
</P>
<P>
The government is of the view that the poor state of the
economy does not justify a stronger naira as any attempt to prop
the exchange rate will further worsen the economic situation, the
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The country's leadership was concerned that a stronger naira
may indirectly encourage capital escape.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of naira will also adversely affect the local
manufacturing industries as it will now be cheaper to import
finished goods than to buy the locally manufactured ones.
</P>
<P>
The naira, whose value has depreciated over the years either
deliberately or otherwise by successive governments, was
exchanging officially for 94.88 naira to one U.S. dollar before
the introduction of Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange Market by the
present administration.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Lagos-based This Day newspaper
Wednesday, Nigeria's central bank Tuesday reduced the Minimum
Rediscount Ratio from 20 percent to 18 percent in a bid to press
the country's interest rate down.
</P>
<P>
The current interest rate of Nigerian banks was reportedly as
high as 35 percent sometimes, posing a great threat to the
recovery of Nigeria's economy.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's National Intelligence Service (MIT) has evidence
that there are camps of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
In response to claims by Russia that there are Chechen
separatists' training camps in Turkey, Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said that "We don't know whether they really have the
evidence."
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Chairmen of the Turkish coalition government's three
partners Wednesday will hold what is likely to be the most
critical summit since they took office, to discuss two important
issues such as the oil pipelines and the case of the imprisoned
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to be held just 24 hours before the Supreme Court
of Appeals will make its decision on Ocalan's death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, Deputy Prime Minister Develet
Bahceli and Motherland Party Chairman Mesut Yelmaz will decide
whether Turkey will wait for the decision of the European Human
Rights Court on Ocalan's case.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Even if Turkish Supreme Court of Appeals does uphold the
death penalty against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
leader Abdullah Ocalan, there is a high probability that the
sentence will never be carried out.
</P>
<P>
At present, the most prevalent speculation, assuming that the
Supreme Court of Appeals upholds the verdict, is that Turkish
Parliament will not act quickly to make a decision on it.
</P>
<P>
Primer Bulent Ecevit told visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday that before sending the matter to Parliament they
would wait for a ruling from the European Court of Human
Rights. "That process could take over a year," Ecevit said.

<HEADLINE> Report Positive On World Economic Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A report just completed by the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) contends that the
current world economic situation is much better than most
economists had predicted early this year, and that the positive
trend will continue through 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yongding, director of CASS's World Economics Institute and
one of the key authors of the report, which will soon published by
the China Social Science Documentation Press, said that the world
economy will grow 3 percent in 1999, and 3.5 percent in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, he said, the Euro dollar got off to a smooth start,
Brazil's financial crisis was controlled, Japan's economic decline
stopped, and instead of facing another financial crisis, Russia
saw a rare economic improvement.
</P>
<P>
"What's more, the United States kept its strong economic growth
tendency, and east Asian countries stepped out from the shadow of
their financial disturbances and regained economic vigor," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the worst economic situation in 1999 was in Latin-
American countries, where many economists believe a 0.5 percent
decline in economy will be the year-end result.
</P>
<P>
Except for Poland, the economy in Eastern Europe is also not so
encouraging, especially in the Czech Republic, which was once
widely praised for its "successful" privatization, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu also warned that the possibility remains for the world
economy to see some fluctuation or even crisis next year. If that
happens, he said, the main reason might be difficulties and
obstacles in the economy of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will not be able to be the engine of the
world economy for the next year, but it will also not be a drag on
the world economy, Yu said.

<HEADLINE> China's New Rule to Ensure Security of Mass Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- From today on, holding
concerts, sports meets, Qigong or other body exercises and other
mass congregations in China involving more than 200 participants
in public places shall be subject to sanction by public security
departments above the county level.
</P>
<P>
A set of regulatory provisions on the security of mass cultural
and sports activities issued by the Ministry of Public security
today spelled out the new rules.
</P>
<P>
If the organizer is an individual not affiliated with
government bodies, companies or social institutions, he must first
get approval from relevant government departments, the regulations
say.
</P>
<P>
In the event that participants may exceed 3,000, approval by
public security body at or above the prefecture level is needed;
and the event that involve two or more localities shall get the go-
ahead from a higher public security department responsible for
these areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security said in a press release today
that public cultural and sports activities are growing rapidly in
number thanks to economic progress and rising living standards.
</P>
<P>
But due to lack of security measures, many security problems
have occurred during such activities, and some have resulted in
serious consequences, including injuries and even death, as well
as extensive property damage, it claims.
</P>
<P>
These measures are "for security reasons," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The regulations strictly prohibit nine categories of mass
congregations, including those that: violate the fundamental
principles of the Constitution, or endanger national security and
public order; infringe upon customs of ethnic minorities, violate
ethnic unity and instigate national separatism; propagate
superstition and heresy, pornography and violence that are
detrimental to the health of the people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, mass congregations shall not be held near places
of government agencies above the county level, radio and
television stations, foreign embassies and consulates, military
establishments and other vital institutions, according to the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations empower police to levy fines and compulsory
measures on those who do not observe these stipulations,
emphasizing that organizers are subject to criminal prosecution if
crimes are committed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Give Tax Holiday for Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
formulating a new policy to attract foreign investors by giving
tax holiday to those investing their capital in the country, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The policy is contained in what it called Early Bird Program in
its investment sector. The government would also grant investors
some incentives such as tax deduction or tax allowance, Minister
of Investment and State Enterprise Construction Laksamana Sukardi
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The facilities, he said, will be given to both foreign and
domestic investors.

"Tax holiday will be granted to new projects. It will last
until March 31, 2000 while tax deduction or tax allowance policy
will be applied starting April 1, 2000," Sukardi told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Asked what sector would be given such facilities, he said: "We
will put priorities in giving these facilities to investment in
agriculture sector." He also he would also give additional
facilities of tax dispensation and raw materials import especially
to new projects which held license but had yet operate.
</P>
<P>

U.S dollars would receive a permanent resident facility.

<P>
SHENYANG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Major railways and
expressways in northeast China's Liaoning Province remained open
today despite slippery conditions from a heavy snowstorm.

<P>
Local meteorologists said the storm swept across many areas of
the province including the capital city Shenyang.

An official with the provincial expressway bureau said
expressways and city roads also remained open today. Although many
snow blowers were used to clear the roads, the bureau set a speed
limit of 40 kmh on icy expressways, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Chins Sets Standard for High-Quality Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with tasteless steamed
buns and cooked rice, more Chinese want to eat savory cakes and
bread made from high-quality grain.
</P>
<P>
To push farmers to grow more fine grain, the State Quality and
Technical Supervision Administration (SQTSA) has issued a new
state standard on grain products including rice, wheat and corn,
to be effective April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The revision of the state standard on grain quality is a great
event which is closely connected with the interests of China's 900
million farmers and the food problem of the country's 1.2 billion
population," Li Zhonghai, vice-director of SQTSA said here today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new standard will help improve competitiveness
of China's grain products in the international market, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He added that after entry into the World Trade Organization (
WTO), China's agriculture, especially wheat and corn trade, will
be affected by international competition. Therefore, the crop mix
must be optimized and the quality of grains increased.
</P>
<P>
The former state standard on rice, wheat and corn was made 13
years ago, and cannot keep up with China's rapid agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
Years of bumper harvests and a continuous emphasis on quantity
by the government have created large stockpiles of grain in China,
with the annual grain yield standing at 480-500 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are growing low-quality grain on large scale and are
worried about how to sell it. However, the production of high-
grade grains cannot meet the mounting market demand.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on the agricultural distribution system
last May decided that the Chinese government will not protect the
production of low-quality grain, but instead will support
cultivation of fine strains.
</P>
<P>
Shi Baoquan, head of the department of standardization under
the SQTSA, said that the revised grain standard will offer a
technical basis for pricing grain according to quality.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Take on Brazil in U-17 Soccer Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia will take on
world soccer powerhouse Brazil in Saturday's final of the under-
17 world championship after beating the United States in penalty
shootout in Wednesday's semifinals in Christchurch of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Australia beat the United States 7-6 to reach its first world
final at any level while Brazil outplayed Ghana 4-2 in another
shootout. Both semifinals matches finished 2-2 at the end of
regular time after the eventual winners squandered 2-0 leads.
</P>
<P>
With the shootout tied at 4-4 after five spot kicks each, it
went into sudden death and was finally settled when U.S. captain
Kenny Cutler blasted his kick over the bar.
</P>
<P>
The loss stopped a 24-game unbeaten streak for the U.S. which
had 19 wins and five draws since its last defeat in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the later semifinal Brazil also got out to a 2-0 lead before
being pegged back by Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo, who shares the famous name with the veteran AC Milan
star, got the first on 25 minutes with a powerful 25-meter volley
which took a slight deflection.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later Brazil went two up as Ghana's Stephen Tetteh
deflected the ball in for an own goal.
</P>
<P>
Brazil looked sluggish at the start of the second half and
Ghana found a way back into the game on 66 minutes when Nathaniel
Lamptey headed in a Benard Dong-Bortey corner at the near post.
</P>
<P>
Brazil beat Ghana 2-1 in the under-17 final two years ago,
avenging its defeat by Ghana in the 1995 final.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Refugee Repatriation Exercise Bogged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The plight of the
275,000 Burundi refugees in Tanzania is now uncertain following
the suspension of their repatriation last month, the United
Nations said in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report circulated by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here on Tuesday, the
repatriation exercise which saw at least 200 Burundians return
home every week had become uncertain because of doubts about the
future of Burundi peace talks following the death of the last
facilitator, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere last month.
</P>
<P>
The document said repatriation which had been going on during
the last ten months could not continue as UNHCR was taking stock
of the situation after the killing of two aid workers in Burundi
on October 12.
</P>
<P>
The two victims, one from UNICEF and the other from the World
Food Program (WFP), were killed in Burundi's southern Rutana
Province while on joint assessment mission for displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said since the repatriation started early this year, the
number of returnees had topped 8,000 people, who went chiefly to
Burundi's Muyinga and Ruyigi provinces where UNHCR maintained
offices.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Tanzanian Minister for Health Aaron Chiduo
declared Tuesday the Tanzanian government will take care of its
people living around the refugee camps to spare them from the
burden of depending on assistance brought for refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said there have been a lot of effects, including environment
 degradation and crimes brought about by refugees who enter the
country in big numbers daily.
</P>
<P>
The government would focus its attention on areas around the
refugee camps so that the residents can live peacefully, he added.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,500 Burundians are fleeing each week to
northwestern Tanzania as fighting intensifies between the
Burundian army and rebels, UNHCR said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge of Burundian refugees to Tanzania comes as regional
leaders are preparing to meet next week in Tanzania's northern
town of Arusha to appoint a new mediator for the stalemated,
year-long Burundi peace talks.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 People Die Every Year in Road Accidents in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Casualties in road accidents in
Bangladesh, estimated at 5,000 deaths every year, is one of the
highest in the world, according to the latest issue of the weekly
Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
Road safety engineers at a seminar in Dhaka recently identified
four major causes of accidents. These include high speed,
overloading, dangerous overtaking and reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
The report said the highways in Bangladesh are unsafe because
the roads have no dividers. In the absence of dividers, the
vehicles collide head-on in most cases.
</P>
<P>
Accidents are rising in Bangladesh also due to dilapidated road
conditions. There are many bridges and culverts that are dangerous
for driving.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor is that rickshaws and other
non-motorized vehicles are allowed to ply on highways where the
motorized vehicles ply at a high speed.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed the need for introducing highway patrol and
raising efficiency of traffic police to avoid accidents.

<HEADLINE> China Pours Funds into Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Juchang, vice minister of Communications, released the
statistics at a recent working conference. He said that China's
highway construction has remained on a sound track in 1999, thanks
to the country's active fiscal policy which tends to emphasize
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that investment in highway construction
in the first half of this year reached 68 billion yuan, accounting
for 37.9 percent of the yearly budget, and hit 62.7 billion yuan
in the third quarter, or 34.8 percent of the estimated amount.
</P>
<P>
Li also disclosed that the total length of highways in
operation is expected to exceed 1.3 million kilometers by the end
of this year, with 35,000-km of new highways added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total length of expressways will also extend to
11,000 kilometers, with over 2,000-km expressways built this year.

<HEADLINE> Regional Meeting on Privatization Held in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A three-day regional meeting
on privatization in South Asia kicked off here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the International Labor Organization
(ILO), will discuss the lessons learnt from privatization
activities in South Asian countries and will provide an
opportunity for the governments, employers and workers to discuss
the issues relating to privatization.
</P>
<P>
Director of ILO's South Asia Multi-disciplinary Advisory Team
A.S. Oberai said at the opening ceremony that instead of debating
whether there should be wholesale privatization, the South Asian
countries could agree on some specific steps to increase
efficiency and reduce the financial burden on governments.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will seek ways to promote and strengthen social
dialogue between workers and employers with the purpose of
resolving the issues arising from privatization, said the
organizers.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are 40 representatives of governments,
employers and workers from Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> WTO Members Fail to Agree on Draft Text to Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have failed to reach consensus on a draft text
one week before WTO's third ministerial conference in Seattle of
the U.S., it was learned here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the last meeting of heads of the delegations held
here Tuesday, trade envoys from WTO members gave up attempts to
narrow their differences over what issues should be in the draft
text to be submitted to the Seattle ministerial conference.
</P>
<P>
The differences remain on certain key aspects of the text,
notably on agriculture and on implementation of existing WTO
agreements and decisions, WTO General Council Chairman Ali Mchumo
told reporters at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the current complete text of more than 30
pages including all proposals from WTO's 135 members since
September 1998 will have to be submitted to the ministerial
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The intensive discussions we have had so far have only served
to highlight that even the best drafters and technicians cannot
offer solutions without political guidance, and that key political
decisions are now necessary," Mchumo told the trade envoys.
</P>
<P>
"We have in our grasp all the ingredients necessary for a
balanced and comprehensive package of results, but we must also
face the reality that we have gone as far as we can in our process
in Geneva," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now the Seattle Ministerial conference will have to take the
critical decision to conclude this work, he said.

GENEVA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World

flexibility necessary to reach consensus after they failed Tuesday
to agree on a draft text one week before WTO's third ministerial
conference in Seattle.

<P>
"I very much regret that this flexibility has not been very

However, the WTO chief said, "This does not mean that we are
going to abandon our efforts to provide ministers with a clear
basis on which to take decisions, or that all the tremendous
efforts of the last months have been for nothing."
</P>
<P>
"These may be seen as useful inputs into the ministers
deliberations in Seattle, but they are of course nothing like an
agreed text," he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Mekong Delta Exports More Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Mekong Delta, Vietnam's
largest rice producer, has exported more than 3.7 million tons of
rice so far this year, according to a report of Vietnam News
Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The whole country has exported 4 million tons of rice this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mekong Delta, located in southern Vietnam, has been the biggest
rice export source of the country for many years.
</P>
<P>
The achievement is attributed to 12 Mekong Delta provinces'
investment of more than 7,500 billion Vietnamese dong (535 million
U.S. dollars) in a number of projects since 1996.
</P>
<P>
They included an irrigation improvement project, a project to
change the crop structure on 800,000 hectares and programs for
reclamation of Dong Thap Muoi (the Plain of Reeds), the Long Xuyen
quadrangle, and the southern Hau River.
</P>
<P>
The measures also include the application of dozens of new
high-quality and high-yield rice strains.
</P>
<P>
Around 600,000 hectares in the delta, mainly in An Giang, Dong
Thap, Can Tho, Kien Giang, Tien Giang, Long An and Vinh Long
provinces, have been put under such rice strains for export.
</P>
<P>
The total rice output in the Mekong Delta is expected to reach
around 17 million tons this year, 4 million tons higher than 1995.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Deplores Fake WTO Websites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore has severely criticized
recently-created websites which mimic WTO's websites and create
confusion among the public.
</P>
<P>
In a statement here Tuesday, Moore said, "I am deeply concerned
about the recent appearance of anonymous websites which copy
important design features of the WTO's official websites."
</P>
<P>
"This causes confusion among visitors looking for genuine
information from the WTO, disrupting a much-needed democratic
dialog," he went on. "It's illegal and it's unfair to those who
have a genuine case in criticizing the WTO, an organization that
only functions with the authority of sovereign governments."
</P>
<P>
WTO's official website is http://www.wto.org. The fake websites
use domain names such as "www.gatt.org" and page titles such as "
World Trade Organization/GATT Home Page", which Moore said makes
it difficult for visitors to realize that these are fake pages.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the WTO uses the image of the official logo of the WTO
Ministerial Conference as a hyperlink to the official conference
website, these fake sites use it to link to anti-WTO material,
further misleading web users," the WTO chief said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Overnight drizzle and an early
morning breeze brought sunshine and fresh air to the Chinese
capital today.
</P>
<P>
A three-day foggy spell ended this morning after a cold gust
from Mongolia gave Beijing a shower Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"I can breathe comfortably again," said Beijinger Liu Guorong.
</P>
<P>
A front-page picture in today's Beijing Morning Post showed an
elderly man at a bus station putting on a gas mask while a child
aside was wearing a white gauze mask.
</P>
<P>
In the past three days, a blanket of fog covered Beijing for
three consecutive days. Pedestrians might have felt like they were
walking in a cloud, and doctors had advised through media alerts
that people should stay inside as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday reported level
V -- the worst of the five levels identifying air freshness.
</P>
<P>
The low atmospheric pressure in the past foggy days and the
pollutants in the air brought more patients with cardio- or
cerebral vascular diseases or respiratory illness to hospitals,
according to sources from the local health department.

The sunny day normalized transportation in Beijing. The Beijing
Capital International Airport, the largest airport in China,
resumed normal operations after some flights had been delayed. A
flight from northeast China's city of Shenyang to Beijing was
canceled because of local heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
Four highways linking Beijing with other parts of the country
were reopened to traffic. Trains arrived and left Beijing on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents had dwindled down to a dozen since the wee
hours of today, according to the Beijing traffic control bureau.
</P>
<P>
During the 42-hour period from Monday morning to Tuesday
evening, however, 861 fog-related traffic accidents had been
reported. More than 90 percent of them involved tailgating and
slight collisions of two or more vehicles because of poor
visibility, which was generally less than 40 meters, and in some
places less than one meter.
</P>
<P>
According to experts from the Beijing Observatory, the fact
that Beijing has mountains on three sides makes moisture and
pollutants hard to disperse. The coal-supported heating system,
industrial pollution and auto emissions produced by the 1.36
million automobiles in Beijing contribute to the foggy conditions,
which in turn make air pollution even worse.
</P>
<P>
Fresh to strong breezes are forecast for the near future as the
cold gust moves on. And the temperature would be lowered to minus
six to minus eight degrees Centigrade.

JAKARTA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
would continue its privatization program for state-run enterprises
in a bid to boost economic recovery and support the rupiah's
stabilization, Minister of Investment and State Enterprises
Construction Laksamana Sukardi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The program is aimed at getting an additional state income and
make healthy the state enterprises," he told parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that at least 11 state-run enterprises had been under
preparation to be privatized in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization of the state enterprises will be conducted
transparently. Privatization is also intended to increase their
competitiveness," Sukardi said.
</P>
<P>
He said those enterprises which were ready would be offered to
investors soon.
</P>
<P>
"If they have been ready, they will be offered soon. But it
seems those which suffer the most will be our priority as we can't
delay further," Sukardi told reporters without giving details.
</P>
<P>
There are around 160 state-owned companies in Indonesia. Their
total combined assets were worth 57.7 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of last year. However, according official sources, at least 50
percent of them are loss-making.

<P>
ANKARA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's National Intelligence Service (MIT) has evidence
that there are camps of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
In response to claims by Russia that there are Chechen
separatists' training camps in Turkey, Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said that "We don't know whether they really have the
evidence."
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Chairmen of the Turkish coalition government's three
partners Wednesday will hold what is likely to be the most
critical summit since they took office, to discuss two important
issues such as the oil pipelines and the case of the imprisoned
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to be held just 24 hours before the Supreme Court
of Appeals will make its decision on Ocalan's death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, Deputy Prime Minister Develet
Bahceli and Motherland Party Chairman Mesut Yelmaz will decide
whether Turkey will wait for the decision of the European Human
Rights Court on Ocalan's case.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Even if Turkish Supreme Court of Appeals does uphold the
death penalty against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
leader Abdullah Ocalan, there is a high probability that the
sentence will never be carried out.
</P>
<P>
At present, the most prevalent speculation, assuming that the
Supreme Court of Appeals upholds the verdict, is that Turkish
Parliament will not act quickly to make a decision on it.
</P>
<P>
Primer Bulent Ecevit told visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday that before sending the matter to Parliament they
would wait for a ruling from the European Court of Human
Rights. "That process could take over a year," Ecevit said.

BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social

</P>
<P>
The report will be published next month in blue-book form by

separatist remarks of Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui and NATO's attack of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade have significantly increased the
sense of unity of the Chinese people, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China's social order remained stable in 1999, and a sound
environment for reform and opening-up was guaranteed, the report
said, adding that this trend will continue in 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, China's current reform still needs to solve a series
of deep-rooted problems. In a small number of regions, some danger
factors are still threatening social stability.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian GDP Rises 8.1 Pct in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic
recovery is going full steam ahead with the gross domestic product
(GDP) doubling its pace to 8.1 percent in the third quarter of
this year from 4.1 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian State Bank governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman, who
announced the encouraging figures Wednesday, said this showed the
country had completely moved out of the crippling recession of
1998.
</P>
<P>
He said GDP growth for the third quarter was "above pre-crisis
levels" and attributed the expansion to the performance of the
manufacturing sector, which posted an impressive growth of 19.5
percent from 10.8 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
With the broad-based growth and policies pursued by the
government to ensure sustained growth, Ali said, the central
bank's estimated GDP of 4.3 percent for 1999 could materialize.
</P>
<P>
He also said the growth rate could be higher than 4.3 percent,
based on the trend in the third quarter and expectations of
sustained growth in the United States and a pick-up in the
recovery of the regional economies.
</P>
<P>
The government's increased spending on economic and social
services would continue to provide stimulus to growth in the
domestic economy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Vows to Continue With Pragmatic Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government will
not abandon its pragmatic economy policy, said Vice-President John
Atta Mills Tuesday while opening the 10th Consultative Group
Meeting (CG), Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to stay this course and fine-tune whatever
rough edges there are to make Ghana an object lesson in the
transparent and judicious use of inflows from development
partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first being held in Ghana, is organized by
the World Bank as a forum between government and its development
partners to discuss issues affecting the economy with a view to
working out strategies together to solve the difficulties. It
also provides the opportunity for the donor community to pledge
resources to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said they expect to raise about two billion
U.S. dollars from more than 30 international donors, including
Japan and China from Asia, the United States, Canada and about a
dozen others from Europe, over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Mills said the government's main concern is poverty reduction,
adding that it would therefore center on poverty reduction
programs during the meeting with specific relation to social
sector programs, micro finance and accelerated agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for resources "to break the current vicious cycle
of poverty, underdevelopment and marginalization" of the country.
</P>
<P>
While it is a fact that the current problems facing Ghana are
due to external forces, the government has admitted its
responsibility for solving them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He restated the government's renewed commitment to deal with
the issue of corruption, especially in public services.
</P>
<P>
The government has developed a strategy on debt relief, which
it hopes to share with its partners during the discussions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said when the cold war ended about a decade ago, Africa's
share of what had been termed the "peace dividend" was not taken
care of.
</P>
<P>
"We have been disappointed because of the invisible barriers,
including the invisible hands that have worked against the peoples
of the developing countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Largest Coal Project to Start Production in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of the Jungar
Coalfield Project, China's largest coal development works, was
completed today with a total investment of 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Located at the juncture of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
Shaanxi and Hebei provinces in north China, Jungar Coalfield has a
proven coal reserve of 26.8 billion tons, six billion tons of
which are fit for opencast working.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project started in 1990. Sources said
the Jungar Coalfield plays an important role in China's coal
exploitation in the under-developed northwestern part of the
country. Its annual capacity is scheduled to reach 12 million tons
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Heidaigou strip mine, the major mine in the project which
was approved by the government in 1996, has produced six million
tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
Power plants, railways and water supply facilities included in
the overall project have already been completed. More than 6.3
billion kwh of electricity has been generated, and over 11.3
million tons of coal have been transported to other parts of the
country so far.

<HEADLINE> Whitebait Output to Increase in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The output of whitebait, a
small sprat or herring, in Taihu, China's third largest freshwater
lake in east China's Jiangsu Province, is expected to exceed 1,000
tons this year, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
L. Taihu boasts the largest reserve of whitebait in China, and
its annual output was maintained at some 1,000 tons in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
But output dropped sharply in the middle 1990s because of water
pollution and over-fishing in the lake. In 1996, it was just over
500 tons, the lowest since 1949.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reduce water pollution, improve egg-laying
conditions, and introduce artificial insemination are credited
with the increase of output, officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Popular for its fresh and tender meat, the whitebait is one of
China's major aquatic exports.

<HEADLINE> Gates Foundation to Donate Funds For Children's Vaccines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman
Bill Gate's charitable fund is giving 750 million U.S. dollars
over five years to help protect poor children around the world
against disease, a news release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The donation is the largest ever by the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and will help launch the Global Fund for Children's
Vaccines, which will begin to operate in the next six to eight
months, the news release of the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation, about four million children in
developing countries die every year of illnesses that could be
prevented if they receive timely vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
"Melinda and I are committed to ensuring that every child has
access to lifesaving vaccines in the next millennium, regardless
of where they live," Gates said in the news release.
</P>
<P>
That fund will work with international development and finance
agencies including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization, UNICEF, the World Health Organization as well as
pharmaceutical companies to vaccinate against tuberculosis, polio,
tetanus, hepatitis B and measles.
</P>
<P>
They will also vaccinate children against rotavirus, which
causes sometimes fatal diarrhea, and pneumococcus, which causes
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The Gates foundation last year gave 100 million dollars to help
deliver new vaccines to children in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Bill and Melinda Gates have donated about 15 billion dollars
this year to their foundation, now the nation's biggest charitable
fund with assets of 17 billion dollars, foundation officials
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
That has reduced Gates's total wealth to 77.5 billion dollars
as of September 28, but he remains the world's richest man.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Public Debt to Rise This Year: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's public debt is
expected to rise to 22 billion U.S. dollars this year, accounting
for 130 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), said a report
by the Association of Banks in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the public debt was estimated at 21.3 billion dollars
when 830 million dollars in outstanding payments to contractors
and hospital owners were added, The Daily Star newspaper Wednesday
quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, in assessing the performance of the national
economy in 1999, said the total budget deficit would reach 2.6
billion dollars by the end of the year compared to 2.5 billion
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government issued eurobonds twice this year, valued at more
than 1 billion dollars, to re-schedule part of the country's
external debt, less than 30 percent of Lebanon's public debt.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister George Korom has announced that the
government was seeking the issuance of another 1 billion dollars
of eurobonds next year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the GDP estimates should be dealt with
carefully as the country didn't have a professional body for
reliable research into the economy.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts and government institutions have different
forecast for the GDP growth this year, which was predicted
ranging from 2 percent to minus 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary policy of the government and the Central Bank,
the report said the Lebanese pound remained stable despite the
economic problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
It rejected any attempt to devalue the pound, warning that
this step could trigger high inflation, which currently stands at
between 1 and zero percent.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the government to cut the size of the public
sector, reform the tax systems and privatize state-owned
companies in a bid to lift the ailing economy out of the
recession.

<P>
ANKARA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The official death toll of the
November 12 quake in northwestern Turkey has risen to 749, local
reports said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Necmettin Alca, spokesman for the Bolu provincial governor,
said that a total of 4,948 people were injured in the
7.2-magnitude quake.
</P>
<P>
As snowfalls are expected in the coming days, the
quake-stricken region is in dire need of 25,000 tents to shelter
the victims who have been sleeping in the open since the temblor.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 tents have been distributed so far in the
Bolu province, which has not recovered from a 7.4-magnitude
devastating quake in August.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,300 makeshift houses have been set up and some 5,000
more are being built to cater for about 200,000 people who have
lost or left their homes. Tens of thousands of people are still
living in makeshift tents, in most cases, made of a few planks of
wood covered by a plastic sheet.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered to host 11,000 of those who left the
region and lived in guest houses and government-run summer camps
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In Duzce, another quake-hit town, 95 percent of buildings were
damaged. When all the damaged buildings are pulled down for
reconstruction, Duzce will be an empty field, said an official of

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices moved up in Tokyo
Wednesday on the back of information and telecom-related issues,
with the key Nikkei index rewriting this year's closing high.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 74.09 points, or 0.39
percent, from Monday's close to end at 18,896.21, after briefly
climbing to as high as 19,036.08, topping the crucial 19,000 line
for the first time in 27 months.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo market was closed Tuesday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 6.38 points or 0.38 percent to 1,668.
35, renewing this year's closing high for the fourth straight
trading day.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 731.14 million
shares from 587.69 million shares Monday.
</P>
<P>
Investors at home and abroad are now investing in the Tokyo
stock market, as corporate earnings in Japan have bottomed out and
the country's economy is heading for a recovery, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking following the Nikkei's surge to the 19,000 level
prevented share prices from rising further, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were higher in 11 of the 33 business sectors, with
the information and telecom sector proving the best performer,
gaining 6.19 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers were steel makers, plunging 4.22 percent as
a group, they added.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues on the First Section, losers overwhelmed gainers
859 to 391 despite the rises in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with 96
issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks Aid Access to Afghan Opposition-Held Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Wednesday
said it was discussing with Afghanistan's ruling Taliban the
possible way to provide humanitarian aid to the people in the
areas held by the Afghan opposition.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has received a "positive signal" from the Taliban on
the issue, said Ahmed S. Farah, acting coordinator for Afghanistan
of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) at a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss with the militia in detail the arrangements
for the supply of aid materials to the opposition-held areas in
northern Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Farah said the only possible route of transportation of aid
materials to the Panjsher valley, the opposition's stronghold, is
from Kabul under Taliban's control and via the Somali plains north
of Kabul, since it's too difficult to reach the valley from the
mountainous northeastern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The latest bout of fighting between the Taliban and the
opposition has displaced tens of thousands of people, some of them
having moved into the Panjsher valley to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
Farah disclosed that the U.N. has appealed for 220.7 million
U.S. dollars for humanitarian aid to the war-torn Afghanistan in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The money will be mainly used for alleviating the suffering of
the Afghan people, providing basis services, sustainable
livelihood and repatriating Afghan refugees, said a U.N. press
statement issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years of war have reduced Afghanistan to a completely
impoverished country and the Afghan people were in "a continuous
struggle for survival", Farah said.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Minister: China Welcomes Japanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China will give financial
support to medium-sized and small Japanese enterprises working
jointly with Chinese firms, especially those that make parts and
components for major products of transnational companies, Minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng
pledged today.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the ninth joint session of Chinese and
Japanese investment promotion institutions, Shi, who also serves
as president of the Sino-Japanese Investment Promotion Council (
SJIPC), stressed that long-term economic cooperation between China
and Japan has much potential because their resources and
industrial structures and technological levels complement each
other.
</P>
<P>
Japan has to date invested in 18,000 projects in China, with
actual investment of 24.43 billion U.S. dollars, topping the list
of countries investing in China. But Japanese investment in China
has slid since 1996, due to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment in China has shown signs of recovery, with
Japan's actual investment over the first three quarters this year
rising by a surprising one fourth over the same period last year,
much higher than other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of SJIPC Wang Shijia attributed this to the
significant investment increase by a group of large-scale
manufacturers like Toyota, and Japanese enterprises' keen interest
in China's service trades like finance and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Shoichiro Toyoda, president of the Japanese-Chinese Investment
Promotion Council, said that China's measures to attract foreign
investment are very welcome among Japanese entrepreneurs. He also
hoped that China will continue to improve its investment
environment.

<HEADLINE> California Prisoners Injure 11 Guards In Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An uprising by two dozen
California prisoners who refused to be strip-searched in a hunt
for weapons sent 11 guards to the hospital, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Guards discovered homemade weapons in a laundry bag Monday and
began strip-searching small groups of inmates at High Desert State
Prison, about 200 kilometers northeast of Sacramento, the capital
of California.
</P>
<P>
"The searches were to determine whether they had any contraband.
One group said it was not involved and didn't want to go through a
strip-search, and that's why one of the inmates started assaulting
a correctional officer," said state Corrections Department
spokeswoman Margot Bach.
</P>
<P>
During the melee, 12 inmates sustained minor injuries and were
treated at the prison. A total of 11 prison staff received minor
to moderate injuries -- including a concussion, a lost tooth, and
numerous bruises, cuts and abrasions. They were treated at nearby
Lassen Community Hospital and released later.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the California Correctional Peace Officers
Association said the assault was the worst on prison guards since
1995, when five inmates at Calipatria State Prison stormed an
office and stabbed five officers.
</P>
<P>
High Desert State Prison, which houses about 4,700 inmates and
is known as one of California's toughest state prisons, was under
lock down while the incident was being investigated.

<HEADLINE> China to Watch Over Charges on Mobile Telecom Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- An official from the Ministry
of Information Industry today reaffirmed that telecom companies
are not allowed to increase or decrease the prices on mobile
telecom services without authorization.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, director of the telecommunication management
administration under the ministry, announced at a tele-conference
here today that these prices are set by the state and should not
be changed by the service suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The two companies engaged in the mobile telecom business, China
Unicom and China Mobile, are both state-owned enterprises, which
take the responsibility of increasing state assets, said Zhang,
adding that the unauthorized rate changes will not only harm each
of the businesses individually but also cause losses of state
assets.
</P>
<P>
He noted that recently, some local branches of the two
companies decreased the mobile telecom prices by providing free
usage time and waived network access fees to capture more market
share.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called on the two mobile telecom operators to strictly
abide by the fees set by the state.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, branches of the two companies should report
to the headquarters before they decide to offer new business
incentives, and when considering price readjustment, the
headquarters should also report to the Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) for approval.
</P>
<P>
The two companies are also required to publicize a hotline
number for consumer complaints or for those within the industry to
report illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
To promote the telecommunication price reform, the State
Development Planning Commission and MII will jointly carry out a
review on the telecommunication fee charges across the country
from December 1 this year to February 12, 2000.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Economic Growth Revised to 8-9 Percent for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and South Korea Wednesday agreed to revise the latter's
economic growth of this year to 8-9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to set the consumer price rise under
one percent and the current-account surplus over 23 billion U.S.
dollars while maintaining low interest rate policy until next year.
</P>
<P>
The revision was made based on South Korea's improved economy,
said the Finance and Economy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, the IMF and Seoul predicted that this year's
economic growth would be at 6-7 percent, inflation at two percent
and the current-account surplus at 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF will provide 500 million dollars to South Korea as part
of its loan commitment after endorsing the revision.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides also reached an unanimity over the
forecast of 5-6 percent for next year's economic growth, three
percent rise in consumer prices and current-account surplus of 10-
15 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said both the South Korean government and the IMF
agreed that South Korean economy is not overheated as it has not
recovered to the level before the financial crisis caused by
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's economic growth registered at 12.3 percent in the
third quarter of this year, which means the nation has witnessed
its highest growth rate since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Fine-Seed Program Benefits Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's large rural population
has been benefiting from a fine-seed program the country started
nationwide some four years ago.
</P>
<P>
China had spent about 2.7 billion yuan in financing the fine-
seed program since it began in 1996, according to information from
a recent meeting on the program held in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The country now has a complete network capable of experimenting
with, producing, processing, testing, storing and transporting
fine seeds.
</P>
<P>
China has a rural population of over 800 million, and the
program is specially designed as an important method of raising
grain output and helping farmers increase their income.
</P>
<P>
According to the information, the country's state-owned seed
companies now have about two million hectares as production bases
for improved varieties of seeds, a rise of 470,000 hectares over
that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, 1,200 kinds of improved varieties of
crop seeds have been spread, and the rate of seed upgrading for
major crops is 56 percent, with fine-seed varieties used in
producing 95 percent of all major crops.
</P>
<P>
As a result, improved varieties of crop seeds now contribute 40
percent of the country's increased grain output and increased
farmer income, compared with only 30 percent in 1995, the
information said.

<P>
Sources at the ministry said the government will allocate 1.8
billion yuan to each of the two universities in the next three
years, provided that a large portion of the money is used to
increase teachers' income.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan of the two universities, all faculty
members, divided into nine categories, will get monthly allowances
ranging from 300 yuan to 5,000 yuan per month or more.
</P>
<P>
Chi Huisheng, vice president of Beijing University, said that
his school set aside 300 million yuan out of the total 1.8 billion
yuan to improve the livelihood of the teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
Not all faculty get the same allowance, however, and their pay
raises will be mainly achievement-based. Outstanding young
teachers and leading researchers are most likely to get handsome
salary hikes.
</P>
<P>
College professors in China have lived in a low-income range
for years. Some said that although most teachers in Beijing
expected their income to reach 3,500 yuan per month, their actual
monthly pay is no more than 1,300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Pei Zhaohong, director of administration of human resources at
Qinghua University, said that the teachers cannot live a well-off
life and get looked down on by some other people because of their
low income.
</P>
<P>
"So it is not surprising that they will leave the colleges,"
Pei added.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by a Beijing-based company, 30
percent of college teachers have thought of leaving their current
jobs, with the rate as high as 40 percent among the teachers under
45.
</P>
<P>
Low pay has forced increasingly more teachers to leave academia
for jobs in commercial companies or even to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
Along with Beijing and Qinghua universities, Shanghai-based
Fudan University and Shanghai Jiaotong University will get 1.2
billion yuan each in the next three years from MOE and the
municipal government of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
MOE has pledged that the actual income of college teachers and
their housing should reach the above-average level in the country
by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Environment-Friendly Tire Developed in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A new type of environment-
friendly tire has been developed in China's leading industrial
city Shanghai and will soon be put into mass production, a local
company has announced.
</P>
<P>
The tire is solid and does not require air, and because it is
made of a 100 percent recyclable new material it causes no harm to
the environment after it is worn out and discarded, said a
spokesman for the Shanghai Gaoju Rubber Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, there are now only two ways to
dispose of worn-out traditional tires: bury them or burn them, and
the ways result in serious environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
"Statistics show that each year Germany generates 600,000 tons
of old tires, while as many as 200 million tires are thrown away
each year in the United States," said the spokesman, adding that
China, which produces more than 30 million bicycles a year, is
also a major consumer of tires.
</P>
<P>
The new tire is also superior to traditional ones in terms of
strength, elasticity and resistance of wear, skids and cold, he
noted. It can also withstand punctures from hard and sharp objects,
and will never blow out.
</P>
<P>
The Gaoju company, which has spent more than 600,000 yuan (
about 75,000 US dollars) in developing the new tire, is now
applying for patent in both China and the United States, said the
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Internet Stock Mutual Funds Expand Rapidly This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Internet stock funds
are expanding rapidly in the United States as its total assets
have grown 12.5 times in the first nine months this year, a report
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the independent mutual fund
tracking service Wiesenburger, while overall mutual fund assets in
the United States grew less than 10 percent during the first three
quarters of 1999, money invested in all Internet stock mutual
funds increased by over 1,250 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of these funds has been nothing short of phenomenal
in just a few short years," Wiesenburger said. "This sector is the
envy of a mutual fund industry that has posted only sluggish
expansion on an overall basis in 1999. Internet stock mutual funds
can play a role in a well-rounded portfolio for investors who are
willing to face more risk."
</P>
<P>
Since the Internet stock mutual funds were incepted three year
ago, assets in such funds have skyrocketed, from 2.8 million U.S.
dollars at the end of 1996 to more than 4.3 billion dollars as of
September 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are 16 additional Internet stock mutual funds now in
registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
, plus the first two Internet mutual funds which were launched in
August 1996, said Wiesenburger, which has been tracking 12
Internet funds.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Vows to Continue With Pragmatic Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government will
not abandon its pragmatic economy policy, said Vice-President John
Atta Mills Tuesday while opening the 10th Consultative Group
Meeting (CG), Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to stay this course and fine-tune whatever
rough edges there are to make Ghana an object lesson in the
transparent and judicious use of inflows from development
partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first being held in Ghana, is organized by
the World Bank as a forum between government and its development
partners to discuss issues affecting the economy with a view to
working out strategies together to solve the difficulties. It
also provides the opportunity for the donor community to pledge
resources to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said they expect to raise about two billion
U.S. dollars from more than 30 international donors, including
Japan and China from Asia, the United States, Canada and about a
dozen others from Europe, over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Mills said the government's main concern is poverty reduction,
adding that it would therefore center on poverty reduction
programs during the meeting with specific relation to social
sector programs, micro finance and accelerated agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for resources "to break the current vicious cycle
of poverty, underdevelopment and marginalization" of the country.
</P>
<P>
While it is a fact that the current problems facing Ghana are
due to external forces, the government has admitted its
responsibility for solving them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He restated the government's renewed commitment to deal with
the issue of corruption, especially in public services.
</P>
<P>
The government has developed a strategy on debt relief, which
it hopes to share with its partners during the discussions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said when the cold war ended about a decade ago, Africa's
share of what had been termed the "peace dividend" was not taken
care of.
</P>
<P>
"We have been disappointed because of the invisible barriers,
including the invisible hands that have worked against the peoples
of the developing countries," he said.

<P>
MAPUTO, November 24 (Xinhua) - There are no grounds for
pessimism about Mozambique's ability to deal with the computer
problem known as the " millennium bug", Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that the government has kept close watch on moves
to deal with the problem in strategic sectors of the Mozambican
economy, and is satisfied with the progress made, local press
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thus the sensitive computerized systems of the Finance Ministry
and the Ministry of State Administration, which deal with such
matters as the wages of civil servants, are now "Year 2000
compliant". Final contingency plans are being drawn up, which will
be concluded by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
As for the banks, "the correcting and testing of systems and
contingency plans were concluded by the end of September", said
Mocumbi. "They are now monitoring the contingency plans".
</P>
<P>
Prospects for transition to the new millennium in the
telecommunications sector were "excellent", said the Prime
Minister. Here too the management systems were "Year 2000
compliant", and final contingency plans would be in place by the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The picture was much the same in civil aviation, which was at
an advanced stage of designing and testing its contingency plans.
Although some railway equipment was not yet compatible, this did
not pose any danger to the circulation of trains, said Mocumbi.
</P>
<P>
A government document summarizing the situation declared that
the institutions responsible for public services are "increasingly
confident" that nothing serious would go wrong in the transition
to the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Budget Cut Hurts Philippine Economic Pump Priming: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday the Senate's plan to cut 50 billion pesos
(1.25 billion U.S. dollars) from the proposed 651-billion-peso
(16.3 billion dollars) budget for next year will hurt economic
pump priming.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a radio program that the cut will severely
affect his administration's program to create more jobs and
generate investments to pump prime the economy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his administration decided to push through with
deficit spending next year to implement its priority programs such
as mass housing and to pour investments into public infrastructure
projects needed to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said these capital-intensive projects will also help
generate jobs and get the construction sector back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we incur a deficit we need to implement the budget
because we need to put in place our priority projects. Besides, we
need to pump prime the economy," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the mass housing program alone will have a big
"multiplier effect" not only on the construction industry, but
also on the rest of the economy because it will not only create
new jobs but generate spending and investments in related sectors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget
and Management said the reported 50-billion-peso budget slash
would derail efforts by the government to sustain economic
recovery and implement safety nets to shield the poor from the
rising prices.
</P>
<P>
He said the move may also defer the implementation of a 10
percent across-the-board salary increase for government workers
supposed to take effect in January, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The budget cut would mean further delays in the implementation
of foreign-assisted projects due to the lack of counterpart
funding for them, making government efforts to bring in new
projects of this nature more difficult, Diokno said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to start its deliberations on the 2000
budget on December 6.

LUSAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- One suspect involved in the
killing of Wezi Kaunda, son of former Zambian president Kenneth
Kaunda, was shot dead last Friday, Times of Zambia newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa as

<HEADLINE> China to Curb Rampant Piracy Along Southeast Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- In order to combat the
notorious and rampant piracy along China's southeast coast and
protect the safety of ocean shipping, the Ministry of Public
Security has convened a meeting on investigating maritime high
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release today that police
departments in related areas must step up efforts in fighting
piracy at sea.
</P>
<P>
According to international maritime organizations, armed
robberies and murders at Southeast Asian waters off China's
southeast coast this year accounted for 43 percent of the total of
such crimes around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of 1998, Chinese police forces have
solved five major cases perpetrated in China's territorial waters,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It also said in a decree that all related public security
departments in the country should strengthen cooperation with
other judiciary bodies, customs, port authorities, harbor
administrations and fishing bureaus in terms of information and
combat actions.
</P>
<P>
Police departments must form special units to handle specific
maritime crimes occurring in their jurisdiction, the decree said.

<HEADLINE> ISPs' Business Threatened by Cable High-Speed Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Demand for high-speed
Internet access via cable modems will generate billions of dollars
in additional revenues for the U.S. cable industry, according to a
report released by a technology and management consulting firm
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A cable modem is a terminal device that connect a subscriber's
PC to the Internet via the cable TV network. Cable TV operators
report that more than a million cable modems have now been
installed in U.S. users' homes. This is still a small fraction of
the over 38 million U.S. households now accessing on-line services,
said the report from Arthur D. Little, Inc. The potential demand
for high-speed Internet access via cable far exceeds cable's
current market penetration, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
The firm's recent study found that up to 28 percent of American
households are likely to subscribe to a cable Internet access
service priced at the typical level of 40 U.S. dollars per month.
These households, approximately 28 million, could generate 13.4
billion dollars in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
A high proportion of these households, 43 percent, would drop
their current dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) rather than
pay 10 dollars extra to be able to continue to use their ISP's e-
mail service. Another 21 percent of these households would pay the
extra fee, while 25 percent would postpone adoption of the cable
modem service and instead wait for their ISP to off a comparable
high-speed Internet access solution; 11 percent said they did not
yet know what they would do.
</P>
<P>
Growth in on-line music, software and video distribution will
generate even greater demand for high-speed always-on Internet
access services, the firm said. Today, most people use the
Internet to retrieve text and graphics information but the demand
for high-speed connections will grow tremendously as multimedia
Internet services become more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 1,000 adults surveyed selected cable
modems, when asked which service they would prefer for high-speed
Internet service, cable or high-speed access via telephone. Twenty-
six percent favored a telephone company offering.
</P>
<P>
Telephone-based Internet access is typically provided by a
service called asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) which,
like a cable modem, also involves a special terminal device in the
subscriber's home but uses the telephone line instead of the cable
TV network. But the version of ADSL offered at the same price
level as cable modems delivers a lower data rate -- less than one
million bits per second versus several million bits per second via
cable modems.
</P>
<P>
According to the consulting firm, in principle, ADSL service
should be competitive, as telephone companies could provide a
higher ADSL data rate for a more competitive price. However, many
telephone lines in the United States are in poor condition and
cannot support this service, and telephone companies are still
moving slowly to make ADSL available to consumers. Also, there is
a lack of a well-accepted single technical standard for ADSL.
Again, ADSL is being left out of moves by cable operators and by
the direct broadcast satellite services to integrate Internet
access with their TV set-top boxes to enhance their subscribers'
TV-viewing experience.

<HEADLINE> Himalayan Snow Cocks Successfully Raised in Captivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Tibet University
have successfully raised nine Himalayan snow cocks in captivity
and sent them to a large breeding center in Dagze County in the
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan snow cock, a rare bird under top state protection,
usually lives in cold regions 4,500 meters above sea level, and
are only found on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as "the roof of
the world."
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly some 300,000 Himalayan snow cocks living
in the wild.
</P>
<P>
To better protect the species, researchers at Tibet University
captured a number of snow cocks in the wildness three years ago
and attempted to raise them in captivity.
</P>
<P>
During the three-year experiment, researchers fed the birds
with formula fodder and successfully bred baby snow cocks through
artificial hatching.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Tibet University sent nine snow cocks they
had raised to the Tajie Breeding Center in Dagze, which is at and
above 4,000 meters, 20 kilometers from Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The nine snow cocks soon adapted themselves to the new
environment and quickly put on weight.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time snow cocks have been raised
successfully in Tibet, and this experience will set a good example
for raising more rare birds and animals in captivity, experts here
said.

<P>
According to a senior official with the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA), in the past few years, China has
received a total of 445 million U.S. dollars in donations from a
multilateral international fund for programs to protect the ozone
layer.
</P>
<P>
SEPA Director Xie Zhenhua, speaking today at the 29th
Conference of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund,
said China has achieved its target of halting the ODS output and
consumption set for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The fund was set up by developed countries from the Parties to
the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer
to help developing countries phase out ODS production and
consumption over a set period.
</P>
<P>
Despite its marked progress, China still faces numerous
difficulties and challenges in reaching its ODS substitution
targets set for 2005 and 2010, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, China needs a total of 860
million U.S. dollars for its ozone-layer protection programs.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Foreign-Backed BOT Power Project Goes Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction of south China's
Laibin Power Plant, the country's first foreign-funded power
project using the build-operate-transfer (BOT) method, has been
proceeding smoothly since it was started in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the first 360,000-kilowatt coal
burning generating unit was successfully linked to a local power
grid recently, making it possible to assure that the station will
go into commercial operation next year as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The station, built on the Hongshui River near Nanning, capital
of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was invested in by the
consortium of Electricite de France (EDF) and GEC Alsthom.
</P>
<P>
The French consortium won the contract to build the station and
is responsible for raising 616 million U.S. dollars of investment
needed for the project.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, two 360,000-kw coal-burning
generating units will be installed at the station.
</P>
<P>
The French investors, who hold 60 percent of the station's
equity, will operate the power station for 15 years after
completion, and then pass on its property rights to the regional
government of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The trial operation of the generating unit has effectively
helped alleviate power shortages in Guangxi and nearby areas, and
will eventually help advance the local economy, said one local
official.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gives Donation to China's First Aid Training Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua)-- The Japanese government has
decided to give a gift of 303 million yen to help equip a Shanghai-
based first aid training center.
</P>
<P>
Documents finalizing the deal were signed here today by China's
chief trade negotiator Long Yongtu and Japanese Ambassador to
China Sakutaro Tanino.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, the money would be used to buy
equipment for both a newly-established first aid training center
and an existing one, also in Shanghai, which have been unable to
meet the increasing demand for training emergency medical staff
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Long and Sakutaro agreed that China's vast central and western
regions, which are so far largely under-developed, need to upgrade
their first-aid medical capabilities, and thus require special
funding.
</P>
<P>
Future Japanese aid to China will concentrate on medicare,
professional training, environmental protection and agriculture,
particularly in the central and western regions and other under-
developed areas, said the Japanese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Japan donated 1.848 billion yen in 1997 to buy medical
equipment and emergency vehicles for first-aid stations in Sichuan
and Hubei provinces and Dalian City in Liaoning Province,
according to sources with the Japanese Embassy.

<HEADLINE> DNA Typing of Five Chinese Ethnic Groups Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have
finished DNA typing using the STR GeneScan among people from five
Chinese ethnic groups -- the Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan and
Uygur nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The study of the STR gene is expected to lead to a better
understanding of the structure and function of DNA.
</P>
<P>
The research was financed by the State Natural Science Fund and
carried out by a team of medical experts led by Professor Li
Shengbin of the Xi'an Medical Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Li and his colleagues began making samples and
analyzing the DNA typing of 500 people from the five ethnic groups,
100 from each group.
</P>
<P>
By gene sequencing, the researchers analyzed STR genetic
structures and have now completed the STR GeneScan analysis of
the five groups.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said their research is of great value for
establishing a STR gene data bank in China and studying and
preserving human gene resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, STR typing by GeneScan can be used to provide
scientific evidence for bio-archeology, gene diagnosis, and
individual identification, they added.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Guangdong Expect Cash Income Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in south China's
Guangdong Province are expecting a six percent growth in their
cash income this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a forecast made by the Guangdong Provincial Team
for Rural and Social Economic Investigations, local farmers' cash
income will be about 3,600 yuan this year, a rise of six percent
over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey carried out among 2,560 rural households in the
province's 31 counties shows that local farmers' per capita cash
income in the first three quarters was 2,636.39 yuan, up 5.7
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast said this hike is certain, provided no major
natural disasters occur in the province's rural areas during the
fourth quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the province levied more than 4.8
billion yuan in income taxes from January to September, up 41
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to local taxation officials, they expect to levy
about six billion yuan in income taxes this year, which will
exceed the 5.4 billion yuan quota set by the State Taxation
Administration.

About 10 percent of them said that they wanted to be astronauts
"if there is no danger," and eight percent said they would never
consider the possibility no matter how safe. The rest were not
sure what they would do.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Will Get a Boost from Fashion and Fads: Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy is likely
to enter a full-recovery stage in March next year, Beijing Daily
reported today, quoting a Shanghai economist.
</P>
<P>
The recovery will be not only the result of China's effective
economic policies, but of an increased demand in the fashion and
fad market, said Shen Hanyao, president of the Shanghai Research
Institute of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
Shen based his "audacious prediction" on the tremendous sales
increase of consumer goods during the seven-day holidays,
including two weekends, around the National Day on October 1,
the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Many department store and supermarket owners in China are
already nostalgic over the long holidays when their stores were
crowded with unprecedented numbers of shoppers.
</P>
<P>
The people in China are now getting ready for the New Year's
Day and the traditional Spring Festival holiday season in early
February new year, when they will have longer vacations and more
time to buy, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The current economic growth has been powered by the unfailing
engine of the fashion and fad industries including clothing,
cosmetology, sports and body-building, health food, cafes and bars,
tea houses, recreational tourism, new townhouses, and many kinds
of cultural consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
New fads continue to pop up, spurring the economy today, he
said, citing computers, the Internet, and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
With these new developments, China's economy is entering a new
era, he said.

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Delinquency Draws Concern of Chinese Public </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 400,000 people
visited a month-long exhibition on the prevention of juvenile
delinquency in Beijing which ended Tuesday, showing growing
public concern for the healthy growth of the country's younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, composed of more than 950 photos, 60 cases of
crimes committed by minors, and other displays was jointly
prepared by the Commission of Comprehensive Management of Public
Security under the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme Court and
other seven other central departments.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition exposed the characteristics and causes of
juvenile delinquency and the damage it causes to the minors
themselves as well as to society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Due to an unsatisfying social environment, coupled with
pornographic Japanese cartoon books easily available around
schools and other harmful materials from the Internet, China has
seen a rising crime rate among its minors.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, most of the visitors came in organized
schools groups led by school teachers and parents.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Farming Area Self-sufficient in Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- People living along three major
rivers in the Tibet Autonomous Region are now more than self-
sufficient in grain thanks to all-round agricultural development
over the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
The region provides the state with 100 million kg of commercial
grain annually in addition that consumed locally.
</P>
<P>
The middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo, Nyang Qu and Lhasa
river valleys are a densely-populated area of 65,700 sq km where
per unit output had been below 150 kg because of water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Under a decade-long development program supported by the
central government, the region has built 182 projects at a cost of
856 million yuan (103 million US dollars) including construction
of eight reservoirs, canals with a total length of 547 km, and 34
electrically pumped water wells and the improvement of 26,600 ha
of low-yielding land.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local farmers have changed their traditional
concepts of farming. More than 1.6 million technicians went down
to the countryside to help farmers raise their grain output with
the use of modern farming methods. Local farmers and herdsmen have
also opened up wasteland and planted trees and grass on formerly
barren fields.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ratio of irrigated land in the region has
risen from less than 40 percent to 60 percent, and annual grain
output has risen at an average rate of 145 million kg.
</P>
<P>
This has helped Tibet further reduce its import of grain from
other provinces from 250 million kg in 1989 to the present 15
million kg, and attain the goal set by the central government to
be self-sufficient in grain and meat by the end of this century,
said a local agricultural official.

<HEADLINE> Australians to Pay Extra Tax for Military Deployment in E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- High-income Australians will
pay for the military deployment in the newly independent nation
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The top 20 percent of tax-payers will bear a one-off increase
in the Medicare Levy to prevent the country's military commitment
in East Timor from dragging the government budget into deficit,
according to a report of the Age Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the oppositions of Labor and the Democrats have expressed
their supports to the tax rise which announced Tuesday by prime
minister John Howard.
</P>
<P>
The Medicare Levy is a special tax in Australia to contribute
to government revenue. It was introduced in 1984 by the Hawke
government.
</P>
<P>
The increased tax would not be paid by the 80 percent of
taxpayers earning less than 32,000 U.S. dollars a year. Those with
a taxable income between 32,000 and 64,000 U.S. dollars will pay
an extra 0.5 percent Medicare Levy, while taxpayers earning above
64,000 U.S. dollars will face a one percent tax rise.
</P>
<P>
It was predicted earlier that the 2000-2001 financial year
budget of the country would produce a 2.1-billion-U.S.-dollar cash
surplus.
</P>
<P>
As times change, the predicted surplus eroded, firstly by a
forced exemption of basic food from the Goods and Services Tax
System starting on July 1 next year, secondly a significant more
money pumping into the environment. Last but not least, the
military deployment in East Timor which will cost Australia 580
million U.S. dollars this year, 704 million U.S. dollars next year
and 577 million U.S. dollars in 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
The Australian-led International force in East Timor will soon
hand over to a United Nation peacekeeping force while Australia
will maintain its commitment to the newly independent nation by
providing 1,500 troops.
</P>
<P>
Howard said without the tax rise, the 2000-2001 budget would be
plunged into a 320-million-U.S.-dollar deficit.
</P>
<P>
"The government is not willing for this to occur. The days of
budget deficits should remain firmly behind us," he said, adding
that "the economic consequences of high deficits -- particularly
the pressure they place on interest rates -- should be
unacceptable."

GUANGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 58 of the world's
500 top companies are now doing business in Guangzhou, capital of
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Information from the municipal commission of foreign trade and
economic cooperation reveals that by August this year, these
companies had started 98 projects by investing 3.2 billion U.S.
dollars in the city.
</P>
<P>
These firms are from countries including Japan, the United
States, Germany, Sweden, France, Britain, and the Netherlands.
Eighty-five of the 98 projects are industrial ones specializing in
manufacture of petrochemical commodities, electronic
telecommunications equipment, automobiles and components, and iron
and steel products. The remainder are engaged in the service
industry.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the presence of leading global

Guangzhou has also held a number of investment promotion
activities, with priority given to attracting more multinational

Both suspects, Su Changhui and Wang Baolai, were former
employees of the 50-year-old victim Yu Taihua, a native of Taoyuan
City in Taiwan Province who had run a recreation center and a
restaurant in Shanghai for several years. When Su, former security
chief at Yu's restaurant, was fired by Yu last April, his close
friend Wang also voluntarily quit his job.
</P>
<P>
A police investigation found that the two suspects, faced with
financial difficulties after losing their jobs, broke into Yu's
house on the evening of October 16 and assaulted him with an iron
bar, killing him on the spot. They also attacked and seriously
wounded Bai Yuzhen, a woman who was at Yu's house at that time.
</P>
<P>
Police said that after murdering Yu, the two broke into a safe
in the house and took 8,000 yuan (about 1,000 US dollars) in cash,
a Rolex wristwatch, and telephone cards valued at some 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The two fled Shanghai after committing the crime, and the
Shanghai Public Security Bureau sent agents to eight provinces and
autonomous regions across the country to hunt them down, according
to local police.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who fled to north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, later sneaked back to Shanghai and was captured by police
there on October 23, while Su was caught in a small desert city in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on November 4
and brought back to Shanghai, said local police.
</P>
<P>
Family members of the murder victim have flown to Shanghai to
express their gratitude to the local public security bureau for
finding the suspected killers, the police source added.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Raise Interest Rate to Limit Credit Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government has
raised interest rate to curb Polish citizens' credit consumption,
local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that more and more Poles are buying new cars
with bank loans in recent years. In the first ten months of this
year, The Poles have bought as many as 530,000 new cars, an
increase of 18 percent over the same period of last year. It is
predicted that the number of the newly-purchased cars is expected
to exceed over 600,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
Most Polish borrow money from banks to pay for their car. Up
to 30 percent to 40 percent of the loans are spent on new cars.
</P>
<P>
In Poland, it is so easy to get a loan for buying a car that a
borrower can get a loan even without the need for official
verification of his income.
</P>
<P>
The amount of debt owed by the Polish has reached over 33
billion Zloties (8 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 40
percent compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Poland has raised the mortgage loan rate
and discount rate by 3.5 percent. Other banks are taking measures
to raise interest rate correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Poland is planning to raise the consumption tax on
home-made automobiles by six percent and increase the tariff on
imported autos next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars on Mogao Caves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese scholars believe
that the geographical location of the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang in
northwestern Gansu Province has played an important role in
preserving one of the world's great storehouses of Buddhist art.
</P>
<P>
The caves, carved out of the rocks, stretch for about 1,600
meters along the eastern side of Mingsha Hill, 25 km southeast of
the town of Dunhuang in the northwest desert corridor of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
"These caves show the talent and wisdom of the ancient people
in choosing a site for carving the grottoes," said Hu Xiaohong, an
associate professor with the Northwestern Institute for
Nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The caves face east and are spared the strength of the west
wind during winter. The Sanwei Mountain, which faces the caves
across the Dangquan River, is a natural shelter protecting the
caves from being damaged by wind and sand, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinyu, a researcher with the Dunhuang Research Institute,
says the location of the Mogao Caves, far away from downtown
Dunhuang, reflects the ideology of Buddhism which emphasizes the
integration of Buddha and nature.
</P>
<P>
The trees around the caves also protect the grottoes from
direct sunlight radiation.
</P>
<P>
It is generally accepted that the first of the Mogao caves,
known as the Thousand Buddha Cave, was created by a Buddhist monk
named Le Zun in the year 366.
</P>
<P>
In spite of protracted natural erosion and man-made destruction,
492 caves cut out over the course of a thousand years, throughout
the Sixteen Kingdoms, Northern Wei, Western Wei, Northern Zhou,
Sui, Tang, the Five Dynasties, Song, Western Xia, and Yuan
dynasties, are still preserved, with frescoes covering an area of
45,000 square meters, more than 2,000 colored sculptured figures,
and five wooden eaves overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang, a small 2,000-year-old town in northwestern China,
was once an important caravan stop on the Silk Road linking
Central Asia with China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- American Pete Sampras thumped
Gustavo Kuerten in straight sets to set up a tantalizing all-star
showdown with compatriot Andre Agassi at the 3.6 million U.S.
dollars ATP Tour World Championship at Hanover.
</P>
<P>
The American, 28, overcame the rusty sign from three months of
back problems to overwhelm the Brazilian 6-2, 6-3 in only 53
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had competed in only one single match since August 20,
when a string of injuries including a herniated disc in his back,
kept him out of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
While Sampras has to struggle with injuries, Agassi, dominator
of the season with two Grand Slam titles, did his part by
smothering Ecuador's season finale debutant Nicolas Lapentti 6-1,
6-2 in 69 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Under the round-robin format of the tournament with two four-
player groups, Agassi and Sampras are in the same pool and play
each other Wednesday. The winner will almost surely advance to the
semifinals. The top two finishers in each group advance.
</P>
<P>
White group leader Yevgeny Kafelnikov, world number two behind
Agassi, began his week with a 6-4, 1-6, 6-1 win ovr U.S. Open
finalist Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's other round-robin matches, Swede Thomas Enqvist
plays German hope Nicolas Kiefer and Lapentti takes on Kuerten.

BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has agreed to reopen
its land border with Thailand Wednesday after more than seven
weeks unilaterally closing it, Channel 9, a state television

<HEADLINE> 15,000-Year-Old  Remains Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 24 (Xinhua)-- Ancient remains were
discovered recently in Heliang village here in the Three Gorges
area believed to date back some 15,000 years, according to
Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
Upon learning that a local farmer found some fossils in this
village in Wushan County in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality this year, Chinese paleoanthropologists began
excavating the area and found an ancient skull, a large number of
traces of the use of fire, and more than 40 stone objects
including scrapers, choppers, and axes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, fossil remains of ancient Asian elephants,
rhinoceros, and pandas were also unearthed.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of the excavation team, Professor Huang
Wanbo from the Research Institute of Ancient Vertebrate and
Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the
Heliang site belongs to the late Paleolithic Period dating back
some 15,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges area is a cradle of ancient Chinese culture,
and among a large number of archeological discoveries, the two
million-year-old Wushan site discovered in the early 1980's has
aroused great interest from archeologists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Heliang Cultural Site has been confirmed as the most
well-preserved site ever found in this area, with all kinds of
relics of human activities along with many valuable animal fossils.
Some experts say that finding a site with such a variety of
paleoanthropological articles is rare, even for China.

<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A project aimed at protecting
babies of poor families against hepatitis B was initiated here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The China Hepatitis Prevention Fund announced that it will
donate nine million yuan (about one million U.S. dollars) worth of
anti-hepatitis B vaccines to 19 poor counties in provinces
including Shaanxi and Anhui.
</P>
<P>
This project is expected to cover over eight million babies
during the next five years and over 85 percent of new-born infants
in areas that will be vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that hepatitis B is a frequently occurring disease
in China, and some 700 million people have been affected by the
hepatitis B viruses.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the country has been promoting anti-hepatitis B
vaccination among new-borns with notable results.
</P>
<P>
Due to its relatively high cost, anti-hepatitis B vaccine has
not been introduced adequately into many poor areas. Now, the
current project is expected to drastically reduce the incidence of
hepatitis B among babies in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM Reaffirms One-China Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile reaffirmed on Tuesday the Taiwan issue is an domestic
affair of China and Romania will stick to its one-China stand.
</P>
<P>
Vasile made the statement during meeting with Chen Delai, newly-
appointed Chinese ambassador to Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian prime minister said that Romania will further
develop the traditional friendly cooperative ties with China.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the great achievements China made in 20
years since 1979 when it started carrying out the reform and
opening-up policy, saying China chose a special road suitable to
its own political, economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is not desirable for certain Western countries to stubbornly
impose their own norms on other countries in disregard of
difference in history, culture and political background, Vasile
said.
</P>
<P>
Vasile appreciated the Chinese government's long-standing
support and help to Romania.
</P>
<P>
To have a sound relationship with China is a focal point of
Romania's foreign strategy, Vasile said. Romania hopes to promote
the development of relations with China in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Chen said China also pays great attention to the
friendly and cooperative ties with Romania, promising he will do
his best to promote the ties to a new level during his term as
ambassador to Romania.

<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Gabriel Batistuta led
Fiorentina to a 2-0 home win over European champions Manchester
United as he opened the scoring and set up the other on Tuesday at
the second round of the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine gave the Italians a 1-0 lead in the 24th minute
with a clinical drive after 25 minutes following a weak backpass
from Roy Keane.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta then took the ball from defender Henning Berg and
sent a prefect pass to fellow Argentine Abel Balbo who scored from
12 meters in the 52nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina's comprehensive victory brought them three vital
points in the first match of the second phase of the competition
in group B.
</P>
<P>
Valencia was another winner in the group as they crushed
Girondins Bordeaux 3-0 at home court after Kily Gonzalez sealed
its emphatic win two minutes from time.

Francisco Farinos scored the go-ahead goal in the 60th minute
before Romanian international Adrian Ilie made it two in the 66th
minute.

<HEADLINE> Nokia to Expand Businesses in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Nokia Group will continuously
strengthen its fruitful cooperation with relevant departments and
partners in China, and expand its businesses in China in years to
come, said Nokia President Jorma Ollila here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nokia will also cement its cooperation with Shanghai, the key
industrial and commercial center in China, said Ollila when
meeting with visiting deputy mayor of Shanghai Zhou Yupeng.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he attended the '99 Fortune Forum in
Shanghai not long ago, and was deeply impressed by Shanghai's
rapid economic progress and the great changes in Pudong
Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
Nokia will seek more cooperative opportunities in Shanghai,
said Ollila, adding that Shanghai is a very important city to
Nokia.
</P>
<P>
Nokia's businesses have expanded apace in China, while the
country has enjoyed rapid development of its economy and opened
wider its door to the outside world in the past years, said Ollila,
noting that China is now the second largest market for Nokia in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He is pleased that China and the United States reached a deal
on China's entry into WTO, saying that China's accession into WTO
will not only promote China's economic development but also
benefit various countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhou briefed the president on economic
progress and investment environment in Shanghai, in particular in
the New Pudong Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
Nokia Group, the flagship of Finland, is the largest mobile
phone producer in the world. It has seven enterprises and one
research center in China. In 1998, the group's sales volume in
China hit 2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students' Dorms Under New Management: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, November 24 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to deal with the
shortage of college housing, the local education commission said
some Beijing universities may soon commercialize the development
and management of student dormitories.
</P>
<P>
The new management would take the dormitory buildings
completely out of the administrative mechanisms of the
universities and colleges and leave them for interested
enterprises, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Although the municipal government will surely increase its
financial input in education to fulfill the goal, not a single
cent will be spent in this field any more," Geng Xuechao, vice-
director of the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, told the
Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the committee vowed to double
the number of students in the Beijing-based universities and
colleges in five to six years, increasing it from today's 250,000
to a half million. But it soon found the goal out of reach because
of the obvious shortage of dormitory buildings.
</P>
<P>
"Our new dormitories will mainly be built outside the schools,"
Geng said. "And the municipal government has set aside 12 pieces
of land for this purpose."
</P>
<P>
To make this new business even more attractive, the committee
has applied for special tax waivers for the developers and
managers, China Daily said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Plaschy Wins World Cup Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Didier Plaschy of
Switzerland skied to victory by nearly a full second over Austria'
s Thomas Stangassinger in a men's World Cup slalom in Colorado,
the United States on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Plaschy paced the first run, carrying a slim lead of .11
seconds over Austria's Benjamin Raich into the second heat.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old racer then clocked the third-fastest time in
the second run of 43.94 seconds for a combined time of 1 minute 24.
69 seconds to claim his first career World Cup victory. He
previously was second in a slalom at Kitzbuhel last January.
</P>
<P>
It was the first slalom victory by a Swiss man since Paul
Accola won in 1991 in Breckenridge en route to capturing the World
Cup overall title.
</P>
<P>
Stangassinger, who won last season's World Cup slalom title,
finished in 1:25.68, namely 0.99 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Matteo Nana and Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt tied for
third in 1:25.79.
</P>
<P>
Raich lost an edge and fell onto his hip, failing to finish his
second run.
</P>
<P>
Plaschy said his victory also was vindication for a decision he
made several years ago to remain in ski racing, and about 20
residents of his tiny hometown of Varen contributed money to
support Plaschy and keep him racing on the World Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
Lasse Kjus, the defending World Cup overall champion who also
captured five medals in the world championships here, appeared to
have straddled a gate on his first run and failed to qualify among
the top 30 skiers for the second run.
</P>
<P>
A giant slalom was scheduled on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> British Government: No Need to Amend Bosman Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The British government is not
convinced that any proposed amendment to the Bosman ruling is
necessary, according to local reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
French sports minister Marie-George Buffet admitted that she
had met with some European counterparts to formulate opposition to
the Bosman ruling with a view to a wide-ranging review of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Smaller clubs would be delighted with a reform to prevent their
emerging players being poached by more established clubs.
</P>
<P>
But the British government has not been persuaded that any
reform of the ruling is required.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that the Bosman ruling is having an
adverse effect on the development of young players in this country,
" a spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said.
</P>
<P>
"The football authorities have reacted to Bosman by amending
their transfer systems and setting aside 20 million pounds for
football academies."
</P>
<P>
Smaller clubs also insist that the Bosman ruling has had a
damaging effect on them with free agency granted to players within
the European Union once their contracts had expired.
</P>
<P>
And without payment of a transfer fee, wages in the game have
spiralled.
</P>
<P>
Buffet believes that when France assumes the presidency of the
EU next June, it will make reform of Bosman and the exemption of
sport from established commercial laws its priority.
</P>
<P>
"We will work to overturn Bosman or try and minimise its
damaging effect," Buffet said.

<HEADLINE> London Marathon Denies Blood Test Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Blood testing will not be
introduced in time for next year's 20th anniversary London
Marathon, organisers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports had suggested that blood tests, which are more accurate
than existing anti-doping measures, would be mandatory for
entrants in the April race.
</P>
<P>
However organisers have confirmed there are no plans to
introduce blood testing until the International Amateur Athletic
Federation has ratified such procedures.
</P>
<P>
"The London Marathon supports moves by the Association of
International Marathons for the introduction of blood-testing,"
said race director David Bedford.
</P>
<P>
"However, we cannot suddenly do this unilaterally. To my
knowledge there is no test in place that we could possibly use for
next year's race.
</P>
<P>
"Once a test is in place, which has been ratified by the IAAF
and adopted by other big city marathons, then it will be in place
in London."
</P>
<P>
Blood testing will detect erythropoietin (EPO), a drug used to
boost the count of oxygen-carrying red blood cells which can
dramatically improve an athletes' stamina.

<HEADLINE> Burns Storms to Back-to-Back Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- English driver Richard Burns
was crowned King of Britain after powering to a crushing victory
in the British Rally on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Reading rocket slaughtered his rivals in the Welsh forests
as he won his home event for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
Burns emulated rally rival Colin McRae's back-to-back wins in
1994 and 1995 to snatch a career-best second place overall in the
world drivers' championship.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old's triumph, his second in succession and third
of the season, underlined his tag as a hot favourite for the world
title next year.
</P>
<P>
Burns piloted his smoking Subaru - literally so on Monday
following the engine fire that nearly scuppered his victory charge
- to the fastest time on 11 of the 15 forest stages.
</P>
<P>
The in-form driver, who set 12 fastest times in all, could
virtually cruise through the final seven timed tests having
inflicted the damage on Monday when he won all but two of the
eight stages.
</P>
<P>
Now based in Oxford, Burns' overnight lead of 29 seconds was
never under threat as, apart from a late puncture, he enjoyed a
trouble-free day where even the weather in the valleys was
welcoming.
</P>
<P>
Burns saw off his rivals in the forests where the rally is
decided as he continued his storming form of the second half of
the season which also brought wins in Greece and Australia to take
his career tally to five.
</P>
<P>
Marcus Gronholm's rally ended when the Finn rolled six times in
his Peugeot on the 19th stage at Rheola when lying third - over a
minute adrift - leaving no serious challengers to Burns.
</P>
<P>
Juha Kankkunen, a three time British winner, finished second
but he was not going to threaten his Subaru team-mate in the final
stages as he eventually came home just over one minute 48 seconds
adrift. Another Finn, Harri Rovanpera, was almost five minutes
behind Burns in third in his SEAT Cordoba.

<HEADLINE> BskyB Quick to Sell Man United Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- BSkyB have moved swiftly to
sell off some of their shares in Manchester United after the
Premier League rejected the club's request that the broadcasting
company retain their 11.1 per cent shareholding at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
The League insisted that BSkyB, who also have a 9.9 percent
stake in Leeds and have agreed to buy 9.9 percent in Manchester
City, should reduce their stake in the Old Trafford club to below
the required 10 percent as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
And United issued a statement after the stock market closed
stating that BSkyB had sold 2.9 million shares, taking their
ownership down to 9.99 percent, which is the maximum allowed.
United's shares were worth around 2 pounds each at the close of
the market.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB failed earlier this year in their attempts to buy the Old
Trafford club after the deal was blocked by the Department of
Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision by the Premier League followed a call from a
group of United shareholders to stop BSkyB buying stakes in
different clubs at the Treble winners' AGM last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Oliver Houston, spokesman for Shareholders United, urged
further co-operation between football authorities and the
Government over BSkyB's shareholding in clubs.
</P>
<P>
Houston said: "The 9.9 percent figure is a red herring. FA and
Premier League rules state that this threshold is for investment
purposes only.
</P>
<P>
"Given BSkyB's strategic holding in Leeds and Manchester City,
no one can seriously suggest that BSkyB's stake in Manchester
United is anything other than an attempt to gain a strategic
footing in the negotiation of TV rights.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the FA to work with the Department of Culture, Media
and Sport and the Office of Fair Trading to ensure a wholesale
approach to this problem."

<HEADLINE> 76ers Guard Iverson out 3-6 Weeks with Fractured Thumb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philadelphia 76ers said
today their star shooting guard Allen Iverson will be sidelined
three to six weeks with a fractured thumb on his shooting hand.
</P>
<P>
Iverson, the NBA's premier scorer, suffered the injury in
Philadelphia's 94-91 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night.
An X-ray taken today revealed the fracture.
</P>
<P>
The Sixers have been without starting center Matt Geiger, who
underwent arthroscopic surgery during the preseason, and key
players Theo Ratliff and Tyrone Hill also have missed games due to
injuries.
</P>
<P>
But playing without Iverson for an extended period of time
could be devastating to the 76ers, who are in fifth place in the
Atlantic Division at 5-7.
</P>
<P>
The electric shooting guard leads the NBA in scoring at 30.8
points per game and is also averaging 5.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists.
He scored a season-high 46 points in a loss at Orlando on November
10. Last Saturday, Iverson lit up the New Jersey Nets for 37
points and finished with 35 in Monday's loss to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Without their scoring machine, the Sixers will likely use Aaron
McKie and Larry Hughes at shooting guard in Iverson's absence.
</P>
<P>
The first pick in the 1996 draft, Iverson, 24, captured the
scoring title with a 26.8 average in the strike-shortened 1998-99
season and earned First-Time All-NBA honors. Iverson also ranked
among the league leaders in minutes and steals (110) and led the
Sixers to their first postseason appearance in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Iverson led the Sixers in scoring in each of his first three
seasons and only missed a total of 10 games due to injuries.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China has set up 180 reform
centers nationwide to house some 40,000 people a year involved in
prostitution and pornographic activities.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhenjiu, a senior official with the Ministry of Public
Security, said at a national meeting on anti-prostitution in
Chongqing in the southwest China's Sichuan Province, that
reforming and re-educating those people is important in China's
campaign against prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai in 1984 set up China's first reform center for
prostitutes and clients who frequent brothels. By the end of last
year, China's anti-prostitution reform centers had taken in more
than 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The reform centers have held a series of training classes for
those engaged in the prostitution trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
"It is realistic. If there is a will, there is a way," he told
Sky Television when he was asked about the timetable in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"We have a major responsibility and we have to live up to the
challenge. It is up to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that the situation in the region would be
disastrous unless peace is made.
</P>
<P>
"If we are failing to do it, the alternative is being dragged
into a new round of violence. We might be thrown 15 years
backwards and we will have to dig many new graves in the Middle
East on all sides before human beings like us will sit down to
solve exactly the same problems," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who arrived here Tuesday morning for talks with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, said the opportunity had to be seized
now.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Syria, Barak said he would hold talks with
that neighboring country "if the Syrians are ready."
</P>
<P>
"We will be there. The differences, I believe, are microscopic
and it needs courage to make the peace of the brave," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also praised Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"I believe both of them are strong. I believe they are
historical figures. Only such historical figures can take the
responsibility and have the political and moral authority to make
the painful decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we wait too long, we will have successors spending some
years consolidating their power.... It might end up with a
generation of waiting and negotiating," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he told reporters that he expected a dispute with
Palestinians over a delayed West Bank land handover to be resolved
within days.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the present (transfer), the one that should be
ended on 15 November, I believe will be ended in a few days,"
Barak said after his talks with Blair.

<HEADLINE> Further Rise in Oil Prices Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexican financial analysts
Tuesday predicted further rises in international petroleum prices
if the producers extend their agreement to cut world-wide crude
oil production.
</P>
<P>
The increase in petroleum prices will consolidate if the demand
for crude oil is higher than expected during the winter months in
the northern hemisphere, said experts from the Serfin stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Crude prices have now reached a historical record, taking the
Mexican basket to 23 dollars per barrel last week, thereby
strengthening the Mexican economy.
</P>
<P>
In London, the price of Brent crude oil in December will be
fixed at 25.55 dollars per barrel on Tuesday for future contracts,
in comparison with 25.75 at the close of trading on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the Inbursa Financial Group, Serfin and BBV-
Probursa said that the prolonging of the agreement to reduce
production until June will strengthen prices.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to the hike in crude oil prices are
the fall in present crude oil inventories to 2.49 million barrels,
the closing of a refinery in Puerto Rica due to the effects of
hurricane Lenny, and the suspension in Iraq of the food for
petroleum program.
</P>
<P>
Last year, crude oil prices fell to an all-time low, but then
regained ground due to the output cut of 2.1 million barrels per
day agreed by producers since April.

of 517.34 points from the 14 record closing high in the previous
17 sessions.
</P>
<P>
The market moved down as investors sold shares to take profits
two days ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Most oil companies
slipped back and big losses from a handful of tech companies
dragged the Nasdaq index lower.

<P>
The market gave no response to a report on less orders for
durable goods. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that
orders for the goods declined by 1.3 percent in October, showing a

<HEADLINE> EU Study Shows Rosy Picture Over WTO Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The study said further trade liberalization could bring about
an annual welfare gain for the world of up to 400 billion U.S.
dollars. This is equal to adding an economy the size of the
Republic of Korea or the Netherlands to the world gross domestic
product (GDP) each year, said the commission, the European Union (
EU)'s executive body.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore around twice as much as the most recent
estimate, conducted by the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), of the impact of full implementation of
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (
GATT), the predecessor of the WTO, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
To take into account the changing nature of the world economy,
the study goes beyond "traditional" market access issues and also
looks at the impact of WTO agreements in the areas of trade
facilitation, competition and investment.
</P>
<P>
The study suggests that agreements in these areas could
generate substantial benefits. For example, a WTO agreement on
competition could generate an annual welfare gain of around 85
billion U.S. dollars. Conservative estimates point to a potential
annual windfall of 75 billion U.S. dollars from a WTO agreement on
investment.
</P>
<P>
The EU study also indicates that all regions could emerge as
beneficiaries from a new trade round. It highlights the role of
further trade liberalization in raising the long-term growth
prospects of developing countries, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Web Survey Finds Differences Between Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
reported Tuesday that the world's largest Web survey it conducted
shows diverse adoption patterns despite the fact that Web usage
and Internet commerce have exploded across all geographies,
cultures and walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The survey, Project Atlas, was conducted in 13 major languages
in cooperation with some of the Web's top portals. More than 28,
000 responses were received from more than 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
"What was unexpected were the differences between individual
countries," said IDC, describing the key findings from the project.
For example, a higher percentage of respondents access the
Internet from schools in Mexico than in Japan, a country renowned
for its advanced education.
</P>
<P>
The average number of home devices that access the Web is about
1.5, but the distribution of multiple-device households is not
even, according to the survey. For example, 26 percent of Japanese
advanced users have over three Internet devices in their
households versus 13 percent in the United States and 7 percent in
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Average monthly Internet access fees vary dramatically by
country, from 78 U.S. dollars per month in Argentina to 18 U.S.
dollars a month in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Purchasing of goods and services over the Web from home is
surprisingly widespread among the users polled, IDC said. Even in
less-developed countries, like India and China, more than 25
percent had made purchases from home. The average amount spent
over the Web ranged from under 35 U.S. dollars in Denmark, Spain
and China to over 70 dollars in the United States, Argentina and

<HEADLINE> Greece: Time Ripe For Resolving Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that the division of
the island republic was the shame of Europe and the settlement of
the Cyprus problem should be sought within the context of U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
While describing Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash as the
negative factor in the efforts for a resolution to the issue,
Reppas said that anyone who could influence Denktash should do it
now.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.N.-sponsored talks between Denktash and Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides in New York next month, the spokesman
stressed that the talks should be substantive as determined by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the New York talks, Clerides met Monday with
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis to coordinate their policies.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said in a joint statement after talks that the
December 3 talks must be based on the relevant U.N. decisions and
carried out according to the G-8 appeal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Consular to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
seeking a visit to Iran by sending a consular and other officials
to Tehran, the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have long wanted U.S. consular officials to visit Iran to
look into facilitating the issuance of visas for Iranians to
travel to the United States and the assistance of American
citizens wishing to travel to Iran," State Department spokesman
James Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called it "high time" for Iran to allow such
visits, given that Iranian officials are routinely permitted to
come to the United States to visit private American citizens.
</P>
<P>
But Iran rejected the proposal when Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday the underlying motive of
Washington sending consular officials was to "set up an
intelligence and political site in the center of Tehran" and"
forge ties with their mercenaries."
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is resisting American pressure for the right to"
base U.S. officials in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran during
the occupation of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by students after the
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss embassy in Tehran looks after U.S. interests, without
permanent U.S. personnel or visiting U.S. staff.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Christmas Retail Sales Expected to Exceed 50 Bln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is about the same as they did last year, but according to
the Conference Board, because of a rise in the number of
households, consumers will push retail sales over 50 billion
dollars, an improvement of about 1.5 percent from last season.
</P>
<P>
Covering a representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households, the
Conference Board's survey found that about 36 percent of all
households plan to spend 500 dollars or more on Christmas gifts,
with more than half spending in excess of 750 dollars.
Approximately 17 percent of consumers plan to shop online.
</P>
<P>
"This year's rise in Christmas spending reflects the current
healthy economy," the Conference Board said. "Consumer confidence
levels remain strong, inflationary pressures are still subdued,
and wages have improved during the year."

<HEADLINE> Greece Not Yet Decided to Support Turkey's EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece had not yet decided
whether to support Turkey's European Union (EU) orientation or not
at the December Helsinki summit, Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that this would depend on the
positions and commitments which the EU would undertake on the way
in which the recognition of the Turkish candidacy would be linked
with the consolidation of Greek interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that
the likelihood of Greece approving or rejecting Turkey's EU
candidacy bid was "50-50."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 25 years over their territorial disputes
and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has opposed Turkey's EU accession, saying that Ankara
cannot join the EU unless it improves its human rights record and
its strained relations with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Greece, which is trying hard to improve its relations
with Turkey, has repeatedly said that it favors Turkey's accession
to the EU, but the neighboring country must make some goodwill
gestures toward Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. agencies said
Tuesday global AIDS deaths have reached a record 2.6 million this
year and HIV infections continued unabated, with some 5.6 million
adults and children becoming infected in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, 50 million
individuals worldwide have been infected with HIV, the virus
leading to AIDS. Among them more than 33 million are still alive
and over 16 million have died.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by the Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organizations (WHO) in a
report in advance of World AIDS Day which falls on December 1.
</P>
<P>
The report said HIV-positive women in Africa now outnumber
infected men by 2 million while countries of former Soviet Union
have seen infection rates double between 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
HIV infections are expected to rise annually in the coming
years, fueled by growing use of injected drugs, the U.N. agencies
warned.
