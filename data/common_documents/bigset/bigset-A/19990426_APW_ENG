	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks were mixed today, after a two-day  
rally, despite hopes that the government may come up with new 
economic stimulus steps ahead of a Japan-U.S. summit next week. The 
dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.86 yen in late afternoon, down 0.72 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
119.41 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.74 points,  
or 0.03 percent, to close at 16,918.51. Before today's close, the 
Nikkei had gained some 428 points in the previous two trading days, 
including Friday's 257.37-point, or 1.54 percent, gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes that the government will come up with more measures to  
boost the weak economy pushed the Nikkei to as high as 17,143.49 
points at one point earlier in the day. It was the first time since 
April 9 that the Nikkei moved above the 17,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders expect finance ministers and central bankers of the  
Group of Seven industrialized nations to pressure Japan to work 
harder to get its economy back on track at their meeting in 
Washington later today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were hopes that the government will be pressured to come  
up with additional stimulus measures,'' said Muneyuki Ichihara, 
general manager of investment information at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also hopes that Japan may come up with new measures  
ahead of a summit meeting between Obuchi and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, set for May 3 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies are still struggling to recover from the  
nation's worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also attributed the afternoon decline to profit-taking  
after heady gains the last two days. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy,  
Britain, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's first section was estimated at 562  
million shares, compared with 578 million shares on Friday. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 745 to 444, with 129 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 8.37 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,343.84. The 
TOPIX closed up 21.03 points, or 1.60 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar drifted lower on selling from  
foreign investors trying to reduce long, or overbought, dollar 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, they didn't expect the market to move  
much ahead of the G-7 meeting and scheduled discussions between 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Robert Rubin, the U.S. 
treasury secretary, in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded in a range between 118.67 yen and 119.37 yen  
in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.17 yen, down  
from 127.28 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the newly selected benchmark No. 212 10-year  
Japanese government bond fell to 1.490 percent from Friday's finish 
of 1.535 percent, driving its price up to 102.71 yen from 102.31 
yen.

<HEADLINE> NBA Fines Wallace, Best for Fouls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Toronto's John Wallace was fined $5,000 and  
Indiana's Travis Best was fined $3,000 by the NBA on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace committed a flagrant foul against Detroit's Grant Hill  
with 9:58 left in Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, who escaped a suspension, was ejected after he took  
down Hill with a forearm on a drive to the basket. Hill got up 
quickly and charged Wallace before being restrained by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sick of people trying to hurt (Hill),'' said Detroit coach  
Alvin Gentry in the Toronto Sun. ``I don't mind hard fouls but I 
think there's a difference between a hard foul and trying to hurt 
someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best was fined for a flagrant foul on New Jersey's Jamie Feick  
during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game.

<HEADLINE> Skins Owner May Keep Turner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businessman Daniel Snyder plans to retain  
Coach Norv Turner and General Manager Charley Casserly for at least 
the 1999 season if he is approved as the new owner of the 
Washington Redskins, The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing sources close to Snyder, the paper reported in Monday's  
editions that trustees for the estate of late Redskins owner Jack 
Kent Cooke completed an agreement over the weekend to sell the team 
and Jack Kent Cook Stadium to a group headed by Snyder for $800 
million and that an announcement was planned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If at least 24 of the 31 National Football League team owners  
vote to approve the sale, it would be a record price for a U.S. 
professional sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be no reason to rush into anything,'' the Post  
quoted one person close to Snyder as saying. ``Dan hasn't even met 
them. There wouldn't be any quick changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said Snyder and his associates are trying to avoid the  
impression they are attempting to run the team before they have 
been approved as its new owners, but that they also know NFL 
officials would like to see them maintain continuity in the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was part of a group headed by New York banker Howard  
Milstein that agreed to buy the team and stadium for $800 million 
in an offer that ultimately was withdrawn after it because clear 
Milstein would not win league approval for the sale.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Group Launches Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Newspapers must develop aggressive advertising  
campaigns to attract new readers and stop current readers from 
switching to other media sources for their news, the Newspaper 
Association of America said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The association announced its intent to help newspapers improve  
readership with an $11.5 million marketing plan headed by Coca-Cola 
Co.'s former marketing czar, Sergio Zyman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continually know that we, in one way, have a very high  
calling,'' said association chairman Richard Gottlieb. ``In another 
... we need to become better marketers and understand our customers 
better. There are a whole lot of marketers who want to take our 
readers away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The association, a nonprofit organization representing the  
country's $54 billion newspaper industry, announced the five-year 
marketing plan at its annual conference here. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the goals of the Readership Initiative campaign is to find  
ways to stop readers from defecting to other media and make 
newspapers a part of every advertiser's media plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyman was chosen to head the initiative to inject some  
excitement into what have traditionally been drab newspaper 
campaigns to lure readers, Gottlieb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the heaviest hitters in the industry of  
marketing,'' said Gottlieb, president and CEO of Davenport, 
Iowa-based Lee Enterprises Inc., which owns newspapers and 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyman, who stepped down at Coca-Cola last year, oversaw the  
successful debut of Diet Coke and the unfavorable launch of New 
Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	He will direct research on what attracts or repels readers, and  
design a campaign that can be used by newspapers nationwide, said 
N. Christian Anderson III, president of the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors and publisher and CEO of The Orange County 
Register in Santa Ana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously the highest priority, to find better ways of  
reaching readers,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many newspapers are doing well financially, but the bottom line  
is that readership is declining at too many publications, said John 
Sturm, association president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily newspaper readership in the top 50 markets in the United  
States is 58 percent of the adult population, according to the 
association. Readership is about 10 percent higher on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyman declined to disclose details of the marketing plan but  
said he expects to devote the first two years to developing a 
marketing strategy that emphasizes the value of newspapers to 
readers and newspapers, and to creating a readership project at 
Northwestern University.

<HEADLINE> Report: Boeing Plans New Jumbo Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. is considering a new family of 450- to  
550-seat jetliners, according to confidential company documents 
obtained by a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology reported in its Monday edition  
that while ``Boeing is working closely with key suppliers on the 
design,'' development of the aircraft is far from certain. If 
approved, the earliest the plane could enter airline service would 
be 2006, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokeswoman Mary Jean Olsen declined to comment in detail  
about the proposal, except to say it was among many preliminary 
designs that have emerged over years of studying possible larger 
aircraft lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very disappointed that confidential Boeing documents  
leaked outside the company,'' she said, adding that the proposal is 
``something we consider a low-level-effort, product-development 
study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation Week noted that ``go-ahead for the new aircraft is by  
no means certain,'' and that Boeing is also working on new 
variations of the 747 that would be cheaper and quicker to get to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing rival Airbus Industrie has long sought to build the A3XX,  
a double-deck aircraft that would carry 550 passengers or more. 
Boeing has said that if Airbus does decide to build the plane -- and 
if enough airlines actually want such an aircraft -- it would 
respond with a plane larger than its 420-passenger 747-400. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing maintains, however, that it's unlikely sufficient demand  
will emerge soon for such a huge aircraft, which company executives 
believe could be used on relatively few routes. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary market would be long-distance, high-capacity routes  
over the Pacific and in Asia. Economic conditions in Asia have 
caused orders for 747s to dry up over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Boeing engineers dropped the idea of a sweeping  
overhaul of the 747, which Boeing determined would cost more than 
$12 billion to develop. The company has continued to study more 
modest derivatives of the 747 and its newer jumbo jet, the 777. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Ozimek, Boeing director of product development, said last  
fall that developing a 747 that could carry 70 to 100 more 
passengers would cost between $2 billion and $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation Week said the ``concept aircraft'' described in the  
documents is designated the 763-246C. The plane, which apparently 
would have four 777-type engines, would seat 454 passengers in 
three classes and 547 in the stretched aircraft, the magazine said. 
All would be seated on one deck, though there would be the option 
of adding up to 82 sleeper berths in the space above the first- and 
business-class seating.

<HEADLINE> Intel CEO Advises Asia on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Countries in the Asian Pacific region risk  
being left behind by the world economy unless they radically 
improve their infrastructure for access to the Internet, Craig 
Barrett, president and CEO of computer chip maker Intel Corp., said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet access in most parts of Asia is still seriously  
restricted by a lack of bandwidth -- a measure of how much data can 
be stuffed through the wires and cables of the country's 
telecommunications networks, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet access is going to be very important for every  
economy to allow it to grow and prosper,'' said Barrett. ``Right 
now, any country that wants to be an economic hub has to have 
bandwidth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many countries, the relatively high cost of Internet access  
keeps users away and limits the potential of the Internet to play a 
major role in the economy, Barrett said in a speech to students at 
National Taiwan University, the island's top school. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett, who is touring the region to promote Internet use,  
cited Intel's experience with e-commerce, or conducting business 
over the Internet, as an example of the potential inherent in the 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel began doing business over the Internet with some of its  
largest customers last summer. This year it expects that half of 
total revenue will come over the Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has made increasing bandwidth a priority for continued  
expansion of its core business -- the semiconductors that make 
computers work -- because the Internet is replacing actual computers 
as the engine of growth in the industry, Barrett said. In the 
United States Intel is part of a consortium developing a system 
that will increase the speed of Internet service by 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett praised Taiwan's computer design and manufacturing  
business but said the island's computer industry needs to move up 
the next rung of technology to develop workstations and servers 
that are the backbone of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, Intel's purchases of semiconductor, peripheral, and  
personal computer-related components from Taiwan manufacturers 
increased 200 percent to U.S. dlrs 400 million. Intel is based in 
Santa Clara, California.

<HEADLINE> Teens Charged in Texas Bomb Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBERLEY, Texas (AP) -- Police arrested five teen-age boys on  
charges they plotted a bomb attack on their junior high school 
after gunpowder, crude explosive devices and bomb-making 
information were found in several of their homes 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the boys remain in custody today, and authorities said  
they were weighing charging them as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Don Montague said that the boys, all 14, began planning  
the attack in January. Last week's school shooting in Littleton, 
Colo, may have spurred acquaintances of the teens to tell school 
officials what they overheard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teens arrested gave statements to police, and more students  
could be implicated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the statements given, it is clear that these young  
men were serious about targeting fellow students and teachers,'' 
Montague said. ``There would have been people hurt. There could 
have been people killed'' if they were successful, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Gov. George W. Bush came to a gathering of 900 people  
at the school and urged parents to teach their children to value 
life. He also applauded officials' prompt response. ``When it comes 
to the lives of our children, every threat must be taken 
seriously,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five eighth-grade boys were arrested Friday on juvenile  
charges of conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit arson 
and conspiracy to manufacture explosives, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	A search of the school turned up nothing out of the ordinary,  
said authorities in this town of 3,000 people about 40 miles 
southwest of Austin.

<HEADLINE> Deal Exchange Provides Fast Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Jeffrey Maas had a company to sell:  
a maker of fiber optics and copper cable manufacturer used for 
Internet and telephone connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment banker David Teed was looking to buy, representing a  
textile manufacturer that wants to grow through acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	So last Thursday, Maas and Teed came to the Deal Exchange, an  
annual event where buyers and sellers hear a pitch a minute on 
deals that range from modem manufacturing in Kazakstan to peat moss 
production in the American Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by the Association for Corporate Growth, the Deal  
Exchange comes down to one person standing in front of hundreds, 
with 60 seconds to describe the company they want to buy or sell. 
They leave the podium hoping the right person heard the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Held as part of the association's annual conference, the  
exchange attracted nearly 400 people to this desert town about 100 
miles east of Los Angeles, providing a glimpse into the merger and 
acquisition fever that grips the world of small and mid-sized 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a useful forum,'' said Teed, a principal in a Quebec  
investment firm. He was making his third appearance at the 
exchange, where like many, he's received useful leads but never 
closed a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this business,'' he said, ``you have to kiss a lot of  
frogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others have better luck. Within an hour of making his  
presentation, Maas was approached by three people interested in 
buying the company he represented. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, a record 1,974 corporate mergers were logged, with a  
combined value of nearly $358 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But for every megamerger where billions traded hands, nine deals  
took place among smaller firms like those who come to the Deal 
Exchange, according to Mergerstat, a division of the Los Angeles 
investment bank Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin. 
</P>
<P>
	Most mergers are arranged quietly through brokers and investment  
bankers who rely on extensive electronic databases and personal 
contacts to locate the right buyer or seller. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, buyout specialist Paul Stewart used the Deal Exchange  
to help his Milwaukee-based Xymox Technologies buy a smaller New 
Jersey company that also manufactured electronics products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked for me,'' said Stewart, who came back this year.  
``It brings the deal to their attention. From my standpoint, that's 
all you can hope for.''

<HEADLINE> Stars Shine in Third Period / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- A funny thing has happened to the  
thirty-something Dallas Stars in the NHL playoffs. They've become a 
strong third-period team. 
</P>
<P>
	``For whatever reason, everything's reversed (from the regular  
season),'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Monday. ``(In this 
series) we've started a little bit slower than we wanted to but we 
finish stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars are one win away from a sweep of the Edmonton Oilers  
in their best-of-7 Western Conference quarterfinal. Game 4 is 
Tuesday night at Skyreach Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers have thrown everything at Dallas in the first three  
games, pounding the team's roster of veterans -- 14 of whom are over 
30 -- in the hopes the older guys would wilt in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so. Dallas has come up big every time. In Game 1 they were  
down 1-0 going into the third period but it was 39-year-old forward 
Guy Carbonneau who scored to cap a 2-1 comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2, after the Oilers tied the game midway through the  
third period, Dallas rallied for two goals in a 3-2 win. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Sunday night, trailing 2-0 with 14 minutes to play, they  
struck for three goals, a 3-2 victory and a 3-0 series lead. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a far cry from the regular season. Despite 51 wins and  
114 points, the Stars were 1-14-2 when trailing after two periods. 
On five occasions they lost third-period leads and had to settle 
for ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said the difference is the Stars are playing with  
confidence and stars like Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk are 
stepping up. Both scored Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull said this year's Stars have the Oilers from two years  
ago to thank for some of their late-game poise. That spring, the 
heavily favored Stars were knocked out in seven games by the 
upstart Oilers and Dallas has not looked past an underdog since. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience the core group has gone through in the last  
three years will be a big, big help,'' Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers, meanwhile, say they aren't looking past anything  
except the next shift if they want to avoid a sweep. If they lose 
Game 4, it would be the first time since 1979-80 -- the team's first 
season in the NHL -- that they have exited the postseason without a 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has the heart and character to come back and make a  
series of it. We know we've dug ourselves a huge hole and it's 
going to take everybody in here to get out of it,'' captain Kelly 
Buchberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Marty McSorley said they must fight through a Dallas  
defense that has even top scorers like Modano thinking about 
plus-minus statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modano is coming back to get the puck. He's not standing at  
the red line waiting for it,'' McSorley said. ``He's working hard 
defensively and they're doing that all through their lineup. 
Everyone of their guys is committed -- but so are we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers have lost their top defenseman, Roman Hamrlik, for  
two weeks with a strained knee. Center Josef Beranek is day to day 
with a pulled stomach muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Stars' injured list, Carbonneau is out 10 days with a  
sprained knee and defenseman Richard Matvichuk is day to day with a 
pulled groin.

	Cops Describe Colo. Gunmen's Diary  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who killed 13 people  
and themselves at Columbine High School dreamed of an even bigger 
bloodbath, plotting to kill hundreds of neighbors, then hijack a 
plane and crash it into New York City, investigators said today. 
Authorities also questioned an 18-year-old girlfriend of Eric 
Harris about whether she bought two of the guns used in the 
rampage. Meanwhile, funerals were held for four victims of the 
attack.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose new gun-control  
measures tomorrow, counting on outrage over the Colorado school 
shooting to push the bill through Congress. ``Unfortunately, 
oftentimes it takes tragic events to catalyze work here in 
Washington,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said today. 
Clinton's new omnibus crime package will propose mandatory 
child-safety locks on all guns sold, a lifetime ban on gun 
ownership for people who commit violent crimes as juveniles and 
criminal liability for adults, including parents, who allow 
children access to guns.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The AIDS virus might be able to hide undetected  
for 60 years in people taking powerful anti-viral drugs, says a 
study that underlines a major obstacle to the bold notion of curing 
AIDS. While the drugs can drive the body's supply of HIV down to 
undetectable levels, they can't attack virus that lies quietly in 
cells. Such hidden ``reservoirs'' of HIV have long been recognized, 
and these new calculations confirm the belief that they could 
harbor the virus for a very long time.

<HEADLINE> Diaper Gel Proves Fire-Resistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- A soggy, stinking baby diaper is helping  
save everything from homes to utility poles from wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire-resistant gel -- developed by a firefighter who noticed a  
disposable diaper was the only thing that survived uncharred in a 
house fire -- is being touted by experts and businesses as the 
greatest invention in firefighting since the hose and pump. 
</P>
<P>
	Barricade gel is made from the same super-absorbent polymers  
found in baby diapers. They act as tiny, mega-absorbent sponges 
that can hold off flames for up to 30 hours and even put out a 
fire, says John Bartlett, founder of Barricade International and a 
Palm Beach County firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not just blowing smoke. Already the gel is being used  
by the Los Angeles fire department, the U.S. military and Florida 
Power &AMP; Light Co., one of the nation's largest utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The gel -- which looks like shaving cream and can be applied with  
a hose -- was credited with saving several homes during last year's 
blazes in Flagler County and recent wildfires in Port St. Lucie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impressive stuff,'' says Bill Kramer, a professor of fire  
science at the University of Cincinnati and fire chief of Deerfield 
Township, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a lot of new products,'' he adds, launching into a  
litany of foams and other items. ``This is the only one that gives 
the fire chief a quantum leap to put lasting protection on a 
burning structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gel can be washed off after the fire threat is gone.  
</P>
<P>
	And it all began with a diaper.  
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett, 45, says he was rummaging through charred trash from a  
house fire when he happened on something slimy and white. It was 
the diaper, the only thing that hadn't burned in a huge pile of 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, he talked to a chemist and began experimenting.  
</P>
<P>
	He soon realized a powder wouldn't stick like a gel or a foam.  
He set up shop with his father, Bill, himself a retired 
firefighter, and fellow firefighter Bruce Hill. They worked in a 
cramped garage without air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	After five years, countless planks of plywood burned in the back  
yard and 60 formulations, they believe they've got it. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has developed a $189 home protection kit that  
includes an attachment for garden hoses. There is also a 
``Ghostbusters''-style backpack that allows firefighters to carry 
the gel with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is cultivating corporate and government customers  
and hopes to market to homeowners and the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Barricade was credited with saving homes in  
Port St. Lucie. FPL publicly praised the invention, saying it saved 
about 100 utility poles. Then the phones began to ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Strangers pulled into the Bartletts' driveway looking for gel.  
They sold 500 one-gallon jugs at $35 each in the past 10 days, Bill 
Bartlett said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Dennison of FPL says the utility has bought hundreds of  
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can put it on metal, you can put it on wood, you can put  
it on grass around a transformer,'' Dennison says. ``It's a proven 
product for us, and I think we're going to do real well with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett is still with the Fire Department. The county is now  
considering using his invention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love fire department jobs, I love my job here as a  
firefighter,'' he says. ``This is probably the most important work 
I can do in the future as a firefighter -- letting the fire service 
know this new technology is out there.''

<HEADLINE> Buffalo Eyes Sweep of Senators / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Ottawa coach Jacques Martin is unhappy with  
the play of the Senators and star Alexei Yashin in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-scoring Yashin has been held scoreless and the  
second-seeded Senators have fallen behind Buffalo and goaltender 
Dominik Hasek 3-0 in the best-of-7 Eastern Conference quarterfinal 
series. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I'd be lying if I said I'm not disappointed,'' Martin  
said Monday when asked about the suddenly inept Senators and their 
curiously ineffective captain, Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I feel strongly in my team, and I still think we can win  
this,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin denied the Sabres had driven him to frustration.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking for points or goals,'' he said. ``Whatever  
goals I scored during the regular season, it's all team goals. 
We're not looking for my goals; we're looking to win the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin scored 44 goals during the regular season, but he's been  
shackled by the Sabres and Michael Peca in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin was beaten by Peca in Buffalo's 3-0 win Sunday when the  
Sabres captain passed from behind the net to Dixon Ward for the 
first goal. Yashin also committed two roughing penalties after 
letting Buffalo's Vaclav Varada get under his skin in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca, who is sporting a shiner around one eye, has one goal and  
three assists. 
</P>
<P>
	As ineffective as Yashin has been, the Sabres will keep him  
paying attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's their marquee player and the key to their team,'' said  
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, whose team shut down Eric Lindros and 
Philadelphia in the first round last year on the way to the 
conference finals. ``You have to take care of players like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres swept Montreal in last year's playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing better than we did against Montreal,'' Ward  
said. ``At least two of those games Dom stole for us. He did the 
same thing in Game 1 here, but in the last two we've played much 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek made 40 saves to lift the Sabres to a series-opening 2-1  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was huge,'' Sabres defenseman Jay McKee said. ``If we  
don't steal that first game the second is definitely a must win and 
anything could have happened from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Senators were impressed with Hasek.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been unbelievable,'' Ottawa's Shawn McEachern said. ``The  
first game especially. But this past game, I don't think he was a 
factor because we played so poorly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I was a bit surprised,'' said Hasek, who has allowed  
just three goals on 119 shots in the three playoff games. ``I did 
not expect it to be 3-0 after three games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hasek was cautious.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is over,'' he said. ``We have to win one more.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa finished 12 points ahead of Buffalo during the regular  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have to win one,'' Yashin said. ``We still have a  
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' leading scorer, Miroslav Satan, bruised his foot  
when he was hit by a teammate's shot Sunday and is listed as 
day-to-day. He did not practice Monday and might not play Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Sun To Unveil Connection Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sun Microsystems Inc. plans to unveil software  
it says will allow workers outside the office to connect more 
easily to a corporate computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palo Alto, Calif.-based computer maker says the program,  
called i-Planet, will enable traveling workers to connect to a 
corporate network through a Web browser using any Internet 
connection, such as at a hotel business center or Internet cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun says i-Planet will provide secure access to corporate e-mail  
as well as personal files, and can be used for traditional 
applications like word processing and spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
	The software, which runs on corporate servers, uses Sun's Java  
technology. Sun said it has been using the program internally for 
about a year, and it was so popular, the computer maker decided to 
make it available for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	I-Planet, which Sun said includes security measures such as  
encryption and ID authentication, is expected to be available May 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	The software could bring savings to companies, since using the  
Internet instead of dial-up access eliminates the need to maintain 
large modem banks and cuts down on long-distance calls.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Members Seek To Boost Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, concerned about a  
soaring U.S. trade deficit, pressured Japan and major European 
allies Monday to accelerate efforts to ensure a fragile global 
economic recovery remains on track. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are encouraging signs that the worst is over in a  
currency crisis that leveled economies from Asia to Latin America, 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and others in the 
administration are concerned that the global recovery remains 
extremely tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin enlisted the support of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan to drive that point home during meetings with their 
counterparts from the world's seven largest industrial countries. 
The G-7 includes the United States, Japan, Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to seeking a coordinated approach to boost growth  
among the wealthy nations, the G-7 members also sought to reach 
agreement on an action program to remodel the global financial 
system so that it can better withstand future Asian-style currency 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	America's trade deficit hit a record $169 billion last year and  
is headed higher this year, triggering rising protectionist 
pressures in the United States. The steel industry, for example, is 
pushing the administration and Congress to cut off shipments of 
cheap steel from Japan, Russia and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials said that they discussed the steel issue  
during discussions with Rubin and Greenspan on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said the United States cannot continue to  
serve as the market of last resort for a recession-plagued world. 
The United States expects Japan, as the world's second largest 
economy, to intensify efforts to emerge from an eight-year slump 
and is looking for Europe to counteract recent disturbing signs of 
its own emerging slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	As the finance officials posed for pictures in front of blooming  
azalea bushes, Rubin described the discussions as ``very 
thoughtful'' and disputed suggestions that it would be a low-key 
meeting because the global economy is now on sounder footing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the new proposals being put forward by the  
administration for the most part involve modest, incremental 
changes. A proposal the United States has been pushing since last 
fall -- the creation a kind of contingency loan that could be rushed 
to countries before financial disaster strikes -- was approved 
Sunday by the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	All the discussions were taking place around the annual springs  
meetings of the 182-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, 
the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the IMF was able to reach agreement on the contingent  
credit lines at this time after months of debate, Jack Boorman, IMF 
director of policy development, said, ``The crisis has genuinely 
frightened people and frightened policy-makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hopes that any decisions reached this week  
will be endorsed at the annual economic summit of the G-7 countries 
and Russia, to be held this year in mid-June in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-range remodeling of the global financial architecture was  
only one agenda item. The IMF will hold a special conference 
Tuesday with more than 40 countries to examine the financial needs 
of six Balkan countries who have been heavily affected by the 
fighting in Yugoslavia and the exodus of refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint IMF-World Bank study says the conflict will cost the six  
nations at least $2.4 billion this year if the fighting is 
prolonged and no refugees return home. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian delegation was also meeting with the G-7 nations and  
IMF officials in hopes of completing negotiations this week that 
will clear the way for the IMF to resume lending to support 
Russia's economic reforms, which were severely set back last August 
when the country was forced to devalue its currency and default on 
billions of dollars in foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	That default sent Wall Street and financial markets around the  
world into a tailspin as it looked for awhile like the Asian crisis 
had entered a new and much more virulent phase. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investor calm was restored when the Federal Reserve  
lowered U.S. interest rates and since that time U.S. stocks have 
returned to record levels. Many crisis countries have been 
exhibiting signs of life in recent weeks with stocks and currency 
prices rebounding, although their economies remain mired in steep 
recessions.

                        *William F. Achatz Jr.    	
</P>
<P>
	POTTSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Longtime Associated Press photo editor  
William F. Achatz Jr., who supervised photo coverage of the Korean 
War, Latin American revolutions and civil rights marches in 
Alabama, died Sunday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a down-to-earth, wonderful guy. He knew pictures,''  
said Paul Vathis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning AP photographer who 
worked with Achatz for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Achatz was Vathis' editor in 1961, when Dwight D. Eisenhower and  
John F. Kennedy were meeting at Camp David. Vathis got a shot of 
the two men that no one else had by aiming his camera between a 
Secret Service man's legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He edited the picture that won me the Pulitzer Prize,'' said  
Vathis, one of three AP photographers who won Pulitzers under 
Achatz's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Achatz began working in journalism in 1931 at The Mercury. He  
covered crime and government for 10 years before joining the Marine 
Corps and serving in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Achatz was hired by the AP as a photographer in 1946 in  
Harrisburg. He soon moved to Philadelphia to become photo editor 
for Pennsylvania. He retired in 1976.

	KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Manmohan Adhikari, Nepal's first  
communist prime minister, died Monday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of  
Nepal collapsed during an election rally last week and slipped into 
a coma. He was declared brain dead on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Adhikari, who helped popularize communism in Nepal, became prime  
minister in November 1994. But his minority government was ousted 
in a vote of confidence nine months later. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected general-secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal  
in 1953 and remained its head until it merged with another 
communist group in 1990 to become the United Marxist-Leninist 
Communist Party of Nepal. He was elected its chairman the same 
year.

nonprofit research firm that charted the South's trends and 
economic prospects, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack. He was 
62. 
</P>
<P>
	Autry was president for 32 years of MDC Inc., which issued

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Stephen Baxter, a cameraman for a Sacramento,  
Calif., television station, died Thursday from an allergic reaction 
to something he ate or drank. He was 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter died while on assignment for KXTV. He had worked as a  
cameraman in California for 13 years, covering floods, earthquakes, 
mudslides and blizzards. He captured images including that of a 
dramatic helicopter rescue of a couple stranded atop their car 
during the January flood of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he won a Northern California Emmy Award for outstanding  
achievement in camera news for a portfolio featuring three videos 
with remarkable vantage points: aerial views of Lake Tahoe, scenes 
aboard the USS Nimitz in the Persian Gulf, and looking down on the 
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as it was being painted. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a son and a daughter, his mother, a

	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Arthur Boyd, whose talent for  
capturing Australian landscapes in oil helped establish him as one 
of the nation's leading painters, died Saturday at age 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister John Howard said Boyd was one of the greatest  
Australian painters of the 20th century. He described Boyd as a man 
of great generosity -- demonstrated by the artist's 1993 gift to the 
Australian people of his $13 million, 2,470-acre rural property in 
New South Wales state.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jane Crowley, a longtime NBC-TV censor who  
worked on ``The Tonight Show,'' ``Late Night With David Letterman'' 
and ``The Cosby Show,'' died Wednesday of an apparent heart attack. 
She was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Carson, in his ``Tonight'' monologues, would occasionally  
refer to a fictional censor named ``Priscilla Goodbody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mace, who worked for the show from 1968 to 1971 as an  
assistant to Ed McMahon, said he believes Carson coined the name 
with Miss Crowley in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Crowley retired in 1987 after working for NBC for 40 years.  
As a manager for Standards and Practices, she was assigned certain 
shows and had the final say, in the tamer TV environment of her 
early career, on whether a costume was too revealing or a word like 
``toilet'' could be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Crowley also worked for ``Your Show of Shows,'' starring  
Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca, soap operas such as ``Another World'' 
and Hallmark Hall of Fame specials.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Walter J. Cummings, a former U.S. solicitor  
general who was one of the longest-serving federal appeals court 
judges, died Saturday of pneumonia. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 36, he became the youngest-ever U.S. solicitor general,  
holding the job from 1952 to 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by  
President Johnson in 1966. He spent 32 years on the court, which 
serves parts of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings took part in many landmark cases, including one in 1972  
freeing Black Panther leader Bobby Seale, who had been held in 
contempt of court in the famous Chicago Seven trial. That trial 
stemmed from anti-Vietnam protests at the 1968 Democratic National 
Convention.

surviving Mexican soldier who fought Pancho Villa's rebel forces 
during the Mexican Revolution, died Sunday. He was 110. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on Jan. 7, 1889, in Sacramento, Mexico, Garcia was among  
the Mexican ``Federales'' who fought for dictator Porfirio Diaz, 
who won several fraudulent elections for the presidency. Villa 
joined the revolution on the side of Francisco Madero, who in 1910 
toppled Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Urbina, professor of Latin American history at Texas  
City's College of the Mainland, said Garcia is the last of a 
handful of Mexican veterans he has tracked since the late 1980s. He 
said Garcia fought for Diaz's forces in 1910 and 1911.

was one of professional wrestling's biggest stars in the 1980s and 
early 1990s, died April 20. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Rood was found unconscious at his home. He was resuscitated, but

</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Randy Johnson said empty prescription pill bottles

</P>
<P>
	Rood was charged April 9 with driving under the influence and  
blood test results from that charge were pending, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ring, Rood played a womanizing, conceited bad guy who  
would often finish off opponents with the ``Rude Awakening,'' a 
neck-breaking takedown. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured in a 1994 match with the wrestler Sting in Japan  
and then retired.

``More Bounce to the Ounce'' and ``I Want to Be Your Man,'' was 
shot to death Sunday along with his brother in an apparent 
murder-suicide, police said. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Troutman, who with his brother was part of the family group Zapp  
and recorded as a solo artist under the name Roger, was found 
outside his recording studio. He had been shot several times in the 
torso and died while in surgery, police Sgt. Gary White said. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Larry Troutman, 54, was found dead in a car a few  
blocks away with a gunshot wound to the head, police said. A 
handgun was found inside the car, which matched the description of 
a car leaving the scene of Roger Troutman's shooting, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Betz, executive director of the Montgomery County coroner's  
office, said authorities believe Larry Troutman shot his brother 
Sunday and then turned the gun on himself. The motive for the 
shooting was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were part of the Troutman family of performers that  
formed the band Zapp and helped pioneer the rock-funk ``Dayton 
sound'' in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> 2 Jailed in Cross Burning Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Two white teen-agers convicted of  
trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple were 
sentenced Monday to a few months in jail, prompting complaints from 
their victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge followed a jury's recommendation in sentencing Richard  
J. Elliott, 19, to 90 days in jail and a $2,500 fine for attempting 
to burn a cross with the intent to intimidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan S. O'Mara, 19, pleaded guilty to the charge and one of  
conspiracy and was ordered to serve 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teens remain free on bond while their attorneys appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	James Jubilee, who found the 4-by-2-foot wooden cross with a  
burned spot in the middle on his lawn in May said the defendants 
should have to serve at least a year in prison. The maximum 
possible punishment on each charge was five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really frustrated with the system,'' Jubilee, who is  
black, said outside court. ``The system is supposed to be on the 
side of the victim. I don't think it is here.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Book Copy Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Illinois book publisher that accused  
another publisher of unlawfully copying the size and cover style of 
its cookbooks and children's storybooks lost a Supreme Court appeal 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned down Publications  
International's argument that its books were distinctive enough to 
qualify for legal protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Publications International, based in Lincolnwood, Ill., began  
publishing large cookbooks in 1993 with padded, high-gloss covers 
and gilded page edges. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year it began publishing children's storybooks in the  
same style, although smaller. The company said it sold millions of 
copies of the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Landoll Inc. of Ashland, Ohio, began publishing cookbooks and  
children's books of similar size and style in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Publications International sued, saying Landoll unlawfully  
copied its ``trade dress,'' which refers to a product's size, 
shape, color or other features distinctive enough to identify the 
company that makes it. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Chicago ruled for Landoll, and the 7th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Publications International's books 
were not distinctive enough that a look-alike would fool consumers, 
the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers who want to distinguish their books from competitors'  
products can do so by adopting a logo, using a uniform cover design 
or printing their name prominently on the cover, the appeals court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Publications International's  
lawyers said its books were ``unquestionably unique,'' adding that 
lower courts disagree on what makes a product distinctive enough to 
warrant legal protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Publications International vs. Landoll, 98-1492.

<HEADLINE> R&AMP;B Singer Roger Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- R&AMP;B singer Roger Troutman, who had songs  
such as ``More Bounce to the Ounce'' and ``I Want to Be Your Man,'' 
was shot to death along with his brother in an apparent 
murder-suicide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Troutman, who with his brother was part of the family group Zapp  
and recorded as a solo artist under the name Roger, was found 
outside his northwest Dayton recording studio around 7 a.m. Sunday. 
The 47-year-old Dayton resident had been shot several times in the 
torso and died while in surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital and 
Health Center, police Sgt. Gary White said. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Larry Troutman, 54, was found dead in a car a few  
blocks away with a gunshot wound to the head, police said. A 
handgun was found inside the car, which matched the description of 
a car leaving the scene of Roger Troutman's shooting, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives are investigating it as an apparent murder-suicide,  
police said. But family members ``can offer no reason or motive,'' 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were part of the Troutman family of performers that  
formed the band Zapp and helped pioneer the rock-funk ``Dayton 
sound'' in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The band, more recently known as Zapp &AMP; Roger, was known for the  
1980 hit ``More Bounce to the Ounce.'' The song, which reached the 
top 20 on the pop charts, was part of the band's debut album in 
1980. Among their other hits were ``Doo Wah Ditty (Blow That 
Thing),'' ``Dance Floor,'' ``Heartbreaker,'' ``I Can Make You 
Dance'' and ``Computer Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Troutman eventually went solo for a time. As Roger, he hit  
No. 1 on the R&AMP;B chart and No. 3 on the pop chart in 1987-88 with 
the single ``I Want to Be Your Man.'' The family group, by now 
called Zapp &AMP; Roger, had hits in the 1990s with ``Slow and Easy'' 
and ``Mega Medley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Troutman also collaborated with hip-hop superstars Tupac  
Shakur and Dr. Dre on the song ``California Love -- How Do U Want 
It,'' which made the top 10 on the charts and was nominated for a 
Grammy for best rap performance by a duo or group in 1997. Shakur 
was shot to death in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger, he was unique,'' said Ohio Players drummer and leader  
Diamond Williams. ``Very, very talented. The world has lost a truly 
talented entertainer by another senseless act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Troutman left performing in the mid-'80s to manage the  
group full time and assume the presidency of the Dayton-based 
Troutman Enterprises, which included recording studios, real-estate 
ventures and contracting.

<HEADLINE> FAA Delays New Radar Installation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new radar system designed to control planes  
within 50 miles of an airport is behind schedule, prompting the 
government to test it at smaller airfields. 
</P>
<P>
	Aging systems scheduled to be replaced by the new system will  
instead be replaced by technology already in use, the Federal 
Aviation Administration said Monday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System -- due  
to have entered civilian service in Boston last December -- will now 
be installed at a schedule and program cost that will not be 
divulged until later this summer, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests of the new equipment will be conducted at less busy air  
traffic control centers in Syracuse, N.Y., and El Paso, Texas, 
starting late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, aged controller displays at the New York area,  
Dallas-Forth Worth and Washington airports will be replaced 
starting in the summer of 2000 with existing Lockheed Martin color 
controller displays. The first new system was to have gone to 
Reagan National Airport in Washington March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary equipment also will be used in two new air traffic  
control centers being built to control planes over northern 
California and northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussing the prospect of delays earlier this month, the FAA  
said development of its new STARS system is running behind schedule 
because changes requested by air traffic controllers have slowed 
the computers' response times. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement with the FAA, Mike McNally, president of  
the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said: ``STARS is 
the platform of the future for terminal air traffic control, and 
this is the right approach -- taking the time to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	STARS is being developed for the FAA and the Defense Department  
by the Raytheon Co. Electronic Systems Division in Marlboro, Mass. 
It will provide new computer hardware displays, keyboards, 
processors and software for up to 172 FAA and 199 Defense 
Department terminal control facilities, which handle planes shortly 
after takeoff or just before landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing equipment, the Automated Radar Terminal Systems, or  
ARTS, is based on technology developed in the 1970s and 1980s. It 
consists of displays, computers and software acquired over two 
decades, resulting in a hodgepodge of equipment nearing the end of 
its useful life. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's technological upgrades have been plagued by costly  
delays. The STARS project, for example, is expected to cost $2.2 
billion.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, concerned about a  
soaring U.S. trade deficit, pressured Japan and major European 
allies Monday to accelerate efforts to ensure a fragile global 
economic recovery remains on track. While there are encouraging 
signs that the worst is over in a currency crisis that leveled 
economies from Asia to Latin America, U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin and others in the administration are concerned that 
the global recovery remains extremely tenuous. Rubin enlisted the

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The computer virus known as Chernobyl seemed to

would sweep the world as another virus did several weeks ago. By 
midday, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, 
only four sites with 30 individual computers had been infected, the 
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh reported. Unlike the recent ``Melissa'' scare, which 
automatically propagated via e-mail but did no direct damage, the 
Chernobyl virus didn't spread as quickly because it required a 
person to launch an infected program file to contaminate a 
computer.

despite a 1.6 percent rise in the market's blue chip index. Der

	Court To Make FDA-Tobacco Decision  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed today to decide  
whether the Food and Drug Administration can crack down on 
cigarette sales to minors. Government lawyers say the FDA's 
decision in 1996 to start regulating tobacco as a drug was 
justified, because of new evidence that the industry wanted its 
products to feed the nicotine habits of consumers. But a federal 
appeals court ruled that Congress, and not the FDA, has the 
authority to decide how to regulate cigarettes and chewing tobacco. 
The FDA's rules are part of growing efforts to curb the tobacco 
industry.

<HEADLINE> 'The Matrix' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- During a weekend considered a clearinghouse  
for studios awaiting the flood of early summer releases, the 
cyberspace blockbuster ``The Matrix'' topped the box office while 
two new releases foundered. 
</P>
<P>
	The futuristic Keanu Reeves thriller grossed $12.9 million over  
the weekend after crossing the $100 million mark last week. It 
replaced the prison comedy ``Life,'' which slipped to second place 
with $11.6 million after losing 43 percent of its audience, 
industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two comedies opening in wide release failed to grab a sizable  
audience and may have been rushed into the market to avoid upcoming 
expected blockbusters such as the ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pushing Tin,'' the John Cusack-Billy Bob Thornton comedy about  
a rivalry between two frantic air traffic controllers, opened with 
$3.6 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lost &AMP; Found,'' featuring David Spade as a smarmy dognapper  
who falls in love with his beautiful neighbor, opened in sixth 
place with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend is considered a dumping ground for films by the  
industry -- their last chance to make something before summer 
releases start coming out,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a movie analyst 
with Reel Source Inc. ``Once the summer opens all the other films 
just fall like a ton of bricks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bucksbaum said studios have started opening ``summer-style''  
big-budget films in the spring -- including ``Star Wars: Episode I -- 
The Phantom Menace'' in May and ``Entrapment'' next week -- to take 
advantage of a time when smaller movies are in the market.

	It worked for ``The Matrix,'' he said. The film about a hacker  
who battles cyber-overlords in a twisting world of virtual reality 
has taken in $117.3 million in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Drew Barrymore high school comedy ``Never Been  
Kissed'' continued to do well, holding onto third place with $6.2 
million.

<P>
	Weekend ticket sales were 4.7 percent higher than the same  
weekend last year, when ``Titanic'' began to lose steam.

	The high school student government satire ``Election,'' starring  
Reese Witherspoon as a compulsive goody-two-shoes and Matthew 
Broderick as a frumpy civics teacher, opened in only six theaters 
nationwide but pulled in an outstanding per-screen average of 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very smart to open it in only six theaters,'' said  
Bucksbaum. ``Awareness was low on the movie before, but now (the

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The replacement of two systems that deliver the  
Associated Press news report, a new Internet site to give members 
better access to that report and plans to increase AP's state news 
staff were announced Monday by Louis D. Boccardi, president and 
chief executive officer, at the news cooperative's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	AP chairman Donald E. Newhouse, president of Advance  
Publications and The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., opened the 
meeting attended by executives representing AP's 1,545 daily 
newspapers. The AP meeting and luncheon were the opening events of 
the first full day of activities of the Newspaper Association of 
America's convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told the meeting that Americans  
and Congress should be patient while the air war against the forces 
of Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting to prevail,'' Richardson said in a luncheon  
speech. He said last weekend's 50th anniversary meeting of NATO 
leaders in Washington solidified the resolve of the 19 member 
nations to continue the bombing campaign and convinced leaders the 
air strikes are working. 
</P>
<P>
	On the topic of espionage at U.S. nuclear facilities, Richardson  
said security had been lax over the past few years, despite a 
presidential directive to tighten it, and information about 
important nuclear weapons was released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secrets were compromised,'' said Richardson, who became energy  
secretary last August. ``They were compromised and accelerated 
China's nuclear development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that now scientists who work on sensitive weapons  
undergo polygraph tests; the counter-intelligence budget has 
tripled over the past few years, and background checks are required 
on scientists from sensitive countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way to deal with China is not to isolate,'' he said. ``The  
way to deal with China is to debate with them, to include them in 
the international community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Boccardi moderated a panel called ``A Conversation:  
Crisis in Kosovo,'' which included White House correspondent Terry 
Hunt; foreign affairs and national security correspondent Laura 
Myers; special correspondent Mort Rosenblum; photographer and 
international photo editor Jerome Delay; and Miles Kahler, a 
professor with the Graduate School of International Relations at 
the University of California, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblum and Delay participated by live satellite from a  
refugee camp in Kukes, Albania. Rosenblum said the refugees, who 
are ``in terrible condition'' and keep streaming across the border 
with Yugoslavia by the thousands, want NATO to send ground troops 
to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The air war is working on a sort of wholesale basis, but  
they're dealing in retail right now,'' Rosenblum said. He said the 
refugees believe ground troops are needed in addition to the 
current air war because the ``ethnic cleansing'' is being carried 
out by small groups of Serb military police. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi started his report to the AP members by showing the AP  
photo portfolios that won both Pulitzer photo prizes this year. AP 
was cited for spot coverage of the terrorist bombings of two 
American embassies in Africa and feature photography for coverage 
of the White House scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi paid tribute to AP television producer Myles Tierney,  
who was killed by rebel gunmen in Sierra Leone, and he spoke of the 
risks taken by AP staffers to cover the struggles in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud of the work being done by some very courageous AP  
people who've been beaten, robbed and shot at as they reported from 
the Balkans,'' Boccardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi said the international video service AP started four  
years ago, now known as APTN, had its first profitable quarter this 
year and had ``begun to fulfill the expectations we've had all 
along that it would generate new revenue for our general funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In connection with AP services, Boccardi announced that the AP  
Leaf Desk will be replaced starting later this year with an all-new 
AP Server. It will go to all PhotoStream subscribers, including 
those who already own the current version of AP Server, at no 
additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Leaf Desk, with which AP led the industry's way to  
electronic picture handling just a few years ago, has served you 
and us well. But it's time to move ahead,'' Boccardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with a new and improved satellite distribution system  
called ObjectStream, the new receivers will make it possible for AP 
to retire its aging AP GraphicsNet system and deliver photos and 
news graphics on the same circuit to the same up-to-date receiver, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later on, AP will add text to ObjectStream so that related  
stories, photos and graphics will be linked when they arrive in 
newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the next few months, Boccardi said, AP will give member  
newspapers a new Internet site at no charge called ``Your AP.'' It 
will provide a directory to access every story, picture and graphic 
available on any subject in the AP news report, and it can be 
customized by editors for their specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take the place of the systems we use for delivering  
our news to your production systems,'' Boccardi said. ``What we're 
doing here is using the Internet to offer another way to look at 
your AP news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, some 950 AP member newspapers will have  
Web sites, Boccardi said, and more than 300 will subscribe to The 
WIRE, AP's Web-based members-only service started more than two 
years ago. To make member sites more attractive to online readers, 
he said, the AP recently launched the MoneyWIRE, which allows users 
to retrieve specific mutual fund and stock listings by company 
name, ticker symbol or AP stock table abbreviation. 
</P>
<P>
	For editors who want to build their own multimedia  
presentations, Boccardi said the AP will soon offer ``multimedia 
components'' on all major stories, including audio and video clips. 
He said the AP is working with RealNetworks Inc. to let Web sites 
offer audio and news programming directly from their pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi also announced that as many as 10 new staffers will be  
added this year to domestic bureaus in a program AP hopes to 
continue for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The first additions will be in Houston; Jackson, Miss.;  
Columbia, S.C.; a Washington-based regional reporter for Utah, 
Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico; and a technology writer based in 
San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In results of all-mail balloting for the AP's board of  
directors, four incumbents were re-elected and two new members were 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-elected were Judith W. Brown, editor, The Herald, New  
Britain, Conn.; Joe Hladky, president and publisher, The Gazette 
Co., Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Burl Osborne, publisher and CEO of The 
Dallas Morning News and president, publishing division, of the 
newspaper's parent company, A.H. Belo Corp.; and representing a 
city of less than 50,000 population, R. Victor Dix, chairman of Dix 
Communications, and president and publisher of The Daily Record, 
Wooster, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	New members are Richard D. Gottlieb, president and CEO, Lee  
Enterprises Inc., Quad-City Times, Davenport, Iowa, and W. Dean 
Singleton, vice chairman, president and CEO, MediaNews Group, and 
chairman of The Denver Post Co.

<HEADLINE> Artists Grapple With Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- One of Kosovo's best-known writers, now  
a refugee in a muddy tent camp, weeps as he recalls the 
half-finished novel left behind when masked Serb paramilitary men 
forced him from his house. 
</P>
<P>
	The province's leading stage and screen actress, in exile in  
Macedonia, finds it hard to believe that any play or movie could 
ever do justice to the ``tragic drama'' of Kosovo Albanians' 
harrowing exodus. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kosovo's artists and thinkers struggle to come to grips with  
shattering loss -- the violent uprooting of virtually an entire 
people -- some wonder whether the province's cultural and 
intellectual life has become a casualty of war as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Kosovo Albanians as a whole, most of the province's  
novelists and painters, musicians and dancers, poets and professors 
are dispersed in refugee camps in neighboring Macedonia and 
Albania, or part of the flood tide of displaced people still 
trapped inside Kosovo, or in reluctant exile elsewhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Kosovo Albanians believe they will eventually be able to  
return to their homes in the Serbian province under some sort of 
international protection. Some argue, though, that any hope for 
healing the collective psyche lies in finding ways to give voice to 
an all-encompassing catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do more than just survive,'' said Maksut Shehu, 68,  
the retired editor-in-chief of Kosovo's most influential daily 
newspaper, Rilindja, now sheltering with his family in a nylon tent 
in Macedonia's biggest refugee camp. ``We have to keep our soul, 
our spirit -- there's no other way we can exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent actress Safete Rugova fled Kosovo earlier this month,  
a nightmarish journey that included three days trapped in a 
no-man's land on the Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing the frontier, she and her relatives found shelter  
in the northern Macedonian town of Tetovo, which is predominantly 
Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all taken part in a drama, a great tragedy,'' Rugova  
said in an interview in a cafe frequented by Albanians, where heads 
turned at the sound of her familiar husky voice. ``I've seen 
children dying, women thrown into the freezing cold, men taken from 
their families ... I never imagined such things could occur in real 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the hardship and despair of the exodus, she said, came the  
balm of hospitality in Tetovo, where thousands of those who fled 
Kosovo have been taken into private homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had started to lose our faith in humanity, and this helped  
to bring it back,'' said Rugova, a gray-haired woman in her 50s who 
gives an impression of elegance even dressed in jeans and a checked 
shirt. ``For me as an artist and as a person, it was very moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova, who is also a playwright, said she was working on some  
short dramatic sketches based on her experiences, which she hoped 
to stage soon with two other actresses in venues including the 
refugee camps. But she doubted it was possible to capture the 
enormity of what had befallen her people. 
</P>
<P>
	``For now, it's all we can do to give one another a sense of  
solidarity,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that is too painful for some to think about yet. Mehmet  
Kajtazi, the author of 13 novels, fled the Kosovo capital of 
Pristina two weeks ago with his family after what he described as 
threats and abuse at the hands of Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before they came and ordered us to go, they threw something  
red at my door, to look like blood, and one of them said, 'You're 
the one who's been writing books against Serbia,'' the 54-year-old 
writer -- haggard and unshaven -- recounted as he sat on the 
blanket-strewn floor of a tent at Macedonia's Brazda refugee camp. 
``I'm sure I would have been killed if I had stayed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kajtazi planned to try at some point to write about what had  
happened in Kosovo, but said it was still too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only watch and feel ... I'm still living it,'' he said.  
``I don't know where to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kajtazi's works, some of which have been translated into French  
and anthologized in English, are marked by themes of confinement 
and exile. One novel written 15 years ago -- recently made into a 
film -- takes its title from the name of a Serb prison island. 
</P>
<P>
	Calm through most of an hourlong talk over cups of sweet tea,  
Kajtazi's composure cracked when asked about his current writing. 
The manuscript of his novel in progress -- representing three years 
of work -- was left behind in the fear and haste of departure, he 
said. As he spoke, a single tear trickled down his face. 
</P>
<P>
	He brushed it aside and talked about literary influences --  
Albanian writer Ismail Kadare, for one, and Colombian writer 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who pioneered a style known as magical 
realism, combining the surreal and the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking through the tent flap at the muddy paths outside,  
Kajtazi said that notion had special meaning for him now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Magical realism takes simple things and turns them to myth,''  
he said. ``In Kosovo, we will have our myths and legends about all 
this. Now we have to learn how to turn these back into ordinary 
things.''

<HEADLINE> Littleton Says Goodbye to Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- He taught them how to type and how to  
run the fast break. He smiled easily and always saw the good in 
life. To his young grandson, he gave the best bedtime snacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, William ``Dave'' Sanders gave it all, sacrificing  
his life while trying to save students during the massacre at 
Columbine High School last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Sanders,'' student Laurel Salerno said through tears at  
Sanders' funeral Monday, ``I thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took the sanctuary and two overflow rooms at the Trinity  
Christian Center to hold the 2,500 people -- students, teachers, 
residents -- who bid goodbye to the 47-year-old, bearded and 
bespectacled Sanders. He died of gunshot wounds in the rampage that 
also killed 12 students. The two gunmen committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was and always will be a hero in my heart,'' said his  
niece, Kim Smith, one of many people offering testimonials. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony for Sanders was one of four funerals Monday, the  
other three for students. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners remembered Cassie Bernall, the 17-year-old girl who  
professed her love of God just before she was shot, and Lauren 
Townsend, an 18-year-old honor student and captain of the girls' 
varsity volleyball team. A funeral was held later Monday for Daniel 
Rohrbough, the 15-year-old boy shot while holding an exit door open 
for fleeing students. 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral for Sanders, students past and present walked to  
the front of the chapel and stood over his dark blue casket, which 
was covered in a large flower arrangement, to remember him as a 
teacher, coach, friend and hero. 
</P>
<P>
	As gunfire echoed through the school cafeteria during the  
attack, Sanders shouted out to students and herded them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was running around and I remember seeing him jumping over  
the chairs and yelling, `Everybody get down!''' student Lindsay 
Dowling told mourners. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many 
other people's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was shot twice in the chest and staggered into a science  
classroom, where students tore off their T-shirts and pressed them 
to his wounds. Students pulled out Sanders' wallet and held it open 
so he could look at pictures of his wife and daughters. The dying 
words of the father of three daughters were: ``Tell my girls I love 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral, daughter Angela Sanders read a ``letter to  
daddy'' that praised his heroism and contained a postscript that 
read, ``The girls and I would like you to know that we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sanders' 10 grandchildren, Austin Sanders, a preschooler,  
told mourners he liked to play with his grandfather and ``he always 
made good bedtime snacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders spent 24 years at Columbine, his first and only teaching  
job. He taught business and substituted in the science department. 
He also coached track and girls' basketball and girls' softball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He taught me how to run the hurdles,'' recalled a former  
student, track athlete Chris Black. ``I fell down quite a few 
times, but he was always there to pick me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As mourners listened to the testimonials, they clutched hands  
and wiped tears. Students gathered in small groups, embracing each 
other. Most in the crowd wore the now-familiar ribbons in blue and 
silver, the school's colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave on Tuesday bled the ultimate blue and silver,'' said  
Columbine High teacher Joe Marshall. ``He will never, never be 
taken from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other funerals Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- At the West Bowles Community Church, about 2,000 people  
remembered the strong Christian faith of Miss Bernall. Other 
students had said after the rampage that when one of the gunmen 
asked her if she believed in God, she answered that she did. The 
gunman then killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie's response does not surprise us,'' the family said in a  
statement released at the funeral. ``Her life was rightly centered 
around our lord Jesus. It was for her strong faith in God and His 
promise of eternal life that she made her stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor George Kirsten told mourners: ``Cassie died a martyr's  
death. She went to the martyr's hall of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- About 1,200 people packed into the standing-room-only worship  
area of Foothills Bible Church to mourn Miss Townsend. The Rev. 
Bill Shelby asked the audience to use the tragedy to become the 
best they can be and love all types of people as Lauren did. 
</P>
<P>
	Her freckled, smiling face beamed down on the crowd from two  
large screens in the church. Friends and family recalled a 
motivated, somewhat shy senior who wanted to become a biologist 
like her brother Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say that Lauren was a victim,'' said Matt Townsend, 25.  
``I don't think of her in that way. The ugly thing that happened 
last Tuesday, they couldn't conquer her beauty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Townsend was a volleyball player, member of the National  
Honor Society and candidate for valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was really a remarkable girl,'' her uncle, Harvey Gates,  
said before the service, wiping away a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family wrote their farewells in blue and black  
marker on Miss Townsend's white coffin. ``I miss you,'' said one.

<HEADLINE> Court To Make FDA-Tobacco Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed today to decide  
whether the Food and Drug Administration can crack down on 
cigarette sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The court will hear a Clinton administration appeal in which  
government lawyers say FDA's 1996 decision to start regulating 
tobacco as a drug was justified by new evidence that the tobacco 
industry intended its products to feed consumers' nicotine habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless this court grants review, an unparalleled opportunity  
to curb tobacco use by children ... will be lost,'' the 
government's appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled that Congress, not the FDA, has  
the authority to make the ``major policy decision'' of how to 
regulate cigarettes and chewing tobacco. The effect of the lower 
court's ruling was to leave no FDA role in regulating tobacco 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the most important public health case the Supreme  
Court hears in decades,'' said David Kessler, FDA commissioner in 
1996 and now dean of Yale University Medical School. ``The goal is 
certainly to reduce the number of people who smoke and the best way 
to do that is to reduce the number of young people who start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry representatives did not immediately comment on  
today's court action. Industry officials have argued that FDA 
regulation of tobacco would force a ban, or short of that, would 
let the agency control the contents of cigarettes and set other 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton released a statement saying he was pleased  
that the court would take up the case. ``Every day, 3,000 young 
people become regular smokers and 1,000 will have their lives cut 
short as a result,'' he said. ``I remain firmly committed to the 
FDA rule, which will help stop young people from smoking before 
they start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to block enforcement of a federal law requiring that  
anyone who produces material showing actual sex acts keep records 
of the name and age of everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected arguments by two big local phone companies, BellSouth  
and US West, that a law restricting how they provide such 
electronic services as stock quotes and sports scores violates 
their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed in a New York City case to decide whether a federal  
anti-discrimination law on the right to enter into contracts 
protects people who are not U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's rules are part of growing efforts to curb the tobacco  
industry. Although Congress failed to pass a nationwide settlement 
last year, all 50 states have reached settlements in which tobacco 
companies will pay them $246 billion for the cost of treating 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government also plans to sue the industry to recover  
federal health-insurance costs for treating such illnesses. And the 
industry faces individual and class-action lawsuits by smokers and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, the FDA said it lacked authority to regulate  
tobacco so long as cigarette manufacturers did not claim that 
smoking provided health benefits. But the government reversed 
itself in 1996 and classified tobacco products as ``devices'' that 
deliver addictive nicotine and therefore are subject to federal 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort was partly spurred by disclosures of secret tobacco  
industry documents starting in 1994 that showed companies had 
targeted teen-agers and that they knew of nicotine's addictive 
quality even before the government did. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states already ban tobacco sales to anyone under 18. In  
addition to adopting that rule, the FDA required stores to demand 
photo I.D. from all tobacco purchasers under age 27 and limited 
vending-machine cigarette sales to adult-only locations, such as 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators also banned tobacco billboards within 1,000  
feet of a school or playground, and set other limits on cigarette 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies challenged the rules. In April 1997, U.S.  
District Judge William Osteen upheld the FDA's authority to 
regulate tobacco and upheld the crackdown on sales to minors, but 
threw out the advertising restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the  
FDA could not regulate tobacco at all. ``Congress never intended to 
give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products,'' the appeals 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers said  
the August ruling ``invalidated the most important public health 
and safety rulemaking that FDA had conducted in the past 50 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before 1996, ``the FDA simply did not have clear and compelling  
evidence that nicotine is extremely addictive, that consumers use 
tobacco products because they are addicted'' and that companies 
manipulate cigarettes' nicotine content, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal, supported by 39 states, said the FDA considered  
banning all cigarette sales, even to adults, but decided it would 
be dangerous to ban a product ``to which so many millions of people 
are addicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's lawyers said that setting tobacco policy is a  
political task for Congress, which already has prohibited tobacco 
advertising on radio and television, banned smoking on airplanes 
and required warning labels on cigarette packages.

	``The FDA has overreached,'' the tobacco companies' lawyers  
said. They added that the main settlement reached last November 
between the industry and 46 states sets many of the limits sought 
by the FDA.

	Cigarette billboards across the country were taken down this  
month as required by the settlement, which also bars companies from

<HEADLINE> China, EU Discuss World Trade Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Senior U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators  
discussed differences over China's bid to enter the World Trade 
Organization in an unexpected meeting Monday, state media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy U.S. trade representative, Robert Cassidy, had been  
scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday. The delay of his 
departure underscored the importance that both sides have placed on 
reaching a market-opening agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy and three other U.S. negotiators met Monday afternoon  
with China's top WTO negotiator, Long Yongtu, at the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, Long described the talks as ``constructive''  
and ``beneficial to both sides,'' the agency said. He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have held talks in Beijing since Thursday to wrap  
up an agreement based on the market-opening offer made by Premier 
Zhu Rongji during his visit to Washington two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bill Clinton rejected it as insufficient but agreed  
with Zhu to try to conclude negotiations by June. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Chinese negotiators have discussed opening China's  
financial, insurance and service industries to foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the sweeping concessions made by Zhu reflect China's  
eagerness to use membership to the WTO to secure access to key 
export markets like the United States and to regain the confidence 
of foreign banks and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Long also opened talks Monday morning with a team of negotiators  
from the European Union to try to secure European backing for 
China's entry into the world trade body, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing and Washington have been engaged in on-again, off-again  
talks over China's entry into WTO and its predecessor since 1986.

	Clinton Plans New Gun-Control Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose new gun-control  
measures tomorrow when he unveils his crime legislation, counting 
on outrage over the Colorado school shooting to push the bill 
through Congress. ``Unfortunately, oftentimes it takes tragic 
events to catalyze work here in Washington,'' White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart said today. Clinton's new omnibus crime 
package will propose mandatory child-safety locks on all guns sold, 
a lifetime ban on gun ownership for people who commit violent 
crimes as juveniles and criminal liability for adults, including 
parents, who allow children access to guns.

gunshot wounds in the rampage that also killed 12 students. The two 
gunmen committed suicide. Elsewhere, mourners remembered Cassie 
Bernall, the 17-year-old who professed her love of God just before 
she was shot dead, and Lauren Townsend, an 18-year-old honor 
student and captain of the volleyball team. A funeral was to be 
held later today for Daniel Rohrbough, the 15-year-old boy shot

NATO countries if necessary. In a reflection of the political 
turmoil in Belgrade, the Yugoslav army later today took over

	Study: Drugs Hiding, Not Curing HIV  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The AIDS virus might be able to hide undetected  
for 60 years in people taking powerful anti-viral drugs, says a 
study that underlines a major obstacle to the bold notion of curing 
AIDS. ``We aren't going to be able to simply wait it out,'' said 
Dr. Robert Siliciano, senior author of the study. While the drugs 
can drive the body's supply of HIV down to undetectable levels, 
they can't attack virus that lies quietly in cells. Such hidden 
``reservoirs'' of HIV have long been recognized, and these new 
calculations confirm the belief that they could harbor the virus 
for a very long time.

exchanges to extend trading hours as a measure to retain the 
nation's dominance in world markets. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt 
said he would prefer that exchanges wait until next year, after any 
Year 2000 computer problems are addressed. The National Association 
of Securities Dealers is in the process of drawing up a proposal to 
extend trading hours to as late as 9 p.m., from the current 4 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Packers Hire Ken Herock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Ken Herock, former Oakland Raiders pro  
scouting director, was hired Monday as vice president of personnel 
by the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Herock, 57, in professional football for more than 35 years as a  
player, coach, scout and personnel official, is a longtime friend 
of Packers general manager Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Munhall, Pa., and a member of Oakland's 1967 Super  
Bowl team as a tight end from West Virginia, Herock launched his 
front office career with the Raiders in 1970 as a combination 
personnel scout and special teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, he was named the Raiders' director of player  
personnel. In 1976, he became the first director of player 
personnel for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Within three years, he 
helped build the Bucs into a playoff contender that advanced to the 
NFC championship game in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to the Raiders' personnel department from  
1984-1986, Herock was named director of player personnel for 
Atlanta in 1987, remaining with the Falcons for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the Raiders in 1997, subsequently leaving the  
Oakland organization after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Herock's son, Shaun, is a scout for Green Bay.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, third-round draft pick Cletidus Hunt acknowledged he  
tested positive for a controlled substance at the NFL scouting 
combine in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bad thing,'' Hunt, a defensive tackle, told the  
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in Tuesday's edition. ``I admit to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely will stay clean from here on.''  
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted a source as saying the positive test was  
for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said an NFL rule prevented him from commenting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans New Gun-Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose new gun-control  
measures Tuesday when he unveils his crime legislation, counting on 
outrage over the Colorado school shooting to push the bill through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospects are good,'' White House press secretary Joe  
Lockhart said Monday. ``Unfortunately, oftentimes it takes tragic 
events to catalyze work here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's spokesman criticized the National Rifle  
Association for its record of fighting Clinton on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a consensus in this country that we need to  
do more; the president will propose to do more and it is time for 
the NRA to get out of the past and get on the right side of this 
issue,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA spokesman Jim Manown replied: ``It's inappropriate for us to  
engage in a political debate at this moment.'' He said NRA 
officials would address the issue at their trimmed-down annual 
conference in Denver this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The president planned a White House ceremony to launch his new  
omnibus crime package. It would contain new gun-control proposals 
in addition to measures that died in the last Congress, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is proposing:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory child-safety locks on all guns sold.  
</P>
<P>
	--All gun-show sales be subject to background checks on buyers.  
</P>
<P>
	--A lifetime ban on gun ownership for people who commit violent  
crimes as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	--A three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases. The Brady  
law's five-day waiting period lapsed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Criminal liability for adults, including parents, who allow  
children access to guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult would be held liable whenever a juvenile crime is  
committed and ``there's some reason to think the parents or gun 
owner should have known'' that the juvenile had access to a 
firearm, said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised this provision long before the Littleton, Colo.,  
shootings and is not meant to suggest that those killers' parents 
should be blamed, said Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Molchan, director of the National Association of  
Federally Licensed Gun Dealers, said the 7,000 gun dealers he 
represents support a lifetime ban on gun ownership for anyone who 
commits a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Clinton's package, Molchan said, ``is an  
unfortunate diversion and, in our view, a dangerous diversion that 
takes energy, time and thought away from the real issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody doesn't decide to walk into a school and murder  
several people because of lack of a gun lock or something,'' he 
said. ``It's a horrible, profound, moral issue.''

<HEADLINE> New Fishing Restrictions Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration unveiled new  
Atlantic and Gulf Coast fishing restrictions Monday aimed at 
rebuilding stocks of shark, Atlantic tuna and marlin. 
Environmentalists said it would be too little to stem the severe 
decline of swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of overfishing has resulted in so huge a drop in the  
number of Atlantic migratory fish that some species of shark, 
swordfish and blue marlin may soon be near to extinction, 
conservationists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service unveiled a broad plan the  
agency said would accommodate the interests of fishermen, yet move 
toward bringing back the fish populations over the next 10 to 20 
years. The plan takes effect June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery plan imposes tighter restrictions on recreational  
and commercial fishing for shark, tuna and so-called ``billfish'' 
including blue marlin, whose population is in severe decline. The 
administration promised to press international negotiations for 
tighter quotas on swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists insisted the agency's action fell short of  
what was necessary, especially to reduce the estimated 30,000 young 
swordfish killed as bycatch in U.S. waters every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its not enough. The time is running out for swordfish,'' said  
Vickie Spruill, executive director of SeaWeb, an organization that 
with some success has been urging restaurants to remove swordfish 
from their menus. ``This is a fish that's been slipping down the 
slope for a decade, and we keep getting procrastination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservationists were critical of the federal agency for not  
closing some swordfish fisheries for at least some part of the year 
where juvenile fish are in jeopardy. The agency proposed closing a 
``nursing area'' in the Florida Straits south of Miami but 
postponed a decision after complaints that the area was too small. 
</P>
<P>
	Penny Dalton, the fisheries service's director, said other areas  
were being reviewed for possible closure to protect juvenile 
swordfish but a decision will not be made until September. She said 
the ``short delay'' should not impact on the swordfish recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said it favors a 10-year recovery plan for swordfish  
that will require reducing the commercial swordfish quota by 27 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on quotas would require international action, and the  
United States will ``be very aggressive'' in pressing for quota 
reductions on swordfish in international negotiations in November 
to meet the 10-year recovery goal, said Terry Garcia, assistant 
commerce secretary for oceans and atmosphere. The fisheries is part 
of the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The management plan, which covers migratory fish in U.S. waters  
from Maine to Texas, includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Lower quotas, and in some cases size limits, on commercial  
catches of large seacoast shark. 
</P>
<P>
	--Restrictions on use of certain fishing techniques, especially  
longlines to catch bluefin tuna to help meet a goal of recovery in 
20 years. Longline fishing for bluefin tuna is banned in June off 
New Jersey's coast, affecting about 100 fishermen, according to the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	--Further restrictions on recreational catches of shark. The  
number of fish allowed to be caught would be reduced from two to 
one per day per vessel. The agency backed off from a 
``catch-and-release'' requirement because of opposition from 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	--New restrictions on landings of blue and white marlin and other  
so-called ``billfish'' by recreational fishermen. Marlin stocks 
have declined to about a quarter of the numbers needed for 
long-term survival, leading to a ban on commercial catches a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of some species of shark has declined by as much as  
85 percent, according to marine biologists. ``Hardest hit have been 
the large coastal sharks,'' said Sonja Fordham of the Center for 
Marine Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Swordfish populations have declined dramatically as more and  
more juveniles are caught. The average size of a swordfish is 
one-third of what it was 30 years ago, according to marine 
biologists.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs New Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One week after the Colorado shootings,  
President Clinton will propose legislation Tuesday that would 
require background checks on sales of explosives and hold parents 
liable when their children commit crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is counting on outrage over the shootings to help push  
the bill through Congress. ``The prospects are good,'' White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said Monday. ``Unfortunately, 
oftentimes it takes tragic events to catalyze work here in 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton referred repeatedly to last week's shootings during a  
tribute Monday night to a Jewish community leader. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that gun-control measures are necessary when ``we  
have a society like ours where we refuse to take even the most 
elemental steps to control access to weapons that kids should not 
have access to, where we had to fight ... for the Brady (background 
check) bill and assault weapons ban and the things I'm trying to 
pass now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president planned a White House ceremony to announce his new  
omnibus anticrime package. It will contain the restriction on 
explosives sales as well as measures that died in the last 
Congress, according to sources familiar with the proposals, 
speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials were still working on the explosives  
provision, which would aim to treat their sale the same way gun 
sales are treated under the Brady law, congressional sources said. 
It was unclear how ``explosives'' would be defined. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Colo., the killers had homemade hand grenades and  
pipe bombs as well as guns. In Oklahoma City, two tons of explosive 
fertilizer were used to blow up the federal building. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., applauded Clinton's initiative at  
cracking down on explosives but wondered if it was a problem too 
loosely defined to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're talking about propane gas tanks and agricultural  
chemicals, I'm anxious to see how they define the component parts 
of this,'' Durbin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is proposing:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory child-safety locks on all guns sold.  
</P>
<P>
	--All gun-show sales be subject to background checks on buyers.  
</P>
<P>
	--A lifetime ban on gun ownership for people who commit violent  
crimes as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	--A three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases, with an  
extra two days if law officers require them. Up to last year, the 
Brady Act provided five days for police to conduct background 
checks on buyers if they needed that much time. Now, it provides up 
to three days, but most checks are instantaneous. There never has 
been a minimum, mandatory waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	--Criminal liability and a $10,000 fine for adults, including  
parents, who allow children access to guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult could be held liable whenever a juvenile crime is  
committed and the adult ``knowingly or recklessly allowed it to 
occur,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. He added that the 
legislation's standard of reckless conduct would be ``a difficult 
standard to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised this liability issue long before the Colorado  
shootings and it is not now meant to suggest that those parents 
should be blamed, said Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, announcing the general proposal though not the details  
on Monday, criticized the National Rifle Association for fighting 
Clinton on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a consensus in this country that we need to  
do more; the president will propose to do more and it is time for 
the NRA to get out of the past and get on the right side of this 
issue,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA spokesman Jim Manown replied: ``It's inappropriate for us to  
engage in a political debate at this moment.'' He said NRA 
officials would address the issue at their trimmed-down annual 
conference in Denver this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin championed a more limited liability than Clinton is  
proposing. The limited version -- for situations where a gun owner 
shows negligence by not safely storing firearms -- gained just 31 
votes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Durbin said, ``with presidential leadership and  
public support, I think this Littleton, Colo., tragedy can 
galvanize the majority we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, who represents South  
Dakota, where guns are popular among ranchers and sportsmen, was 
skeptical about passing any new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that gun legislation is what we need,'' Daschle  
told reporters. He suggested the school shootings were more of a 
societal problem stemming from adults' neglect and violence in the 
media and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the kinds of things we better be looking at,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Molchan, director of the National Association of  
Federally Licensed Gun Dealers, said the 7,000 gun dealers he 
represents support a lifetime ban on gun ownership for anyone who 
commits a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Clinton's package, Molchan said, ``is an  
unfortunate diversion and, in our view, a dangerous diversion that 
takes energy, time and thought away from the real issues.'' 
</P>

	JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- His toes clinging to  
tiny knobs on the rock's face, Jake Safstrom reaches with one hand 
to clip his rope to a metal anchor bolt screwed into the rock. He 
inches to the next bolt and repeats the moves until he reaches the 
top of Headstone Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	The bolts left tacked along the route mean safety for Safstrom's  
ascent of a sheer cliff, so when Park Superintendent Ernia Quintana 
proposed a ban on bolts, citing environmental concerns, climbers 
around the country revolted. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, after a year of often bitter debate, park officials,  
climbers and environmentalists agreed on a plan that provides 
permits for installing new bolts and lifts restrictions on 
replacing old ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long, sometimes painful process, but we've been  
able to come together and come up with a plan that's both sensitive 
to the resources and friendly to the visitor,'' Quintana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Tree is the first national park to draw up a plan to  
supervise climbers, said Carol Anthony, a spokeswoman for the 
National Park Service in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could set a precedent for other parks balancing  
conservation needs with increased demands for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of climbers from around the world are drawn to Joshua  
Tree, about 150 miles east of Los Angeles, by some 4,000 climbing 
routes up hundreds of huge granite boulders and the mild desert 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	But as climbing's popularity has grown, so has its impact: feet  
trample fragile desert plants at the bases of climbs; gymnastic 
chalk used to dry sweaty hands marks the routes; and unofficial 
surveys say as many as 8,000 bolts litter the park's cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 1.4 million people visited Joshua Tree, and  
climbers made up the biggest share, said Assistant Superintendent 
Mary Risser. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sheer volume of the increase in recreational climbing was  
a red flag for us, and we said, 'Whoa, something needs to be 
done,''' Quintana said. ``So we said no bolts -- and that meant 
removing the ones that were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quintana and some environmental groups favored removable  
climbing hardware that would be removed by the last climber in each 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium came in December 1997. The next year, the U.S.  
Forest Service prohibited all bolts in its wilderness areas, 
arguing that the fixtures violated the 1964 Wilderness Act's ban on 
permanent improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Heated debate led Quintana to change his approach, and to the  
Forest Service rescinding its ban pending a study. 
</P>
<P>
	``They asked us to look at their climbing routes as vertical  
trails, so we did,'' Quintana said. ``It was an eye opener for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some climbers argued that since park officials place sign posts,  
walking bridges and other permanent fixtures along hiking trails 
through wilderness areas, there should be no objection to a 2 1/2-inch 
piece of metal that often can't be seen from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the compromise, to take effect by September, climbers can  
install new bolts after they receive approval from a 
yet-to-be-established climbing committee. Old bolts can be replaced 
without a permit. Climbers also are asked to replace shiny hardware 
and brightly colored webbing with less-noticeable materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that bolting can continue -- this route wouldn't be  
possible without bolts,'' Safstrom, 36, of Los Angeles said after 
his climb. ``It's a big safety issue.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Chernobyl radiation victims are still  
praying for better treatment. The leaky concrete-and-steel shelter 
covering the ruined reactor still needs repairs. And Ukraine says 
the plant won't be closed unless the West gives it $1.2 billion for 
two new reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 13th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, a  
grim legacy lingers from the explosion and fire at reactor No. 4 of 
Chernobyl's atomic power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident -- on April 26, 1986 -- sent a radioactive cloud over  
much of Europe and contaminated large areas in Ukraine, Russia and 
Belarus. The government now says 4,365 of those who took part in 
the hasty and poorly organized Soviet cleanup have died due to the 
disaster, and more than 70,000 Ukrainians are considered fully 
disabled by it. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991 provided hope  
for victims, offering promise that better treatment would be made 
available, that the protective cover would be made environmentally 
sound, and that an independent Ukraine would close the plant for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, those hopes have been unfulfilled.  
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has a terrible health legacy and scant finances to cope.  
Nearly 400,000 adults and 1.1 million children are entitled to 
government aid for Chernobyl-related health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuriy Shcherbak, a medic who wrote a book on Chernobyl and later  
served as Ukraine's ambassador in the United States, said the 
anniversary today brought him a sad feeling of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an undefeatable evil ... Chernobyl will continue to exist  
for an indefinite period of time, posing ever new problems for 
mankind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Urged by the West, Ukraine pledged to shut down the plant by  
2000. Now it seems unlikely that pledge will be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, President Leonid Kuchma said it flat out: Chernobyl  
will continue to operate until the West provides Ukraine with the 
estimated $1.2 billion necessary to complete two new nuclear 
reactors to compensate for the loss of the electricity Chernobyl 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Seven richest nations promised aid in 1995 to help  
Ukraine close Chernobyl, but the nation, strapped for energy and 
cash, has complained that the money has been slow in coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma says the G-7 also should help Ukraine build nuclear waste  
depositories and compensate the 6,200 Chernobyl employees who will 
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's arguments seem to be linked more to its desperate  
financial position than on energy problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is heavily dependent on its five nuclear plants -- but  
of its 14 working reactors, only one is at Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant once had four reactors and plans for more. After the  
accident, reactor No. 4 was out of action. Another of the plant's 
Soviet-made reactors has been inactive since a 1991 fire and a 
third was stopped in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The working reactor, No. 3, has its own troubles. It underwent  
repairs for nearly three months and was restarted in March, only to 
suffer a daylong shutdown over a turbine generator malfunction 
later that month. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is slow on making the shelter over the exploded reactor  
environmentally safe, although international donors have pledged 
$400 million. Safety concerns also have delayed construction. 
</P>
<P>
	That work ``might take 50 and even 100 years,'' according to  
Shcherbak, who is Ukraine's coordinator at Chernobyl talks with the 
G-7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian government says it is increasingly unable to bear  
the long-term costs of the disaster after spending $5.7 billion to 
deal with its consequences during Soviet times and more than $4 
billion from 1992-97. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ukraine's economy declining since the Soviet collapse,  
state funding covered only an average 51.6 percent of Chernobyl 
relief needs from 1996-98. This year's budget allocation of $443 
million is only a third of what is needed, according to Emergency 
Situations Minister Vasyl Durdynets. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Belarus on Sunday, 7,000 protesters marched  
through the capital of Minsk demanding more attention for accident 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern France, 400 people gathered Sunday near a nuclear  
reactor in Thionville to mark the Chernobyl anniversary and protest 
France's heavy reliance on atomic energy.

<HEADLINE> Detroit, County Sue Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit and its county sued the gun industry for  
more than $800 million Monday for ``the havoc wreaked'' by illegal 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was brought against 30 manufacturers, distributors  
and sellers. Wayne County, of which Detroit is a part, separately 
sued the industry, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The city said the industry should pay for ``the havoc wreaked on  
the city of Detroit by illegal handguns and other firearms that 
have been carelessly and recklessly sold to individuals who should 
not be armed in our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits did not specify the amount of damages, but lawyers  
said they could exceed $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry profits from the assaults, maimings and killings  
on the streets of our city and county,'' Detroit Mayor Dennis 
Archer said. ``Detroit and Wayne County have had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits are similar to the court actions that forced  
tobacco companies to pay billions of dollars for smoking-related 
health costs. Plaintiffs include Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, New 
Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn. and Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	A gun industry lobbying group said the lawsuits do nothing to  
prevent crime and would drive companies out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not one life will be saved by such lawsuits,'' said Jack  
Adkins, director of operations for the American Shooting Sports 
Council in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal jury in New York found nine gun makers  
liable for shootings. Three companies were ordered to pay $500,000 
to one of seven plaintiffs. The defendants planned to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Fundraiser Heads to Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Olympics lost their $2 billion man Monday,  
replaced by an up-and-coming administrator who helped bring NHL 
stars to the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, the chief fund-raiser of the U.S. Olympic  
Committee for 13 years, resigned to take a job running United 
Airlines' perks program for older frequent fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by Dave Ogrean, the executive director of USA  
Hockey and a former USOC broadcasting chief who has been touted as 
a potential executive director of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is official June 4, although Krimsky and Ogrean said  
a transition period will start immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of the deal maker who took Olympic marketing from  
small change to the corporate suite was a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky had been at the core of efforts to rebuild the games'  
image and sponsor confidence following the bribery scandal stemming 
from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was there and would be there, and enjoy the glory  
and success of the games in 2002, then hang up his skates,'' said 
Dick Pound, an International Olympic Committee vice president from 
Canada and its marketing chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky's efforts to corral sponsors had become more difficult  
since the scandal broke in late November, and last week the USOC 
took the unusual step of hiring International Marketing Group to 
help sign new business partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Krimsky insisted his decision to leave was not colored by  
the worst corruption case in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys conducted for the USOC found 96 percent of Americans  
retained confidence in the games, their athletes and sponsors, he 
said. And while OPUS, the joint USOC-Salt Lake marketing plan 
Krimsky headed, still has $300 million to raise, the departing boss 
said revenues were on target with three years to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes made in the wake of the bribery case, including new  
leadership of the Salt Lake Olympic organization by venture 
capitalist Mitt Romney, left the Olympic community stronger, 
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're beyond the scandal,'' he said. ``This doesn't mean there  
are problems with the USOC. It says we're open for business. We 
have a strong property. Clearly, it has been burned by the scandal 
but it has come out of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky, who helped raise $2 billion for U.S. Olympic programs,  
noted that his contract was to expire next year and the offer to 
become president and CEO of Relationship Management Programs Inc., 
would have been gone by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogrean, who helped negotiate the agreement with the National  
Hockey League that brought the sport's top stars to the Winter 
Olympics for the first time last year, said the scandal had created 
marketing problems, but none insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a relief pitcher coming in with a couple of men on  
base,'' Ogrean said. ``But the apparatus in place gives me a great 
deal of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky's departure continues a major shakeup at the highest  
ranks of the worldwide Olympic community, which has become a 
billion-dollar business the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have been expelled or resigned because of the  
scandal, the largest purge in the committee's 105 years. Romney's 
appointment as SLOC CEO followed the ouster of the two top 
officials of the city's Olympic committee, Tom Welch and Dave 
Johnson, and the resignation of Welch's successor as president, 
Frank Joklik. 
</P>
<P>
	More changes are expected once a reform commission recommends  
new rules late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogrean led the campaign that elected Bill Hybl USOC president in  
1996. In following Krimsky, he succeeds a man who built a 
reputation for shrewd dealing, such as getting the USOC as much 
from money IOC sponsorships as the rest of the world combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tough,'' Pound said. ``He often negotiates on a basis  
that suggests he's not as flexible as he really is. But his aim is 
clearly to make a deal. To not bring home a deal is a failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the Olympics will miss Krimsky's strengths.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has a lot of international experience, especially for  
someone in a national position in the United States,'' the IOC 
executive said. ``He has a pretty good knowledge of the Olympic 
movement. He knows the sort of things sponsors need to make their 
presentations effective.''

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Killing Pastor </HEADLINE>

<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A choir member who shot his pastor to death  
in church after a Bible class on the afterlife was sentenced Monday 
to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``You killed the messenger, but the message will go on,'' the  
Rev. Andrew Lofton's daughter, Candace Henry, told Kenneth Nance. 
``The devil did not win this round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nance, 59, pleaded guilty to murdering Lofton, 65, at Christ  
Temple Apostolic Faith Church in suburban Trotwood last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance sat quietly during the Bible class while Lofton explained  
the Book of Revelation and urged his students to prepare for the 
afterlife. After class, Nance pulled a gun and shot the pastor 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the shooting may have been prompted by  
unspecified religious differences between the two men.

<HEADLINE> Union Carbide Earnings Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Union Carbide Corp.'s profits fell sharply  
in the first quarter, hurt by price declines, increased raw 
material costs and an accounting charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street expectations, but the company's  
stock price sagged as Union Carbide officials said they didn't know 
how long the decline in prices might last. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income was $51 million, or 38 cents per share, compared to  
$142 million, or $1.01 per share, a year ago. The results were 
reduced by a charge of $20 million, or 14 cents per share, for a 
required change in accounting principle for start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the accounting charge, the chemicals company would have  
earned $71 million, or 52 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 7 cents a share ahead of the 45 cents that analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected without the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 10 percent in the first quarter to $1.40 billion,  
compared to $1.56 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide chairman and chief executive William H. Joyce said  
the results were hurt by price declines in polyester glycol and 
increased raw material costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joyce said it was it was tough to get a clear picture on the  
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know how long the current spike in raw material  
costs will last or how much of the increases will be offset by 
higher product prices, in addition to cost savings.'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was enough to send Union Carbide's stock 5.6 percent lower.  
It was down $2.87 1/2 a share at $48.87 1/2 in afternoon trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

	Yugoslavia May Accept U.N. Presence  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia Deputy Premier Vuk  
Draskovic said today his government is ready to accept a peace deal 
calling for a U.N. presence that would include troops from NATO 
countries if necessary. Draskovic, speaking at a news conference, 
said he believed he was expressing the views of President Slobodan 
Milosevic, who has rejected all proposals for foreign troops. ``My 
personal right is to wish no participation of NATO countries in 
U.N. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,'' he said. ``But if the 
Security Council of the U.N. says the U.N. mission must composed on 
the basis of part of NATO countries, we must respect that.''

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three American POWs captured by  
Yugoslav forces in disputed circumstances a month ago and not seen 
in public since were briefly visited today by the head of the Red 
Cross. Cornelio Sommaruga said a full visit in accordance with the 
Geneva war conventions was not possible but that he hoped a doctor 
would visit the soldiers tomorrow. Refugees continue to flow out of 
Kosovo, and the U.N. refugee agency said there were credible 
reports that ethnic Albanian women and children are being held as 
human shields by Serbian soldiers at an ammunition depot in Kosovo.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who carried out the  
attack at Columbine High dreamed of an even bigger bloodbath, 
plotting to kill hundreds of neighbors, then hijack a plane and 
crash it into New York City, investigators say. Authorities also 
are questioning an 18-year-old girl about whether she bought two of 
the guns used in the rampage. ``They wanted to kill 500 people, 
hijack a plane and take it to New York City,'' sheriff's department 
spokesman Steve Davis. The diary plotting the mayhem in precise 
detail, bomb-making materials and weapons were found in gunman Eric 
Harris' bedroom.

	Court To Make FDA-Tobacco Decision

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today stepped into a major  
dispute over smoking, agreeing to decide whether the Food and Drug 
Administration can regulate tobacco as part of the government's 
crackdown on cigarette sales to minors. The decision is ``the most

	FDA Approves Fat-Blocking Diet Drug

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dieters today won the first medication that  
does more than suppress appetite, a pill that blocks absorption of 
almost a third of the fat they eat. The Food and Drug 
Administration approved Xenical, 2 1/2 years after Hoffman-La Roche 
Inc. first sought to sell the drug, a delay largely caused by 
questions about whether the new diet pill might contribute to 
breast cancer. But the FDA ultimately decided the pill was safe,

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A psychologist told a jury today that  
``The Jenny Jones Show'' played Russian roulette by not screening 
its guests for mental illness beforehand. Michael Abramsky 
testified for the family of Scott Amedure, a gay man who was killed 
by Jonathan Schmitz in 1995 after Amedure revealed a crush on 
Schmitz during a taping of the show. Amedure's family is suing the

<HEADLINE> Richardson Addresses AP Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Americans and Congress should be patient until  
the goals of NATO missions in Yugoslavia are met and the ``ethnic 
cleansing'' by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is stopped, 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, who is also former U.S. ambassador to the United  
Nations, was the luncheon speaker Monday at the annual meeting of 
The Associated Press, attended by executives representing 1,545 
daily newspapers that belong to the news cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the importance of NATO leaders meeting last weekend in  
Washington to mark the group's 50th anniversary was that it 
solidified the 19 nations in their fight against Milosevic; 
convinced them that the air strikes were working, and confirmed 
that the air strikes would continue to intensify. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting to prevail,'' said Richardson, who as a  
seven-term congressman from New Mexico embarked on sometimes 
unorthodox and unofficial diplomatic missions to Iraq, North Korea, 
Cuba and Sudan. In the last of those visits he negotiated the 
freedom of three American Red Cross workers. 
</P>
<P>
	As energy secretary, he said, he cannot negotiate with  
Milosevic. But he said the International Committee of the Red Cross 
was promised a second, private visit Tuesday with the three POW 
soldiers held in Belgrade. A Red Cross official visited with the 
soldiers Monday, but in the presence of Yugoslav officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Jesse Jackson was on his way to Belgrade to meet  
with Milosevic, a mission not encouraged or discouraged by the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	On the topic of espionage at U.S. nuclear facilities, Richardson  
said security had been lax over the past few years, despite a 
presidential directive to tighten it, and information about 
important nuclear weapons was released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secrets were compromised,'' said Richardson, who became energy  
secretary last August. ``They were compromised and accelerated 
China's nuclear development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that now scientists who work on sensitive weapons  
undergo polygraph tests; the counter-intelligence budget has 
tripled over the past few years, and background checks are required 
on scientists from sensitive countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Richardson said, he ordered a shutdown of DOE  
computers linked to nuclear weapons information so that their 
security could be measured and upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	He said calls in Congress, as a result of the Chinese spying  
issue, for a moratorium on scientists visiting from other countries 
``are politically popular and may get votes in the Congress, but 
they hurt our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants Russian scientists to visit U.S. labs to learn  
about nuclear safety and nuclear collaboration, not proliferation. 
He said the United States gets reciprocal visits with Chinese labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way to deal with China is not to isolate,'' he said. ``The  
way to deal with China is to debate with them, to include them in 
the international community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Russia's declining economy -- more than 120 million  
Russians currently live in poverty -- threatens the United States 
because Russia has the second-largest nuclear arsenal in the world 
and up to 20,000 nuclear scientists face unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The least thing we want is a terrorist or some sort of  
degrading of a Russian nuclear city,'' he said. ``All it takes is a 
softball of plutonium -- a theft of that softball on the black 
market -- to cause America and the West grave national security 
threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States is involved in cooperative agreements  
with Russia, totaling $1 billion over several years, to safeguard 
nuclear facilities and make sure scientists are paid or working. 
Otherwise, they may be tempted by offers from Korea or Iraq to 
defect with their secrets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's name has surfaced as a possible vice presidential  
candidate on Al Gore's ticket, but he refused to answer a question 
on whether he'd accept the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to duck that question,'' he said.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Thousands of Roman Catholics filed past  
the tomb of slain Bishop Juan Gerardi on Monday, laying red 
carnations on the human rights crusader's grave to mark the first 
anniversary of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning at dawn, a six-hour procession of mourners filed  
through the crypt as priests and nuns sang and prayed for the 
memory of Gerardi, 75, who was bludgeoned to death April 26, 1998, 
at his residence in Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Mario Rios Montt, who took over Gerardi's position as  
head of the Archdiocese Human Rights Office, called on the city's 
faithful at a Mass for Gerardi on Sunday to ``maintain our unity in 
faith and love to show our gratitude to God ... and for the 
advancement of Guatemala.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has continued about possible political motives in  
the slaying. Gerardi was killed two days after presenting a report 
blaming the army and paramilitary patrols for the vast majority of 
human rights abuses during Guatemala's 36-year civil war.

unable to reach the area where the Cessna training plane crashed on

	Finance ministers and Central Bank presidents from the two  
countries will meet to ``analyze and adjust'' their policies, 
Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said. No date was set.

	Lampreia met Monday with his Argentine counterpart Guido di  
Tella, part of a series of meetings to improve tense relations. 
</P>

the murders of 17 farmworkers have been released from prison, two

<P>
	The releases Sunday bring to 15 the number of those convicted  
but later freed in the case. Four others were released last week. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are likely to reinforce the widespread belief that  
low-ranking officers were forced to take the blame while their 
superiors avoided prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Police opened fire on two buses on June 28, 1995, at a police  
roadblock set up to prevent farmworkers from attending a leftist 
political rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen other former officers convicted either have not  
appealed their convictions or have had similar appeals rejected, 
meaning they will have to serve out their 18-year sentences.

<HEADLINE> Court To Mediate Calif. Propisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court Monday granted Gov.  
Gray Davis' request for mediation in the dispute over Proposition 
187, the divisive 1994 measure barring illegal immigrants from 
attending public school or receiving other state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means a mediator will try to get both sides to  
reach a compromise over Proposition 187. Mediation is not binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187, which bars illegal immigrants from receiving  
public schooling and non-emergency health care, was approved by 59 
percent of the voters, but virtually all of it has been blocked by 
the federal courts from taking effect in a legal battle that is 
still going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a Democrat who took office earlier this year, opposed  
Proposition 187. His predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson, backed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidestepping a politically fraught issue, Davis proposed that  
the dispute be submitted to mediation, a process that is typically 
used to resolve matters such as attorney fees and other disputes 
that involve money. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' chief mediator  
said the case was selected for the court's mediation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' decision to seek mediation has been criticized by backers  
of Proposition 187, who contend the state has a duty to defend the 
measure. Some of the civil rights groups challenging the measure 
have also been critical, saying the constitutionality of a law 
cannot be resolved by mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower-court judge has ruled that the core provisions of  
Proposition 187 amount to an attempt to regulate immigration, an 
area that is the exclusive responsibility of the federal 
government. In addition, the ban on public schooling was found to 
conflict with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down an 
identical prohibition in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Sharon Browne of the Pacific Legal Foundation, which  
represents sponsors of Proposition 187, criticized the mediation 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the backers of the measure have been denied status as  
parties to the case, she said, they will not be allowed to take 
part in the mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this does is leave Proposition 187 basically undefended  
in the mediation hearing, because the governor has made it clear he 
opposes the philosophy behind Proposition 187,'' she said. ``I just 
don't see how it can be a fair mediation.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Talks Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They argued about it after children fell  
in Jonesboro, in Paducah, in Springfield and in Edinboro. They 
agonized after gunfire ended lives in San Ysidro and Stockton, in 
Killeen and on the Long Island Rail Road. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after the massacre last Tuesday in Littleton, souls are  
being searched and hands wrung once more. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, both sides of the gun lobby see something  
different. Whatever the cause -- the gunmen's ferocity, the sight of 
dead children, the firepower involved or just the excruciating 
repetition -- Columbine's bloodshed may have changed the terms of 
the argument for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably turned a corner last Tuesday,'' said Allegra  
``Happy'' Haynes, president of Denver's City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's turned the debate around 180 degrees,'' acknowledged  
Dudley Brown, executive director of the 5,000-member Rocky Mountain 
Gun Owners, an advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore heard the emotion. As he walked down the  
street toward Columbine after Sunday's memorial service, someone in 
the crowd shouted at him: ``Stop the NRA!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, which had scheduled a major gun  
show and annual meeting in downtown Denver this weekend, has scaled 
back plans sharply. Mayor Wellington Webb wants more: He's offered 
to reimburse the NRA's costs if it stays away. And anti-gun groups 
plan to protest the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Colorado Legislature, two bills to loosen gun  
restrictions were pulled by sponsors within a day after Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris, their bodies draped with guns and bombs, 
shot 13 people and themselves to death inside Columbine on April 
20. Before the shootings, the bills had been expected to sail 
through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident is going to demonstrate that there's a much  
broader public out there that is not high on the idea of everybody 
and anybody walking the streets -- the entire citizenry -- fully 
armed,'' said Haynes, who plans a resolution asking for citizens' 
help in battling violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been in the wild, wild West for a long, long  
time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what has long vexed Colorado: the perception, real or  
imagined, of a pioneer region where rugged individualists did what 
they had to do to settle the frontier, and used guns along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that notion, longtime Coloradans say, was justified. But  
the massive influx of new residents, especially from the coasts, 
has suburbanized the state to the point where the gun culture has 
ebbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new Westerner's relationship with the land is the  
cross-country ski and the backpack, not the gun,'' said William 
Riebsame, a cultural geographer at the University of Colorado and 
co-author of ``The Atlas of the New West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Westerners are responding differently to these issues than  
they did even 20 years ago,'' he said. ``You might say there's a 
kinder, gentler West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the very idea of reactive post-Columbine legislation  
chills Second Amendment activists. Legal guns, they say, didn't 
cause the massacre. But they recognize the emotional and political 
fallout that Klebold's and Harris' weaponry -- a semiautomatic 
handgun, a short-muzzled carbine and sawed-off shotguns -- 
unleashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people in the gun community who are a lot  
more timid about their gun rights after last week,'' Brown said. 
``It's going to be a part of the debate, in one form or another, 
for the next 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People upset about Columbine are arguing about the same things  
far beyond Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voices from the American people are starting to rise. People  
are starting to say, `Wait a minute,''' said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, 
D-N.Y., who became a congresswoman after her husband and five other 
passengers were shot and killed on the Long Island Rail Road in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the nation, gun-control advocates are describing  
Columbine as the final straw -- the time when action became an 
imperative rather than a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun bills have been killed or delayed in Alabama and Michigan  
because of the massacre. President Clinton says he'll press for 
legislation that would crack down on gun shows and illegal gun 
trafficking, make it tougher for violent kids to buy guns and close 
loopholes that let juveniles own assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a day of the shootings, Colorado Republican state Rep.  
Doug Dean, under pressure from both sides, said he would withdraw 
his bill to ease the issuance of concealed-weapons permits. 
Republican Rep. Gary McPherson decided to abandon a bill to allow 
the state to override local weapons ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gov. Bill Owens plans to veto a bill on his desk that would  
bar local entities from filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	These bills -- and the debate they provoked even before the  
shootings -- may add staying power to the conversation of recent 
days in both Colorado's cities and its rapidly expanding suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Urban cores have always had a stronger propensity to be  
opposed to a proliferation of guns,'' said Webb, Denver's mayor. 
``Now suburban areas are raising the same questions. When you start 
burying your kids, you start having that debate real quick.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tax Audits Target Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese investors in China are being  
singled out in the latest Chinese crackdown on tax evaders, forcing 
some businesses to close because they aren't able to pay massive 
tax bills, a newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is further dampening Taiwanese interest in  
investing in China, evidenced by a major decline in new Taiwanese 
investments in the mainland between September and January, the 
China Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Economics Ministry officials were not immediately available to  
comment on the report. Official statistics on Taiwanese investment 
in China are considered unreliable because many businesses don't 
declare their investments here. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for Taiwan's Chinese National Federation of  
Industries said investors in China have reported a recent tax 
auditing drive. Closures, however, may simply be a ruse to avoid 
paying tax, said Teng Chih-hung, a specialist with the federation's 
mainland China division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taiwanese companies have lots of ways to avoid paying tax. For  
example, they can deliberately let a company fail and pay no tax, 
while funneling the capital away and secretly opening another 
company elsewhere,'' said Teng. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies funded with Taiwanese investment are prime targets for  
auditors because most are medium- and small-sized groups that use 
bribes and connections with Chinese officials to avoid paying 
taxes, the China Times article said. They sometimes issue 
counterfeit receipts to give the appearance of legitimacy, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese oil importers and automotive parts makers are special  
targets of the current drive, along with shoe manufacturers, the 
report said, quoting unidentified Taiwanese investors in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese investors have sunk an estimated $30 billion into  
China. But since last fall, new investments have fallen by as much 
as 75 percent each month from the same period a year before, the 
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Car Production Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Auto production in Japan fell to its lowest level  
in 20 years for the fiscal year ending in March because of slumping 
sales hurt by a recession at home and throughout ailing Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Production for fiscal 1998 totaled 9.97 million, down 7.5  
percent from 10.78 million in 1997, the trade group Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The level for the year marked the first drop in three years and  
was the lowest for auto production in Japan since fiscal 1978, when 
8.95 million vehicles were produced. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese auto production has been dragged down by a recession at  
home as well as the regional economic turmoil that has damped auto 
sales throughout Asia. Japanese automakers have also been shifting 
production abroad as part of their business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunging production is likely to increase pressures for cuts in  
the work force at automakers. Troubled Nissan Motor Co. has said it 
will decrease its office staff worldwide by 10 percent, or 5,000 
workers, by March 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	For March, domestic vehicle production rose 3.8 percent from the  
same month a year ago to 1.01 million -- the first time in five 
months that domestic automobile production rose -- the association 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic vehicle demand in March totaled 830,958, down 2.1  
percent from a year earlier. The association estimated vehicle 
exports in March dropped about 2 percent. It is releasing export 
figures later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said that auto production for the latest fiscal  
year was lower than that of the previous fiscal year at all 
automakers, except for Daihatsu, a minicar-maker that is a Toyota 
affiliate, and Nissan Diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Output at Toyota Motor Corp. was down by about 10 percent to  
3.09 million vehicles, the association said. Production at Nissan 
Motor Co. fell 9 percent to 1.53 million, while production at Honda 
Motor Co. shrank 8 percent to 1.22 million.

<HEADLINE> First Union To Buy Everen Brokerage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Pushing its rapid expansion deep into the  
nation's heartland, the First Union banking company has agreed to 
buy Everen Capital Corp., a major midwestern brokerage, for $1.1 
billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Monday would give First Union a more  
national platform for its brokerage services thanks to Everen's 
vast presence west of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of First Union's investment brokerage operations are found  
in the eastern half of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Everen has offices in 28 states and more than 1,800 investment  
consultants, with the highest concentration in Illinois, 
California, Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	After the acquisition, the combined company would have 3 million  
brokerage accounts with $147 billion in assets. That would make 
First Union, already the nation's sixth largest banking concern, 
the sixth-largest brokerage as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an excellent partnership that gives First Union a  
nationwide securities business,'' said Ken Thompson, vice chairman 
of First Union, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes about a year after a merger agreement between  
Citicorp and Travelers Group set off a round of corporate marriages 
by major financial companies aimed at expanding their reach and 
product offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before that, however, First Union had embarked on an  
aggressive East Coast expansion, purchasing other regional banks 
such as CoreStates Financial, First Fidelity and Signet Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	But for First Union, which entered the brokerage business less  
than two years ago with its purchase of Wheat First Butcher Singer, 
the acquisition of Everen also represents another foothold in a 
more profitable sector of the financial services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are plenty of banks to buy, but I don't know if many of  
them have the growth profile (First Union) is looking for,'' said 
John Moore, an industry analyst for Wachovia Securities in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they are looking for are subsidiaries that grow faster  
than the banking industry,'' Moore said, noting that the Everen 
deal would give First Union one of the highest percentages of 
non-interest income in the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, responding to a question at the annual shareholder  
meeting, First Union chairman Ed Crutchfield said one way for his 
company to expand without merging with large banks would be to 
purchase brokerage firms and other financial institutions. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Case Against Microsoft Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Testimony released Monday in the Microsoft  
antitrust case from one of the nation's largest computer makers 
appears to support government complaints that Microsoft imposes 
unduly tight restrictions on companies that sell its Windows 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior executive for Packard Bell NEC Inc., Mal Ransom, said  
Microsoft can afford to be so demanding because Windows is ``the 
only viable choice'' among today's computer operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Packard Bell NEC official, Jon Kies, told lawyers that  
requests for Microsoft to be flexible, such as allowing 
installation of some parts of Windows for some customers, are met 
with the question: ``What is the benefit to Microsoft?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we cannot find or provide a solid benefit to Microsoft,  
then there's not much likelihood that the request is going to be 
granted,'' said Kies, a senior product manager. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft illegally wields its influence as the manufacturer of 
Windows, the software used to run most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it complains that forcing computer makers to  
distribute Microsoft's Web browsing software, called Internet 
Explorer, with Windows discourages them from giving away rival 
Internet software, such as Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an ideal choice, what we would most prefer is if we had  
Netscape and IE available to the end user during the installation 
process such that a prompt would come up and ask the question 
'Which browser would you like installed at this time?''' Kies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransom, a senior vice president of marketing, said it makes no  
sense to offer both software products because they're so similar: 
``It's kind of like which brand of water do you want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts from the interviews with the Packard Bell NEC  
executives were released Monday, among the first of more than 90 
taken in preparation for the trial. The rest, including those of 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, were expected to be made public this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled this year that an obscure 1913 law  
allows the public to read transcripts from those depositions, from 
some of the high-tech industry's most powerful players. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony from a third Packard Bell NEC employee, Mark Donahue,  
was considerably more favorable toward Microsoft. He told 
government lawyers that Packard Bell NEC would consider installing 
rival operating system software on its notebook computers ``if 
enough customers asked for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also acknowledged that, ``I have no knowledge of  
customers asking for anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue, a senior product manager, also said he had talked with  
three Microsoft employees about being compelled to testify under 
subpoena and told them: ``My personal opinion was that I did not 
understand the government's position in this whole matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a bizarre twist, Donahue confessed that one request his  
company made to Microsoft actually was aimed at limiting consumer 
choice. It wanted to remove Microsoft's list of Internet providers 
from Windows and substitute its own, but Microsoft balked. 
</P>
<P>
	Karma Giulianelli, a Justice Department lawyer, asked how  
Microsoft's decision affected Packard Bell NEC's ability to make 
sales deals for itself with Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose it allows for multiple choices for the end user,  
whereas Packard Bell NEC would like to limit the choices to the end 
user for the purpose of signing up for an online service,'' Donahue 
answered bluntly, adding that the request was motivated by 
``financial reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his own interview days later, Kies said he read Donahue's  
remarks and told him: ``How should I say it? That he did not appear 
to be giving either counsel a very easy time with the discussion 
during the deposition.''

<HEADLINE> Missionary Accused of Molestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Six women have accused an 87-year-old former  
minister of molesting them years ago at a school for missionary 
children in Africa, a newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were brought to Dallas last week as part of a church  
investigation into allegations against the Rev. Bill Pruitt, a 
retired associate pastor of Highland Park Presbyterian Church in 
Dallas, The Dallas Morning News said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruitt was a Presbyterian missionary in the former Belgian Congo  
from 1945 until 1970 when similar allegations by other women forced 
him to quit. He was also a dormitory supervisor at a boarding 
school for missionary children in Kinshasa, Congo, where the six 
women all were students. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said there is no indication of any criminal  
charges or civil complaints pending against Pruitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruitt would not comment and referred questions to a regional  
church governing body, the Grace Presbytery. His wife, Virginia, 
denied the allegations and said they were ``absolutely stunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the presbytery, the Rev. David H. Wasserman, told  
The Associated Press on Monday he could neither confirm nor deny 
any investigation, but said all allegations of such misconduct must 
be taken seriously and investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruitt, who eventually arrived in Dallas to serve at the  
Highland Park church, retired in 1985, according to church 
officials.

<HEADLINE> Mary Slaney Gets Two-Year Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Mary Slaney was given a retroactive  
two-year ban today after an arbitration panel found her guilty of 
taking banned drugs before the 1996 U.S. Olympics trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation decision, for  
which is there is no appeal, scraps from the record books Slaney's 
performances between June 1996 and June 1998 -- including the silver 
medal she won for the 1,500 meters at the 1997 World Indoor 
Championships in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed the ban after the arbitration panel said there  
was ``failure to establish by clear evidence that an abnormal T-E 
test was attributable to pathological or physiological 
conditions,'' according to IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney had expected the ruling, her lawyer said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that this was where this was headed,'' attorney  
Jim Coleman said. ``They weren't interested in whether the test was 
valid. They were simply trying to find a way to get out of this 
mess they got themselves into. They decided the way to get out of 
it is to simply dump on Mary and try to save their tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, had claimed that the widely-used  
testosterone-epitestosterone test is unreliable for women who are 
taking the birth control pill in their late 30s or 40s, an argument 
refuted by the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the IAAF said the decision by USA Track &AMP; Field  
on Sept. 16, 1997, to clear Slaney of an offense was ``erroneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF said it was imposing a retroactive ban from June 17,  
1996, the day of the positive test, until June 16, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of this decision, all results and awards that Mary  
Decker Slaney may have obtained in competition during her period of 
ineligibility are to be considered null and void,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF said the ruling was ``final and binding'' on all  
parties, with no right of appeal . 
</P>
<P>
	The decision ends Slaney's long-running case.  
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, considered the greatest women's distance runner in U.S.  
history and a world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters in 1983, 
gave a urine sample during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials that showed 
a T-E ratio above the 6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E test, used by many sports, detects the presence of  
testosterone, a naturally occurring muscle-building hormone that is 
also taken in concentrated form to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF, track's world governing body, suspended Slaney,  
claiming that USATF was dragging in investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF had imposed its own suspension. But Slaney, backed by her  
sponsor Nike, challenged the ruling, and in September 1997 the U.S. 
federation cleared her. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF later also cleared Slaney to compete, but referred the  
case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney's lawyers sought to stop the hearing earlier this month,  
filing suit in an Indianapolis court against the IAAF and U.S. 
Olympic Committee, which administered the original test. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said today's ruling did not affect the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine what they will do is file a motion arguing that the  
court doesn't have jurisdiction,'' he said. ``So we'll brief that 
and then sometime probably this summer the court will decide 
whether it has jurisdiction. ... I would be very surprised if this 
case ever went to trial once the court decides that it has 
jurisdiction, because they can't afford to have the case tried in 
public. They don't want that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitration panel originally sat in January, but reconvened  
Saturday after lawyers from both sides requested more time to 
collect evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three judges decided Slaney's fate: Germany's Christoph Vedder,  
the panel's chairman; Robert Ellicott of Australia, and Singapore's 
Lin Kokloh.

<HEADLINE> FAA Delays New Radar Installation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new radar system designed to control planes  
within 50 miles of an airport is behind schedule, prompting the 
government to announce Monday that it would test the $1 billion 
system at smaller airports and temporarily replace units at busier 
airports with existing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said its  
Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System -- due to have 
entered civilian service in Boston last December -- will now be 
installed at a schedule and program cost that will not be divulged 
until later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests of the new equipment will also be conducted at less busy  
air traffic control centers in Syracuse, N.Y., and El Paso, Texas, 
starting late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, aged controller displays at the New York area,  
Dallas-Forth Worth and Washington, D.C., airports will be replaced 
with color controller displays previously developed by Lockheed 
Martin starting in the summer of 2000. Reagan National Airport in 
Washington was to have received the first new color controller 
displays by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary equipment will also be used in two new air traffic  
control centers being built to control planes over northern 
California and northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussing the prospect of delays earlier this month, the FAA  
said development of its new STARS system is running behind schedule 
because changes requested by air traffic controllers have slowed 
the computers' response times. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement with the FAA, Mike McNally, president of  
the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said: ``STARS is 
the platform of the future for terminal air traffic control, and 
this is the right approach -- taking the time to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	STARS is being developed for the FAA and the Defense Department  
by the Raytheon Co. Electronic Systems Division in Marlboro, Mass. 
It will provide new computer hardware displays, keyboards, 
processors and software for up to 172 FAA and 199 Defense 
Department terminal control facilities, which handle planes shortly 
after takeoff or just before landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing equipment, the Automated Radar Terminal Systems, or  
ARTS, is based on technology developed in the 1970s and 1980s. It 
consists of displays, computers and software acquired over two 
decades, resulting in a hodgepodge of equipment nearing the end of 
its useful life. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system will provide greater uniformity, capacity and  
backup, which have been deemed priorities since the number of 
airline passengers is expected to grow from 600 million to nearly 
800 million by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the delays, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said Monday:  
``We are committed to a successful implementation of the full 
STARS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA is also replacing the computers used by controllers in  
en route centers, which control planes between terminal control 
facilities. In addition, the agency is developing technology that 
will allow pilots to use the satellite-based Global Positioning 
System for pinpoint navigation and more precise landings at an 
increased number of airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's technological upgrades have been plagued by costly  
delays. The STARS project, for example, is expected to cost $2.2 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Deal Made on Phone Locating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Dazed and bleeding so heavily she  
couldn't see, Zoya Moghaddas dialed 911 on her cellular phone after 
smashing her car into a tree last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she waited. And waited.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten squad cars and a helicopter spent almost an hour searching  
before they found the semiconscious woman, because she didn't know 
where she was and dispatchers couldn't track her through her 
cellular telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 10 miles away from the accident, a team of engineers  
at SnapTrack were perfecting a patented system about the size of 
two dimes that will put an end to the technological glitches that 
have led to hundreds of potentially life-threatening delays. 
</P>
<P>
	SnapTrack said Monday it had struck a licensing agreement with  
Motorola, a deal that comes on the heels of a strategic investment 
by Texas Instruments. Under the arrangements, SnapTrack's devices 
should end up in more than half of all cellular telephones in the 
world, with the first phones appearing on the market within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what we have now, we could have been able to locate that  
woman who hit the tree in San Jose within about three seconds,'' 
said Ellen Kirk, a SnapTrack vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology will help wireless carriers meet the Federal  
Communications Commission's mandate to locate wireless callers 
requesting 911 service by Oct. 1, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other companies have come up with different solutions to  
the mandate, but to date, none have been as ready for market, 
inexpensive and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of 911 calls in the country -- about 98,000 a  
day -- are made on wireless telephones. In most cases, callers are 
able to tell dispatchers where they are. 
</P>
<P>
	But in all too many situations, emergency crews waste precious  
minutes searching for their victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Moghaddas survived the accident in San Jose and has been  
successfully treated and released. Others have not been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, a Fort Wayne, Ind., man died in a car accident after  
using his cellular phone to call for help. Police said they 
couldn't locate Jon Charleston, 49, for two hours. When they 
finally found him, after using sirens and listening for the sound 
over Charleston's cell phone to locate the wreckage, he was already 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Six days later, a 911 caller injured in a car wreck sent  
Montpelier, Vt., emergency crews toward a mile marker on the wrong 
interstate. A second crew was sent to the correct spot, in time to 
save the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``That sort of thing can happen,'' said Montpelier Assistant  
Fire Chief Chris Reed. ``It's obviously much better if we don't 
(get sent to incorrect locations). We don't have enough resources 
to be more than one place at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SnapTrack's system uses the U.S. Department of Defense's Global  
Positioning System, a $10 billion navigation satellite network. The 
digital signal processing chips can be installed in wireless phones 
for about $10 each, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a clear view of the sky, the SnapTrack system will provide  
location accurate to less than five meters, according to recent 
in-house tests. When blocked by trees or other obstacles, accuracy 
is expected to be about 50 meters.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Assembles Team for O's Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Star shortstop German Mesa, pitcher Jose Contreras  
and third baseman Omar Linares are among 48 players being 
considered by Cuban officials for an all-star team that will visit 
the Baltimore Orioles on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government does not intend to announce the exact  
25-man roster until shortly before next Monday night's exhibition 
game at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each plans their strategy to their goals and ours is to  
maintain our continental and world supremacy,'' the Communist Party 
workers' daily newspaper Trabajadores said Monday. ``No one shows 
their cards and this is no exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras struck out 10 in eight scoreless innings against the  
Orioles on March 28 in Havana, a game the Cubans lost 3-2 in 11 
innings. Linares, one of the country's greatest players ever, hit a 
key RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team that played that afternoon at Latinoamericano  
Stadium did not include some of the island's top players, who were 
involved at the time in the national baseball series. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa was among those who missed out. He started ahead of future  
Gold Glove shortstop Rey Ordonez of the New York Mets when they 
both played on the Havana Industriales. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this year, a Cuban national team will play in the Pan  
American Games in Winnipeg, Alberta, and the International Cup in 
Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of about 300 Cubans will travel to Baltimore on May  
2. In addition to the team, the group will include retired baseball 
players and members of youth teams. 
</P>
<P>
	It has not been announced which Cuban officials will make the  
trip to Baltimore. Among those most likely to go are Humberto 
Rodriguez, director of Cuba's National Institute of Sports, and 
National Baseball Commissioner Carlos Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Union City, N.J. on Monday, Assemblyman  
Raul ``Rudy'' Garcia and representatives from the United Cuban 
Organizations, an umbrella group of about 30 Cuban-American clubs 
representing thousands of people, announced a scheduled protest at 
the May 3 game. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who is also the mayor of Union City and whose family  
escaped from Cuba in 1968, said the timing of the games parallels a 
United Nations report that condemned president Fidel Castro for 
human rights violations, such as jailing dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to send a strong message that we're against  
this,'' Garcia said of the contact between the countries through 
baseball. ``We don't want this to be the beginning of the end of 
sanctions against Cuba.''

become the world's top-ranked tennis player next week -- even if he 
loses again. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras, currently No. 1, has withdrawn from his defense of  
the Atlanta clay court tournament this week because of a back 
injury, which likely will keep him sidelined until next month's 
Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Sampras automatically loses 172 ranking points and  
will drop to 3,367, while Kafelnikov, who has none to lose, will at 
least remain unchanged with 3,382. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the Australian Open in January, the Russian has had  
several chances to replace Sampras as No. 1 but has squandered them 
all. He has been in poor form since winning an indoor tournament in 
London two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov lost his opening matches at Indian Wells, Key  
Biscayne, Estoril, Barcelona and Monte Carlo and goes into this 
week's Czech Open clay court tournament as the top seed because of 
his No. 2 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has been No. 1 for 267 weeks during his career and is  
four weeks away from breaking Ivan Lendl's record of 270.

<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Jump Networks Inc., which provides address  
books and calendars over the Internet, is being acquired by 
Microsoft Corp. to augment the MSN network. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint announcement Monday said the deal would provide MSN  
customers with a combination of electronic mail, chat rooms and 
appointment event and task listings that can be shared among 
individuals and groups. Terms of the acquisition were not 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The service will make it easier to notify consumers of future  
events in which they may be interested and allow automatic purchase 
of goods and services, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jump's services will be folded into MSN Hotmail, a free  
Web-based e-mail service with 40 million subscribers, said Marty 
Taucher, director of MSN network communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither MSN nor Jump, founded last year, is currently  
profitable, Taucher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jump's work force, fewer than 20 people, will move from their

<HEADLINE> Orioles Are a Flock Heading South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Ray Miller evidently has had enough of merely  
throwing his hands up in disgust -- he's now pounding a wall. Such 
is his frustration with the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, who have the worst record in baseball, are a mess.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite owning the third-highest payroll in the majors and  
arguably the best right-handed hitter in the game, Baltimore has 
sputtered to a 4-14 start that has left the once-proud franchise 
hurting and Miller nursing a fractured hand. 
</P>
<P>
	After Orioles pitchers issued 14 walks Sunday in an embarrassing  
11-10 loss to Oakland, Miller slammed his right hand against a wall 
and ripped his players in a brief, profanity-laced session with the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm frustrated,'' the manager said, hiding his  
wrapped hand under his desk. ``I feel sorry for the fans. You pay 
that much money to see a game, you expect to see professionals 
play. Today some people weren't professional. By that I mean the 
ability to throw the ball over the plate. Fourteen walks is 
inexcusable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Timlin walked two and suffered his first blown save by  
allowing a three-run homer in the ninth inning. Timlin, one of 12 
new players brought in this season by new general manager Frank 
Wren, confirmed Miller's viewpoint about where blame for the horrid 
start should be directed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He calls the shots but we throw it, we catch it, we hit it.  
It's in this room,'' he said. ``We're not doing anything well right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, however, the manager is the one held accountable for  
the team's performance. And Miller may soon lose his job if the 
Orioles don't begin to justify the $78.5 million that owner Peter 
Angelos is paying to field a team that was expected to contend for 
a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren said Monday that the Orioles aren't about to give up on the  
season, or Miller, after just 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you look for in baseball is trends. Right now we're in a  
bad trend,'' Wren said. ``What we need to do is try to find out how 
to turn it around. That's what I'm talking about today with my 
staff. ... I'm certainly not going to make any public personnel 
decisions at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked his opinion of Miller's actions and words Sunday, Wren  
said, ``With everybody calling for Ray's head, now is not the time 
to critique the manager through the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos handpicked Miller for the job after accepting a  
controversial resignation from Davey Johnson in 1997, less than one 
month after the Orioles' second straight appearance in the AL 
championship series. Baltimore stumbled to a 79-83 finish last year 
and has not done anything thus far to indicate that a different 
cast of characters will produce better results. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle hit his fourth homer Sunday and leads the team with  
14 RBIs, but he's drawn 19 walks because Miller can't find a 
consistent bat to put behind his cleanup hitter. Jeff Conine, 
subbing for the injured Will Clark at first base, was hitless in 
the No. 5 slot Sunday and is batting .152. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is there are people being paid pretty well out  
there and they're supposed to produce,'' Miller said. ``They're 
not.''

<HEADLINE> Elway Announcement Set for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway will retire Sunday because he no longer  
believes he can handle the physical punishment of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen confirmed Monday that Elway was  
leaving football because he ``felt in his own mind that he had some 
physical problems he didn't think he could overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The usually durable Elway, 38, missed all or part of six games  
last season with hamstring, back and rib injuries. Of more concern, 
however, was a troublesome left knee. Limping around a golf course 
in California last weekend, he admitted he eventually will require 
an artificial knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said the news conference, already delayed several times,  
will be held Sunday at a time and location to be determined later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be very sensitive to the families involved in the  
Columbine (school shooting) situation,'' Bowlen said. ``We wanted 
to make sure we did not in any way interrupt the grieving process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Sunday probably is the time when we could put  
this tragedy behind us, and perhaps John's press conference could 
be received as sort of a happy time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's Denver Post, Elway left no doubt about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, I'm retired,'' he told the newspaper. ``One of the  
reasons I held off saying anything was to make sure it's what I 
would do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seriously considered coming back, but I just couldn't make  
it because of my knee,'' he said. ``I've never liked it when an 
athlete says he's retired and then comes back. Once I've decided, I 
am certain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said he was in Australia nearly two weeks ago, promoting  
his team's Aug. 6 preseason game there, when he received a 
telephone message from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I got the message, I knew what it was about,''  
Bowlen said. ``I called him back and basically it was a short 
conversation. He said, `Pat, I've decided to retire and go on with 
the rest of my life.' I told him I respected his decision and was 
really happy for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I couldn't get back until the following week, we  
originally decided to announce it on Wednesday (April 21). With 
what happened at Columbine (April 20), that was very much not 
appropriate. And it was just a matter of time before the press 
figured out what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen, who said he will retire Elway's No. 7, insisted he would  
not lower his expectations for the two-time Super Bowl champions 
this season, despite the loss of the Hall of Fame-bound 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``John will be missed, for sure,'' Bowlen said. ``But, no, our  
expectations are going to be the same. I think we've got a very 
solid football team. Bubby Brister is going to play well, and, of 
course, we have Terrell Davis and many other very good players on 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have had John come back for another  
year. I'd love to see him three-peat, do something that no other 
quarterback has done in history. But that wasn't to be. So we'll go 
forward. We'll be fine. I think we'll be a good football team, if 
not a great football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said he was more worried about the leadership void left  
by Elway's exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody loves to talk about the comebacks and all the rest  
of those things, but there is much, much more to John's 
participation on this team than that,'' he said. ``His physical 
accomplishments are unparalleled, but my biggest concern right now 
is the man that John was -- the guy he was in the locker room and 
the stability he brought. Losing that is going to be difficult for 
us, quite frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even while confronted with the evidence of Elway's decision, his  
teammates were in a state of denial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have to hear it come out of his mouth before I believe  
it,'' wide receiver Ed McCaffrey said. ``I just can't imagine 
football, much less the Broncos, without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Davis, ``Until I hear it from him, he's still on the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, Elway's heir apparent, was reluctant to discuss his new  
status until the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, in fact, he does retire, I'm going to miss him,'' Brister  
said. ``Nobody will ever be John Elway. If he does retire, I hope 
we can keep the machine rolling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But linebacker Bill Romanowski said he saw the retirement  
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year when he came back, he said that definitely was going  
to be his last year,'' Romanowski said. ``You have to believe what 
he said. In my mind it's always been official. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two weeks prior to the Super Bowl last year, John's  
intensity was unbelievable. I've never seen him like that. He 
wanted that game so badly. You just knew.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Shoot For Anaheim Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg called the  
Detroit Red Wings ``probably the best hockey team in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Red Wings' opening playoff series against Anaheim has  
shown, the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions are, at the 
very least, out of the Mighty Ducks' league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've certainly been getting taught a pretty good lesson from  
the best team in hockey,'' Hartsburg said after practice Monday. 
``This has to be a learning experience. We have to take something 
from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mighty Ducks left wing Paul Kariya agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing what it takes to win in the playoffs. That's how  
you get better,'' said Kariya, who has scored only one goal in the 
series. ``When you see guys doing well, you try to take from their 
game, and take from their team game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're trying to do, but we obviously had a long  
way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The education of the Mighty Ducks probably won't last much  
longer; up 3-0 in the best-of-7 series, Detroit can finish things 
off by winning Tuesday night in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Red Wings, who have outscored Anaheim 14-6 in the  
series, are trying not to look beyond Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've found that fourth win in a series is always tougher,''  
Detroit left wing Brendan Shanahan said. ``That's a proud group of 
guys over there and we really saw them play a different game (in 
the Red Wings' 4-2 win in Game 3 in Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not taking anything for granted.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings' go-ahead goal in Game 3, scored by Steve Yzerman  
in the second period, came with Detroit holding a two-man advantage 
because of a lapse in judgment by Anaheim defenseman Stu Grimson. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman scored with Travis Green in the penalty box for elbowing  
and Grimson in the dressing room after getting a five-minute match 
penalty for checking Kris Draper into the glass from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimson, who said afterward that the game turned on that moment,  
and that his hit was ``overly aggressive'' and ``inappropriate,'' 
was suspended by the league Monday for one game, so he'll sit out 
Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	While Grimson's mistake was costly, the story of the series has  
been the play of the Detroit defense, especially Chris Chelios and 
Nicklas Lidstrom, on the Mighty Ducks' high-scoring duo of Teemu 
Selanne and Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne, who led the league with 47 goals this season, did not  
get off a single shot on goal in the third game. Kariya, who had 
one shot on the net in the second game, managed three in Game 3, 
only one after the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both Lidstrom and Chelios are both playing so well.  
And there are always three forwards back-checking at 100 mph,'' 
said Selanne, whose two goals in the series both came after the Red 
Wings had taken control of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	While Selanne and Kariya have been mostly silenced, Yzerman has  
had a very noisy series, scoring five goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings also are strong in number.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the contenders (for the Stanley Cup), they have the  
most depth,'' Hartsburg said. ``They also have the most 
accomplished coach ever to coach the game. It's quite a mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit coach Scotty Bowman is going for his ninth Stanley Cup  
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their dire situation, Hartsburg and his players don't  
want to bow out without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll play as tough as we can,'' he said. ``We can't be down  
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Kariya: ``I think we played our best game yesterday  
(Sunday), so we've been getting better. If we can win the next 
game, I think it would give us a sense of accomplishment, that 
we've gotten better.''

<HEADLINE> Tips To Guard Against Y2K Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Federal Trade Commission advice for consumers to guard against  
Y2K scams: 
</P>
<P>
	--Never provide personal information, including bank account or  
credit card numbers, over the phone or online unless you're 
familiar with the business and have initiated the contact. Scam 
artists can use that information to commit fraud against you. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be on the alert for unauthorized charges to your credit card.  
If you haven't authorized a charge, don't pay it -- dispute it. 
Follow your credit card issuer's procedures for disputing a charge. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask your financial service provider about its plans to deal  
with Y2K. If you're uncomfortable with the response, consider doing 
business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	--If you don't normally keep financial records, start doing so.  
That way you'll have proof if something happens to the computerized 
records. At a minimum, keep a six-month paper trail -- three months 
before and after the date change -- on significant transactions, 
such as mortgages, stocks and insurance, as well as banking and 
credit card records. 
</P>
<P>
	--Consumers can call the federal Year 2000 hotline for more  
information or to call a specialist toll-free at 1-888-USA-4-Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Sign Veteran QB Miller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos on Monday agreed to contract  
terms with unrestricted free agent quarterback Chris Miller, who 
retired after the 1995 season because of a series of concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 33, provides the Broncos with backup insurance because  
of the loss of John Elway, who will make his retirement 
announcement Sunday. Bubby Brister and Brian Griese are Denver's 
other quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was Atlanta's first-round draft pick in 1987 out of  
Oregon. He passed for 3,459 yards in 1989 and for 3,103 yards with 
26 touchdowns and 15 interceptions in 1991, when he was named to 
the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed most of the 1992 and 1993 seasons because of a knee  
injury. After signing with the Rams, he threw for 2,104 yards in 
1994 and for 2,623 in 1995.

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks were mixed today, after a two-day  
rally, despite hopes that the government may come up with new 
economic stimulus steps ahead of a Japan-U.S. summit next week. The 
dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.86 yen in late afternoon, down 0.72 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
119.41 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.74 points,  
or 0.03 percent, to close at 16,918.51. Before today's close, the 
Nikkei had gained some 428 points in the previous two trading days, 
including Friday's 257.37-point, or 1.54 percent, gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes that the government will come up with more measures to  
boost the weak economy pushed the Nikkei to as high as 17,143.49 
points at one point earlier in the day. It was the first time since 
April 9 that the Nikkei moved above the 17,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders expect finance ministers and central bankers of the  
Group of Seven industrialized nations to pressure Japan to work 
harder to get its economy back on track at their meeting in 
Washington later today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were hopes that the government will be pressured to come  
up with additional stimulus measures,'' said Muneyuki Ichihara, 
general manager of investment information at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also hopes that Japan may come up with new measures  
ahead of a summit meeting between Obuchi and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, set for May 3 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies are still struggling to recover from the  
nation's worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also attributed the afternoon decline to profit-taking  
after heady gains the last two days. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy,  
Britain, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's first section was estimated at 562  
million shares, compared with 578 million shares on Friday. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 745 to 444, with 129 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 8.37 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,343.84. The 
TOPIX closed up 21.03 points, or 1.60 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar drifted lower on selling from  
foreign investors trying to reduce long, or overbought, dollar 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, they didn't expect the market to move  
much ahead of the G-7 meeting and scheduled discussions between 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Robert Rubin, the U.S. 
treasury secretary, in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded in a range between 118.67 yen and 119.37 yen  
in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.17 yen, down  
from 127.28 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the newly selected benchmark No. 212 10-year  
Japanese government bond fell to 1.490 percent from Friday's finish 
of 1.535 percent, driving its price up to 102.71 yen from 102.31 
yen.

<HEADLINE> First Union To Buy Everen Brokerage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Pushing its rapid expansion deep into the  
nation's heartland, the First Union banking company has agreed to 
buy Everen Capital Corp., a major midwestern brokerage, for $1.1 
billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Monday would give First Union a more  
national platform for its brokerage services thanks to Everen's 
vast presence west of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of First Union's investment brokerage operations are found  
in the eastern half of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Everen has offices in 28 states and more than 1,800 investment  
consultants, with the highest concentration in Illinois, 
California, Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	After the acquisition, the combined company would have 3 million  
brokerage accounts with $147 billion in assets. That would make 
First Union, already the nation's sixth largest banking concern, 
the sixth-largest brokerage as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an excellent partnership that gives First Union a  
nationwide securities business,'' said Ken Thompson, vice chairman 
of First Union, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes about a year after a merger agreement between  
Citicorp and Travelers Group set off a round of corporate marriages 
by major financial companies aimed at expanding their reach and 
product offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before that, however, First Union had embarked on an  
aggressive East Coast expansion, purchasing other regional banks 
such as CoreStates Financial, First Fidelity and Signet Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	But for First Union, which entered the brokerage business less  
than two years ago with its purchase of Wheat First Butcher Singer, 
the acquisition of Everen also represents another foothold in a 
more profitable sector of the financial services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are plenty of banks to buy, but I don't know if many of  
them have the growth profile (First Union) is looking for,'' said 
John Moore, an industry analyst for Wachovia Securities in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they are looking for are subsidiaries that grow faster  
than the banking industry,'' Moore said, noting that the Everen 
deal would give First Union one of the highest percentages of 
non-interest income in the banking industry. 
</P>

	Last week, responding to a question at the annual shareholder

<HEADLINE> Apache Helicopters Ready To Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Army Apache helicopters and their  
supporting troops and equipment are ready for action against 
Yugoslav forces, NATO said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The full package of the Apache (force) is now in Albania,''  
said Col. Konrad Freytag, NATO's military spokesman. The 
helicopters and supporting ground-based rocket launchers have been 
deployed north of Tirana, near the border of the embattled Kosovo 
provence in Yugoslovia. 
</P>
<P>
	Freytag said the helicopters can be called into action when Gen.  
Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, decides they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters this morning that  
completion of the Apache deployment brings total U.S. combat 
strength in Albania to 5,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor weather continued to hamper NATO warplanes beginning their  
second month of strikes throughout Yugoslavia, Freytag said. The 
German colonel called poor weather the single biggest 
disappointment and obstacle in the NATO campaign, saying it has 
slowed the NATO effort to take down Yugoslavia's integrated air 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather has really extensively hindered our precision air  
operation,'' Freytag said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, NATO planes continued to pound away at fuel  
production and storage facilities, Yugoslav ground forces operating 
in Kosovo and key bridges, including the last surviving bridge in 
the city of Novi Sad in northern Yugoslavia. Shea said destruction 
of the bridge makes it far more difficult for Yugoslavia to supply 
fuel to its troops in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea had no further detail on the visit by the head of the  
International Red Cross with the three American soldiers captured 
by Yugoslavia. He said the Red Cross official provided the soldiers 
with mail from home and took delivery of some of their letters 
home, but said he wanted a longer visit to assess their mental and 
physical health. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington today, Congress, despite some criticism of NATO  
strategy, geared up to approve President Clinton's request for $6 
billion of emergency money into the air war against Yugoslavia -- 
and seemed likely to boost it to at least about $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota  
told reporters today that the $6 billion seemed adequate for 
meeting direct Kosovo-related expenses, Republicans were leading 
the way for more money to take care of longer-range Pentagon needs 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle also said that the Senate, which has voted to support  
the airstrikes, might take up a another measure soon to exhibit 
Senate support for ``expanding the effort if required.'' But 
Daschle said he doubted the Senate would support a stronger 
resolution by a bipartisan group led by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
to authorize the presdident to use ``all necessary force'' to 
previal. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said that he didn't think it was a good idea to approve  
an ``open-ended, unlimited military excursion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has to act on the president's request,'' said Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott. ``We need to support the men and women, 
the troops who are doing the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A GOP plan expected to win House and Senate approval this week  
would add at least $4 billion to President Clinton's $6 billion 
request. The package would include pay and benefit improvements for 
service members, Lott said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Democrats want to see the details, momentum is building in  
favor of the emergency spending package. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to support whatever's necessary to prevail in  
Kosovo,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., ranking Democrat on the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustration over continued Serb military sweeps in the Kosovo  
province has led some senators to back a resolution authorizing 
introduction of NATO ground troops. But Lott said he would oppose 
such a resolution. The White House, while willing to look at the 
option, insisted that airstrikes will work eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need a divisive debate that could give aid and  
comfort to Mr. Milosevic,'' Lott said on ABC's ``This Week With Sam 
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shea, the NATO spokesman, said it will be harder for Yugoslavia  
to shoot down NATO planes now that Romania and Slovenia have 
granted NATO access to their airspace. The permission will give 
NATO planes more entry points into Yugoslavia, making it difficult 
for Serb forces to predict flight paths and position their 
defensive batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied cargo planes, meanwhile, have ferried more than 5,000  
tons of food, medical supplies and tents to the refugee areas in 
Albania and Macedonia throughout the course of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A mixture of support and criticism characterized the mood in  
Washington as NATO's 50th anniversary summit concluded. Republican 
lawmakers criticized Clinton's handling of the Kosovo crisis while 
still pledging more money than Clinton has requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that the  
Clinton administration and NATO made ``a serious mistake'' in 
adopting a new strategic concept embracing military missions 
outside the territory of the 19 NATO countries. Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., said ``this has really been horribly 
mismanaged.'' McConnell said ground troops should have been 
prepositioned months ago in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Levin on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Sen. John  
Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
predicted overwhelming support for the bill in both the House and 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make certain that no leader or group in another  
area of the world perceives that the United States has drawn down 
its military assets for this operation and now's the time to start 
a problem,'' Warner said.

<HEADLINE> 2 McCaughey Babies Watched For CP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLISLE, Iowa (AP) -- Two of Bobbi McCaughey's 17-month-old  
septuplets are being monitored for cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there are some signs of something that could be  
long-term, they don't have to mean that,'' Mrs. McCaughey said in 
The Des Moines Sunday Register. ``They could just be muscle 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While baby Alexis can't yet sit up by herself, Mrs. McCaughey  
said, she can stay upright once someone puts her in a sitting 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Peter Hetherington, the children's doctor, has said that  
Alexis' lack of strength could stem from her difficulty in getting 
enough food to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's not going to worry about it, then at this point we  
shouldn't either,'' Mrs. McCaughey said of the pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexis weighs just over 15 pounds -- up from 12 in January -- and  
is still fed through a tube in her stomach. She has severe reflux 
and vomits frequently. She became dehydrated and lost weight while 
hospitalized for nine days in January with flu and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's said all along, `I think 15 pounds is going to be the  
magic number.' Since she's hit 15 pounds, we can see she's trying 
to do more,''' Mrs. McCaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan weighs 20 pounds. The newspaper did not say what the  
other children weigh and there was no additional comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the firm that handles all of the McCaugheys' public  
relations, the Ambassador Agency of Nashville, were not answered 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors frequently monitor developmentally delayed children  
between the ages of 18 months and 30 months for cerebral palsy, 
said Dennis C. Harper, a University of Iowa pediatrics professor 
and president of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and 
Developmental Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hard call at a very young age,'' Harper said. ``You  
need to look at growth over time. ... Children's nervous systems 
are amazingly plastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cerebral palsy is a motor nerve disorder caused by a permanent  
brain defect or injury shortly after birth. Those who suffer milder 
cases may have spastic paralysis, while more severe cases can 
include seizures, numbness and mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
	Physical therapists have been visiting the McCaughey home twice  
a month since October to work with Nathan and Alexis. Even with 
their medical challenges, Mrs. McCaughey said, she and her husband, 
Kenny, are generally optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if they have something that is long-term -- and I would  
hate to see that happen and I'm sure we would have some difficult 
and troubling days ahead of us if it did -- I know we'll be given 
the strength to deal with it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose in early trading Tuesday  
following a surge in share prices of U.S. technology companies in 
New York. The dollar gained against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 110.35 points, or 0.65 percent to  
17,028.86 in the first half hour of trading. On Monday, it lost 
4.74 points, or 0.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.38 yen in early trading, up 0.52 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
119.26 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, investors bid up shares of  
high-tech companies on the back of a rally in technology-related 
stocks in the U.S. on Monday, traders said. That helped buoy the 
broader market, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is strong overall,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy  
general manager of the equity department at Daiwa SB Capital 
Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 28.92  
points Monday to close at 10,718.59, while the technology-oriented 
Nasdaq composite shot up 61.36 points to a new record high of 
2,652.05. 
</P>
<P>
	In early Tokyo trading Tuesday, the broader Tokyo Stock Price  
Index of all issues listed on the first section picked up 7.77 
points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,351.61. It had risen 8.37 points, or 
0.63 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar gained ground  
against the yen as dealers moved to cover short positions after 
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters his nation 
doesn't plan any new economic stimulus measures, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.89 yen, up from  
126.17 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.485  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.490 percent, driving its price up 
to 102.76 yen from 102.71 yen.

<HEADLINE> Kerry Collins Convicted of DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- New York Giants quarterback Kerry Collins  
was convicted today of driving while impaired, had his driver's 
license suspended for a month and was ordered to pay $186. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins entered a no contest plea to the charge, which stemmed  
from his arrest in Charlotte Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins did not attend today's hearing in Mecklenburg County  
District Court, but his lawyer, George Laughrun, told Judge Fritz 
Mercer Jr. that his client ``expressed regret and sorrow'' for the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, signed by the Giants in February to a four-year, $16.9  
million contract, was fined $100, the maximum allowed, and was 
assessed $86 in court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	People convicted of DWI in North Carolina usually are also  
ordered to undergo alcohol counseling. Collins was not, however, 
because Laughrun said his client had already completed an 
NFL-ordered alcohol rehabilitation program from Jan. 6 to Feb. 27 
at the Menninger Clinic, a world-renowned mental health facility in 
Topeka, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also revoked Collins' driving privileges in North  
Carolina until May 25, but Laughrun said his client moved out of 
his Charlotte home three weeks ago and had no plans to return to 
the state in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who in 1995 became the expansion Panthers' first draft  
pick, was arrested about nine hours after Carolina's 31-17 victory 
over New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Trooper R.A. Benze, who made the arrest, testified today that  
Collins' car twice crossed the center line on a street that runs 
through one of Charlotte's most popular nightclub districts. 
Collins also nearly drove the car onto a curb, Benze said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins refused to take a breath test when he was stopped, but  
was very polite, the trooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was cut by the Panthers in October after he reportedly  
told the team his heart was no longer into being Carolina's 
quarterback. New Orleans then signed him, but he also struggled 
with the Saints, and after the season they were not interested in 
re-signing the free agent.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators said today that two  
teen-age students who carried out the massacre at Columbine High 
School also plotted to kill hundreds of neighbors, hijack a plane 
and crash it into New York City. A diary kept by Eric Harris 
described his and Dylan Klebold's plans for a murderous rampage

	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australian intelligence authorities  
said Tuesday they may not have time to carry out full terrorist 
checks on all workers and volunteers expected to help run the 
Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.

	But doing full background checks on them all would not be  
possible in that time ``because of the volume of work we will be

<HEADLINE> Runner Remembers Colo. Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- As the crowd cheered him to victory in  
bright sunshine at the Drake Relays, Mark Hauser carried a reminder 
of life's darker side. 
</P>
<P>
	Hauser, who beat defending champion Paul McMullen in the mile,  
wore a black ribbon on the right side of his shirt in memory of 
Daniel Mauser, one of those killed in the Littleton, Colo., 
shooting rampage last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauser, 15, had been a cross country runner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to send my deepest regrets to the people in  
Littleton,'' Hauser said after Saturday's race. ``This race was for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hauser said his mother had seen information about Mauser in a  
message board on the Internet and told him about it. That's when he 
decided to wear the ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You replace the `M' in his name with an `H' and you have my  
name,'' Hauser said. ``That's how close it is. I've really done it 
for him. I've been blessed with a God-given ability to run and I 
wanted to do the best I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hauser did well enough Saturday to beat a runner who had  
thrilled the Drake Relays crowd last year by running a 3:59.12 
mile. They were on pace for another sub-4-minute clocking at the 
halfway point but couldn't maintain it and Hauser finished in 
4:00.59. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was decided when Hauser passed McMullen on the second  
turn of the final lap and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I feel good, I've got to go right now,' '' said  
Hauser, whose college eligibility at UCLA expired at the end of the 
indoor season. ``I started to get really tight with 200 to go, but 
the last 100 yards I gave it everything I had. I tied up a little 
bit the last 20 and had to slow down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no slowing Derrick Adkins, who continued his comeback  
by beating a strong field in the 400-meter hurdles. It was the 
second victory in seven days for Adkins, who had a poor year in 
1998 after winning the world championship in 1995 and the Olympic 
gold medal in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He won at the Mt. SAC Relays the week before running at Drake.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to get my confidence back,'' Adkins said. ``I  
looked at this race as a chance to go out and do that. I'm ready to 
go after it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adkins' time of 48.99 was just off the 48.71 he ran at Mt. SAC.  
Joey Woody, who ran the third-fastest time in the world last year, 
was second in 49.26. Calvin Davis, the Olympic bronze medalist in 
1996, was third in 49.78. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first race this year, and these guys have had three  
or four,'' said Woody, the 1997 NCAA champion at Northern Iowa. 
``So this is a good showing to see where I'm at. I'm at about 85 
percent right now, which isn't bad.''

	The meet ended just as it has the previous seven years, with  
Baylor winning the university 1,600 relay. Brandon Couts outran 
Georgia's Chandler Teasley on the final leg as the Bears won in 
3:06.98 to keep their streak intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baylor women won the 1,600 relay for the sixth straight year  
to finish off an outstanding meet. Baylor won the 800 relay on 
Friday and got first-place finishes Saturday from Ssereta Lafayette 
in the 100 and Nzingah Kamani in the 100 hurdles. Sherri Smith and 
Karin Ernstrom of Baylor finished 1-2 in the 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``For so long, it was the Baylor men's team,'' said Yulanda  
Nelson, who anchored the 1,600 team and finished second in the 400. 
``We've earned the respect of our men's team, and there's no 
stopping us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa State, shut out in 1998 after winning at least one men's  
event for 17 straight years, got two victories Saturday. Jason 
Woods won the 110 hurdles and anchored the Cyclones to a meet 
record 56.18 clocking in the shuttle hurdle relay. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and another member of the shuttle unit, Justin Hyde, had  
run on the Cyclones' team that was disqualified after winning the 
800 relay on Friday.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders More 737 Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's airlines, already subject to  
fuel, wiring and hydraulic inspections of their Boeing 737s, face a 
new round on inspections on the popular aircraft's rear 
pressurization barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines Monday to  
inspect for and correct possible fatigue cracks in the aft pressure 
bulkhead, located near the tail. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrier, like one in the cockpit, allows the planes to  
pressurize to a safe breathing atmosphere. Left untended, cracks 
could widen and trigger rapid depressurization of a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The order stems from reports of fatigue cracks on the aft  
pressure bulkhead of some Boeing 737-200 models, older planes with 
cigar-shaped engines under the wings. Newer models have oval or 
round engine pods. 
</P>
<P>
	The airworthiness directive requires operators of Boeing 737-100  
through -500 series aircraft to conduct either electronic or visual 
inspections, and to repair any cracks found. 
</P>
<P>
	The directive is an interim action pending identification of a  
final action, which could require further FAA rulemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the government said it planned to require  
inspections and repairs on the forward pressure bulkheads in older 
Boeing 737s. The FAA said those bulkheads might also crack and 
cause an aircraft to depressurize rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine 737 is the world's most commonly used passenger  
aircraft. The proposed rule affects 1,020 planes worldwide, 500 of 
which are registered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has been making the 737 since 1967, and the government  
has been paying closer attention to its operation in recent years 
for several reasons: the creation of a new aging aircraft program, 
the crash of several 737s linked to rudder problems and the ongoing 
investigation into the explosion of TWA Flight 800. 
</P>
<P>
	While that plane was a Boeing 747, a jumbo jet unlike the 737,  
it also was an older aircraft and investigators have sought to 
apply their safety findings to similar planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Boeing 737 operators were ordered to conduct new  
inspections of the plane's center fuel tank for potential wiring 
problems that could spark a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the FAA said most 737 operators would have to  
perform a one-time inspection of a replacement hydraulic valve 
being installed in the airplane's rudder after the manufacturer and 
some airlines found parts with cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the new inspections is $480 per aircraft for each  
electronic inspection, and $120 per aircraft for each detailed 
visual inspection.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Discussed at AP Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- President Clinton and NATO are resisting  
sending ground troops to help resolve the conflict in Kosovo, but 
refugees believe that is the only way to defeat Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic, panelists told the annual meeting of The 
Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive of the news  
cooperative, moderated the panel, titled ``A Conversation: Crisis 
in Kosovo.'' The group included White House correspondent Terry 
Hunt; foreign affairs and national security correspondent Laura 
Myers; special correspondent Mort Rosenblum; photographer and 
international photo editor Jerome Delay; and Miles Kahler, a 
professor with the Graduate School of International Relations at 
the University of California, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblum and Delay participated by live satellite from a  
refugee camp in Kukes, Albania. They said more than 300,000 of an 
estimated 1 million refugees have reached Albanian camps, but they 
are unsure about where the others are or if they are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	When refugees arrive, often after days of walking or hiding in  
the mountains, ``they are in terrible condition,'' Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi asked Delay to talk about a photo he took at a refugee  
camp of a little girl with blond pigtails. She had cried so much 
the skin around her eyes was bluish-red. After the photo was 
published in a German newspaper, more than $1 million was raised 
for the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an easy job,'' Delay said, noting he sees his own  
daughters in the refugee children he photographs. ``Emotionally, 
it's very stressing ... but I think our role is very important to 
document what we're doing here (and) I hope people see the pictures 
and feel the same feelings that I felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delay said the little girl and her grandmother were now living  
in Hamburg, Germany, and Monday was her third birthday. Some of the 
money raised will go toward her health care, education and housing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblum said even in the refugees' despair, they show great  
resilience and hope. He said they expect to return to their homes, 
but realize it won't happen soon, likely not this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the refugees want NATO to send ground forces to end the  
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials are assessing how many troops it would take to  
lead a ground war, said Myers, adding that Clinton would soon call 
33,000 reservists to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	She said a ground mission would be difficult because the  
geography is rough and only Hungary, a NATO member, will allow 
troops to pass across its border into Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	An oil embargo is another possible step in ``tightening the  
noose around Belgrade,'' Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahler said it was critical to realize the refugees believe they  
can eventually return to a stable environment politically and 
economically, which NATO promised it would help secure. He said the 
questions are whether that can happen without sending ground troops 
and forcing Milosevic from power. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi said covering Kosovo is a dangerous assignment, but one  
handled bravely by dozens of journalists and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud of the work being done by some very courageous AP  
people who've been beaten, robbed and shot at as they reported from 
the Balkans,'' Boccardi said.

<HEADLINE>  PLO Leaves Peace Talks Door Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The Palestinian parliament today left  
open the door to continued peace talks with Israel, passing a 
resolution that does not mention a declaration of statehood on May 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonbinding resolution, adopted 41-1 with two abstentions,  
was issued a day before Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was to 
convene a senior PLO body, the 124-member Palestinian Central 
Council, to make the final decision on the statehood issue. 
</P>
<P>
	May 4 was the target date for completing a final peace agreement  
between Israel and the Palestinians. A senior Israeli official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said the United States is proposing 
a new target date of May 2000 and that Israel would accept the 
one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	PLO official Hassan Abdel Rahman said he believes the United  
States does not want negotiations to extend beyond a year. ``The 
Americans have said they do not want open-ended negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing a  
tight battle for re-election May 17, took an even tougher stand 
against Palestinian statehood than he has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I'm prime minister, it doesn't matter what he  
(Arafat) gets on an international level, this (a state) he will not 
have,'' Netanyahu said during a campaign stop in the central 
Israeli town of Kiryat Malachi. 
</P>
<P>
	He also claimed credit for the Palestinians' apparent  
willingness to forgo a statehood declaration, saying that Israel's 
threat to annex parts of the West Bank kept Arafat from making a 
unilateral move. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of this statement and our stance for the past few  
months, the Palestinian Authority realized that it had to back 
down,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian Central Council was widely expected to decide to  
postpone a statehood declaration. Council head Salim Zanoun said 
the session could last for days and even until after Israel's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, meanwhile, a senior administration official said  
President Clinton would release a statement later today offering to 
resume his mediator role within six months of Israel's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, in effect, acknowledges that Israel and the  
Palestinian Authority will not meet their May 4 deadline for an 
interim settlement on the West Bank and ``final-status'' 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Arafat's main political rival, Hamas founder Ahmed  
Yassin, announced the Islamic militant group has accepted an 
invitation to attend the council session as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamas has never before attended a PLO gathering; Yassin's  
acceptance could signal that Arafat is making progress in reaching 
agreement with the group on political participation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yassin said Hamas would urge the council to walk away from the  
peace agreements with Israel and ``close this shameful chapter in 
history.''

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Only one of the seven surviving Houston octuplets  
remained in the hospital Monday after the release of his youngest 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorom Louis, the eighth-born baby to Nkem Chukwu last December,  
was released from Texas Children's Hospital on Friday, officials 
said Monday. She weighed 4 pounds, 10 ounces upon discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of the octuplets still hospitalized is Ikem, the  
firstborn of two boys to Ms. Chukwu and her husband, Ikye Louis 
Udobi. He is listed in serious condition but continues to progress, 
the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakest of the octuplets was Odera, born at 10.3 ounces, who  
died a week after birth. Gorom and Ikem have been the sickliest of 
the survivors, each needing surgery and other specialized care.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Farmers Fear Competition / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERNARD, Iowa (AP) -- The 77 cows Dennis Meyer milks every day on  
his 384-acre farm in Dubuque County may become too expensive to 
feed if U.S. trade policies open the borders to milk exports from 
New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer fears trade talks beginning this fall in Seattle will  
eliminate the tariff that has kept domestic milk prices above the 
world price of $9.50 per hundredweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa dairy producers need about $12.50 per hundredweight to  
break even. Meyer said he got $11.50 per hundredweight in his last 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa milk prices, however, have averaged $13.49 for the past  
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want the government in my face or the government  
handout, but if they pull the rug out from under me, I'll be doing 
something else,'' Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under past changes to the General Agreement on Tariffs and  
Trade, Meyer said, New Zealand boosted its annual butter sales to 
the United States from 320 metric tons to 20,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Zealand exports 30 percent of the world (dairy) product.  
They're smacking their lips to get into our market,'' Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. grain and pork producers often boast that they are the  
lowest-cost producers in the world. They push for free trade 
agreements so they can sell their products in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not the case for dairy producers.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite good domestic production, the cost of production is  
higher in the United States than in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should not expect to see lower milk prices in the  
grocery stores if the tariffs drop and cheaper, foreign milk is 
sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Processors didn't take the price down on butter when our price  
went down in February,'' Meyer said. ``Don't think they'd lower it 
if we had cheaper milk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	December pork prices showed how disconnected farm prices are  
from consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers in December received about $24 for a hog. That is  
more than $100 less per animal than they were paid in December 
1997. Yet pork prices in grocery stores dipped only a few cents per 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer, 46, traveled earlier this month to Washington, D.C., to  
meet with federal lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrae Erickson, director of government relations for the  
American Farm Bureau, said everything will be on the table during 
GATT talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a given things will be reduced. We're not out to harm  
our producers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. tariffs would change little if a new GATT agreement said  
all countries would reduce their tariffs by 10 percent, Erickson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tariff is so low that 10 percent amounts to almost  
nothing, she said. But 10 percent of another country's higher 
tariff might mean a big advantage to U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau has commissioned a study to see what changes in  
trade will best benefit U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think negotiations could be structured so that everyone  
benefits. We're being mindful of our producers. We don't feel 
negotiations will result in a flood of imports,'' Erickson said.

<HEADLINE> Sinead O'Connor Ordained by Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Sinead O'Connor, who once ripped up a  
picture of the pope on television, could be in trouble with the 
Vatican again. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer was ordained as the first woman priest in the Latin  
Tridentine Church, a Roman Catholic splinter group, by Bishop 
Michael Cox, who pioneered a phone-in confession service in 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who knows me knows that what I have done makes perfect  
sense for me. I adore God and believe very much in the power of 
prayer,'' O'Connor said Monday in a broadcast interview. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said she had already celebrated Mass four times but  
will study with Cox for six weeks before starting her priestly 
career as Mother Bernadette Mary, a name she also plans to use in 
her music career. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said her views have changed since her 1992 appearance  
on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,'' when she tore up a picture of 
Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do apologize for that. I am sorry I did that. It was a  
disrespectful thing to do,'' she said. ``I have never even met the 
pope. I am sure he is a lovely man.''

<HEADLINE> Stern Under Fire for Colo. Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Howard Stern and a local radio station that  
syndicates his show have drawn criticism over the shock jock's 
comments on the Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern was quoted by the Rocky Mountain News as saying that some  
of the girls fleeing from the April 20 shooting were ``really 
good-looking'' and wondered on the air whether the suicide gunmen 
tried ``to have sex with any of the good-looking girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At least if you're going to kill yourself and kill all the  
kids, why wouldn't you have some sex?'' Stern asked, according to 
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The show can be heard locally on KXPK-FM, a rock music station.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let Howard Stern make his millions in other broadcast  
markets,'' the News said in an editorial Monday. ``He does not 
belong in Denver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern was unavailable for comment. A message left with his agent  
wasn't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	But KXPK general manager Bob Visotcky said he spoke with Stern  
on Monday for 20 minutes and reported that Stern ``feels that his 
comments were taken out of context.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Many Think Attack Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four in 10 high school students and nearly  
half of parents questioned in a new poll say it's likely that a 
Littleton, Colo.-style attack could take place at their school. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the students also answered yes when asked if  
any of their fellow students might be troubled enough to do 
something like last week's slayings at Columbine High School in 
suburban Denver, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students shocked the nation a week ago when they shot their  
way through the high school, killing 12 students and a teacher 
before shooting themselves to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the students considered the chances likely that  
such an attack could happen at their school, against 58 percent who 
considered it unlikely, and 49 percent of parents said the chances 
were likely, opposed to 48 percent who said it was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that 23 percent of students and parents  
considered violence a serious problem at their school, while 77 
percent of teens and 76 percent of parents did not. The poll said 
88 percent of students felt safe at their school, while 11 percent 
felt unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, taken by International Communications Research, was  
conducted by telephone April 22-25 among a national sampling of 500 
high school students and 522 parents of students. The margin of 
error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Hero Teacher Burial Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The sign said it all: Friend, coach,  
father. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo above the words was of William ``Dave'' Sanders, the  
heroic teacher killed during the massacre at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The white sign, propped against a tree during Sunday's memorial  
for the 13 victims, was just one small tribute to the man many 
students credit for saving their lives by herding them away from 
the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Sanders' students, who huddled by their beloved teacher's  
side after he was shot, were to come together again -- to bid him 
farewell at his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, current and former students remembered Sanders'  
dedication and devotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just a model teacher, said Jeff Markle, the school's  
1994 student body president who traveled from Dallas to honor 
Sanders. ``He'd come early, stay late. Anything he could do to make 
us feel better he would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a really exceptional coach,'' a teary-eyed Stephanie  
Gilbert, 34, said of the man who guided her cross-country team 15 
years ago. ``I was never really into sports. He got me to learn. He 
ran with me the first week of practice to keep me going, right 
beside me. I still run today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, when gunfire and explosions echoed through the  
school cafeteria, Sanders jumped on tables, shouting for students 
to get out. He ran through the halls, herding students to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was shot twice in the chest and staggered into a  
second-floor classroom, where students tore off their T-shirts and 
pressed them to his wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	They covered him with blankets and told him how important he was  
to them. They tenderly showed him pictures of his wife and 
daughters from his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to make it,'' Sanders told them. ``Tell my girls  
I love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 47, was an unassuming guy with an easy smile, a  
teacher-coach who taught old-fashioned values. He urged students to 
look for the best in every situation, to strive to do their best 
and be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Oct. 22, 1951, in Eldorado, Ill., Sanders was raised in  
Veedersburg, about 50 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In high 
school, the 6-foot-1-inch Sanders played basketball and baseball 
and ran cross country. He got his college degree from Chadron State 
in Nebraska in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a former coach, Sanders landed his first -- and  
only -- teaching job at Columbine, where he taught business and 
substituted in the science department. He also coached girls' 
basketball, girls' softball and track for nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned the respect and praise of co-workers and competitors.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't out for glory,'' said Joe Poisson, coach of the  
girls' basketball team in Arvada, a suburb northwest of Denver. 
``His team played really tough defense, and you'd have to play your 
best to win against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Martin, who coached with Sanders at Columbine for 22 years,  
said Sanders ``was more concerned with the student athlete and what 
they got out of games than he was with winning and losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Sanders coached his girls' basketball team through  
its first winning season in several years. Even-tempered as always, 
Sanders sat on the bench for most of what turned out to be his 
final game. ``He was making all the right moves,'' Martin said, but 
the team lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' first love was his family: wife Linda; daughters,  
Angela, Cindy and Coni; and 10 grandchildren. He organized an 
annual reunion and frequent gatherings, which typically included a 
softball game. 
</P>
<P>
	But his students, too, were close to his heart. At Sunday's  
memorial, they spoke of his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you and I will miss you,'' said Amber Burgess. ``I know  
that each day your memory will push me to become a better person 
and to live my life to its fullest.''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Sign Second-Round DT Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars signed  
second-round draft pick Larry Smith Monday, continuing their 
reputation for getting rookies under contract quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a defensive tackle from Florida State, became the second  
NFL draft pick to reach terms. The first pick in the draft, 
quarterback Tim Couch, signed his deal with the Cleveland Browns on 
draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three seasons, all but the first-round picks have  
been signed by July. Cornerback Fernando Bryant, Jacksonville's No. 
1, has said he wants to get his deal done quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always pays dividends,'' said Jaguars senior vice president  
Michael Huyghue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only in the fact that you can dictate the market instead  
of having it dictated to you, but for clear football reasons, as 
well. If you get a guy signed before training camp, you overcome 
the obstacle of him having to worry about the business of football 
during that time.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Tyson will not decide on his boxing future

	He must still serve 60 days for violating probation for a 1992  
rape conviction in Indiana and the earliest he can get out is in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Mike's release we will sit down and discuss his boxing

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Derby Threesome At It Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob, Wayne and Nick have combined to win  
the Kentucky Derby six times in the 1990s, and it wouldn't be 
surprising if one of the trainers is in the winner's circle again 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about this Derby,'' Bob Baffert said. ``I've got  
two horses who are contenders. I hope one of them wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If General Challenge or Prime Timber -- first and second,  
respectively, in the Santa Anita Derby -- does win, Baffert will be 
the first person in any racing capacity to win the Kentucky Derby 
three straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The last horseman to be in position to win three straight was D.  
Wayne Lukas. He sent out Thunder Gulch to win in 1995 and followed 
with Grindstone, but in 1997 his Deeds Not Words finished 13th as 
Baffert won with Silver Charm. Baffert's winner last year was Real 
Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas will try to return the favor at Churchill Downs when he  
sends out Charismatic and Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the horses that are battle-tested will be there at the  
end,'' said Lukas, whose two colts certainly are just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, fourth in the Santa Anita Derby and a winner of the  
Lexington at Keeneland, will be making his 15th start. Cat Thief, 
winless in four starts this year but second twice and third once in 
Grade I stakes in his last three, will be going to the post for the 
12th time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm grateful to be in this position,'' said Nick Zito, who  
will try to win his first Derby since 1994 (Go for Gin) with 
Adonis, winner of the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, and Stephen Got 
Even, winner of the Gallery Furniture.com at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito likes the Derby rivalry he's formed with Baffert and Lukas.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to finish it off,'' he said of winning the final  
Derby of the `90s. I would love to have that honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito also said he didn't want to seen the 1990s end with four  
trainers have two Derby wins apiece. That would happen should Carl 
Nafzger win with Florida Derby winner Vicar. Nafzger won in 1990 
with Unbridled, his only previous Derby starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Nafzger, the only Derby-winning trainers in the last  
nine years not named Baffert, Lukas or Zito were Lynn Whiting (Lil 
E. Tee 1992) and Mac Miller (Sea Hero, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a rivalry guy,'' Baffert said when asked about Lukas  
and Zito. ``I won the last two, so I don't see it as a rivalry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of it that way,'' Lukas said when asked about  
rivalry. ``Each of these things is a separate race,'' he said. In 
other words, the real stars of the show -- the horses -- are 
different every year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lukas also said with a smile, ``One guy's got three Derby  
wins and the other two guys have two, so it's catching up for 
them.'' Lukas also won the Derby with the filly Winning Colors in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas worked both of his colts five-eights of a mile in the rain  
Monday. Cat Thief worked in company with another colt and went 
1:02. Charismatic worked in 1:02 3-5. Mike Smith will ride Cat 
Thief on Saturday and Chris Antley will be aboard Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just workouts,'' Lukas said. ``I don't put much  
stock in workouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the rain and sloppy track, Zito postponed Adonis'  
workout until Tuesday. Stephen Got Even worked five-eighths of a 
mile in company Saturday in 1:02 2-5. Chris McCarron, who will ride 
in the Derby, was up for the workout. Jorge Chavez will ride 
Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis will be making his seventh career start, while Stephen  
Got Even will be making his sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who possibly could enter the filly Excellent Meeting in  
the Derby, worked each of his colts three-quarters of a mile last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strapping General Challenge is set to make his sixth start.  
Prime Timber will go to the post for the seventh time. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears a full field of 20 3-year-olds will be entered  
Wednesday. The Derby is limited to 20 starters based on money 
earned in graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of Arkansas Derby winner Valhol remains unclear. Owner  
James Jackson sued Arkansas racing authorities on Monday, demanding 
they release the winner's share from the April 10 race at Oaklawn 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol most likely will not qualify for the Kentucky Derby  
without the $300,000 winnings. The money was held up because jockey 
Billy Patin might have carried an illegal electrical device. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on Jackson's petition is scheduled for Tuesday in  
Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Minority Election Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For most of an hour Monday, it seemed the  
Supreme Court was intent on deciding just how vigorously the 
federal government can protect minorities from election-system 
changes that might hurt their voting power. 
</P>
<P>
	But the argument session's last few minutes threw into doubt  
whether the Bossier Parish, La., case, to be decided by late June, 
will yield an important ruling that affects all states and counties 
covered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal fight over how the local school board elects its 12  
members has lasted so long, the court was told, that no more 
elections are planned until the current system gets revamped after 
the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no remedy,'' said school board lawyer Michael Carvin,  
suggesting the case is too old to matter. Only if the justices 
disagree are they likely to reach the heart of the dispute: Whether 
the Justice Department can forestall election changes that may be 
discriminatory but do not leave minority voters any worse off. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1965 law ``is not limited to changes intended to make  
matters worse for minorities,'' Justice Department lawyer Paul 
Wolfson argued. He said the Bossier Parish school board's intent in 
1992 ``was to hold the line as much as possible against further 
black participation'' in school board matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Brannan said her clients, black voters in the parish,  
``have been trying for seven years to have ... the school board 
adopt a nondiscriminatory system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carvin argued, however, that the relevant section of the voting  
rights law was not written to eliminate the perpetuation of 
discrimination but only to guard against retrogression. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Supreme Court decides that issue, it would go a long way  
in determining how easy or difficult it will be for the Justice 
Department to reject proposed election law changes that affect 
minority voting power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bossier Parish school board for years has had its members  
elected to four-year terms from 12 different districts. About 20 
percent of the parish's population is black, concentrated into two 
areas. None of the 12 districts has a black majority. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1990, no black ever had been elected to the school board.  
After the 1990 census required a redrawing of the school board 
election map, the local NAACP chapter proposed creating two 
black-majority districts. The school board opted instead for a new 
map in 1992 with no such district, the same map that had been 
adopted by the parish's chief governing body, called the police 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the police jury's plan had received the Justice  
Department's approval required by the 1965 law, the school board's 
proposed redistricting plan did not. Government lawyers decided the 
plan would dilute minority voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
	While the case wended its way through federal courts, two black  
candidates were elected to the 12-member school board in 1994. They 
were re-elected in 1998, along with a third black candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Reno vs. Bossier Parish School Board, 98-405.

<HEADLINE> CIA Headquarters Named for Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANGLEY, Va. (AP) -- Former President Bush saw the CIA's  
sprawling headquarters named for him Monday and declared himself as 
close as a heartbeat to the agency he once headed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told a cheering audience of intelligence workers he has  
nothing but ``contempt and anger'' for those who would betray the 
sources of U.S. intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74-year-old Bush, the only CIA director ever to become  
president, told a VIP audience gathered under a tent on the plaza 
outside the spy agency's front door he deeply appreciates the act 
of Congress that renamed the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left here 22 years ago after a limited tenure and my stay  
here had a major impact on me, he said. ``CIA became part of my 
heartbeat back then, and it's never gone away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA complex will be known as the George Bush Center for  
Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that in the perilous world left after the breakup of  
the Soviet Union more protection than ever is needed for the 
sources and methods of intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I am a tranquil guy now at this stage of my  
life,'' Bush said, ``I have nothing but contempt and anger for 
those who betray the trust by exposing the name of our sources,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are in my view the most insidious of traitors.''  
</P>
<P>
	He said of his own tenure at the intelligence agency: ``I got  
some things right, and I'm sure I could have done many things 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I hope it will be said of my time here and in the White  
House that I kept the trust and treated my office with respect. I 
know you do that every day, and I know I tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had his one-liners honed for his appearance. When he was  
told that one CIA veteran had said his appearance would ``be like 
Elvis had returned,'' Bush said he would do anything to please 
except sing ``Hound Dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his wife, Barbara, brought him back to earth to remember  
that ``they only name things after you when you're dead or really 
old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was named CIA director by President Ford in 1976 and served  
into the next year after Ford's re-election defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning public life as a two-term congressman from Texas, Bush  
served also as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of 
the Republican National Committee and U.S. envoy to China. He was 
Ronald Reagan's running mate and was elected president in his own 
right in 1988 after eight years as vice president.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Fat-Blocking Diet Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved a long-awaited pill  
Monday that sounds like a dieter's dream: It blocks the body from 
absorbing almost a third of the fat a person eats. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical is supposed to be only for obese people on strict diets.  
Indeed, popping the pill before a big greasy cheeseburger and fries 
is almost certain to cause unpleasant side effects as the leftover 
fat exits the body. 
</P>
<P>
	But Xenical is the first-ever diet drug that works in the gut  
instead of targeting the brain to suppress appetite. So scientists 
expect that, gastrointestinal discomfort aside, it should be a safe 
drug -- unlike two popular appetite suppressants that had to be 
banned in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, doctors are bracing for demand from people seeking  
a magic elixir for weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drug is not a magic bullet,'' stressed Dr. Steven  
Heymsfeld of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, who helped 
research Xenical. ``We don't want it used just casually by itself 
without any diet, or just for cosmetic weight loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical, known chemically as orlistat, blocks intestinal  
enzymes. So instead of being stored on people's hips, 30 percent of 
the fat they eat passes straight to the colon for excretion. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies, adding Xenical to a diet let people lose about 7 1/2  
pounds more in a year than diet alone, the Food and Drug 
Administration said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way it works, Xenical can cause intestinal  
cramping, oily spotting, gas, fecal urgency and oily or loose 
stools. Some 27 percent of Xenical users had at least one episode, 
although the side effects tend to wane the longer people take the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The more fat eaten, the more side effects -- thus, the FDA  
recommended that Xenical users get no more than 30 percent of their 
daily calories from fat, something they can calculate by reading 
food labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical also decreases absorption of the important fat-soluble  
vitamins A, D, E and K, so users should take supplements two hours 
before or after swallowing Xenical. 
</P>
<P>
	Dieters take one Xenical capsule with each main meal, up to  
three daily. Manufacturer Hoffman-La Roche said the 
prescription-only drug will be available within two weeks, at a 
wholesale price of $1.10 per pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical was long-awaited by obesity experts, who say they need  
new alternatives after the ill-fated Redux and the fenfluramine 
half of ``fen-phen'' were banned in 1997 for causing heart damage. 
Those drugs had been wildly popular; many people even bought them 
on the Internet without ever seeing a doctor, something specialists 
say is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other prescription weight-loss drugs are sold in this  
country. Doctors expect many dieters will begin taking Xenical 
together with those appetite suppressants in hopes of greater 
weight loss. But the FDA warned that no one has studied the safety 
of mixing those drugs, and Roche said it has no plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA delayed Xenical's approval by almost two years because  
of a perplexing concern: In studies of over 1,000 patients, 12 
Xenical users came down with breast cancer, vs. just 2 women given 
a dummy pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA ordered Roche to re-study the issue. In January, new  
data from 8,000 women tested worldwide showed just one case of 
breast cancer in a Xenical patient but five in women who had 
received placebos. 
</P>
<P>
	That proved the original worrisome cases were merely a  
statistical fluke and ``makes us comfortable that this drug is not 
in any way promoting breast cancer,'' said FDA chief medical 
reviewer Dr. Eric Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical is not for people who want to drop a quick 10 pounds for  
bathing suit season, cautioned Dr. Richard Atkinson of the 
University of Wisconsin, president of the American Obesity 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It's only for the clinically obese, as measured by a ``body mass  
index'' of 30 -- such as someone 5 feet, 5 inches tall who weighs 
180 pounds -- or a BMI of 27 if they also have high blood pressure 
or other heart disease risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
	For Xenical to do any good, dieters have to eat fewer overall  
calories, not just watch fat, Atkinson stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	As for people who ``eat the pizza and milkshake and take this  
drug and think it's going to absolve them of all their sins, 
they're going to be in for a surprise,'' he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	As Heymsfeld put it: ``If you misbehave, I think you might  
suffer the gastrointestinal consequences.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Reaches a Solid Front on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The often-fractious NATO nations, drawn  
together in an intense air war against ethnic cleansing in 
Yugoslavia, emerged from their summit with tough words for 
President Slobodan Milosevic and a pledge to help friends in the 
Balkans who are suffering the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's 19 leaders molded a solid front at their three-day 50th  
anniversary summit on conduct of the war, an oil blockade against 
Yugoslavia and the direction of the alliance as it enters the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing that happened here, however, was likely to cause  
Milosevic any more worry than he already has. The Yugoslav leader 
has shown his willingness to absorb enormous amounts of punishment 
without flinching. More bombs, an oil embargo -- none of this is 
likely to alter his course. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of NATO's military arm, German Gen. Klaus Naumann,  
acknowledged today there may be a flaw in NATO's conviction that 
its air campaign can bring down Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our flaw may be that we think he has at least a little bit of  
responsibility for his country,'' Naumann said. He said NATO has 
assumed that Milosevic would not be willing to allow his country to 
be pounded into rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Naumann said the alliance had no plans to use force in the  
``visit and search'' of ships in the Adriatic as part of an oil 
embargo. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said details of the oil embargo 
would be worked out quickly, and searching ships would be only part 
of the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies ordered an assessment of the ground-troop option  
before the summit, and at the meetings authorized Gen. Wesley 
Clark, the NATO commander for Europe, to devise a plan to block oil 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit also killed off speculation, at least for the moment,  
that NATO was secretly laying the groundwork for a ground war in 
Kosovo. NATO leaders and officials issued denial after denial that 
they were preparing to invade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This summit was an impressive demonstration of unity despite  
the fact that some skeptics feared it would not be wise to hold a 
summit in times of war,'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said 
Sunday at the end of the three-day convocation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the allies ``reaffirmed our determination  
repeatedly to intensify our actions, military and economic, until 
we achieve our objectives in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``On this, the alliance leaves Washington more united  
even than it was when we came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, the summit's lesson  
was clear: 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees are going to go back, be back in their place in  
their country, and ethnic cleansing will not be victorious in our 
continent as we approach the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allies said repeatedly during a summit shorn of its  
celebratory aura that Kosovo is a conflict they cannot afford to 
lose. It would be disaster for NATO as an organization, and a 
disaster for the security of Europe, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO clearly wants to draft Russia to the cause. Moscow opposes  
NATO military action in Kosovo and has been attempting to get 
Milosevic to budge on the diplomatic front. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton dispatched Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to  
Moscow to urge Russia to press the tough NATO demands for a 
settlement in Kosovo on Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia can be constructive provided they know what our  
position is,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of their final acts, NATO's leaders met with leaders of  
seven of Yugoslavia's neighbors, all feeling the fallout from the 
conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nations of the region have risked, and even faced, armed  
confrontation with Serbia by facilitating and supporting our 
campaign to end the bloodshed in Kosovo,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania and Macedonia have been particularly hard hit, taking in  
nearly 500,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees fleeing Yugoslav military 
action. The other neighboring countries are Bosnia, Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Romania and Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies stressed that any Yugoslav retaliation against its  
neighbors would be met with a response from NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kosovo dominated the summit, the leaders also approved a  
new strategic concept, NATO's basic statement of purpose, which 
plots the alliance's future. This document focuses on Europe's new 
security challenges, largely regional and ethnic conflicts such as 
Kosovo, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The new strategic concept included the European Security and  
Defense Identity, a program to allow European countries freedom to 
conduct operations in which the United States does not want to 
participate, but using NATO assets. It also embraces a new Defense 
Capability Initiative, an attempt to head off a technology gap 
between American forces and the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also approved was a program setting out required steps for  
aspirant members, a sort of road map to joining NATO; an enhanced 
Partnership for Peace program, under which nonmember countries get 
involved in NATO activities which may or may not lead to 
membership; and creation of a center at NATO headquarters for 
dealing with weapons of mass destruction.

up from $6 million for the same period last year. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> In Shooting Aftermath, Clergy Helps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The mourners in Colorado weren't alone.  
</P>
<P>
	On the first Sunday after the most devastating school rampage in  
U.S. history, churchgoers nationwide crowded into pews looking for 
guidance in dealing with their own children, and for answers about 
why someone else's child would turn a gun on a classmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the brilliant stained glass and gothic arches of St.  
Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, Cardinal John O'Connor 
offered a prayer for those ``emotionally and spiritually 
shattered'' by the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere, amid the floral dresses and the whispered prayers,  
there were questions. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Rev. Richard R. Wolschlaeger, of the Swarthmore  
Presbyterian Church in Swarthmore, Pa.: ``What are we to do with 
the horror of Littleton? ... How will adolescents who have 
witnessed firsthand such wanton human evil ever be able to hear the 
shepherd's voice again to lead them from despair to the promise of 
abundant life?'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Rev. Randolph L. Williamson at nearby Trinity Episcopal  
Church, ``How can we look at a world which presents us with these 
images and not lose a sense of sanity, and not become immobilized 
in despair or in apathy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And from the Rev. Susan Swanson of Luther Memorial Church in  
Chicago: ``What is causing all this turmoil? The media? TV? The 
Internet? Music? Or far right-wing hate groups? 
</P>
<P>
	``How can things like this happen in our society -- children  
killing children?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	She also offered an answer: ``Take off the earphones, turn off  
the TV, turn down the radio. ... Start speaking words of love and 
kindness in our families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Ronald M. Shapiro of Congregation Shalom, in Fox Point,  
Wis., also focused on the need to spend time with children and show 
them they're special 
</P>
<P>
	``The preciousness of human life can sometimes be lost in the  
flurry of activity of American life,'' he said during Shabbat 
services Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns over parental supervision and the wide availability of  
firearms were both recurrent themes from small country churches to 
the grandest houses of worship. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, Roman Catholic Cardinal Bernard Law criticized  
society for making guns ``too accessible and too acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And at the Historic Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church in  
Detroit, the Rev. Jim Holley said parents have to take more 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just goes to show you that we need to know what our  
children are doing,'' Holley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. David Schonhoff of Central Church of Christ in  
Chattanooga, Tenn., based his sermon on Proverbs 22:6 of the Bible. 
``Train up a child in the way he should go,'' it says. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on the nation to reclaim its children by reintroducing  
a moral compass. But he said it won't be easy in a society where 
``matters of faith and worship are used in all manner of jokes'' 
and where pop culture shows ``revenge and violence always win.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rebuffs Sex Magazine Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The publisher of sexually explicit magazines  
for ``swingers'' was rebuffed by the Supreme Court today. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, refused to halt enforcement of a  
federal law that requires anyone who produces material depicting 
sexual acts to keep records of the name and age of everyone 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected an appeal in which the Cleveland-based  
Connection Distributing Co. contended that the record-keeping law 
violates free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 law, intended to reduce the sexual exploitation of  
minors, applies to anyone who films, photographs or publishes 
material showing people involved in actual -- not simulated -- sex 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such people must keep records of participants' names and ages  
available for government inspection. The information cannot be used 
to prosecute anyone except those accused of violating the reporting 
law. Violators are subject to fines and up to two years in prison 
for a first offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Connection challenged the law 1995. The company publishes  
magazines for people who do not believe in monogamous sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazines publish personal messages, sometimes accompanied  
by sexually explicit photos, from people who want to meet other 
people. The messages are anonymous, but for a fee the magazine will 
send responses to the person who placed the message. 
</P>
<P>
	Connection's lawsuit said the record-keeping requirement  
suppressed free speech. The publisher said requests to place 
personal messages virtually dried up after it told readers of the 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled against Connection, as did the 6th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals. The law is ``a reasonable attempt to 
prevent the use of minors in pornographic materials,'' the appeals 
court concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking the Supreme Court's help, Connection's lawyers said  
most of those who placed the messages were between 30 and 50, and 
that they ``lost the only forum in which they could safely 
communicate with one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said the challenged law did not bar  
anyone from placing anonymous messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Connection Distributing vs. Reno, 98-1156.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Debate Cost of HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resuming partisan sniping over patient  
protections, Republicans touted a new estimate that predicts a 
Democratic bill would raise private health insurance premiums by 
6.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats fired back that changes being made would put the  
increase at a more modest 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very minimal increase, well in line with every other  
independent estimate we've seen to date of the patient bill of 
rights,'' said Jim Manley, spokesman for Sen. Edward Kennedy, 
D-Mass., one of the chief sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office released its estimates of the  
cost of the patients bill of rights measure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans have their own HMO legislation that would  
cost less but would cover fewer Americans and include fewer 
provisions. The budget office has already said the GOP bill would 
increase premiums by less than 1 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Democratic bill would cover all Americans, give  
them the right to sue their health plans and add a number of other 
provisions meant to ensure easier access to care. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Republicans were promoting new budget estimates,  
arguing that increased costs will simply lead employers to drop 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats' bill fails the single most important test of  
any managed care legislation: helping people obtain affordable 
health care,'' said a statement by Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., who 
chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But in providing the CBO's 6.1 percent estimate of the  
Democratic bill, Jeffords' office failed to note that the budget 
office also indicated the cost might be lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have indicated their intention to clarify the  
bill in ways that could reduce the premium increase to 4.8 
percent,'' CBO Director Dan L. Crippen wrote to Jeffords. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley criticized the Republicans for not including that  
information, calling it ``another typical ploy by the Republicans 
and the special interests downtown designed to derail passage of 
this important legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The typical individual health plan costs about $2,200 per year,  
with a family plan costing about $5,500. Employers typically pay 
much of these premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	For an individual, a 4.8 percent premium increase would  
translate to an extra $106 per year, or $9 per month. For a family 
plan, it would add $264 per year, or $22 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Should premiums rise 6.1 percent, the increase would average  
$134 per year for an individual, $11 per month, and $336 per year 
for a family, $28 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget office says it would take about three years for most  
of the increases to be phased in.

<HEADLINE> Valhol Owner Sues To Get Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The owner of Arkansas Derby winner  
Valhol sued the state's racing authorities today, demanding they 
release the winner's share of the $500,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	James Jackson said the Arkansas Racing Commission was required  
by state law to distribute the purse within 96 hours -- Sunday 
excluded -- of the April 10 race at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs. The 
winner's share is $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race, the commission ordered that the distribution be  
delayed while it addressed concerns that jockey Billy Patin might 
have carried an illegal electrical device. Oaklawn stewards have 
set a hearing for May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulaski County Circuit Judge John Plegge set a hearing on  
Jackson's petition for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson wants to enter Valhol in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday,  
but Valhol most likely will not qualify without the $300,000. Entry 
day is Wednesday, and Jackson wants the purse distributed before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs won't recognize Valhol as the Arkansas Derby  
winner until the money is officially awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs allows up to 20 horses to enter in the Kentucky  
Derby. If more than 20 enter, it takes the top 20 earners of money 
won in graded stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson argues in the suit that ``irreparable harm'' might  
result to him if the court does to grant his request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The petitioner will, in all probability, be denied a starting  
position for Valhol in the Kentucky Derby, the single most 
important and prestigious thoroughbred race in the world, thereby 
depriving Valhol of its once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to run in 
said race,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Discrimination Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether a federal anti-discrimination law on the right to enter 
into contracts protects people who are not U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will review the New York City case of a  
man ousted from his job as a labor union officer after it was 
discovered he is a legal alien, not a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	A 133-year-old civil rights law originally aimed at protecting  
newly freed slaves says all people ``within the jurisdiction of the 
United States shall have the same right in every state and 
territory to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white 
citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courts long have recognized that employment contracts are  
encompassed in the law's protection, but have disagreed whether 
private bias based on anything but race and ethnicity are covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Linden Anderson, a citizen of Jamaica who has lived and worked  
in this country since 1968, joined Local 17 of the United 
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners in 1973. He was elected as 
the union's business representative in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was removed from that post in 1994 after the union's  
court-appointed overseer learned that he is not a citizen. The 
union's constitution requires all its officers to be citizens of 
the country in which their local is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson sued the union, accusing it of illegal discrimination.  
But U.S. District Judge Charles Haight Jr. threw out the case. He 
ruled that the 1866 law, which was amended by the Civil Rights Act 
of 1991, does not protect against private, or nongovernmental, bias 
based on someone's alienage. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
unanimously reversed the judge's ruling last September and 
reinstated Anderson's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court concluded that the 1866 law barred the  
government from discriminating against noncitizens' contractual 
rights, and that the 1991 law extended that protection to 
discrimination by private parties. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the union's lawyers argued that  
the 2nd Circuit court was wrong. They noted that the New 
Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the 
disputed civil rights law does not protect aliens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the issue, and  
some of its past decisions have resulted in lower court confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a 1948 high court ruling said the 1866 law ``has  
been held to extend to aliens as well as to citizens'' and to 
protect them ``either because of alienage or color.'' Some courts 
have interpreted the decision to bar only racial bias aimed at 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on today is United Brotherhood of Carpenters and  
Joiners vs. Anderson, 98-958.

<HEADLINE> US-EU Beef Fight Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 *AP Photos NY107-110    	
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- In principle, the banana war is over.  
</P>
<P>
	But tensions remain between the United States and the European  
Union over banana imports, and a big trade fight over European 
restrictions on American beef is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana fight cooled off when the EU accepted a World Trade  
Organization finding that the EU unfairly discriminate against 
Latin American banana producers and their American distributors in 
favor of former European colonies in Africa and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Under WTO rules, the EU now will rework its import rules, while  
Washington maintains punitive tariffs of $191.4 million per year on 
selected European goods. Once the U.S. side is satisfied, the 
sanctions will be removed, and everyone, the theory goes, will be 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
	But few people expect the Europeans and the Americans to easily  
agree on whatever changes the EU comes up with. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a showdown seems likely over Washington's complaints  
about the EU's 10-year-old ban on importing beef from cattle 
treated with certain growth hormones on the grounds the hormones 
may cause cancer. The United States says that is nonsense and just 
an excuse to protect Europe's cattle farmers from competition. 
Washington claims the ban costs American exporters $250 million per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO already ruled that the ban violates international trade  
rules because the EU's scientific evidence was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans said that meant the ban should be lifted, but the  
Europeans replied they would do more scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Then this past week, the EU further angered Washington by saying  
it would ban even American beef that is certified hormone-free, 
because traces of hormones are still being found -- a decision that 
affects another $20 million of exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans have until May 13 to comply with the WTO's beef  
ruling, but have already said they will not make the deadline to 
complete their scientific research and have no intention of lifting 
the ban. That could bring a round of more U.S. penalty tariffs on 
European goods imported into the United States. The Americans have 
compiled a list of $900 million in proposed sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The beef and banana fights have been around since the formation  
of the World Trade Organization in 1995, replacing a previous 
international trade regime set up after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana war tested the fledgling body's assertion that all  
trade disputes can be sorted out by sticking to a set of rules. 
There are more than 150 disputes currently on the WTO's books, and 
the United States is the country that appears most often, both as 
complainant and alleged violator. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the heart of the system, and this is why our  
organization is different from other organizations,'' said Renato 
Ruggiero, who is stepping down as the WTO's director-general at the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicts that refining the organization's dispute settlement  
procedure will be the big challenge for whoever is named his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana fight had lawyers on both sides finding loopholes and  
ambiguities in the rules that exasperated other members of the 
134-nation WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO finally ruled against the EU, and the Europeans were  
given time to change their policies. When the Jan. 1 deadline 
arrived, Washington said the EU was still breaking the rules by 
discriminating against a region's produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU disputed that, and diplomats got down to intense marathon  
bargaining. Feelings were so bruised that American and European 
representatives refused to negotiate face-to-face for a time, and 
WTO officials had to shuttle between the delegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks lasted until this month. Finally, last Monday, EU  
Ambassador Roderick Abbott announced the EU would not oppose the 
United States' position. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later the meeting broke up with U.S. sanctions against  
European Union goods approved by the WTO and the EU saying it would 
change its rules to bring the banana crisis to a conclusion.

<HEADLINE> US Tries To Calm Russia on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A U.S. envoy arrives in Moscow today to try to  
cool Russia's growing anger over NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia and 
keep Moscow engaged in efforts to find a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was to meet with  
former prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, President Boris 
Yeltsin's special envoy for the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin announced last week that he had reached a tentative  
agreement with Yugoslavia on ending the conflict -- but the Yugoslav 
government rejected Chernomyrdin's claim that it had agreed to let 
an international military force enter Kosovo. Chernomyrdin later 
retreated from his claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting with Talbott apparently would be Chernomyrdin's  
first opportunity to outline what happened during his talks in 
Belgrade last week with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott may also meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and  
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, said U.S. diplomats, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Another likely topic for conversation will be whether Russia  
will observe a NATO attempt to impose an oil blockade on 
Yugoslavia. Russia, which is Belgrade's main source of oil, has 
said it would not honor the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to dispatch Talbott to Moscow came after President  
Clinton discussed the Kosovo conflict with Yeltsin in a telephone 
conversation Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov said Sunday that Russia may beef up its defense budget  
and will review its relations with NATO countries if the alliance 
commits ground troops to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not call directly for more military spending -- as many  
Russian lawmakers have done -- but said, ``We will have to pay more 
attention to defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has strongly denounced the NATO airstrikes against its  
ally Yugoslavia but has insisted it would not intervene militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it has sought to serve as a peace broker. Several  
Russian politicians and diplomatic leaders have traveled to 
Belgrade to meet with Milosevic, but they have achieved no 
breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Yeltsin to press Milosevic to accept a political  
solution and stressed that Russia ``could play a constructive 
role'' in the Kosovo crisis, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, however,  
warned Sunday that Russia's peace initiatives were ``running dry,'' 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO countries have rejected all peaceful initiatives that  
Russia and Yugoslavia have offered,'' said Communist speaker 
Gennady Seleznyov, urging Russian military aid to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov To Get No. 1 Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who has not won a  
match since late February and has lost five times in a row, will 
become the world's top-ranked tennis player next week -- even if he 
loses again. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras, currently No. 1, has withdrawn from his defense of  
the Atlanta clay court tournament this week because of a back 
injury, which likely will keep him sidelined until next month's 
Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Sampras automatically loses 172 ranking points and  
will drop to 3,367, while Kafelnikov, who has none to lose, will at 
least remain unchanged with 3,382. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have now achieved what I set out to achieve my whole life --  
to be No. 1 and to win a Grand Slam,'' Kafelnikov said on the eve 
of his first round match against journeyman Australian Richard 
Fromberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there is definitely going to be more pressure but I knew  
it was going to happen. I am not in the best form right at the 
moment but I think I deserve it. I won a Grand Slam and I had a 
great start to the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the Australian Open in January, the Russian has had  
several chances to replace Sampras as No. 1 but has squandered them 
all. He has been in poor form since winning an indoor tournament in 
London two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov lost his opening matches at Indian Wells, Key  
Biscayne, Estoril, Barcelona and Monte Carlo and goes into this 
week's Czech Open clay court tournament as the top seed because of 
his No. 2 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has been No. 1 for 267 weeks during his career and is  
four weeks away from breaking Ivan Lendl's record of 270.

<HEADLINE>  Hero Teacher Remembered at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Remembering him as a friend and a hero,  
an overflow crowd of 2,500 people said goodbye today to William 
``Dave'' Sanders, the Columbine High School teacher and coach who 
died while trying to save students' lives during last week's 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, his students -- past and present -- walked to the  
front of the Trinity Christian Center to remember his smile, 
dedication and sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believed he saved my life and many other people's,''  
said Lindsay Dowling, one of Sanders' business class students, who 
was in the school cafeteria last Tuesday when she heard Sanders 
yelling for people to get down. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Laurel Salerno, who also was in the cafeteria, didn't  
even wait for his shouts. She said the second she saw the serious 
expression on the usually good-natured teacher, ``I ducked 
underneath the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to thank him for saving my life,'' she said. ``Mr.  
Sanders, I thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 47, was the only teacher to die in last the rampage, in  
which 12 students were also slain, and the two shooters committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire and explosions echoed through the school cafeteria,  
Sanders jumped on tables, shouting for students to get out. He ran 
through the halls, herding students to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Shot twice in the chest, Sanders staggered into a second-floor  
classroom, where students tore off their T-shirts and pressed them 
to his wounds, and covered him with blankets. 
</P>
<P>
	They told him how important he was and tenderly showed him  
pictures of his wife and three daughters from his wallet. But he 
told them: ``I'm not going to make it. Tell my girls I love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine principal Frank De Angelis said Sanders' selflessness  
as a coach and teacher prepared him for his courage during the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hear what a hero Dave was on Tuesday,'' DeAngelis said.  
``But I need to tell you he was a hero before that. He impacted so 
many of our students and teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Black, a former student who was on the track team said  
Sanders ``taught me how to run the hurdles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I fell down quite a few times but he was always there to pick  
me up,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kris Macauley, the assistant basketball coach for the girls  
team that Sanders coached, said, ``I think Dave is up there playing 
basetball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's running and gunning and having lots of fun,'' said Ms.  
Macauley. 
</P>
<P>
	As mourners listened to the testimonials, they clutched hands  
and wiped tears. Students gathered in small groups, embracing each 
other. Most in the crowd wore the now-familiar blue and silver 
ribbons, the school's colors. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral followed Sunday's memorial service in which current  
and former students also remembered Sanders' dedication and 
devotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a really exceptional coach,'' a teary-eyed Stephanie  
Gilbert, 34, said of the man who guided her cross-country team 15 
years ago. ``I was never really into sports. He got me to learn. He 
ran with me the first week of practice to keep me going, right 
beside me. I still run today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners remembered Sanders as an unassuming guy with an easy  
smile, a teacher-coach who taught old-fashioned values. He urged 
students to look for the best in every situation, to strive to do 
their best and be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, a native of Illinois, got his college degree from  
Chadron State in Nebraska in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a former coach, Sanders landed his first -- and  
only -- teaching job at Columbine, where he taught business and 
substituted in the science department. He also coached girls' 
basketball, girls' softball and track for nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't out for glory,'' said Joe Poisson, coach of the  
girls' basketball team in Arvada, a suburb northwest of Denver. 
``His team played really tough defense, and you'd have to play your 
best to win against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' first love was his family: wife Linda; daughters  
Angela, Cindy and Coni; and 10 grandchildren. But his students, 
too, were close to his heart. At Sunday's memorial, they spoke of 
his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you and I will miss you,'' said Amber Burgess. ``I know  
that each day your memory will push me to become a better person 
and to live my life to its fullest.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Fears Immigrant Onslaught </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOUGLAS, Ariz. (AP) -- Roger Barnett perches atop a hill on his  
ranch near the Mexican border and peers across the desert through 
binoculars. He is looking for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Barnett doesn't need to look very far. The steady  
flow of immigrants is evident everywhere in southeastern Arizona, 
he says, angering and frightening many of Arizona's rural 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Mexican and Central American immigrants, pouring in  
by the thousands, have been pushed north recently by devastation in 
the wake of last year's Hurricane Mitch. Others are simply in 
search of jobs in the U.S. interior. 
</P>
<P>
	And, with ongoing immigration crackdowns in California and  
Texas, the clearest route is through Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Their trail is littered with evidence, residents say: plastic  
water bottles, soiled diapers, drained cattle tanks, cut fences or 
water lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the vandalism. Resident Greg Jones said his home  
northeast of Douglas has been broken into five times, the last time 
by a culprit who pounded an 18- by 12-inch hole through his door. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks like Barnett are tired of it, and have begun to take  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, when Barnett and his two brothers came upon  
a group of 27 immigrants on the ranch, the trio confronted them. 
Barnett flashed a blue and gold badge resembling a highway 
patrolman's. It read: ``Barnett Ranch Patrol. Cochise County. State 
of Arizona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was also armed with a 9mm pistol, but never drew it.  
</P>
<P>
	Barnett then turned the group over to the Border Patrol.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, his brother, Jim, apprehended 30 more people,  
most of whom had dashed from a culvert toward his truck, possibly 
thinking he was an alien smuggler come to transport them. They, 
too, were turned over to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Barnett said he's called the patrol several dozen times to  
pick up people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if the way I'm doing it is the solution or not,''  
he says. ``But it sure has brought national attention to the 
problem we've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attention is what people here want.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to plead with the government to get their butt down  
here and do something about it before it does turn nasty, because 
it will,'' said Larry Vance, spokesman for a local group called 
Concerned Area Citizens of the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, overburdened U.S. Border Patrol officials have urged  
people not to take the law into their own hands, and told them to 
call authorities when they encounter undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	John L. Koren, who heads the Douglas Border Patrol station, said  
that in March his roughly 300 agents apprehended 27,225 border 
crossers, a local record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We arrest what we can ... you can only do so much,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In some case, violence already has broken out, and worried  
residents warn that more is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	A Santa Cruz County rancher faces prosecution for allegedly  
wounding a Mexico City man walking through his ranch on Jan. 24. 
And last week, an illegal entrant said she heard three shots fired 
as she approached a ranch near Hereford, about 40 miles west. 
</P>
<P>
	Since only immigration officers are authorized to arrest people  
for immigration violations, Barnett's apprehension of the 27 aliens 
triggered an outcry from the Arizona Border Rights Project, a human 
rights organization. The U.S. Attorney's office has started an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Matus, spokesman for the coalition, blames U.S. immigration  
policy and inflammatory rhetoric of government leaders for creating 
a dangerous situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The rancher roundups, he said, violate the civil rights of  
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	David Stoddard, a retired Border Patrol supervisory agent, said  
Barnett has been a friend for 40 years. But, he said, flashing a 
badge as Barnett did, suggesting to people that he was a law 
enforcement officer, ``is immoral if not illegal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local sentiment, however, clearly is in Barnett's corner.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the people of this country to protect themselves,''  
said Bill Wendt, who has put iron bars on his adobe home. Unless 
authorities do something, he said, ``bad things are going to start 
really happening.''

<HEADLINE> Fishery Plan Aims To Rebuild Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to rebuild declining migratory fish  
stocks in Atlantic and Gulf waters, federal regulators announced 
new fishing restrictions today for shark, Atlantic tuna and 
so-called ``billfish,'' including marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of overfishing has resulted in such a decline in the  
number of Atlantic migratory fish that environmentalists fear some 
species such as shark, swordfish and blue marlin could be 
threatened with extinction. Chefs at some pricy restaurants in the 
Northeast last year said they would not serve swordfish because of 
the species' dramatic decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service announced today it will  
press in international negotiations for a 10-year recovery program 
for swordfish that would require a 27 percent reduction in 
swordfish landings. By treaty, the United States can't set a quota 
on swordfish independently. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency said it would move on its own to reduce  
commercial fishing for large coastal shark, imposing tougher quotas 
on the number of such sharks that may be caught as well as size 
limits on some species. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fish management plans apply to federal Atlantic waters  
and the Gulf of Mexico from Maine to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an atmosphere of intensely competing interests, we have  
crafted what we think is a fair reflection of the public's wishes 
while at the same time never losing sight of our goal to rebuild 
these species,'' said Terry Garcia, the Commerce Department's 
assistant secretary for oceans and atmosphere. The fisheries 
service is part of the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency held off a decision on how to deal with the large  
number of juvenile swordfish that are killed each year as 
``bycatch.'' It had proposed closing an area in the Florida 
straights for three months out of the year to reduce juvenile 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalits said that was inadequate. The agency said  
it would re-examine the issue and announce a plan later this that 
likely will require a larger area, including the Florida Keys, to 
be put off-limits to protect juvenile fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, environmentalists have focused on the threat  
to swordfish, persuading some restaurants to ban the fish from 
their menus. Last year, in a largely symbolic move, chefs from 27 
of the country's finest restaurants said they would keep the fish 
off the menu for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swordfish is emblematic of a lot of the problems that face  
fisheries,'' said Lisa Speer of the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, an environmental advocacy group. ``The population is down 
to the lowest level ever recorded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's management plan also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require new restrictions on fishing for Atlantic yellowfin tuna  
and close some bluefin tuna fishries off the New Jersey coast 
druing the month of June. 
</P>
<P>
	--Adopt restrictions on fishing for Atlantic bluefin tuna, along  
the lines of an international agreement reached last November, with 
a 20-year recovery goal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Further restrict recreational catches of shark. The number of  
fish allowed to be caught would be reduced from two to one per day 
per vessel. The agency backed off from a ``catch-and-release'' 
requirement because of opposition from fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	--Add restrictions on landings of blue and white marlin and other  
so-called ``billfish'' by recreational fishermen. Marlin stocks 
have declined to about a quarter of the numbers needed for 
long-term survival, leading to a ban on commercial catches a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of some species of shark has declined by as much as  
85 percent, according to marine biologists. ``Hardest hit have been 
the large coastal sharks,'' said Sonja Fordham of the Center for 
Marine Conservation. ``They are especially vulnerable to 
overfishing because they grow slowly, mature late and have a small 
number of young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swordfish populations have declined dramatically because too  
many young fish are being caught, biologists say. The average size 
of a swordfish today is one-third of what it was 30 years ago, and 
as many as a third of the roughly 110,000 swordfish caught each 
year are juveniles killed as bycatch -- caught incidentally in the 
process of fishing for something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a serious bycatch problem'' with swordfish that the  
proposals that had been considered in draft plans did not 
adequately address the problem, said Kenneth Hinman, president of 
the National Coalition for Marine Conservation.

Macauley. 
</P>
<P>
	As mourners listened to the testimonials, they clutched hands  
and wiped tears. Students gathered in small groups, embracing each 
other. Most in the crowd wore the now-familiar blue and silver 
ribbons, the school's colors. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral followed Sunday's memorial service in which current  
and former students also remembered Sanders' dedication and 
devotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a really exceptional coach,'' a teary-eyed Stephanie  
Gilbert, 34, said of the man who guided her cross-country team 15 
years ago. ``I was never really into sports. He got me to learn. He 
ran with me the first week of practice to keep me going, right 
beside me. I still run today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners remembered Sanders as an unassuming guy with an easy  
smile, a teacher-coach who taught old-fashioned values. He urged 
students to look for the best in every situation, to strive to do 
their best and be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, a native of Illinois, got his college degree from  
Chadron State in Nebraska in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a former coach, Sanders landed his first -- and  
only -- teaching job at Columbine, where he taught business and 
substituted in the science department. He also coached girls' 
basketball, girls' softball and track for nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't out for glory,'' said Joe Poisson, coach of the  
girls' basketball team in Arvada, a suburb northwest of Denver. 
``His team played really tough defense, and you'd have to play your 
best to win against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' first love was his family: wife Linda; daughters  
Angela, Cindy and Coni; and 10 grandchildren. But his students, 
too, were close to his heart. At Sunday's memorial, they spoke of 
his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you and I will miss you,'' said Amber Burgess. ``I know  
that each day your memory will push me to become a better person 
and to live my life to its fullest.''

<HEADLINE> US, Allies See Economic Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and its major allies said  
Monday that the world economy still faces a number of ``serious 
challenges'' stemming from a 20-month-old global currency crisis. 
They pledged closer cooperation to boost growth and help lift 
crisis countries out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitments came in an eight-page joint statement issued at  
the end of an afternoon of discussions among finance ministers and 
central bank presidents from the world's seven largest economies -- 
the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration sought during the meetings to impress  
upon Japan and its European allies that they must do more to boost 
growth in order to take pressure off America's soaring trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint statement expressed concern about the need to achieve  
``more balanced growth among our countries to reduce external 
imbalances and to continue to support recovery in emerging 
markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the group did not spell out how this increased growth  
would be achieved, its statement noted that the outlook remained 
favorable for continued price stability -- a signal that interest 
rate cuts by individual countries could be used to boost domestic 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``In recent months, there have been improvements in some  
areas,'' the G-7 statement said. ``A number of serious challenges 
remain, however, that will take time to resolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other U.S. officials have  
been speaking with increased urgency in recent weeks about 
forecasts that Japan, already in its worst recession in 50 years, 
will see its economy shrink further this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, U.S. officials have become alarmed about recent  
reductions in growth prospects for Europe. The administration is 
concerned that unless other major powers return to more solid 
growth, the U.S. trade deficit, already at record levels, will soar 
even higher and add to protectionist pressures in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a global economy in which the only major area that's doing  
well is the United States, there are enormous challenges going 
ahead and uncertainties we all have to be focused on,'' Rubin told 
reporters after the G-7 discussions ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said there was general  
agreement that the global recovery remained too fragile to provide 
any ``grounds for complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that language  
in the communique calling on Japan to use ``all available tools'' 
to ensure a sustained recovery meant only that Japan should ``do 
its best,'' not that Japan should ``do something new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to concerns about the outlook for recovery this  
year, the G-7 group gave a general endorsement to continuing with 
efforts to reform the global financial architecture to prevent or 
at least better cope with future Asian-style currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	It endorsed a breakthrough that occurred Sunday with final  
approval by the 182-nation International Monetary Fund for a new 
contingency line of credit that will make billions of dollars of 
loans available to countries pursuing sound policies before a 
currency crisis hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval represents a major victory for President Clinton,  
who first advanced the idea last fall at the height of the global 
crisis after Russia shocked markets worldwide with a botched 
devaluation of the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials, who met with the G-7 at the end of Monday's  
discussions, emerged to express hope that they are near an 
agreement with the IMF on economic reforms that will allow the IMF 
to resume lending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good feeling about our position with the G-7,''  
Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	While there had been speculation that the West might tie its  
resumption of financial support to Russia to that country dropping 
its objections to NATO's bombing of Kosovo, Zadornov said Kosovo 
never came up in the G-7 discussions of the Russian economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 statement did condemn the ``brutal violence against the  
ethnic Albanians of Kosovo'' and pledged financial for neighboring 
countries in the region to help them cope with the war and the 
exodus of refugees. The IMF announced it will hold a donors' 
conference with more than 40 nations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin enlisted the support of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan to help convince other G-7 members that they needed to 
make greater efforts to support a fragile global recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade deficit hit a record $169 billion last year and  
is headed higher this year, triggering rising protectionist 
pressures in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 statement said Clinton and other leaders will address  
remaining issues on reforms to the global architecture when they 
hold their annual economic summit, in Cologne, Germany, in 
mid-June.

<HEADLINE> US Wants Allies To Repair Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, enlisting the  
support of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, pushed ahead 
today with efforts to persuade some major U.S. allies to do more to 
get a shaken world economy back on track and help relieve pressure 
on a soaring American trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan joined Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in meetings  
with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and German Finance 
Minister Hans Eichel. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions centered on recent worrisome sings of an  
economic slowdown in Europe and the need for Japan to increase 
efforts to end that country's worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials said that the two countries also discussed  
Japanese steel shipments to the United States. President Clinton 
has warned Japan that unless steel imports from Japan decline 
dramatically, the administration will bring a trade case against 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry has been one of the hardest hit domestic  
industries from the global financial crisis, which has sent a flood 
of low-cost steel shipments pouring into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A key administration goal is to convince both Germany and Japan  
that more must be done to promote economic growth and take some of 
the pressure off America's soaring trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	A Treasury spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
that during the meeting with the Japanese, Rubin ``stressed the 
importance of implementing stimulus measures until growth is 
restored using all available tools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the only major economy doing well at  
present. U.S. officials are concerned that without a pickup in 
growth in Japan and Europe, the global recovery from the 
20-month-old Asian currency crisis will remain uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's meetings today were in advance of the spring meetings of  
the 182-nation International Monetary Fund. IMF officials announced 
that there will be a special conference of more than 40 countries 
on Tuesday to assess the economic needs of the European countries 
that have been affected by the war in Yugoslavia and the flood of 
refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Those participating will include countries in the region plus  
prospective donor nations to the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told an audience  
Sunday night that if America's allies do their part to bolster 
global growth, the United States will do ``everything we can to 
preserve solid growth in our economy and keep our own markets open 
to the emerging economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there are a number of hopeful signs that the financial  
crisis that pushed one-third of the globe into recession is finally 
ending, Rubin has repeatedly cautioned against complacency, warning 
that the world is ``not on healthy, firm footing, because we are 
the only economy doing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the one-on-one sessions with Germany and Japan,  
Rubin and Greenspan were to join their counterparts from the 
world's seven richest countries for talks on the global economy 
later in the day. The Group of Seven nations are the United States, 
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the need to promote better growth among the large  
economies, the G-7 officials will also focus on a package of U.S. 
proposals to try to remodel the global financial system to avert or 
at least better handle future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States scored an early victory on its proposals when  
the International Monetary Fund announced Sunday that its executive 
board had given final approval to a major change in IMF procedures 
designed to speed billions of dollars in financial assistance to 
countries before their economies are ravaged by economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had first called for the IMF to adopt the new approach  
of approving contingency loans for countries pursuing sound 
policies in hopes that the presence of large back-up reserves would 
convince investors to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
	During the recent global currency crisis, the IMF has approved  
more than $100 billion in rescue packages but only after nations 
have been pushed into deep recessions and their currencies pummeled 
by frightened investors all rushing for the exits at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing approval of the new contingent credit lines, IMF  
Managing Director Michel Camdessus said that it would encourage 
countries to pursue proper policies and could end up costing the 
IMF less by providing support up front before disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that this will be an important contribution for  
the world to be better prepared for future crisis,'' Camdessus told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also praised the IMF action and expressed the  
hop that it would be the first of a number of reforms to the world 
monetary system that the international community will approve 
including proposals he will put forward at this year's economic 
summit in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops Into Negative Ground / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks wobbled today, dipping back  
into negative territory at midday. But strength in technology 
shares took the Nasdaq composite into record territory, extending a 
strong rebound from last Monday's 5.6 percent plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 3.44 at 10,686.23, after trading up and down all morning. The 
Dow ended Friday's session down 37 points at 10,689.67 but it 
reached two record closing highs last week, the latest one on 
Thursday at 10,727.18. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare departure from the normal scramble on Wall Street,  
trading was halted for one minute of silence at noon on the New 
York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market 
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange in memory of the Colorado high 
school shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Dow's loss could be attributed to Merck, which was  
off 1 3/4 at 74, which translates to more than 8 points on the Dow. 
Merck's share were lower amid concerns about the drugmaker's 
expiring patents. On Friday, Merck reported first-quarter earnings 
that were in line with expectations, but mostly because of a 
restructuring of its joint venture with Astra AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, broader stock indicators were higher, with the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 1.13 at 1,357.98, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 47.90 at 2,638.59. That 
put Nasdaq on track to surpass the previous high of 2,598.81, set 
April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were continuing a shift that started late last week.  
They were showing less interest today in the shares of economically 
sensitive companies, which had been briefly popular because they 
were viewed as a bargain by investors who have faith that the world 
economy is improving. But investors were back buying ``growth'' 
stocks, the shares of companies such as technology concerns that 
may have not yet hit their stride in earnings but that are expected 
to show good results in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect market,'' said Rao Chalasani, a market  
analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago. ``Right now, there is 
harmony between value and growth. A month ago it was only growth; 
now, value and growth are coexisting, and there's no reason why it 
shouldn't, because the world economy is improving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market had a mixed reaction to earnings reports today.  
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust, for example, which this morning reported  
first-quarter profit numbers that beat Wall Street's estimates. BT 
stock was up 5/16 at 90 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though drugmaker Warner-Lambert reported earnings this  
morning that beat analysts' expectations by 1 cent a share, its 
stock was down 1 3/4 at 66 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are anxiously awaiting some earnings reports in the  
technology sector after a spectacular performance by IBM, reported 
late last Wednesday, took the market sharply higher. Today, online 
auctioneer e-Bay is slated to report after the close of trading. 
Its stock was up 13 13/16 at 117 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM shares were still getting a boost from last week's profit  
report; its stock was up 5 13/16 at 205 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	On the merger front, AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecommunications  
PLC will take a combined 30 percent stake in Japan Telecom Co. for 
$1.84 billion. AT&AMP;T, which met investor skepticism last week with 
an unsolicited bid for MediaOne Group, was down 11/16 at 52 11/16. 
But British Telecom's American shares were up 7 7/8 at 170. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, banking in stocks in general were lower along with  
bond prices. Dow component Citigroup was down 1/4 at 74 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues led decliners by a narrow 1,394 to 1,356 on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 312.85 million shares at late morning, 
down from Friday's pace of 342.69 million.

<HEADLINE>  Community Draws Together in Grief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They streamed in from all over --  
hand-lettered signs and cards and bouquets by the hundreds, aimed 
at comforting a town torn asunder. One good wish, soaked by the 
morning rain, was signed, simply, ``Your community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what community was it from? So many forms of community,  
rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have 
come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown  
of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has 
produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, 
still thrives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jefferson County has 500,000 residents, but today our  
community is much larger,'' county commissioner Patricia Holloway 
said Sunday at a shopping-center parking lot service attended by 
70,000 people -- a hastily stitched-together community unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine  
students and Columbine Valley residents. There are myriad 
mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students, 
their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel, 
united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and 
Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's 
anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community. 
</P>
<P>
	The list continues onward, outward -- beyond metropolitan Denver,  
past President Clinton and his prayers, as far as the president of 
the West African nation of Ghana, who counted himself among the 
community of Littleton mourners and said ``something must be done 
to stop this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The response is most visible in metropolitan Denver, radiating  
outward from the high school and adjacent Clement Park, which has 
become a mourner's Lourdes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast-food restaurants are flying flags at half-staff and posting  
sympathy signs. Businesses are contributing goods and raising 
funds. Denver's newscasters have donned blue Columbine ribbons. 
Big-league sports teams canceled games in deference; Mile High 
Stadium now sports a giant Columbine ribbon visible from Interstate 
25. Hugs have become a greeting of choice -- even, sometimes, 
between strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get so busy in our everyday lives and we're so  
self-sufficient that we think we don't need the help of our 
community,'' said Marny Danneberg, a volunteer dispensing hot 
drinks and food from a Red Cross truck near the high school since 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's when something like this happens that we realize the  
community's there for us,'' she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shootings, messages and contributions of support came  
in from across the nation, from towns and individuals that 
repeatedly reassured mourners that they were ``part of a larger 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folks from Elgin, Ill., drove a giant banner of support into  
town. Kids by the busload came from towns across the West to share 
grief. In Seaside Heights, N.J., 1,800 miles away, Mayor P. Kenneth 
Kershey scheduled a candlelight vigil on an Atlantic Ocean beach as 
``a clear demonstration of the nationwide caring for the people of 
Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What unifies regions this way? A national culture, for one -- the  
very mass media that many blame for fomenting the violence. 
Instantaneous news delivery unites people in shock and grief, 
creating a virtual community of TV viewers and another of Internet 
users that didn't exist 40 years ago. Thus, people who don't know 
each other can mourn together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire nation is a community of shock, of love and of  
grief,'' Vice President Al Gore said Sunday. ``One of the hidden 
truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton (literally ``Little Town''), an affluent town of  
35,000 at the foot of the Rockies, the fresh bonding of its 
existing communities and the birth of so many new ones are serving 
as salves for recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents say the area around Columbine in the Southern Platte  
River Valley has been a tight-knit community for 26 years, since 
the high school opened on an undeveloped patch of prairie and 
houses sprouted up around it. This was long before the retail 
sprawl unfurled from the north to connect Columbine to Denver and 
make the area a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``A community formed around that high school, and the school  
grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened 
Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years. ``It 
has a sound community base to it that's somewhat unusual for a 
suburban high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, though a few patches of open prairie remain, houses  
continue to sprout. And the families that have streamed into 
Denver's suburbs in recent years have, some say, created a populace 
unfamiliar with its neighbors -- one hungry for the coming-together 
that the Columbine deaths caused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disaster brings out the best of us, not the worst. People may  
not know each other, but when disaster hits that doesn't matter. We 
knock on the neighbor's door and talk about it,'' says Robert R. 
Butterworth, a psychologist who studies both child trauma and how 
people cope with public tragedy. ``That sense of reaching out makes 
us feel better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That reaching out resonates nationally and globally as people  
sew together crisis bonds that wouldn't otherwise exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the event recedes and coping begins, some are hoping  
that perhaps, this time, the unity allegedly caused by two angry 
boys' violent acts can last. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have known the revival they have started, they  
never would have done what they did,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose 
daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine. ``They wanted death and 
destruction. Instead, we've all come together.''

in from across the nation, from towns and individuals that 
repeatedly reassured mourners that they were ``part of a larger 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folks from Elgin, Ill., drove a giant banner of support into  
town. Kids by the busload came from towns across the West to share 
grief. In Seaside Heights, N.J., 1,800 miles away, Mayor P. Kenneth 
Kershey scheduled a candlelight vigil on an Atlantic Ocean beach as 
``a clear demonstration of the nationwide caring for the people of 
Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What unifies regions this way? A national culture, for one -- the  
very mass media that many blame for fomenting the violence. 
Instantaneous news delivery unites people in shock and grief, 
creating a virtual community of TV viewers and another of Internet 
users that didn't exist 40 years ago. Thus, people who don't know 
each other can mourn together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire nation is a community of shock, of love and of  
grief,'' Vice President Al Gore said Sunday. ``One of the hidden 
truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton (literally ``Little Town''), an affluent town of  
35,000 at the foot of the Rockies, the fresh bonding of its 
existing communities and the birth of so many new ones are serving 
as salves for recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents say the area around Columbine in the Southern Platte  
River Valley has been a tight-knit community for 26 years, since 
the high school opened on an undeveloped patch of prairie and 
houses sprouted up around it. This was long before the retail 
sprawl unfurled from the north to connect Columbine to Denver and 
make the area a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``A community formed around that high school, and the school  
grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened 
Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years. ``It 
has a sound community base to it that's somewhat unusual for a 
suburban high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, though a few patches of open prairie remain, houses  
continue to sprout. And the families that have streamed into 
Denver's suburbs in recent years have, some say, created a populace 
unfamiliar with its neighbors -- one hungry for the coming-together 
that the Columbine deaths caused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disaster brings out the best of us, not the worst. People may  
not know each other, but when disaster hits that doesn't matter. We 
knock on the neighbor's door and talk about it,'' says Robert R. 
Butterworth, a psychologist who studies both child trauma and how 
people cope with public tragedy. ``That sense of reaching out makes 
us feel better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That reaching out resonates nationally and globally as people  
sew together crisis bonds that wouldn't otherwise exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the event recedes and coping begins, some are hoping  
that perhaps, this time, the unity allegedly caused by two angry 
boys' violent acts can last. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have known the revival they have started, they  
never would have done what they did,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose 
daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine. ``They wanted death and 
destruction. Instead, we've all come together.''

<HEADLINE> Radiation May Cause DNA Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cells may be more sensitive to genetic damage  
caused by radiation from radon gas than previously believed, 
according to research that found high energy particles do not need 
to hit the nucleus of a cell to cause DNA changes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a laboratory study to be published Tuesday, researchers aimed  
alpha particles -- a decay product from radon gas -- at the fluid 
surrounding nuclei in cells taken from a hamster, and they found 
that radiation could cause genetic changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prevailing view has been that in order to cause genetic  
damage you have to irradiate the DNA directly in the cell 
nucleus,'' said Gerhard Randers-Pehrson of Columbia University, a 
co-author of the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences. ``What we find is that you can irradiate outside of 
the nucleus and still cause that type of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randers-Pehrson said scientists who calculate the health effects  
of radiation exposure will have to take this new finding into 
account, but that it is not yet clear how the research will affect 
the risk estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may turn out there is more damage to the DNA at low doses  
than previously assumed, but that is something that scientists who 
make these extrapolations will have to determine,'' said 
Randers-Pehrson. ``It is unclear as yet whether the results imply 
greater or lesser risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure to radon gas, a natural byproduct from the decay of  
uranium and radium in soil and rocks, is thought to cause about 
21,000 American lung cancer deaths annually, second only to 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Radon gas can leak from the earth and collect in basements. When  
inhaled, the gas can leave in the lungs alpha particles that emit 
low levels of radiation over long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much radon poses a health risk has been controversial,  
but the Environmental Protectection Agency recommends that the 
concentration of radon gas in homes be kept below 4 picocuries (a 
measure of radiation) per liter of air. A National Academy of 
Sciences study last year estimated that since 1980, Americans have 
spent about $400 million on radon gas tests and on renovations to 
vent buildings where the gas can collect. The study estimated that 
about 6 percent of American homes have radon concentrations that 
would merit corrective action. 
</P>
<P>
	Radon cancer risk estimates have been based, in part, on the  
belief that mutations that can lead to cancer occur only if 
radiation particles directly hit the cell nucleus that contains the 
DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, Randers-Pehrson and his colleagues used a  
machine to zap cytoplasm, the part of the cell outside of the 
nucleus, with precise numbers of alpha particles. The number of 
particles is representative of the intensity of radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that cytoplasm hits of three to eight particles could  
trigger a genetic change in a cell. Randers-Pehrson said they also 
found that when the cytoplasm was hit, the cells tended to survive 
and were more likely to pass mutations into new generations of 
cells, a critical step in the formation of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alpha particles striking the DNA directly tends to cause such  
extensive damage that the cell is generally killed and does not 
make new cells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew J. Grosovsky, a radiation biologist at the University of  
California, Riverside, said the Columbia University study may 
``prompt a reassessment'' of the risks of radon gas. But he noted 
that ``it is way too early to tell what the consequences of this 
new understanding will be'' in recommendations about radon gas 
exposure.

<HEADLINE> Panel Studies Gambling Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate over changing state lotteries was  
covering familiar terrain -- more money for gambling addiction 
programs, less aggressive advertising -- when Richard Leone steered 
it toward a political minefield. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps states should not make any money from the lottery, Leone  
suggested to fellow members of a federal panel studying gambling. 
Rather, states could pool people's bets, invest the entire pot for 
a year, then divide the proceeds in a drawing. 
</P>
<P>
	His ``savings lottery'' idea died fast, but Leone had made his  
point. The former New Jersey state treasurer has become the 
resident provocateur on the National Gambling Impact Study 
Commission, arguing for a report that is blunt, controversial, even 
outlandish in its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear is that ... we'll come up with something relatively  
small-bore that is mostly an outline or an encyclopedia of gambling 
in the United States in 1999,'' Leone said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather see us speak out rather forcefully on how  
troubled we are by the increasing invasion of gambling into 
neighborhoods and into homes and into families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the argument, advocating a more encyclopedic  
approach, is John Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel Employees 
and Restaurant Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The report will be ``useless and irrelevant'' if it recommends  
legislative measures that will not be enacted or will do no good, 
he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think information has great power. I have a lot of  
confidence in the American people,'' Wilhelm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two contrasting positions reflect the difficulty that the  
nine-member commission, which meets for two days this week, is 
having in making recommendations on national gambling policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel runs an ideological gamut from conservative activist  
James Dobson, who opposes gambling, to J. Terrence Lanni, who makes 
his living as chief executive officer of Las Vegas-based MGM Grand 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the commission nears a June deadline for its report, the  
debate is defined more about activism versus restraint in the 
industry than it is simply about pro-gambling versus anti-gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Best representing that divide are Leone and Wilhelm, with  
distinct views and backgrounds when it comes to gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm, appointed to the commission by House Minority Leader  
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is president of a union that represents 
75,000 casino employees. In a running joke, commission chairwoman 
Kay James keeps track of how much time goes by at each meeting 
before Wilhelm utters the word ``jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leone, appointed by President Clinton, was state treasurer when  
New Jersey voters approved casino gambling for Atlantic City in 
1976. Leone lobbied against legalized gambling even though the 
governor, Brendan Byrne, supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the president of the Twentieth Century Fund, a public policy  
research institution, Leone admits he was wrong in his contention 
back then that organized crime would infiltrate casino operations. 
But his discomfort with government-sanctioned casinos and 
government-run lotteries remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Leone said he will continue to recommend controversial ideas for  
the commission's report. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we really decide not much is possible, then we'll fail, and  
we won't get much attention,'' he said. ``I think this commission's 
obligation is to push people, to be considered far out and radical. 
If we're not, who's going to do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final report on the economic and social impacts of legalized  
gambling will go to Congress, the president, state governments and 
tribal governments.

<HEADLINE> Broadcom in High-Speed Network Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Broadcom Corp., a leading developer of  
technology for high-speed Internet connections, said it will buy 
Epigram Inc. for $316 million in an effort to expand into the home 
networking market. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine, Calif.-based Broadcom, supplies silicon chips for cable  
modems, set-top television boxes and Ethernet computer networking 
gear, such as switches. Epigram, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has 
focused on broadband networking within the home, particularly chips 
that allow personal computers and related devices to communicate 
via existing telephone wiring within the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcom Chief Executive Henry Nicholas III said in today's  
edition of The Wall Street Journal that he plans to integrate the 
Epigram's technology into Broadcom's current set of products. The 
company wants to provide a complete set of chips for 
high-performance, or broadband, networks that extend from the 
public-network switch to the home PC, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcom executives contend that as high-speed Internet  
connections become available to more people, families will want to 
link multiple devices, such as computers, phones and cable-TV 
hookups, at similar speeds.

<HEADLINE> Blame Assigned in Colo. Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)-- Amid this community's shock and sorrow,  
the attempts to assign blame have begun. How did Dylan Klebold and 
Eric Harris escape notice, some are asking, when so many warning 
signs were there? 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff blames the teens' parents. Families of victims say  
teachers should have noticed ominous behavior that was obvious to 
students. Others criticize court officials for being duped by the 
killers. Youth advocates fault a community that doesn't want to 
believe some of its children could be troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Some blame themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	``Students, forgive us, because we failed you,'' the Rev. Bruce  
Porter said Saturday at one slain student's funeral. Porter 
shrugged and said he hopes the children can do what parents, 
preachers, police and politicians had not: Make the world safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to take your schools back, YOU have to do it,''  
Porter implored. ``We can't. We have failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One week ago, Klebold and Harris stormed into Columbine High  
School and killed a teacher, 12 students and themselves. In 
hindsight, it seems obvious to many in this prosperous suburb south 
of Denver that someone should have noticed the troubled teens long 
before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Around school, Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, openly admired  
Hitler, celebrating strikes in bowling class by giving the Nazi 
salute. They wore black trench coats and played violent video games 
for hours. Harris wrote hate-filled messages on the Internet, 
vowing death to all who had slighted him. The pair stockpiled an 
arsenal that included semi-automatic guns and enough explosives to 
make 30 bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents should have known,'' Sheriff John Stone said.  
According to a diary kept by Harris, the teens planned their attack 
for a year. Searching the gunmen's homes, investigators found the 
sawed-off barrel of a shotgun on one boy's dresser. Bomb-making 
materials also were clearly in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would be a little concerned about my son's room if I  
went in there and I found a sawed-off shotgun barrel,'' Stone said. 
``I think parents should be accountable for their kid's actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet friends and neighbors describe the parents of both teens as  
anything but negligent. By all accounts, they led everyday suburban 
lives, attending Little League games and taking their sons swimming 
and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' families wonder why school officials didn't notice  
anything amiss. Since the shooting, there have been reports that 
Harris and Klebold made violent videos for a class project, wrote 
hate stories in English class, hurled racist comments at 
schoolmates, and belonged to an outcast group of students called 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	But teachers say Klebold and Harris didn't stand out.  
</P>
<P>
	``At least half the stories I have heard, I find out aren't  
true,'' said Schools Superintendent Jane Hammond. There was no 
video that ``at all resembled'' last week's attack, she said. The 
principal at Columbine High said he had never even seen a student 
wearing a black trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County court system is under fire for being fooled  
by Harris and Klebold, who last year entered a diversion program to 
clear their records of a car-burglary arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time they were planning their attack on Columbine,  
the teens completed 45 hours of community service, received 
counseling and wrote an apology to the car's owner. Harris received 
additional counseling in anger management. Less than three months 
ago, their court officer recommended that the teens be allowed to 
complete the program early because of their bright prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold ``is intelligent enough to make any dream a reality,''  
the unidentified officer wrote. Harris enjoyed his anger-management 
counseling and ``is a very bright young man who is likely to 
succeed in life,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The diversion officer now feels terrible, said his boss,  
District Attorney Dave Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anguishing over what happened here,'' said Thomas, who  
believes the officer did the best he could. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys came in and put their best face on,'' Thomas said.  
``Most of us in the system wish we were human lie-detectors, but 
we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department was criticized by a Columbine parent,  
Randall Brown, who said he complained last year that Harris and 
Klebold had threatened his son. Brown said he backed up his 
complaint with pages of venomous writings from Harris' Internet 
home page. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheriff's spokesman confirmed that a ``suspicious incident  
report'' had been filed but did not know the extent to which the 
department followed up on Brown's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe Harris and Klebold escaped notice in part because  
residents here cling to the notion that Littleton is a haven from 
social ills such as youth violence. People often move here so their 
kids can go to a good school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a community in denial,'' said Michael Briand, a  
community development consultant who helped found the Littleton 
Area Youth Council. ``A lot of folks don't want to know if there's 
a problem with their kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Briand and others held several forums on youth  
violence in Littleton. None attracted more than 10 people, he said. 
More recently, his group suggested doing a survey of children's 
psychological needs as a way to confirm teachers' stories of deeply 
troubled kids in the schools. They were dissuaded by a school board 
member who said the survey's personal questions would stir up too 
much controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	The moral debate is likely to become a legal one. In other  
recent school shootings around the nation, families of victims have 
sued killers' parents, teachers, schoolmates, gun manufacturers and 
purveyors of violent images in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers are watching for signs of negligence on the part of  
anyone who had frequent contact -- or should have had frequent 
contact -- with Klebold and Harris, said Marc Kaplan, president of 
the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	While that may be the American way, District Attorney Thomas  
believes it misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the responsibility of the individual,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As Thomas sees it, the world may have failed these troubled  
young men, but nobody made them pull the trigger.

<HEADLINE> NATO Reaches a Solid Front on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The often-fractious NATO nations, drawn  
together in an intense air war against ethnic cleansing in 
Yugoslavia, emerged from their summit with tough words for 
President Slobodan Milosevic and a pledge to help friends in the 
Balkans who are suffering the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's 19 leaders molded a solid front at their three-day 50th  
anniversary summit on conduct of the war, an oil blockade against 
Yugoslavia and the direction of the alliance as it enters the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing that happened here, however, was likely to cause  
Milosevic any more worry than he already has. The Yugoslav leader 
has shown his willingness to absorb enormous amounts of punishment 
without flinching. More bombs, an oil embargo -- none of this is 
likely to alter his course. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of NATO's military arm, German Gen. Klaus Naumann,  
acknowledged today there may be a flaw in NATO's conviction that 
its air campaign can bring down Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our flaw may be that we think he has at least a little bit of  
responsibility for his country,'' Naumann said. He said NATO has 
assumed that Milosevic would not be willing to allow his country to 
be pounded into rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Naumann said the alliance had no plans to use force in the  
``visit and search'' of ships in the Adriatic as part of an oil 
embargo. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said details of the oil embargo 
would be worked out quickly, and searching ships would be only part 
of the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies ordered an assessment of the ground-troop option  
before the summit, and at the meetings authorized Gen. Wesley 
Clark, the NATO commander for Europe, to devise a plan to block oil 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit also killed off speculation, at least for the moment,  
that NATO was secretly laying the groundwork for a ground war in 
Kosovo. NATO leaders and officials issued denial after denial that 
they were preparing to invade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This summit was an impressive demonstration of unity despite  
the fact that some skeptics feared it would not be wise to hold a 
summit in times of war,'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said 
Sunday at the end of the three-day convocation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the allies ``reaffirmed our determination  
repeatedly to intensify our actions, military and economic, until 
we achieve our objectives in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``On this, the alliance leaves Washington more united  
even than it was when we came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, the summit's lesson  
was clear: 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees are going to go back, be back in their place in  
their country, and ethnic cleansing will not be victorious in our 
continent as we approach the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allies said repeatedly during a summit shorn of its  
celebratory aura that Kosovo is a conflict they cannot afford to 
lose. It would be disaster for NATO as an organization, and a 
disaster for the security of Europe, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO clearly wants to draft Russia to the cause. Moscow opposes  
NATO military action in Kosovo and has been attempting to get 
Milosevic to budge on the diplomatic front. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton dispatched Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to  
Moscow to urge Russia to press the tough NATO demands for a 
settlement in Kosovo on Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia can be constructive provided they know what our  
position is,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of their final acts, NATO's leaders met with leaders of  
seven of Yugoslavia's neighbors, all feeling the fallout from the 
conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nations of the region have risked, and even faced, armed  
confrontation with Serbia by facilitating and supporting our 
campaign to end the bloodshed in Kosovo,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania and Macedonia have been particularly hard hit, taking in  
nearly 500,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees fleeing Yugoslav military 
action. The other neighboring countries are Bosnia, Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Romania and Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies stressed that any Yugoslav retaliation against its  
neighbors would be met with a response from NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kosovo dominated the summit, the leaders also approved a  
new strategic concept, NATO's basic statement of purpose, which 
plots the alliance's future. This document focuses on Europe's new 
security challenges, largely regional and ethnic conflicts such as 
Kosovo, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The new strategic concept included the European Security and  
Defense Identity, a program to allow European countries freedom to 
conduct operations in which the United States does not want to 
participate, but using NATO assets. It also embraces a new Defense 
Capability Initiative, an attempt to head off a technology gap 
between American forces and the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also approved was a program setting out required steps for  
aspirant members, a sort of road map to joining NATO; an enhanced 
Partnership for Peace program, under which nonmember countries get 
involved in NATO activities which may or may not lead to 
membership; and creation of a center at NATO headquarters for 
dealing with weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Van Horn Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets forward Keith Van  
Horn will miss the final two weeks of the NBA season after breaking 
his left thumb in Sunday night's victory over the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	The thumb is displaced and will require surgery, Dr. Charles  
Melone, a hand specialist, said Monday. The surgery has not been 
scheduled. 
</P>

	Van Horn was injured blocking a shot by Reggie Miller late in  
the third quarter of the Nets' 120-98 win. Both players fell to the 
floor on the play, and Van Horn got up holding his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is the third major one this season for the Nets, who  
were eliminated from playoff contention last week. Point guard Sam 
Cassell, who has since been traded, missed most of the first half 
of this lockout-shorted season with a sprained ankle and All-Star 
center Jayson Williams was sidelined for the season on April 1 with 
a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth-leading scorer in the league, Van Horn was averaging  
21.8 points and 8.5 rebounds. The second-year pro had a career-high 
35 points against Detroit on Feb. 16, and his .859 free throw 
shooting percentage is 11th best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn scored 30 points three times this season and had 12  
double-doubles.

<HEADLINE> Opportunists Exploit Y2K Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When a caller told Betty Mason he would help  
make sure her credit card would work after Jan. 1, she pulled the 
card from her wallet and was ready to listen. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he asked for her credit card number and promised to  
send a sticker that would make the card Y2K compliant, she balked. 
Mason was wise enough to avoid being taken, but the Federal Trade 
Commission fears others will lose money in this and other scams 
tied to fears about Year 2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a new twist that someone is going to cash in on,''  
said Mason, of Warner Robbins, Ga. ``Someone is saying we'll make 
money off this Year 2000 thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer  
protection, said scam artists ``move right in'' to exploit change 
or vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems are not limited to credit cards.  
</P>
<P>
	``The scams that are out there are so diverse, there is no one  
fix-all type of solution,'' said Norman Willox Jr., president of 
the National Fraud Center, a Philadelphia-based firm that focuses 
on fraud prevention and interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers might see an Internet ad to buy stocks from a company  
that claims it has created products to thwart the millennium bug. 
Shareholders are assured big returns, after the third quarter, when 
the inventions hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In what Willox calls a ``pump and dump'' scheme, consumers make  
an investment only to have the business -- or the goods they produce 
-- turn out to be fake. 
</P>
<P>
	Another common scheme involves con artists calling consumers and  
warning that they must move their money into a separate bank 
account to protect it from millennium bug foul-ups. Pretending to 
be representatives from a bank, they ask customers for their 
account number to move holdings. Sure enough, the money is 
transferred into another account -- one belonging to the caller. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're concerned about anyone using Y2K to scam  
people,'' said Jack Gribben, spokesman for the president's Year 
2000 council. 
</P>
<P>
	He advised people concerned about the Y2K compliance of their  
banks or credit card companies to contact these institutions 
directly -- rather than responding to an impersonator who calls them 
and scares them into giving out personal financial information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year may not work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines might assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the need to convert machines and equipment to accept  
this change, businesses and consumers are desperately searching for 
specialists to adjust their systems. But high demand and 
insufficient supply of these experts creates a chance for 
opportunists who pretend they can fix the technology, says Willox. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies may not figure out they've been scammed until after  
the millennium, when their computers fail, says Willox. In other 
cases, a phony business operation will tout easy solutions -- such 
as a disk customers can buy and load onto their computer for an 
instant remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know, there are no fixes like that, but there are  
a lot of people out there promoting them,'' Willox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC is working with state attorneys general and businesses  
to raise awareness and skepticism among consumers. For consumers 
who are taken anyway, Bernstein said, law enforcement is always an 
available option.

<HEADLINE> Panel Says Slaney Took Banned Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Mary Slaney was given a retroactive  
two-year ban on Monday after an arbitration panel found the runner 
guilty of taking banned drugs before the 1996 U.S. Olympics Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation decision, for  
which is there is no appeal, scraps from the record books Slaney's 
performances between June 1996 and June 1998 -- including the silver 
medal she won for the 1,500 meters race at the 1997 World Indoor 
Championships in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed the ban after the arbitration panel said there  
was ``failure to establish by clear evidence that an abnormal T-E 
test was attributable to pathological or physiological 
conditions,'' according to IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, had claimed that the widely-used  
testosterone-epitestosterone test is unreliable for women who are 
taking the birth control pill in their late 30s or 40s, an argument 
refuted by the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF two-year ban is from June 17, 1996, the day after the  
test, Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the final and binding decision and does not allow any  
right of appeal to another court under the IAAF constitution,'' 
Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision ends Slaney's long-running case.  
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, considered the greatest women's distance runner in U.S.  
history and a world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters in 1983, 
gave a urine sample during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials that showed 
a T-E ratio above the 6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E test, used by dozens of sports, detects the presence of  
testosterone, a naturally occurring muscle-building hormone that is 
also taken in concentrated form to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF, track's world governing body, suspended Slaney -- the  
former Mary Decker -- claiming that USA Track and Field was dragging 
its feet investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF had imposed its own suspension. But Slaney, backed by her  
sponsor Nike, challenged the ruling, and in September 1997 the U.S. 
federation cleared the runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF later also cleared Slaney to compete, but referred the  
case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney's lawyers sought to stop the hearing earlier this month,  
filing suit in an Indianapolis court against the IAAF and U.S. 
Olympic Committee, which administered the original test. 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitration panel originally sat in January, but reconvened  
Saturday after lawyers from both sides requested more time to 
collect evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three judges decided Slaney's fate: Germany's Christoph Vedder,  
the panel's chairman; Robert Ellicott of Australia; and Singapore's 
Lin Kokloh.

	POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A 78-year-old man with a criminal  
record dating back to the 1930s was jailed Monday as a suspect in a 
string of south Florida bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	Forrest Silva Tucker was arrested Thursday by Broward County  
sheriff's deputies following a slow-speed chase. He was being held 
without bond on charges of bank robbery and reckless driving.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls for Racial Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Echoing a political rival's recent theme, Vice  
President Al Gore called for enhanced racial justice and the need 
for expanded federal hate-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	During a speech Sunday to the NAACP's Detroit branch, Gore said  
the nation's future depends on its ability to improve civil rights, 
including fending off challenges to affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martin Luther King died to give us civil rights,'' Gore told  
about 9,000 people at the annual Fight for Freedom Fund dinner held 
by the nation's largest NAACP chapter. ``The least we can do is 
enforce those laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a flight to Detroit from Colorado, where he attended a  
memorial service for victims of Tuesday's high school shooting, 
Gore talked by phone to reporters -- several from publications 
targeted to black readers -- criticizing a ``right-wing coordinated 
effort to try to end affirmative action'' and racial profiling by 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore revisited those themes in Detroit, where he also pushed for  
bolstering education by hiring more teachers and paring class 
sizes, and urged federal emphasis on improving economic climates in 
inner cities through loans and other funding. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore keyed on racial themes, telling the 51,000-member  
Detroit chapter of the National Organization for the Advancement of 
Colored People the nation's future means ``recognizing and 
accepting our diversity and harmony as the greatest strength we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's comments were akin to those made five days earlier by  
former Sen. Bill Bradley, the only announced challenger to Gore in 
the race for their party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Bradley declared racial unity ``the defining moral  
issue of our time'' and put the quest for societal integration at 
the center of his campaign to win the White House. Like Gore, 
Bradley called the problem of race ``central to our American 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also cast himself as a born-and-bred defender  
of minorities, alluding to his father's political pursuit of racial 
justice as a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sacrificed his career because he was willing to stand for  
what he believed,'' Gore said. ``I'm glad my father taught me to 
love justice. My family taught me to hate discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a connection to this struggle and to your history  
through my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gore formally hasn't declared himself a candidate for the  
2000 presidential race, he has announced an exploratory committee 
and is considered a virtual certainty to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore urged the NAACP branch to continue to ``reach out for  
justice and fairness for all Americans.'' To that end, he urged the 
group to help pressure Congress to act on a measure that would make 
federal prosecution of hate crimes easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional Republicans have suggested the legislation is  
unnecessary because dozens of states have laws protecting the 
groups identified in the bill. As well, backers are concerned that 
social conservatives may construe the legislation as extending 
special protections to homosexuals.

<HEADLINE> Court To Make FDA-Tobacco Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed today to decide  
whether the Food and Drug Administration can crack down on 
cigarette sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The court will hear a Clinton administration appeal in which  
government lawyers say FDA's 1996 decision to start regulating 
tobacco as a drug was justified by new evidence that the tobacco 
industry intended its products to feed consumers' nicotine habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless this court grants review, an unparalleled opportunity  
to curb tobacco use by children ... will be lost,'' the 
government's appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled that Congress, not the FDA, has  
the authority to make the ``major policy decision'' of how to 
regulate cigarettes and chewing tobacco. The effect of the lower 
court's ruling was to leave no FDA role in regulating tobacco 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the most important public health case the Supreme  
Court hears in decades,'' said David Kessler, FDA commissioner in 
1996 and now dean of Yale University Medical School. ``The goal is 
certainly to reduce the number of people who smoke and the best way 
to do that is to reduce the number of young people who start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry representatives did not immediately comment on  
today's court action. Industry officials have argued that FDA 
regulation of tobacco would force a ban, or short of that, would 
let the agency control the contents of cigarettes and set other 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's rules are part of growing efforts to curb the tobacco  
industry. Although Congress failed to pass a nationwide settlement 
last year, all 50 states have reached settlements in which tobacco 
companies will pay them $246 billion for the cost of treating 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government also plans to sue the industry to recover  
federal health-insurance costs for treating such illnesses. And the 
industry faces individual and class-action lawsuits by smokers and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, the FDA said it lacked authority to regulate  
tobacco so long as cigarette manufacturers did not claim that 
smoking provided health benefits. But the government reversed 
itself in 1996 and classified tobacco products as ``devices'' that 
deliver addictive nicotine and therefore are subject to federal 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort was partly spurred by disclosures of secret tobacco  
industry documents starting in 1994 that showed companies had 
targeted teen-agers and that they knew of nicotine's addictive 
quality even before the government did. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states already ban tobacco sales to anyone under 18. In  
addition to adopting that rule, the FDA required stores to demand 
photo I.D. from all tobacco purchasers under age 27 and limited 
vending-machine cigarette sales to adult-only locations, such as 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators also banned tobacco billboards within 1,000  
feet of a school or playground, and set other limits on cigarette 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies challenged the rules. In April 1997, U.S.  
District Judge William Osteen upheld the FDA's authority to 
regulate tobacco and upheld the crackdown on sales to minors, but 
threw out the advertising restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the  
FDA could not regulate tobacco at all. ``Congress never intended to 
give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products,'' the appeals 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers said  
the August ruling ``invalidated the most important public health 
and safety rulemaking that FDA had conducted in the past 50 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before 1996, ``the FDA simply did not have clear and compelling  
evidence that nicotine is extremely addictive, that consumers use 
tobacco products because they are addicted'' and that companies 
manipulate cigarettes' nicotine content, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal, supported by 39 states, said the FDA considered  
banning all cigarette sales, even to adults, but decided it would 
be dangerous to ban a product ``to which so many millions of people 
are addicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's lawyers said that setting tobacco policy is a  
political task for Congress, which already has prohibited tobacco 
advertising on radio and television, banned smoking on airplanes 
and required warning labels on cigarette packages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FDA has overreached,'' the tobacco companies' lawyers  
said. They added that the main settlement reached last November 
between the industry and 46 states sets many of the limits sought 
by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette billboards across the country were taken down this  
month as required by the settlement, which also bars companies from 
using cartoon characters in ads or distributing caps, T-shirts and 
other merchandise bearing cigarette logos. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is FDA vs. Brown and Williamson, 98-1152.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Futures Sink / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for beneficial weather this 
week in U.S. growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans fell sharply amid a return of drier weather in  
the Midwest following nearly a week of rain. The dry conditions 
should allow farmers to return to their fieldwork by midweek, while 
the moisture should help early plantings, agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also were pressured by reports China had made a large sale  
of competing corn to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by beneficial rainfall in  
winter-wheat growing regions and amid the drop in corn and soybean 
values. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.63 a bushel; July  
corn fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.21 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 3 1/4 cents to 
$1.19 a bushel; July soybeans fell 4 cents to $4.90 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies retreated. 
</P>

	June live cattle rose .60 cent to 63.32 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .85 cent to 71.47 cents a pound; July lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Dollar Off Vs. Yen, Up Vs. Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen but  
edged higher against most other major currencies Monday as top 
finance officials from around the world shuttled among meetings in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.26  
Japanese yen, down from 119.41 yen late Friday, but rose against 
the euro, the currency of 11 European nations. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0582, down from $1.0605 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded in narrow ranges against both the yen and the  
euro even as the world's top finance officials were gathered for 
meetings of the Group of Seven industrial nations and the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traders are waiting to see if any significant developments  
come out of the G-7 and IMF meetings,'' said Paul Podolsky, a 
currency strategist at BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa met separately with  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin during the day but no new 
government efforts were announced afterwards aimed at stimulating 
the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar varied little against European currencies in trading  
throughout the day. ``People are wondering if there is going to be 
anything dramatic,'' Podolsky said, but nothing of that sort 
surfaced by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	He said traders expect the euro will remain under pressure until  
there are signs of a peaceful settlement that would end the NATO 
bombing of sites in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gargano, manager of foreign exchange at First Union  
National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., said the dollar continues to 
benefit from relatively solid corporate earnings growth and 
productivity increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a stable environment where U.S. rates are higher, funds are  
going to gravitate toward the dollar,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5140 Swiss francs, up from 1.5104,  
and 1.4753 Canadian dollars, the same as late Friday. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6119, down from $1.6150. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8481 German 
marks, up from 1.8443; 6.1996 French francs, up from 6.1805, and 
1,828.15 Italian lire, up from 1,824.82.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Strips Medal From Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Mary Slaney was stripped of her  
silver medal from the 1997 world championships after track 
authorities determined Monday she failed a drug test three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney said she was not surprised by the International Amateur  
Athletic Federation ruling, and promised to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they are protected over there, safe in their little  
cocoon,'' Slaney said, referring to the IAAF headquarters in 
London. ``They can take away whatever rights the athletes had. This 
has to be addressed, fought and changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the premier U.S. distance runner said the ruling  
was based on ``legal fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sad that the worldwide governing body for the sport of  
track and field would choose to prop up its sham drug-testing 
program at the expense of one of its greatest athletes,'' lawyer 
Doriane Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney is free to compete since the IAAF said she had  
retroactively completed her two-year ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they think that I'm guilty of a doping violation and that  
banning me just through 1998 is going to end it, they are sadly 
mistaken,'' Slaney told The Register-Guard in her hometown of 
Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-man IAAF arbitration panel said the 40-year-old runner  
tested positive for high testosterone levels before the 1996 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed a ban on Slaney that ran from June 1996, when  
the test was administered, to June 1998. Thus, Slaney loses the 
medal she won at Paris in the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them come and try to get the $20,000 (in prize money) that  
she won in Paris,'' lawyer Jim Coleman, Doriane's husband, said. 
``They don't say they're going to ask for it back, but the order 
suggested they might. ... They'll never see the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the test ``bogus.''  
</P>
<P>
	``What they should have been doing is trying to find a way to  
prove when a female athlete has used testosterone. Rather than 
doing that, they've been trying to find a way to save a test that 
doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Slaney's husband, Richard: ``According to the IAAF, you're  
guilty until you prove your innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney repeatedly has proclaimed her innocence. Earlier this  
month, she sued the IAAF and the U.S. Olympic Committee, which 
administered the original test. 
</P>
<P>
	She claims the testosterone-epitestosterone test is unreliable  
for women who take birth control pills in their late 30s or 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF disputes that argument and said the decision by USA  
Track &AMP; Field on Sept. 16, 1997, to clear Slaney was ``erroneous.'' 
The IAAF said Monday's ruling was ``final and binding,'' with no 
right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mary is fine,'' Jim Coleman said. ``She was prepared for what  
happened in Monaco. It's of no concern to her. She's totally 
ignored it. It's a nonevent as far as we're concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF executive director Craig Masback called the decision ``a  
tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, she's one of the great athletes in the sport and a  
pioneer,'' Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	``T-E testing for women is not supported by scientific evidence  
... never mind for her particular test. I think it's unfortunate 
that the IAAF decided to pursue this case after we exonerated her. 
They should come up with a legal test, not pursue someone who is 
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed the ban after the arbitration panel said there  
was ``failure to establish by clear evidence that an abnormal T-E 
test was attributable to pathological or physiological 
conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters, gave  
a urine sample during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials that showed a 
T-E ratio above the 6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E test detects the presence of testosterone, a naturally  
occurring muscle-building hormone that also is taken in 
concentrated form to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF suspended Slaney, claiming USATF was slow to  
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF imposed its own suspension. But Slaney, backed by her  
sponsor Nike, challenged the ruling, and in September 1997 the U.S. 
federation cleared her. The IAAF also later cleared Slaney to 
compete but referred the case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney now joins other prominent names in track found guilty by  
the IAAF: Ben Johnson, Butch Reynolds and Katrin Krabbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Another high-profile case is pending. U.S. sprinter Dennis  
Mitchell is going to arbitration after testing positive for high 
testosterone.

<HEADLINE> 'The Matrix' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- During a weekend considered a clearinghouse  
for studios awaiting the flood of early summer releases, the 
cyberspace blockbuster ``The Matrix'' topped the box office while 
two new releases foundered. 
</P>
<P>
	The futuristic Keanu Reeves thriller grossed $12.9 million over  
the weekend after crossing the $100 million mark last week. It 
replaced the prison comedy ``Life,'' which slipped to second place 
with $11.6 million after losing 43 percent of its audience, 
industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two comedies opening in wide release failed to grab a sizable  
audience and may have been rushed into the market to avoid upcoming 
expected blockbusters such as the ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pushing Tin,'' the John Cusack-Billy Bob Thornton comedy about  
a rivalry between two frantic air traffic controllers, opened with 
$3.6 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lost &AMP; Found,'' featuring David Spade as a smarmy dognapper  
who falls in love with his beautiful neighbor, opened in sixth 
place with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend is considered a dumping ground for films by the  
industry -- their last chance to make something before summer 
releases start coming out,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a movie analyst 
with Reel Source Inc. ``Once the summer opens all the other films 
just fall like a ton of bricks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bucksbaum said studios have started opening ``summer-style''  
big-budget films in the spring -- including ``Star Wars: Episode I -- 
The Phantom Menace'' in May and ``Entrapment'' next week -- to take 
advantage of a time when smaller movies are in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked for ``The Matrix,'' he said. The film about a hacker  
who battles cyber-overlords in a twisting world of virtual reality 
has taken in $117.3 million in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Drew Barrymore high school comedy ``Never Been  
Kissed'' continued to do well, holding onto third place with $6.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend ticket sales were 4.7 percent higher than the same  
weekend last year, when ``Titanic'' began to lose steam. 
</P>
<P>
	The high school student government satire ``Election,'' starring  
Reese Witherspoon as a compulsive goody-two-shoes and Matthew 
Broderick as a frumpy civics teacher, opened in only six theaters 
nationwide but pulled in an outstanding per-screen average of 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very smart to open it in only six theaters,'' said  
Bucksbaum. ``Awareness was low on the movie before, but now (the 
studio) is counting on good word of mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Matrix,'' $12.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Life,'' $11.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $6.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Pushing Tin,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Analyze This,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Lost &AMP; Found,'' $3.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $2.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Out-Of-Towners,'' $2.02 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Go,'' $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Forces of Nature,'' $1.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Push Nasdaq Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Strength in technology shares took the Nasdaq  
composite index into record territory today, extending a strong 
rebound from last Monday's 5.6 percent plunge. Blue-chip stocks 
were moderately higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite was up 64.37 at  
2,655.06, topping its previous high of 2,598.81, set April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 13.74 at 10,703.41,  
after wobbling in a narrow range up and down throughout the day. 
The Dow ended Friday's session down 37 points at 10,689.67 but it 
reached two record closing highs last week, the latest one on 
Thursday at 10,727.18. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.56 
at 1,361.41. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare departure from the normal scramble on Wall Street,  
trading was halted for one minute of silence at noon on the New 
York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market 
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange in memory of the Colorado high 
school shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were back in the limelight today, as investors  
saw encouraging personal-computer sales data ahead of some key 
earnings reports in the computer sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speculation in technology stocks continues to be the  
dominant theme,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. ``It goes away for a 
while, but then it comes right back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which rose sharply last Friday on a strong earnings report,  
was up 9 5/8 at 209 3/8. Internet shares were higher, with e-Bay up 16 
11/16 at 120 3/4. The online auction company is scheduled to report 
earnings after the close of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing a shift that started late last week, investors were  
showing less interest today in the shares of economically sensitive 
companies. These cyclical shares had been briefly popular because 
they were viewed as a bargain by investors who have faith that the 
world economy is improving. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors were back buying ``growth'' stocks, the shares of  
companies such as technology concerns that may have not yet hit 
their stride in earnings but that are expected to show good results 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if investors could continue to buy growth stocks but not  
sell value shares, Tony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg 
Thalmann &AMP; Co., said, ``Why not? The whole market right now is on 
sound footing. Earnings are favorable, and the same fundamentals 
that have taken us higher for four years are still intact,'' such 
as low interest rates and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, Dwyer said, investors are showing strong faith that  
economies outside the United States are improving, which should 
help U.S.-based global businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors had mixed reactions to earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust, for example, which this morning reported  
first-quarter profit numbers that beat Wall Street's estimates, was 
up 7/16 at 90 1/2. That was despite a general weakness in financial 
stocks that was tied to lower bond prices. Citigroup's shares were 
down 11/16 at 74 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though drugmaker Warner-Lambert reported earnings that  
beat analysts' expectations by 1 cent a share, its stock was down, 
with other drug stocks, 1 7/8 at 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Merck was off 1 3/4 at 74, which translates to more  
than 8 points on the Dow. Merck's share were lower following 
analysts' concerns about the drugmaker's expiring patents. On 
Friday, Merck reported first-quarter earnings that were in line 
with expectations, but mostly because of a restructuring of its 
joint venture with Astra AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues led decliners by a narrow 1,566 to 1,413 on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 562.72 million shares at late afternoon, 
down from Friday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Disney Boss Says He's Owed $250M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Top Walt Disney Co. executives waged a secret  
campaign called ``Operation Snowball'' to deprive former studio 
chief Jeffrey Katzenberg of tens of millions of dollars he was owed 
for making the company a success, his lawyer contended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Disney attorney scoffed at that and said Operation Snowball  
was nothing more than Disney's effort to keep track of how much it 
owed Katzenberg and the snowball of paperwork required to compute 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements in the second phase a $250 million  
breach-of-contract lawsuit, Katzenberg lawyer Bert Fields presented 
a series of memos to bolster his argument that Disney concocted a 
contract argument over an incentive bonus to deprive Katzenberg of 
the money he was owed. 
</P>
<P>
	During Katzenberg's first few years as chief of the film  
entertainment division, operating income went from $2.3 million in 
1984 to $186.3 million in 1988. He oversaw the development of 700 
projects, including TV shows and movies like ``Sister Act,'' ``The 
Lion King,'' ``Aladdin,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The Little 
Mermaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg joined Disney in 1984, under a success-based  
contract. In 1988, he signed a renegotiated contract, extending it 
to 1996. The new contract included an early-out option that would 
let him leave in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman, claimed Katzenberg agreed  
to forfeit his incentive bonus if he left in 1994 or if Disney let 
him go. Katzenberg left in 1994 when Eisner reportedly refused to 
make him the company's No. 2 man after Frank Wells was killed in a 
helicopter accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, who would become the ``K'' in DreamWorks SKG, with  
Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, smiled frequently as Fields 
delivered his statement to judicial referee Paul G. Breckenridge 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney contends Katzenberg is entitled to 2 percent of the  
estimated income generated by the 700 products he developed at 
Disney, including music and merchandise spinoffs. He said the money 
was to be paid in a lump sum two years after he left the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney general counsel Louis Meisinger said Disney agreed,  
during the first phase of the trial, to pay Katzenberg some money. 
At issue in this second phase is how much and what kinds of 
merchandise and product should be included in the tally. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields said a ``handful'' of Disney executives -- he did not name  
them -- were concerned that the bonus due Katzenberg had snowballed 
because of the studio's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were cooking up this contract argument that he'd given up  
his bonus,'' Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meisinger said the name was coined by a Disney accountant.  
</P>
<P>
	``Project Snowball wasn't to figure out how we could get Mr.  
Katzenberg out of his bonus ... it was to calculate it. She (the 
accountant) knew that the work was going to snowball when she got 
into it. There's nothing sinister about a company having a project 
to calculate a very complicated bonus.''

<HEADLINE> Early Photojournalism Work on Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of the earliest works of photojournalism -- a  
daguerreotype of a man taken moments before he plunged to his death 
over Niagara Falls -- is on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1853 photo by Platt D. Babbitt, called ``Avery Stranded,''  
will be auctioned at Sotheby's on Tuesday as part of the David 
Feigenbaum photographic collection, which includes works by Albert 
Sands Southworth, Josiah Johnson Hawes and other 19th-century 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's expects $20,000 to $30,000 for the black-and-white  
photo of the stranded German immigrant, who was identified only as 
Mr. Avery, said Sotheby's spokesman Matthew Weigman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents one of the first times that a news event was  
photographed,'' Weigman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Often daguerreotypes are portraits or depict buildings simply  
because the equipment used to create the images was heavy and 
difficult to carry. Babbitt had just obtained his photographic 
concession at Niagara Falls when the event happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 19, 1853, picture helped spark interest in the dramatic  
rescue attempt of Avery, who was pictured while clinging to rocks 
after his boat was smashed by rocks; two companions had already 
been thrown from the boat to their deaths. After four rescue 
attempts and several hours on the river, a fifth try at rescuing 
Avery was attempted. 
</P>
<P>
	A rowboat, held by cables and rope, was within Avery's grasp  
when it suddenly lurched, knocking him off the rocks. He plunged 
the 162 feet over Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, a practicing daguerreotypist from the 1850s to the  
1870s, captured the string of events through several photos, with 
``Avery Stranded'' one of the most dramatic. The failed rescue was 
later memorialized in a poem titled ``Avery,'' by William Dean 
Howells. 
</P>
<P>
	The daguerreotype is one of hundreds of black-and-white  
photographs collected by Feigenbaum, who worked most of his life in 
the radiology department of Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of a sleeping child, a bride, a classroom and ``eleven  
gentlemen,'' by Southworth and Hawes from the early 1850s, are 
among the photos offered at the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it's the most significant discovery in American  
photography in the last 25 years,'' Weigman said of the Feigenbaum 
collection, which was found in the basement of his home in 
Marblehead, Mass., after his death last June.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl's Messy Legacy Lingers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Chernobyl radiation victims are still  
praying for better treatment. The leaky concrete-and-steel shelter 
covering the ruined reactor still needs repairs. And Ukraine says 
the plant won't be closed unless the West gives it $1.2 billion for 
two new reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 13th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, a  
grim legacy lingers from the explosion and fire at reactor No. 4 of 
Chernobyl's atomic power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident -- on April 26, 1986 -- sent a radioactive cloud over  
much of Europe and contaminated large areas in Ukraine, Russia and 
Belarus. The government now says 4,365 of those who took part in 
the hasty and poorly organized Soviet cleanup have died due to the 
disaster, and more than 70,000 Ukrainians are considered fully 
disabled by it. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991 provided hope  
for victims, offering promise that better treatment would be made 
available, that the protective cover would be made environmentally 
sound, and that an independent Ukraine would close the plant for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, those hopes have been unfulfilled.  
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has a terrible health legacy and scant finances to cope.  
Nearly 400,000 adults and 1.1 million children are entitled to 
government aid for Chernobyl-related health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuriy Shcherbak, a medic who wrote a book on Chernobyl and later  
served as Ukraine's ambassador in the United States, said the 
anniversary today brought him a sad feeling of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an undefeatable evil ... Chernobyl will continue to exist  
for an indefinite period of time, posing ever new problems for 
mankind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Urged by the West, Ukraine pledged to shut down the plant by  
2000. Now it seems unlikely that pledge will be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, President Leonid Kuchma said it flat out: Chernobyl  
will continue to operate until the West provides Ukraine with the 
estimated $1.2 billion necessary to complete two new nuclear 
reactors to compensate for the loss of the electricity Chernobyl 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Seven richest nations promised aid in 1995 to help  
Ukraine close Chernobyl, but the nation, strapped for energy and 
cash, has complained that the money has been slow in coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma says the G-7 also should help Ukraine build nuclear waste  
depositories and compensate the 6,200 Chernobyl employees who will 
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's arguments seem to be linked more to its desperate  
financial position than on energy problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is heavily dependent on its five nuclear plants -- but  
of its 14 working reactors, only one is at Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant once had four reactors and plans for more. After the  
accident, reactor No. 4 was out of action. Another of the plant's 
Soviet-made reactors has been inactive since a 1991 fire and a 
third was stopped in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The working reactor, No. 3, has its own troubles. It underwent  
repairs for nearly three months and was restarted in March, only to 
suffer a daylong shutdown over a turbine generator malfunction 
later that month. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is slow on making the shelter over the exploded reactor  
environmentally safe, although international donors have pledged 
$400 million. Safety concerns also have delayed construction. 
</P>
<P>
	That work ``might take 50 and even 100 years,'' according to  
Shcherbak, who is Ukraine's coordinator at Chernobyl talks with the 
G-7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian government says it is increasingly unable to bear  
the long-term costs of the disaster after spending $5.7 billion to 
deal with its consequences during Soviet times and more than $4 
billion from 1992-97. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ukraine's economy declining since the Soviet collapse,  
state funding covered only an average 51.6 percent of Chernobyl 
relief needs from 1996-98. This year's budget allocation of $443 
million is only a third of what is needed, according to Emergency 
Situations Minister Vasyl Durdynets. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Belarus on Sunday, 7,000 protesters marched  
through the capital of Minsk demanding more attention for accident 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern France, 400 people gathered Sunday near a nuclear  
reactor in Thionville to mark the Chernobyl anniversary and protest 
France's heavy reliance on atomic energy.

<HEADLINE> Curiosities in Smithsonian Backrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly everyone's attic has them: heirlooms  
considered priceless or historical or junk, items that don't quite 
fit in the living room but stuff you just can't bear to throw away. 
</P>
<P>
	But with cast-offs like the Bee Gees' silver lame suits, Abraham  
Lincoln's stovepipe hat and several thousand meteorites, the 
Smithsonian Institution -- with more than 141 million items and just 
a fraction of the space to display them -- has the rest beat. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the public floors of its 16 museums are full of classics  
such as the Hope Diamond and the ruby red slippers from ``The 
Wizard of Oz,'' many of the real finds are in dust-free, 
climate-controlled cabinets of the museums' curatorial hideaways or 
a sprawling storage facility in suburban Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the following treasures tucked away behind the desk of  
curator David Shayt at the National Museum of American History: 
</P>
<P>
	An Emmy won by Sid Caesar. A gold record earned by Rosemary  
Clooney. A pocket billiards trophy awarded to Groucho Marx. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby hang Dustin Hoffman's red sequin dress from ``Tootsie,''  
the red Hawaiian shirt worn by Tom Selleck on ``Magnum P.I.'' and 
three cream chiffon gowns that once adorned the Supremes. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the aisle sit John Wayne's makeup kit -- rugged colors  
mostly, tans and browns -- and, however disillusioning, two toupees 
the Duke sported in ``True Grit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But asked to show off the neatest items in his collection, Shayt  
turns to a tall glass-and-metal cabinet full of stamped-steel lunch 
boxes. Built from 1958 to 1985 -- when they were discontinued 
because kids were hitting each other over the head with them -- the 
lunch boxes, he says, are perfect Smithsonian collectibles: 
durable, manageable in size, icons of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the hall of fame, the best of the best,'' Shayt  
says. ``We're the typical of the typical. We collect the full 
spectrum of human achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He opens a drawer containing one of every crayon box ever  
issued, including a 1958 64-crayon set with a built-in sharpener, 
acquired just last year. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawer down is the Silly Putty collection, including a  
plastic eggful alleged to have flown on an Apollo mission to the 
moon. ``The Air and Space Museum is investigating'' that claim, 
Shayt says. 
</P>
<P>
	Will such items ever see the light of the museum's public  
floors? ``We never say never,'' Shayt replies. ``There are no 
immediate places for these items, but ideas are always 
percolating.'' The needs of thematic exhibitions often determine 
what is used; a ``Happy Days'' lunch box, for example, now sits 
beside Fonzi's leather jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	And is any of the collection junk?  
</P>
<P>
	``The word has no meaning for me,'' he says. ``We literally  
collected trash off the floor at the New Yorker'' -- when the 
magazine moved offices some years ago -- and even sections of the 
linoleum floor itself from the editing room. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get something, it's for the ages,'' Shayt says.  
However trivial an item may seem now, you never know what will hold 
meaning to historians in 100 years, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers need not wait that long for much of what is stored  
by the Museum of Natural History -- by far the largest share of the 
Smithsonian's collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists, anthropologists and zoologists regularly visit the  
museum's storage center in Suitland, Md., a series of 
state-of-the-art warehouses whose alcoves, cabinets and open 
shelves cover the equivalent of 6 1/2 football fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The rare outsider can wander past crates of giant squid, long  
rows of elephant skulls, stuffed alligators and enough elk and 
moose antlers to fill a score of trophy rooms. Next to a tank once 
used to melt whale flesh from bones is a freezer of frozen dolphins 
stacked like firewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the thousands of tiny meteorites kept in a  
nitrogen atmosphere, and dozens of others -- some rough, some 
polished -- out on the warehouse floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The need for more storage only increases.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, the Smithsonian added 325,000 items, including  
artifacts from the Titanic, a large collection of mosquitoes and 
the stopwatch from CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What to display is the challenge, says Lonnie Bunch, associate  
director of curatorial affairs for American history. Some things, 
like Lincoln's hat, need to ``rest'' from the deterioration caused 
by human beings' dust and moisture. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``when we walk through the storage and we open a cabinet and  
see 10 light bulbs that Edison invented, or the life mask that was 
made when Lincoln was elected ... you suddenly realize that the 
goal ought to be to share those moments.''

<HEADLINE> Thousands Attend Colorado Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They came with children in strollers,  
dogs on leashes and tears in their eyes. Some carried flowers, 
others brought signs and some walked quietly, empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	But they came.  
</P>
<P>
	By the thousands they came, to share their grief and their hope,  
to try to make sense out of something so senseless. Footprints upon 
footprints as young and old, those from near and those from far 
away, huddled Monday around a makeshift memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	A mother grasped her daughter's hand, a father held onto his  
son's shoulder. Some cried, clutching each other. Others, red-eyed, 
stood quietly reading the outpourings that came from all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see all the people here,'' said Kenneth Dodson,  
whose niece, Linda, was married to David Sanders, the coach and 
teacher who died saving the lives of his students as two teen-age 
gunmen rampaged through Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen killed Sanders and 12 of their classmates before  
killing themselves in the massacre April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just came from David's funeral this morning and I think  
this helps,'' Dodson said. ``It's better to get it outside. It's 
hard when you keep it inside. This is a way to get it outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It started with 23 red tulips that were placed at the foot of a  
tree near the school shortly after the shootings, one tulip for 
each person believed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the number of dead shrank, the memorial grew.  
</P>
<P>
	Piles of flowers and banners, stuffed animals and paintings,  
cards and poems now cover the area the size of a football field in 
the corner of Robert F. Clement Park, which embraces Columbine High 
School on its eastern edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pictures and banners are smeared by rain and snow, some  
placed carefully in plastic covers. The messages are of simple 
love, peace and hope, others are eloquent poems. One issued a 
warning, ``SILENCE LEADS TO MORAL DECAY.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen white crosses stand at one edge of the memorial, the  
victims' names carefully scripted on them in blue. A stone statue 
of the Virgin Mary is in front of them, a sea of flowers, stuffed 
animals and cards around them. People stop here, some pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 240-acre park there are remembrances for the  
victims, the students, the community. Flowers and messages are 
strung along the fence that surrounds the tennis courts next to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	A paper chain of bright colors and kind words is looped through  
the branches of the trees that line the main street near the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're very special to us,'' is written on one paper link.  
``I'm so very sorry,'' says another. 
</P>
<P>
	A snow angel is surrounded by candles, poems, cards. A  
dark-haired little boy kneels down and carefully takes a piece of 
paper out of a manila folder and places it near the angel. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the family of Cassie Bernall. We love you guys,'' it says  
in black ink. 
</P>
<P>
	A teen-ager uses a white candle to light the wicks of those  
whose flames have been extinguished by the wind. Off to the side a 
young man sits huddled, his arms clutching his knees as his friends 
try to console him. A young girl's sobs are audible. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the victims' vehicles have become shrines themselves.  
Notes and flowers cover Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's beat 
up brown Chevy pick-up. 
</P>
<P>
	John Spahlinger, the park superintendent who put loads of hay  
and woodchips around the edges of the memorial worn away by feet 
and rain, estimated at least 10,000 people visited on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' said John Bryant, who drove from Phoenix on  
Sunday to be with the community in Littleton. ``It shows the need 
for answers. On the news, every time you turn around, it's `Why?' I 
think this helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Sternfeld, a photographer who captured communities'  
reactions to tragedy in ``On this Site: Landscape in Memoriam,'' 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to where it happened gives you something to do with your  
feeling of helplessness,'' he said. ``Here is this indescribable 
tragedy, and unless you're a neighbor or a family to one of those 
people who lost their lives, what is there for you to do? If you go 
there, you can grieve with others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that a memorial just becomes the locus in space and  
time for the remembering. It gives a place to the remembering. We 
all need to remember.''

<HEADLINE> Scope of Disability Law Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Vaughn Murphy controls his high blood pressure with medication.  
When UPS fired him as a mechanic and driver, saying his condition 
made him unfit to drive, he sued under the law protecting the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	But is he really disabled?  
</P>
<P>
	This week, the Supreme Court considers whether Murphy, and  
workers in two similar cases, are protected by law from 
discrimination even if they have corrected their conditions with, 
say, medicine or eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's eventual rulings will define who is protected under  
the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act: just the severely 
disabled, or millions more with contact lenses, diabetes or hearing 
aids. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers and advocates for the disabled alike are closely  
watching the cases, which will be argued before the court starting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of this case and the other two is that they  
will determine how open the front door to the ADA will be,'' said 
Kirk Lowry, a Topeka, Kan., lawyer representing Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts have come down on both sides of the issue, giving  
the Supreme Court an impetus to step in and clarify the scope of 
the civil rights law banning discrimination against the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both employers and employees need to know what the correct  
rule of law is,'' said Aaron Hughes, lawyer for Karen Sutton and 
Kimberly Hinton, severely nearsighted twin sisters who sued United 
Airlines for rejecting them from jobs as pilots. Their case comes 
before the court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The third case involves Hallie Kirkingburg, who has poor vision  
in one eye. He sued Albertson's grocery stores after they fired him 
from a truck driving job. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers have fared well in ADA court battles. They have won 92  
percent of the 700 ADA cases resolved in court from 1992 to 1997, 
according to a study by the American Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But now employers fear that victories by the workers in the  
Supreme Court cases could lead to a flood of new lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will allow a much larger population to claim rights under  
the ADA,'' said Quentin Riegel, deputy general counsel for the 
National Association of Manufacturers, which has filed a brief with 
the court siding with United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Tthe numbers of people protected by the ADA would skyrocket.  
Take one example: Nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population -- or 
about 152 million people -- are nearsighted enough to need glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers scoff at the idea that a person whose impairment is  
corrected day-to-day can sue for discrimination under the ADA, 
which defines a disability as an impairment that substantially 
limits a major life activity. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS lawyer William Kilberg argues that by the ADA's definition,  
Murphy is ``not entitled to the advantages that the statute 
reserves for people who are disabled.'' UPS says Murphy was fired 
in 1994 because his blood pressure exceeded federal regulations for 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	But advocates for the disabled -- along with the Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission -- argue that if someone is fired or rejected 
from a job because of their impairment, that is discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say someone's lost a leg, and they can walk with a prosthesis,  
they're still substantially limited in a major life activity: 
walking,'' said Ellen Vargyas, EEOC legal counsel. ``Most people 
would accept as a given that that person is covered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn Murphy has found another job, fixing utility trucks. But  
he's still angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's blatant discrimination,'' said the Manhattan, Kan.,  
mechanic.

<HEADLINE> Psychologist Criticizes Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A psychologist told a jury Monday that  
``The Jenny Jones Show'' played Russian roulette by not screening 
its guests for mental illness beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Abramsky testified for the family of Scott Amedure, a  
gay man who was killed by Jonathan Schmitz in 1995 after Amedure 
revealed a crush on Schmitz during a taping of the show. Amedure's 
family is suing the show and Warner Bros., its distributor, for $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not screening guests for mental illness is ``Russian roulette.  
You're just waiting for something to happen,'' Abramsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abramsky blamed Amedure's slaying on the show, saying that after  
the taping, Schmitz slept little, drank more and lost control over 
his mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He began to feel his whole life was ruined,'' Abramsky  
testified. ``He thought his grandparents would think he's gay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologist added, ``He came to be extremely depressed and  
extremely paranoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family contends a mentally ill Schmitz was led to  
believe he would meet a woman if he appeared on the ``Jenny Jones'' 
segment about secret admirers. Instead, his secret admirer turned 
out to be Amedure, who described a sexual fantasy involving Schmitz 
as the studio audience laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the show say that Schmitz was told ahead of time  
that his secret admirer could be a man or woman, and that the 
program played no role in Amedure's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after the taping, Schmitz went to Amedure's mobile  
home and killed him with a shotgun. The segment never aired. 
Schmitz was found guilty of second-degree murder in 1996, but his 
conviction was overturned on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Abramsky said Amedure's sexual fantasy about Schmitz was the  
most devastating part of the experience -- ``to imply that he's not 
a man on national TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But during cross-examination, defense attorney Jim George noted  
that Schmitz had not mentioned the fantasy in his confession or to 
any police officers when he turned himself in.

	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- The body of an Argentine exchange  
student slain on a sightseeing trip to Yosemite National Park has 
begun its long trip home. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Carrington, whose daughter and granddaughter also were  
killed on the trip, was among those who boarded a flight Sunday to 
Cordoba, Argentina, with the remains of 16-year-old Silvina 
Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	Modesto police escorted the hearse carrying Ms. Pelosso to  
Stockton Metropolitan Airport, where San Diego Chargers owner and 
philanthropist Alex Spanos arranged for a corporate jet to fly the 
teen home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pelosso, Carole Sund and her 15-year-old daughter, Julie,  
were last seen alive Feb. 15, after ice-skating and sightseeing in 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
	The burnt remains of Ms. Pelosso and Mrs. Sund were found in the  
trunk of their torched rental car March 19. Julie's body was found 
about a week later and more than 30 miles away, on a wooded 
hillside near Lake Don Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine Consul General Luis Maria Kreckler, FBI chaplain Mark  
O'Sullivan and Mrs. Sund's brother-in-law Ken Sund also were flying 
to Argentina with the remains. 
</P>

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who carried out the  
massacre at Columbine High School plotted to kill hundreds of 
neighbors, then hijack a plane and crash it into New York City, 
investigators said today. A diary kept by gunman Eric Harris 
described his and Klebold's plans for continuing their murderous 
rampage through the school's neighborhood, sheriff's spokesman 
Steve Davis said. Authorities also questioned an 18-year-old 
girlfriend of Dylan Klebold about whether she bought two of the 
guns used in the rampage.

	Study: Drugs Not Curing HIV  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The AIDS virus might be able to hide undetected  
for 60 years in people taking powerful anti-viral drugs, says a 
study that underlines a major obstacle to the bold notion of curing 
AIDS. While the drugs can drive the body's supply of HIV down to 
undetectable levels, they can't attack virus that lies quietly in 
cells. Such hidden ``reservoirs'' of HIV have long been recognized, 
and these new calculations confirm the belief that they could 
harbor the virus for a very long time.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Virus Not Spreading Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Chernobyl virus, which can literally destroy  
a computer, infected a small number of computers Monday, allaying 
fears that it would sweep the world like another virus did several 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday Monday, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear  
disaster in Russia, only 70 computers had been infected in the 
United States, according to the Computer Emergency Response Team at 
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were 30 to 40 computers used by Boston College  
students, said college spokesman Jack Dunn. The virus affected only 
students who did not install antivirus software distributed by the 
university last fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Chernobyl seemed more widespread with reports coming  
in from Russia, Malta and Finland. In Singapore, there were at 
least 150 cases, including some at the national university, state 
television news said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common version of the Chernobyl virus, also known as  
``CIH,'' affects computers using Windows 95 and Windows 98. Another 
version, less common, strikes computers on the 26th day of any 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The viruses, believed to originate in Taiwan, attempt to erase a  
computer's hard-drive and write gibberish to the computer's system 
settings, called its BIOS, which would prevent the machine from 
being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	There are probably more infections, but the virus was not  
expected to be as widely spread as the Melissa virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly not comparable to what we saw with Melissa,''  
said CERT's Bill Pollak, referring to the recent computer virus. 
``It would be a big surprise if it were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the recent ``Melissa'' scare, which automatically  
propagated via e-mail but did no direct damage, the Chernobyl virus 
didn't spread as quickly because it required a person to launch an 
infected program file to contaminate a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts seemed sanguine because Chernobyl was discovered last  
summer, giving antivirus companies time to develop free software 
updates to identify and destroy it.

<HEADLINE> Stadium Turns Its Eyes to DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Standing alone in center field at Yankee  
Stadium, the way Joe DiMaggio did for 13 majestic seasons, 
songwriter Paul Simon sang his anthem of the '60s that closes with 
a poignant lament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you  
</P>
<P>
	``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died March 8, is gone but will never be forgotten  
by the Yankees, who dedicated a monument to his memory Sunday 
before a sellout crowd of 51,903 that included a half-dozen of his 
old teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	As Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto, Whitey Ford, Jerry Coleman, Gil  
McDougald and Hank Bauer participated in the ceremonies, the 
poignancy of the event was not lost on present-day Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``These sorts of days can only happen in Yankee Stadium,'' said  
David Cone, New York's starting pitcher Sunday against Toronto. ``I 
was star struck with Paul Simon singing in center field. I had to 
stop my warmup. I felt proud just to be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Yankees bench, Bernie Williams, who finished the day with  
three hits, including the game-winner, was touched by the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great treat,'' said the team's present-day center  
fielder. ``It was almost surreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto manager Jim Fregosi, a native of San Francisco,  
DiMaggio's hometown, felt privileged to witness the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was wonderful,'' he said. ``I'm pleased I had the  
opportunity to be here in the stadium. It was a nice feeling to be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute was handled tastefully, understandable because the  
Yankees have so much experience with such events. 
</P>
<P>
	All the old players except Ford were in the Yankees starting  
lineup for Game 6 of the 1951 World Series -- DiMaggio's final game. 
Public address announcer Bob Sheppard recited that game's lineup on 
Sunday, just as he did on that day -- Oct. 10, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the old teammates for the unveiling ceremony were  
DiMaggio's granddaughters, Paula Hamra and Kathie Stein, and his 
longtime attorney, Morris Engelberg. Cardinal John O'Connor 
delivered the invocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Simon sang the song that was written for the movie ``The  
Graduate'' and became an anthem for the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	When he sang the line, ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?''  
the crowd responded with one more cheer for the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,000-pound monument was the fifth erected in the fenced-in  
area in left-center field. The others honor Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, 
Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
	The inscription remembers DiMaggio's accomplishments in a  
13-year career that produced nine World Series championships. 
Included is his designation in 1969 as baseball's greatest living 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom of the monument DiMaggio is lauded as ``a baseball  
legend and an American icon. He has passed but he will never leave 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman remembered DiMaggio as a larger-than-life hero for a  
young infielder who, like Fregosi, grew up in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled March 1949, when the Yankees were in Fort Worth,  
Texas, part of a two-week spring training barnstorming trip. ``He 
didn't show up and we asked, `Where's Joe.' Somebody said, `We've 
got a problem.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the year he had the heel problem. He was out until  
June, never picked up a baseball, never picked up a bat. He walked 
into Fenway Park and hit four home runs in three games. We won all 
three and that was the difference that year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, New York City honored the player known as  
the Yankee Clipper by putting his name on a dilapidated highway 
known for potholes and traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Side Highway became the Joe DiMaggio Highway in a  
ceremony attended by DiMaggio's granddaughters, Yankees owner 
George Steinbrenner and Rizzuto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you come up and down here, it's going to bring back  
memories,'' said Rizzuto, a Hall of Fame shortstop who played with 
DiMaggio in the 1940s and '50s. ``I know Joe is going to be looking 
down at the Yankees and he's going to be really proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who guarded his privacy, had agreed with plans to  
place his name on the highway since it would not replace anyone 
already honored. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature voted unanimously to rename the highway,  
which runs north-south in Manhattan alongside the Hudson River, 
between Battery Place and West 72nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The name change is ceremonial, meaning signs and maps will still  
identify the road as the West Side Highway, which has been under 
reconstruction for much of the last two decades and is the scene of 
daily traffic backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional signs will be erected informing motorists that the  
stretch of the road had been named in honor of DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The renaming was one of several events this weekend to honor  
DiMaggio. On Friday, a memorial service was held at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Fined for Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Hyundai Semiconductor America Inc. must  
pay $9.5 million to a corporate headhunter, who said he was fired 
for refusing to discriminate against women and minorities, an 
Orange County Superior Court jury decided. Hyundai plans to appeal 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a division of Korean giant Hyundai Group, came out  
the loser on Friday in a lawsuit filed by Jeff Abraham, owner of 
Technical Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The verdict is the truth. The award is beyond my wildest  
expectations,'' Abraham said. ``This has never been about money. I 
did this because I wanted the record to show what they're all 
about, and it's on the record today: Hyundai stands for 
discrimination and intimidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai said in a statement that it would appeal the verdict and  
``has not ever, nor does it now, discriminate in hiring or 
contracting practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai hired Abraham's recruiting firm in 1996 to find  
engineers and other professionals for a computer chip manufacturing 
plant in Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his lawsuit, Abraham was told by James F. Menzie, a  
Hyundai human resources manager, to stop sending resumes from 
blacks or women. Menzie said the Korean managers had indicated 
``they would hire as few as possible,'' the suit contended. 
</P>
<P>
	When Abraham refused, the suit claims the company cut its  
business ties, refused to pay commissions it owed for two recruits 
and began a smear campaign against Abraham's company. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham also alleged that Menzie demanded thousands of dollars  
in kickbacks. In addition to Hyundai's payment, the jury ruled that 
Menzie must pay Abraham nearly $500,000.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Suspect Says He Is a Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) -- The prime suspect in the slayings  
of two college students says he is a monster and should be 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two girls are dead. If I'm not a monster, then what am  
I?'' paroled rapist Rex Krebs said in a weekend interview with The 
Fresno Bee at San Luis Obispo County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	He also apologized to the parents of the two women and told the  
newspaper he hopes to receive the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Jim Gardiner said he expects Krebs, 33, to be  
charged within two weeks with kidnapping and killing Aundria 
Crawford and Rachel Newhouse, both 20. 
</P>
<P>
	A registered sex offender, Krebs moved here eight months ago  
after serving 10 years in a state prison for rape, sodomy, assault 
with intent to commit rape and three burglaries. He became a 
suspect in the disappearances when a parole officer searching his 
home spotted property that belonged to one of the victims, police 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's bodies were excavated Friday from graves near Krebs'  
canyon home south of town. Autopsies showed the victims were 
asphyxiated, Gardiner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Newhouse, a California Polytechnic State University junior  
from Irvine, vanished in November as she walked home from a bar. 
Ms. Crawford, a Cuesta College sophomore from Clovis, was kidnapped 
in March from her duplex. 
</P>
<P>
	Krebs was jailed March 20 on parole violations unrelated to the  
murder cases.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plans Discussion on Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders intend to  
call for a national dialogue on ``youth and culture'' as a response 
to the shootings last week in a Colorado high school, at the same 
time the White House is renewing efforts for passage of gun control 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Monday  
that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., would use a prearranged news conference on 
education today to discuss at least preliminary plans. 
</P>
<P>
	One official said Lott and Hastert envision a series of public  
events where leaders of religious institutions, teachers, parents, 
community leaders, representatives of the media and Hollywood and 
officials of the online industry could ``inform the nation'' about 
modern culture and its impact on youth. 
</P>
<P>
	One GOP aide said Republicans hoped to make the point that gun  
control legislation isn't automatically the answer to the shootings 
that stunned the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the leaders' plans were incomplete on Monday night.  
Officials said there had been talk of attempting to line up a 
prominent national figure to head the effort. It was not known how 
the program would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference, scheduled for a middle school in suburban  
Virginia, was originally set for the GOP leaders to tout 
legislation that recently cleared Congress that is designed to 
loosen strings on federal education aid to the states. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, declined comment on the  
plans Monday night. He said the majority leader ``will have more to 
say about how we can make sense of this senseless tragedy as soon 
as tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve students and one teacher were gunned down by two students  
last week at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The killings 
ended when the two armed students killed themselves, and appear to 
be reigniting a debate about gun control that has been relatively 
dormant in Congress for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was using a White House ceremony today to  
propose legislation that would require background checks on sales 
of explosives and hold parents liable when their children commit 
crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is counting on outrage over the shootings to help push  
the bill through Congress. ``The prospects are good,'' White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said Monday. ``Unfortunately, 
oftentimes it takes tragic events to catalyze work here in 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans seem eager to try to focus the debate on other  
issues, including violence prevalent in television and the movies, 
as well as material widely available on the Internet, according to 
GOP officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Gov. Bill Owens provided a preview of the Republican  
response on Saturday, when he said, ``Events like this one warn us 
there is a virus loose within our culture. Too many of our young 
people are susceptible to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the formal GOP response to Clinton's weekly radio address,  
Owens urged parents to play more active roles in their children's 
lives, particularly to pay more attention to what their children 
may be watching on television, what video games they play, what 
World Wide Web sites they log onto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know if your child has a home page?'' Owens asked. ``Do  
you know what is on your child's home page, or whom they talk with 
on the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
	``If not, please find out.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Protests Quietly End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Operation Rescue National leaders were so  
encouraged by their weeklong anti-abortion campaign that they have 
permanently changed the group's name to reflect a broader moral 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Rescue now will be known as Operation Save America as  
it attempts to combat not just abortion, but child pornography, 
teen sex, homosexuality and the absence of God from the classroom, 
a spokeswoman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do want to save this country, not just the unborn,'' said  
spokeswoman Eileen Schopf. ``We want to show our love for this 
country and our desire to return to the moral grounds this country 
was founded on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Save America drew to a quiet close with church  
services on Sunday, ending a week of peaceful protests outside 
abortion clinics, doctors' offices, hospitals, bookstores and high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 to 250 abortion opponents were estimated to have taken  
part in events throughout the week, far fewer than the thousands 
who came to Buffalo during the 1992 Spring of Life abortion 
protests. And in stark contrast to the 628 arrests of 1992, no 
protesters were arrested this week. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication how many people may have shied away from  
the week's events because of its timing. Operation Save America was 
announced a week after last October's unsolved sniper killing of an 
abortion provider, Dr. Barnett Slepian, at his suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Murray, an attorney for the Slepian family, said the  
doctor's widow ``thinks it's despicable that in the aftermath of 
her husband's murder they would plan a rally trying to exploit his 
death and eliminate access to abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Police Commissioner Rocco Diina praised the multi-agency  
effort that enabled law enforcement to maintain a strong presence 
at protest sites through the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers from the Amherst, Buffalo and Tonawanda police  
departments, Erie County Sheriff, county district attorney's 
office, state police, state attorney general's office, FBI, U.S. 
Marshall's Office and the U.S. Attorney's office sometimes 
outnumbered protesters outside clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said a temporary  
restraining order, which kept protesters from 15 to 60 feet from 
the facilities, did its job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wider zones helped achieve our goal of achieving peaceful  
protests,'' Darren Dopp said. What's more, he noted, the 
protesters' message was heard loud and clear. ``It proved that 
wider buffer zones are not an impediment to free speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was one arrest during the week, but it didn't involve a  
protester. James Krentel of Rochester was arrested Wednesday after 
pretending to shoot an imaginary rifle into a crowd picketing a 
hospital that provides abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	At Buffalo United for Choice '99, a coalition of abortion rights  
supporters, the message on the answering machine included plans for 
a victory party. A spokeswoman was not immediately available to 
comment.

	Hero Teacher Burial Today  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- William ``Dave'' Sanders, the heroic  
teacher killed during Tuesday's massacre at Columbine High School, 
will be laid to rest today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, current and former students remembered Sanders'  
dedication and devotion. ``He was just a model teacher,'' said Jeff 
Markle, the school's 1994 student body president who traveled from 
Dallas to honor Sanders. ``He'd come early, stay late. Anything he 
could do to make us feel better he would do.'' When gunfire and 
explosions echoed through the school cafeteria, Sanders jumped on 
tables, shouting for students to get out. He ran through the halls, 
herding students to safety before he was killed.

	Pilot Dismissed Over Affair

<P>
	TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- An Air Force captain who  
refused to stop his affair with an enlisted woman was dismissed 
from the service and given 15 days in prison. A military jury today 
decided the sentence after prosecutors said Capt. Joseph Belli 
should serve a year in prison. Belli, 35, pleaded guilty to 
fraternization, conspiracy and disobeying direct orders. The 
charges carry a maximum 22-year prison term. The pilot, who was 
married and the father of five children when he began the affair 
with Airman Susan Redo, said his love for her clouded his judgment. 
He later married Redo.

	High-Tech Education Unpopular

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A new study says fewer students are  
seeking high-tech degrees despite a need for graduates in those 
fields. Issued today by the American Electronics Association, the 
report found that degrees in engineering, math, physics and 
computer science declined 5 percent between 1990 and 1996. The AEA 
said elementary and high schools must do more to get students ready 
to tackle a high-tech education. Nationwide the unemployment rate 
for high-tech careers is extremely low --1.6 percent for engineers 
and 1.2 percent for math and computer scientists last year.

granddaughter also were killed on the trip, was among those who 
boarded a flight Sunday to Cordoba, Argentina, with the remains of 
16-year-old Silvina Pelosso. Ms. Pelosso, Carole Sund and her 
15-year-old daughter, Julie, were last seen alive Feb. 15, after 
ice-skating and sightseeing in the park. The burnt remains of Ms. 
Pelosso and Mrs. Sund were found in the trunk of their torched 
rental car March 19.

worth $1.84 billion. Under the deal, the telecommunications giants 
will each hold a 15 percent stake in Japan Telecom, the companies 
said in a statement on Sunday. Japan Telecom had reportedly been 
looking for a partner to survive tough competition, with many 
Japanese telecom companies cutting rates for domestic and

get a chance to change that when the best-of-7 series resumes in 
Boston with Game 3. And one forward said they must be aggressive 
from the start. ``We're going to try to match their emotion right 
from the get-go,'' Anson Carter said after the Bruins' light 
workout Sunday.

Yugoslav forces, NATO said today. ``The full package of the Apache

Harris. ``They wanted to kill 500 people, hijack a plane and take 
it to New York City,'' sheriff's department spokesman Steve Davis. 
As to why the gunmen were thinking of New York City, he said: ``I 
have no idea. Maybe the density of population, for all I know.'' 
The diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail, bomb-making

	Court To Make FDA-Tobacco Decision  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed today to decide  
whether the Food and Drug Administration can crack down on 
cigarette sales to minors. The court will hear a Clinton 
administration appeal in which government lawyers say the FDA's 
1996 decision to start regulating tobacco as a drug was justified 
by new evidence that the tobacco industry intended its products to 
feed consumers' nicotine habits. A federal appeals court ruled that 
Congress, not the FDA, has the authority to make the ``major policy

<HEADLINE> Global Crisis Stalls Help for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global financial crisis may stall or  
reverse improvements in the lives of millions of the world's poor, 
the World Bank said Monday in a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also said that financial rescue packages designed to  
help crisis-hit countries often harm poor people and plunge back 
into poverty those who had achieved middle-class status. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year ago we confidently predicted that the international  
development goals of halving poverty ... could be met,'' World Bank 
President James Wolfensohn said in an introduction to the report. 
``Now those goals are at risk and we must reshape our strategies,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, ``World Development Indicators 1999,'' was issued as  
the bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary 
Fund, hold their annual spring meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	During these sessions, the United States is trying to push its  
European allies and Japan to do more to get the shaky world economy 
back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is forecasting that developing countries' growth this  
year will decline to 1.5 percent. This contrasts with average 
growth in these countries, excluding the former Soviet Union, of 
5.3 percent in 1991-1997, growth rates that encouraged expectations 
that living standards would continue to rise in most of the world, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the financial crisis, has now tempered those  
expectations and could reverse the gains of many people who had 
previously migrated from poverty to the ranks of the middle class 
in the worst-affected countries,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's chief economist, said the IMF  
had to be wary about the effects of its rescue packages. Some 
programs that help the economy may do so ``at the cost of increased 
poverty, interrupted education or declining life expectancies,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Delta Pilots Sue Over Commuter Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines pilots have sued to block the  
planned use of a commuter airline's planes and crews on a new Delta 
shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots union says the shuttle service has always been flown  
by Delta's own pilots and the airline is acting ``in bad faith'' by 
planning to use Comair regional jets on some flights that begin 
June 1 between Boston and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Delta is permitted to unilaterally alter the status quo  
concerning shuttle operations, it would have no reason to reach a 
collectively bargained resolution of shuttle issues with ALPA (the 
Air Line Pilots Association),'' said the suit, filed Friday in 
federal court in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Delta pilots adamantly believe that the Delta shuttle  
flying is unique to Delta Air Lines,'' said Karen McGuffey, 
spokeswoman for the union, which represents about 9,000 Delta 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner said Monday that based on a  
preliminary review of the pilots' complaint, the carrier ``believes 
it is without merit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that Delta is using Comair to beef up its new nonstop  
service because the smaller carrier had commuter landing rights at 
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport supplementing Delta's own 
slots in the tightly controlled airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta will operate five roundtrip flights with its own Boeing  
727 aircraft and crews, while Comair will fly three roundtrips with 
regional jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit involves a concern common to pilots at many major  
airlines about the increasing use of small, regional jets. The 
issue will figure into negotiations on a new Delta pilots agreement 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue was going to be on the table one way or the other,  
and this use of Comair RJ's on expanded shuttle flying has become a 
lightning rod for this issue,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an airline 
analyst for PaineWebber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Buttrick said most recent major-airline contracts have included  
restrictions addressing pilot job-protection concerns about 
expanding use of regional jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots who command bigger salaries flying larger planes worry  
that increased use of regional jets will come at the expense of 
growth of the mainline fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue became a sticking point during negotiations marked by  
a brief strike in 1997 by American Airlines pilots.

<HEADLINE> Cops Describe Colo. Gunmen's Diary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who carried out the  
attack at Columbine High dreamed of an even bigger bloodbath, 
plotting to kill hundreds of neighbors, then hijack a plane and 
crash it into New York City, investigators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also questioned an 18-year-old girlfriend of Dylan  
Klebold about whether she bought two of the guns used in the 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	A diary kept by gunman Eric Harris described his and Klebold's  
plans for continuing their murderous rampage through the school's 
neighborhood, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to kill 500 people, hijack a plane and take it to  
New York City,'' Davis said. He speculated that they chose New York 
because of the high population density. 
</P>
<P>
	He credited the quick response of sheriff's deputies with  
keeping the gunmen confined to the school. ``Perhaps some major, 
major catastrophes were averted,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	On NBC's ``Today'' show, District Attorney Dave Thomas said of  
the plot to attack New York: ``I suppose when you first hear it, 
you think that it's some horrible fantasy. But we now know that at 
least the first portion of those planned activities were, in fact, 
carried out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, funerals were held Monday for the teacher and three  
of the students slain. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a half-mile from the school, 2,700 mourners at the  
Trinity Christian Center wiped tears as friends and family 
remembered William ``Dave'' Sanders, 47, who was shot twice in the 
chest as he shepherded students down a hallway to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was and always will be a hero in my heart,'' said his  
niece, Kim Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals also were held for Lauren Townsend, 18, the captain of  
the girls' varsity volleyball team and a candidate for 
valedictorian; Daniel Rohrbough, 15, who was shot while holding an 
exit door open for fleeing students; and Cassie Bernall, 17, who 
became a born-again Christian two years ago. Witnesses have said 
that when one of the gunmen asked Ms. Bernall if she believed in 
God, she answered ``Yes.'' Then he shot her. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 23 people injured, 10 remained hospitalized Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack's bold, bizarre nature led to early speculation that  
the gunmen might have been on drugs. But toxicology tests revealed 
no drugs or alcohol in their bodies, the county coroner's office 
said. Investigators said they found no drugs at the teens' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair also passed repeated drug and alcohol tests during the  
previous year as part of a probation program for a car burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurling bombs and blasting away with guns, Klebold, 17, and  
Harris, 18, killed 12 fellow students and a teacher, then shot 
themselves to death last Tuesday. The sheer firepower involved has 
led authorities to question whether others helped plan or execute 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said investigators have questioned Robyn Anderson, who  
has been described as Klebold's girlfriend, about whether she had 
bought two of the four guns Harris and Klebold used: a 9 mm carbine 
rifle and a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Under law, a person must be 18 to buy rifles and shotguns from a  
dealer and 21 to buy a pistol. But the 18-year-old woman could have 
legally bought the semiautomatic pistol at a private sale, like a 
gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the woman is considered a witness, not a suspect.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that at some future date her status could  
change from being a witness to something else,'' Thomas said in an 
interview on MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have no other suspects, nor are they keeping  
anyone under surveillance, but they are working 220 separate leads 
in the case, sheriff's spokesman Jim Parr said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Columbine High, the main road past the school was reopened  
Monday, but it hardly signaled a return to normalcy. The school's 
1,800 students still were attending funerals instead of classes, 
which will resume Thursday at a school nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers start work Tuesday, but they won't be allowed back in  
to Columbine. They'll be at nearby Chatfield High, which will also 
welcome Columbine students starting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they need anything and we can find it, we'll get it for  
them,'' Parr said. ``But I think they're going to be operating on a 
shoestring for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs and bomb-squad officers continued their slow progress  
through lockers and backpacks left behind by fleeing students. 
Investigators won't finish collecting evidence at the school for 
two weeks, Davis said, and analyzing the thousands of items will 
take much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our lab people have barely begun to scratch the surface,''  
Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert Earnings Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. (AP) -- Warner-Lambert Co. reported a 36  
percent earnings surge in the first quarter as sales climbed 29 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped analysts' expectations but Warner Lambert  
shares were down $1.87 1/2 a share at $66 in afternoon trading Monday 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Listerine mouthwash, Trident chewing gum and  
prescription drugs for lowering cholesterol and treating diabetes 
earned $381 million, or 45 cents per share, in the first three 
months of the year compared with $279 million, or 33 cents a share, 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings per share figure was a penny ahead of the 44 cents  
that analysts surveyed by First Call had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $2.9 billion worldwide from $2.2 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvin R. Goodes, chairman and chief executive, said both the  
pharmaceutical and consumer products segments performed strongly 
and said the company was ``on track to achieve our previously 
stated goal of 30 percent growth in earnings per share for 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodes is scheduled to retire April 30 and will be succeeded by  
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Warner-Lambert's cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor and  
its Rezulin diabetes treatment drove the company's growth in the 
pharmaceutical segment, the largest of its three divisions. 
Worldwide sales of Lipitor nearly doubled to $751 million in the 
quarter. Sales of Rezulin increased 33 percent to $184 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales in the company's consumer health segment  
increased 13 percent to $736 million, led by Listerine mouthwash, 
whose sales rose 22 percent to $128 million, Lubiderm skin care 
products, up 35 percent to $35 million, and the Schick Protector 
shaving system, up 23 percent to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the company's confectionary segment rose 4 percent to  
$460 million. Halls cough tablets and Trident, Clorets and Dentyne 
gum were among the best-performing product lines.

<HEADLINE>  Chernobyl's Messy Legacy Lingers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Chernobyl radiation victims are still  
praying for better treatment. The leaky concrete-and-steel shelter 
covering the ruined reactor still needs repairs. And Ukraine says 
the plant won't be closed unless the West gives it $1.2 billion for 
two new reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 13th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, a  
grim legacy lingers from the explosion and fire at reactor No. 4 of 
Chernobyl's atomic power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident -- on April 26, 1986 -- sent a radioactive cloud over  
much of Europe and contaminated large areas in Ukraine, Russia and 
Belarus. The government now says 4,365 of those who took part in 
the hasty and poorly organized Soviet cleanup have died due to the 
disaster, and more than 70,000 Ukrainians are considered fully 
disabled by it. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991 provided hope  
for victims, offering promise that better treatment would be made 
available, that the protective cover would be made environmentally 
sound, and that an independent Ukraine would close the plant for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, those hopes have been unfulfilled.  
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has a terrible health legacy and scant finances to cope.  
Nearly 400,000 adults and 1.1 million children are entitled to 
government aid for Chernobyl-related health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuriy Shcherbak, a medic who wrote a book on Chernobyl and later  
served as Ukraine's ambassador in the United States, said the 
anniversary today brought him a sad feeling of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an undefeatable evil ... Chernobyl will continue to exist  
for an indefinite period of time, posing ever new problems for 
mankind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Urged by the West, Ukraine pledged to shut down the plant by  
2000. Now it seems unlikely that pledge will be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, President Leonid Kuchma said it flat out: Chernobyl  
will continue to operate until the West provides Ukraine with the 
estimated $1.2 billion necessary to complete two new nuclear 
reactors to compensate for the loss of the electricity Chernobyl 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Seven richest nations promised aid in 1995 to help  
Ukraine close Chernobyl, but the nation, strapped for energy and 
cash, has complained that the money has been slow in coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma says the G-7 also should help Ukraine build nuclear waste  
depositories and compensate the 6,200 Chernobyl employees who will 
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's arguments seem to be linked more to its desperate  
financial position than on energy problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is heavily dependent on its five nuclear plants -- but  
of its 14 working reactors, only one is at Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant once had four reactors and plans for more. After the  
accident, reactor No. 4 was out of action. Another of the plant's 
Soviet-made reactors has been inactive since a 1991 fire and a 
third was stopped in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The working reactor, No. 3, has its own troubles. It underwent  
repairs for nearly three months and was restarted in March, only to 
suffer a daylong shutdown over a turbine generator malfunction 
later that month. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is slow on making the shelter over the exploded reactor  
environmentally safe, although international donors have pledged 
$400 million. Safety concerns also have delayed construction. 
</P>
<P>
	That work ``might take 50 and even 100 years,'' according to  
Shcherbak, who is Ukraine's coordinator at Chernobyl talks with the 
G-7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian government says it is increasingly unable to bear  
the long-term costs of the disaster after spending $5.7 billion to 
deal with its consequences during Soviet times and more than $4 
billion from 1992-97. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ukraine's economy declining since the Soviet collapse,  
state funding covered only an average 51.6 percent of Chernobyl 
relief needs from 1996-98. This year's budget allocation of $443 
million is only a third of what is needed, according to Emergency 
Situations Minister Vasyl Durdynets. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Belarus on Sunday, 7,000 protesters marched  
through the capital of Minsk demanding more attention for accident 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern France, 400 people gathered Sunday near a nuclear  
reactor in Thionville to mark the Chernobyl anniversary and protest 
France's heavy reliance on atomic energy.

<HEADLINE> Union Carbide Earnings Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Union Carbide Corp.'s profits fell sharply  
in the first quarter, hurt by price declines, increased raw 
material costs and an accounting charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street expectations, but the company's  
stock price sagged as Union Carbide officials said they didn't know 
how long the decline in prices might last. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income was $51 million, or 38 cents per share, compared to  
$142 million, or $1.01 per share, a year ago. The results were 
reduced by a charge of $20 million, or 14 cents per share, for a 
required change in accounting principle for start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the accounting charge, the chemicals company would have  
earned $71 million, or 52 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 7 cents a share ahead of the 45 cents that analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected without the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 10 percent in the first quarter to $1.40 billion,  
compared to $1.56 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide chairman and chief executive William H. Joyce said  
the results were hurt by price declines in polyester glycol and 
increased raw material costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joyce said it was it was tough to get a clear picture on the  
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know how long the current spike in raw material  
costs will last or how much of the increases will be offset by 
higher product prices, in addition to cost savings.'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was enough to send Union Carbide's stock 7 percent lower.  
It closed down $3.50 a share at $48.25 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

points and 3.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mormon, Burgess had talked late in the season about possibly  
leaving the team to go on a two-year church mission. A statement 
released by the school did not address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't indicate what he planned to do about that,'' said  
Duke sports information director Mike Cragg. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgess is the third Blue Devil to leave the team in the past  
two weeks. Fellow sophomores Brand and William Avery had announced 
their intentions to enter the 1999 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Corey Maggette was also reportedly considering leaving  
early for the pros but hadn't made up his mind as of late last 
week. The deadline for underclassmen to send a letter to the NBA 
declaring for the draft is May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski supported Brand's decision but  
opposed Avery leaving early. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgess' decision apparently caught him off guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised by the decision and the timing of it,''  
Krzyzewski said in a statement released by the school. ``I 
certainly wish Chris and his family the best in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke went 37-2 last season, losing to Connecticut in the  
national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgess was a Parade All-America out of Mater Dei High School in  
Santa Ana, Calif., but would have again competed for playing time 
next season. Krzyzewski lured a another stellar recruiting class 
that includes Nick Horvath, a 6-10 center from Arden Hills, Minn., 
and Casey Sanders, a 6-11 shot-blocking specialist from Tampa, Fla.

<HEADLINE> US-EU Beef Fight Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- In principle, the banana war is over.  
</P>
<P>
	But tensions remain between the United States and the European  
Union over banana imports, and a big trade fight over European 
restrictions on American beef is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana fight cooled off when the EU accepted a World Trade  
Organization finding that the EU unfairly discriminate against 
Latin American banana producers and their American distributors in 
favor of former European colonies in Africa and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Under WTO rules, the EU now will rework its import rules, while  
Washington maintains punitive tariffs of $191.4 million per year on 
selected European goods. Once the U.S. side is satisfied, the 
sanctions will be removed, and everyone, the theory goes, will be 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
	But few people expect the Europeans and the Americans to easily  
agree on whatever changes the EU comes up with. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a showdown seems likely over Washington's complaints  
about the EU's 10-year-old ban on importing beef from cattle 
treated with certain growth hormones on the grounds the hormones 
may cause cancer. The United States says that is nonsense and just 
an excuse to protect Europe's cattle farmers from competition. 
Washington claims the ban costs American exporters $250 million per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO already ruled that the ban violates international trade  
rules because the EU's scientific evidence was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans said that meant the ban should be lifted, but the  
Europeans replied they would do more scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Then this past week, the EU further angered Washington by saying  
it would ban even American beef that is certified hormone-free, 
because traces of hormones are still being found -- a decision that 
affects another $20 million of exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans have until May 13 to comply with the WTO's beef  
ruling, but have already said they will not make the deadline to 
complete their scientific research and have no intention of lifting 
the ban. That could bring a round of more U.S. penalty tariffs on 
European goods imported into the United States. The Americans have 
compiled a list of $900 million in proposed sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The beef and banana fights have been around since the formation  
of the World Trade Organization in 1995, replacing a previous 
international trade regime set up after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana war tested the fledgling body's assertion that all  
trade disputes can be sorted out by sticking to a set of rules. 
There are more than 150 disputes currently on the WTO's books, and 
the United States is the country that appears most often, both as 
complainant and alleged violator. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the heart of the system, and this is why our  
organization is different from other organizations,'' said Renato 
Ruggiero, who is stepping down as the WTO's director-general at the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicts that refining the organization's dispute settlement  
procedure will be the big challenge for whoever is named his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana fight had lawyers on both sides finding loopholes and  
ambiguities in the rules that exasperated other members of the 
134-nation WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO finally ruled against the EU, and the Europeans were  
given time to change their policies. When the Jan. 1 deadline 
arrived, Washington said the EU was still breaking the rules by 
discriminating against a region's produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU disputed that, and diplomats got down to intense marathon  
bargaining. Feelings were so bruised that American and European 
representatives refused to negotiate face-to-face for a time, and 
WTO officials had to shuttle between the delegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks lasted until this month. Finally, last Monday, EU  
Ambassador Roderick Abbott announced the EU would not oppose the 
United States' position. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later the meeting broke up with U.S. sanctions against  
European Union goods approved by the WTO and the EU saying it would 
change its rules to bring the banana crisis to a conclusion.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Fat-Blocking Diet Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The menu at Pink's is a dietitian's  
nightmare: hot dogs, hamburgers and french fries augmented with 
healthy doses -- so to speak -- of chili, cheese, sauerkraut or 
bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	For the adventurous -- or indecisive -- there's the $3.90 pastrami  
burrito dog. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the dieters, how about a chaser of Xenical?  
</P>
<P>
	The highly anticipated diet pill, which earned government  
approval Monday, sounds like a Pink's patron's dream. It blocks the 
body from absorbing 30 percent of the fat a person eats. 
</P>
<P>
	But medical experts warned the drug -- the first that works in  
the gut instead of targeting the brain to suppress appetite -- is 
only for obese people on strict diets and can cause unpleasant side 
effects, especially if someone pops a pill just before indulging in 
a greasy burger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always looking for the next magic drug, but there's no  
pill people can take that'll make you close the refrigerator 
door,'' said Dr. David Heber, director of the Center for Human 
Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pink's, which has served up its cuisine since 1939 in Los  
Angeles' Miracle Mile district, customers said they would stick 
with exercise and better eating habits, considering the drug's 
potential downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prefer a more natural way of losing weight if I had a  
choice,'' said Jaime Parker, as he waited in line for his chili 
cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical, known chemically as orlistat, blocks intestinal  
enzymes. So instead of being stored on people's hips, 30 percent of 
the fat eaten passes straight to the colon for excretion. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies, adding Xenical to a diet let people lose about 7 1/2  
pounds more in a year than diet alone, the Food and Drug 
Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way it works, Xenical can also cause intestinal  
cramping, oily spotting, gas, fecal urgency, and oily or loose 
stools. Some 27 percent of Xenical users had at least one episode, 
although the side effects tend to wane the longer people take the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the more fat eaten, the more side effects -- thus, the FDA  
recommended that Xenical users get no more than 30 percent of their 
daily calories from fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the side effects will keep many dieters from the  
kind of haphazard use that plagued Redux and the fenfluramine half 
of ``fen-phen,'' which were banned for causing heart damage. Both 
were very popular and sometimes bought on the Internet without 
consultation with a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical ``is not a drug for people who want to eat whatever they  
want,'' said Heber, whose center treats thousands a year. ``Those 
gastrointestinal side effects will be enough to turn a lot of those 
people off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Xenical to do any good, dieters have to eat fewer overall  
calories, not just watch fat, said Dr. Richard Atkinson of the 
University of Wisconsin, president of the American Obesity 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	As for people who ``eat the pizza and milkshake and take this  
drug and think it's going to absolve them of all their sins, 
they're going to be in for a surprise,'' Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical also decreases absorption of the important fat-soluble  
vitamins A, D, E and K, so users should take vitamin supplements 
two hours before -- or after -- swallowing Xenical. 
</P>
<P>
	Dieters take one Xenical capsule with each main meal, up to  
three daily. Manufacturer Hoffman-La Roche said the 
prescription-only drug would be available within two weeks, at a 
wholesale price of $1.10 per pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other prescription weight-loss drugs are sold in the  
country. Doctors expect many dieters will begin taking Xenical with 
those appetite suppressants to shed even more pounds. But the FDA 
warned no one has studied the safety of mixing the drugs, and Roche 
has no plans to do so.

<HEADLINE>  Cops Say Teens Wanted To Kill 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who killed 13 people at  
Columbine High School wanted to kill at least 500 others, attack 
nearby homes and then hijack a plane and crash it into New York 
City, investigators said. Authorities also said today they were 
questioning an 18-year-old girl about whether she purchased two of 
the firearms used in the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone earlier told reporters the  
goal of the killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, was to strike 
during the busy lunch hour to go for ``a big kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But sheriff's department spokesman Steve Davis said today that  
the gunmen's diary indicates that if they survived, they wanted 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to kill 500 people, hijack a plane and take it to  
New York City,'' Davis said. ``If in fact they were able to carry 
out the entire plan, there could have been quite a bit more damage 
and quite a few more fatalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As to why the gunmen were thinking of New York City, he said:  
``I have no idea. Maybe the density of population, for all I 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose when you first hear it, you think that it's some  
horrible fantasy,'' District Attorney Dave Thomas told NBC's 
``Today'' show. ``But we now know that at least the first portion 
of those planned activities were in fact carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we also know that had a couple of the devices  
in the school actually detonated as they had planned, the death 
toll could have been much higher than it was,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail, bomb-making  
materials and weapons were found in Harris' bedroom. Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the pair, enraged by what they considered taunts and  
insults from classmates, rampaged through their school with guns 
and bombs before turning their weapons on themselves. 
Investigators, amazed at the sheer firepower, are trying to 
determine if others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas confirmed reports that an 18-year-old woman, described as  
Klebold's girlfriend, was to be brought in for questioning today 
about whether she had purchased two of the four firearms used in 
Tuesday's massacre at Columbine, a 9 mm carbine rifle and a TEC-DC9 
semiautomatic pistol. Authorities were attempting to determine if 
any law was broken, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the woman has not been named as a suspect and no  
arrests were imminent. He said he didn't know if she supplied the 
guns or, if she did, whether she knew what Harris and Klebold 
planned to do with them. He wouldn't say what information had led 
authorities to think she might have supplied the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	As for whether anyone other than Harris, Klebold and the young  
woman were under investigation, Thomas said: ``We believe more than 
three were certainly aware of it. Whether more than three were 
involved in it, that's really the essence of our investigation at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, students, friends, relatives and thousands of others  
turned a strip-mall parking lot into an arena of grief and promised 
each other they would reach past their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore brought the 70,000 heartbroken people a  
message Sunday: ``You are not alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 students slain, three were to be laid to rest today. A  
funeral also was scheduled for Dave Sanders, a popular teacher 
hailed as a hero for shepherding students to safety during the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's outdoor ceremony was a mass catharsis at the foot of  
the snow-capped Rockies. People hugged and wept as a parade of 
students, singers and public officials tried to make sense of the 
week's events. Many wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight -- 
even portable toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High  
School,'' Gov. Bill Owens said. ``One thing is clear: This 
community will not be beaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian singer Amy Grant began a tribute song to the victims  
with a gentle lament: ``So much pain and no reason why.'' Bagpipe 
players played ``Amazing Grace'' and four F-16 jets flew over in a 
``missing-man'' formation after 13 doves were released -- one for 
each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen sang a tribute they wrote.  
Jonathan Cohen, a junior, was trapped in the Columbine choir room 
when gunfire erupted. Stephen, a senior, was in the cafeteria where 
many students were shot or hit by shrapnel from pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious  
ones?'' they sang. ``In God's son, hope will come, his red stain 
will take our pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis called the gathering ``the  
end of a nightmare.'' Religious leaders urged trust in God. And 
Gore, thundering like a preacher at a revival, underscored that 
bloodshed like that allegedly caused by Klebold and Harris must 
remain an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for  
the spirit of America,'' Gore said. ``America is a good and decent 
place, and our goodness is a light to all the nations of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the gathering, the proceedings moved en masse to Clement  
Park, adjacent to Columbine and -- as long as the school remains 
cordoned off -- the mourning place of choice and site of a vast 
makeshift memorial. Hundreds lined the procession route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew this school was very strong and this is a good  
community, and all the kids love each other. But to see the kids 
and the community come together was just amazing,'' said Scott 
Rathbun, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered at a  
church to remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a cross-country runner who had recently returned from a  
two-week trip to Paris with the French club; she was an aspiring 
songwriter and author eager to get her driver's license. The 
victims' families held the dual funeral because they belong to 
neighboring Roman Catholic churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  
students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at 
Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate 
Columbine's overflow. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's graduation ceremony will be held May 22 at a  
suburban amphitheater normally used for rock concerts, a baby step 
toward normalcy and in defiance of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted death and destruction. Instead, we've all come  
together,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends 
Columbine. ``They can't kill the message. They can't kill the 
hope.''

<HEADLINE> American Express CEO To Go in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Golub plans to step aside as chief  
executive of American Express Co. in two years, and president Ken 
Chenault, already one of the top black executives in America, was 
tapped as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Monday outlined a smooth executive transition  
in the fierce and fast-changing credit card industry. Golub, 60, 
will relinquish the chief executive's title in April 2001, and 
retire as chairman in 2002. Golub will leave American Express a 
very different company than the one he has controlled since 1993, 
but with many of the same challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenault, 47, will have to make bold choices about how to regain  
the market share and prestige the flagship credit card once 
commanded. He also will face more competition and a landscape 
vastly changed by the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does American Express remain relevant in the card business  
at a time when financial institutions offer many of the same 
services and products, if not all of the same products, with a much 
larger distribution network and a larger merchant network?'' asks 
Dave Robertson, president of The Nilson Report, an industry trade 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenault came to American Express in 1981 as a strategic  
planner. He eventually became president of Travel Related Services, 
and led an effort to build customer loyalty through reward programs 
which allow people to earn free airline tickets, hotel 
accommodations and retail gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to be a very strong growth company,'' he  
said. ``I believe we have made substantial progress over the last 
few years in achieving good growth, but there's certainly more we 
can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his new post at American Express, Chenault will be the No. 2  
ranked black executive in the country, after Franklin Raines, 
chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, a federally insured 
mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenault dismissed any reference to his race, saying, ``What I  
hope (the promotion) represents is that the decision was made based 
on my performance and that's all there is to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express has been losing business to Visa USA since  
Golub took the helm, but his problems got much worse in mid-1996, 
when he led a campaign to change a policy at Visa that prohibits 
its member banks from issuing American Express cards. 
</P>
<P>
	That dispute is now being reviewed by the Department of Justice.  
But while Golub has been waiting for a settlement, many of his 
competitors have been aggressively forming new business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express' market share has fallen to 17.7 percent this  
year from 20.4 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, Visa's dominance has 
soared to 50.6 percent from 43.9 percent over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since May 1996, American Express' competitors have launched  
many more products domestically than American Express has,'' said 
Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	Golub, however, can fend off many of his critics by simply  
pointing to the stock price. Shares of American Express have soared 
525 percent during his tenure as CEO. On Monday, however, American 
Express dropped $1.06 1/4 to close at $134.31 1/4 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Golub, who joined American Express in 1984, changed the  
company's strategy by selling off the Lehman Brothers brokerage and 
investment banking unit in 1994, and expanding into travel 
services. American Express also has made solid inroads overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chenault, whose appointment has been endorsed by the board  
of directors, may oversee the biggest change in American Express' 
history. The Internet is reshaping the industry, and American 
Express is forging a plan to shift its business and services to the 
World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet ``will have as profound effect on the way people  
and organizations live, work, function and operate as the 
industrial revolution'' but in a much shorter period, Golub said. 
``Given the importance of the Internet to society and to our 
business, we have to reposition the company ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's Chenault's job.

<HEADLINE> 'Mark McGwire Highway' Bill Gets OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gov. Mel Carnahan said Monday he will  
sign legislation naming a stretch of Interstate 70 after Mark 
McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers approved the legislation last week to honor the St.  
Louis Cardinals first baseman, who last season set the major league 
record with 70 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have slowed McGwire a bit this year and he has hit five  
home runs in 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Mark McGwire Highway'' will be a five-mile stretch of I-70  
through St. Louis, from the city's western edge to the Illinois 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he will try to arrange the bill signing ceremony  
so McGwire can attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a positive thing for Missouri. He's such a great  
role model, and the fact that we can name a piece of highway for 
him is very appropriate, and I will do that with delight,'' 
Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, during his annual State of the State address to  
lawmakers, Carnahan recognized McGwire for his record number of 
home runs and his $1 million donation to help abused and neglected 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, a California native who is in his second full season  
with the Cardinals, could not be immediately reached for comment 
Monday. In an October appearance on ``Late Night with David 
Letterman,'' he joked about the hoopla surrounding last year's home 
run chase and the possibility that a stretch of interstate might be 
named after him.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Dismissed From Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- Capt. Joseph Belli ``always  
wanted to be in the Air Force, ever since I was a little kid.'' He 
got his dream, serving as a top tanker pilot in a crack squadron. 
</P>
<P>
	The dream ended Sunday night when a court-martial jury dismissed  
Belli from the service and ordered him to serve 15 days in jail for 
disobeying two commanders who had ordered him to halt his affair 
with an enlisted woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, a married father of five when he and Airman Susan Redo  
began their affair in 1997, pleaded guilty to obstruction, 
fraternization and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations carried a maximum of 22 years in prison.  
Prosecutors had asked the six-member jury for a one-year sentence 
and Belli's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case was about honor and obeying orders and the ability  
to lead by example,'' said Air Force Sgt. Eric Grill, a Travis Air 
Force Base spokesman. ``The expectation is that an officer will 
follow lawful orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors declined to discuss their decision. The defense, however,  
was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney John Hodson said it was ``a ridiculous notion'' that an  
officer could receive years in prison for a love affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a confinement period this small. He can do two  
weeks standing on his head,'' he said. ``As I've said all along, 
the whole Air Force isn't nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, 35, was taken into custody moments after the verdict was  
read. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli and Redo, then 19, met in 1997 while stationed at Diego  
Garcia Island in the Indian Ocean. Their affair continued when they 
were transferred to Travis Air Force Base, 50 miles northeast of 
San Francisco. The first order to stop the affair came in the 
spring of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they gave me the order I walked out of the room  
with good intentions,'' Belli said Sunday before court resumed. 
``But you just can't stop loving somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belli's request to resign was refused in December.  
</P>
<P>
	Belli and Redo married in March, days after his divorce from  
Kelly Belli. Redo has been demoted to the Air Force's lowest rank 
and continues trying to get discharged from the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli's dismissal means he immediately forfeits all pay and  
benefits. Air Force authorities said the military may provide child 
support payments to his ex-wife, but only for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternization between officers became a national issue in 1997  
when Lt. Kelly Flinn, the first female B-52 bomber pilot, was 
charged with adultery for having an affair with the husband of a 
female airman in North Dakota. She eventually was allowed to resign 
and was not prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Say Bomb Killed Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONNELLSVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- A bomb, not an accidental gas  
explosion, killed a pregnant woman and her 3-year-old daughter, 
federal investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Mitts and her daughter, Kayla, died in a blast and fire  
in their apartment on Jan. 1. Ms. Mitts was seven months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities originally speculated that the deaths were  
accidental, and that the explosion could have been caused by 
malfunctioning gas appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investigators have now determined that a bomb was  
placed in the apartment, Dan Boeh, of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeh said investigators found no evidence of forced entry into  
the apartment, so whoever placed the bomb might have known Ms. 
Mitts or had a key. 
</P>
<P>
	He said federal and Fayette County authorities have interviewed  
60 to 70 people and executed five search warrants for 90 places, 
but wouldn't say what officials have found. A grand jury is 
considering the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mitts was a single mother, and authorities are looking into  
whether the man or men who fathered her 3-year-old and her expected 
baby were involved.	   ''Any time you get into an investigation you look at people who 
are close to the victim,'' Boeh said.

<HEADLINE> Asia Markets Soar As Recovery Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia's financial crisis may not be over yet,  
but its stock markets are red hot and analysts predict its 
economies may start rallying too. 
</P>
<P>
	While traders may be overly exuberant, strong gains on regional  
stock markets are likely another sign the global economy is 
recovering from the troubles set off nearly two years ago by the 
Asian turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts see the world economy stabilizing, with a strong  
chance of healthy growth resuming in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Harwood, head of economics and strategy at investment bank  
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London, sees the recent Asian market 
rallies, which have followed a string of record gains by the Dow 
Jones industrial average, as ``over-enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harwood predicts the global economy will grow by about 2 percent  
this year. He expects some of the troubles in emerging markets will 
run their course, not only in Asia but also in Brazil, where a 
currency crisis failed to infect the rest of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it's going to be a storming recovery,'' Harwood  
said. ``We think it's going to be a slow one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund, whose bailout packages have  
come to the rescue in Asia's biggest recovery story, South Korea, 
has predicted the world economy is stabilizing and should return to 
healthy growth next year. South Korea has even started paying back 
some of its IMF loans early. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Roach, chief economist for New York investment bank  
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has dubbed 1999 as a ``year of healing 
for the global economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The patient is still in bed,'' Roach said Friday. ``The  
patient is sitting up, not yet smiling. All the bandages aren't 
off. But the patient is alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers coming out of the United States, the United  
Kingdom, Asia and even in Europe suggest that confidence has 
improved a bit,'' said Andy Cates, senior international economist 
at Warburg Dillon Read in London. ``I think as far as the global 
economy moving forward goes, much, as ever, hinges on the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some bears worry that any decline on Wall Street could spoil the  
party. U.S. consumers are driving global demand, and if their paper 
profits from the extended bull run on Wall Street vanish, they 
could stop spending and kill off any hopes for a global recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously still worried about the U.S. stock market,''  
Roach told reporters during a visit to Hong Kong. ``Were that to 
go, it would be problematic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor that could slow the rebound is a recent rise in  
oil prices. Crude prices were pulled down by excess production in 
1998. They have started climbing back on pledges by world oil 
producers to cut output. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook isn't rosy everywhere. The Russian economy remains  
troubled, and the government is still badly in need of 
international loans. Indonesia's economy, which skidded into a 
depression, also has an uncertain outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	But elsewhere, there are signs of a rebound.  
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, for example, blue chip stocks have been soaring,  
even though the territory is in its worst recession in many years, 
with joblessness setting new records every month and consumer 
prices falling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index recently pushed above 12,000 points for the  
first time since its collapse in October 1997. Within the next five 
trading days, the Hang Seng had moved briefly through the 
13,000-point level -- twice -- before closing Friday at 12,905.30, up 
27.5 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other markets in Asia have also been hitting highs.  
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, Asia's biggest market, the Nikkei 225 stock index is  
up 22 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That despite the fact that Japan, the world's second-largest  
economy, remains mired in its worst recession since World War II. 
Optimists say banking reforms and government spending can restore 
growth. Others are doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
	Seema Desai, an Asia economist at the investment bank Schroders  
Ltd. in Hong Kong, believes the Japanese economy will start sinking 
again after the benefits of government spending plans wear off. She 
also sees Asian unemployment rising throughout the year and wonders 
where Asian manufacturers will find enough demand for their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are plenty of risks ahead,'' she said. ``I think  
it's too early to be euphoric. I think the markets have gotten way 
ahead of themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Kids Hear Anti-Drug Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America's teen-agers are listening to their  
parents' warnings about the dangers of drug use, but the older 
generation needs to invest more time in delivering their message, a 
new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	``With parents, we can cut drug use dramatically,'' said  
chairman James E. Burke of the Partnership for a Drug Free America, 
which conducted the survey. ``Without them, we cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teens who receive strong anti-drug messages at home were 42  
percent less likely to use drugs than those whose parents ignore 
the issue, according to the study released Sunday by the group. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, however, a discrepancy between the beliefs of the  
parents and their kids. Although 98 percent of parents say they've 
spoken with their children about drugs, only 27 percent of teens 
say they are learning a lot about drug risks at home, the survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's truly complicated about this is that parents really  
believe they're doing their job in this area, but the data suggest 
otherwise,'' Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, there were significant differences in  
experimentation between teens who spoke regularly with their 
parents about drug use and those who did not. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Among teens who learned a lot at home, marijuana use was 26  
percent. Among those who said they learned nothing at home, 45 
percent said they had used marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	-- For inhalants, the first group reported 14 percent; among the  
latter group, 28 percent had used inhalants. For LSD, the figures 
were 7 percent and 20 percent; for cocaine, 7 percent and 16 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason parents weren't speaking with children about drugs:  
They underestimate the availability. The survey found only 37 
percent of parents believed their teens has been offered marijuana. 
But 53 percent of the teens said they were offered pot. 
</P>
<P>
	One other finding: It's best for parents to reach their children  
at an early age. Among fourth-graders, 74 percent said they want 
more details from their parents about drugs. Among eighth-graders, 
the figure fell to 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Partnership is a private, nonprofit coalition of  
communications industry professionals, known for its anti-drug 
advertising campaign. This is its 11th annual poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was conducted in 1998 among 2,258 pre-teens, 6,852  
teens and 809 parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The margin of error for the pre-teen's data was plus or minus  
2.8 percentage points; the teens, plus or minus 1.8; for the 
adults, plus or minus 3.9.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Recover From Early Retreat / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices rose late Monday, shaking  
off early losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32  
point, or $4.06 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.57 percent from 5.60 
percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As selling ran out of steam Monday, the market got a lift from  
statements by a maverick leader in Yugoslavia that raised hopes 
NATO's air assaults are succeeding, something that could hold down 
the cost of the campaign and its impact on the U.S. budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's deputy premier, Vuk Draskovic, said Monday that his  
government was prepared to accept a U.N. presence in Kosovo. 
Draskovic also said Yugoslavia cannot defeat NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 1/16 point, and intermediate maturities rose between 1/8 point 
and 1/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.44 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point from Friday to 4.33 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.56 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 
percentage point to 4.40 percent. One-year yields were 4.68 percent 
as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, climbed to 4.88 percent from Friday's 4.56 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 25/32 from 123 15/16. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.26 from 5.25 percent Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants New Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is calling for a three-way  
summit meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders within six 
months of Israel's election and urging both sides to immediately 
implement the land-for-security accord he helped put together, a 
senior administration official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement due to be released later in the day, Clinton  
urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat to adhere to the commitments they made last 
October. These include an Israeli promise to give up more land on 
the West Bank and a Palestinian pledge to root out terrorists in 
areas already under Arafat's control. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, in effect, acknowledges that Israeli and the  
Palestinian Authority will not meet their May 4 deadline for an 
interim settlement on the West Bank and ``final-status'' 
negotiations. Those final issues include Palestinian demands for a 
state and talks on the future of Jerusalem, which Israel insists it 
will never give up as its capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Clinton's intention was to promote the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
process despite the impasse that has developed since his mediation 
between Netanyahu and Arafat at the Wye River retreat on Maryland's 
Eastern Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	After surrendering another 2 percent of the West Bank, Israel  
stopped its backpedaling, insisting that the Palestinian Authority 
had not worked hard enough to deter violence against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has disagreed publicly with Israel,  
saying that while the Palestinians had done fairly well, there was 
an obligation on Israel to pull back as promised from 13.1 percent 
of the West Bank territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has said several times that if he did not gain statehood  
through negotiations, he would declare a state unilaterally after 
May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is urging the Palestinian leader -- and Netanyahu as well  
-- not to prejudge the outcome of talks still to be held, while 
insisting on an Israeli pullback and offering to resume his 
mediator role within six months of Israel's mid-May elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu, who heads the Likud bloc, is being challenged by the  
Labor Party. While most analysts are reluctant to predict the 
outcome, there is a strong possibility of a follow-up runoff 
election between the top two finalists, who are likely to be 
Netanyahu and Labor's Ehud Barak, who takes a softer line toward 
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> RNC Turns Sights to Bill Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee is adjusting  
its presidential election strategy and taking a closer look at 
Democratic candidate Bill Bradley after determining that Al Gore is 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest RNC poll, which is still in the works, includes  
several questions about the former Democratic senator from New 
Jersey. GOP leaders have ordered staff to begin researching the 
political background of Gore's only rival for the Democratic 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are serious about Bradley. We think he has an excellent  
chance of upsetting the vice president,'' said Tom Cole, chief of 
staff to chairman Jim Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that he has a lot of momentum. There are a lot of  
disaffected Democrats who are looking to not make this election 
about Bill Clinton,'' Cole said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign said the RNC's only motive is to create a false  
impression that the vice president is weak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the GOP strategy is as transparent as their lack of  
vision,'' said Gore spokesman Roger Salazar. ``I think it's ironic 
that they're trying to build up our Democratic opponent. It just 
shows our strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls show Gore with a wide lead over Bradley  
among Democratic voters, but the gap is shrinking. Bradley produced 
a strong showing in first-quarter fund raising and has begun to 
distinguish himself from the vice president, particularly involving 
the administration's actions in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore defends President Clinton, Bradley contends the  
administration's objectives in Kosovo are not clear.

	Giving rise to questions about Gore's general election stamina,

<HEADLINE> Internet Provides Bomb Blueprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two things may have made it easy for the  
Columbine High School gunmen to arm themselves for their bloodbath: 
gun shows and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The ingredients used in the explosives were especially easy to  
find: nails, BBs, duct tape, metal pipe, broken glass and 
gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Littleton are investigating whether an  
18-year-old girlfriend of Dylan Klebold bought two of the weapons 
in their arsenal at a gun show. They are also exploring whether 
Eric Harris downloaded bomb-making information from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone with an afternoon to spare and access to a hardware store  
and fireworks can make the kind of bombs assembled by the students 
in Littleton. And with 250 million guns in American homes -- more 
than the number of cars -- a gun is as accessible to high school 
students as a weekend ride, according to gun researchers and bomb 
technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days after the Littleton massacre, police who searched the  
home of three Texas teens accused of plotting a strikingly similar 
attack at their junior high school in Wimberly found gunpowder, 
homemade bombs and bomb-making instructions downloaded from the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're talented on the Net, they could probably find the  
information in an hour or two and take a trip down to the local 
hardware store,'' said Eric Stalnaker, a captain with the Metro 
Arson Strike Team in San Diego, which finds about 30 homemade pipe 
bombs a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if they're cutting open fireworks and taking out the  
powder -- which is a dangerous thing to be doing -- probably in one 
or two days they can have a couple of pipe bombs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris is reported to have described stripping gunpowder from  
firecrackers on a Web page that has since been removed. (One of 
Harris' friends has said the teen-ager worked at a fireworks stand 
and always made sure he was paid in fireworks.) One explosive, 
which never went off, was made from a 20-pound propane tank and an 
egg timer. Nails and BBs were packed in the pipes to maximize the 
shrapnel that would tear into victims with each blast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Littleton killers were hardly pioneers.  
</P>
<P>
	Pipe bombs have been around for decades. When a Baltimore boy  
made a package bomb that blew the arms off a neighbor who had 
accused him of vandalism in 1995, he had simply followed the 
instructions in ``The Anarchist Cookbook,'' according to juvenile 
court files made available by a Baltimore judge on the condition 
that the boy's name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
	The $25 book, first published in 1971, is available at stores  
like The Tattered Cover in downtown Denver and quoted in dozens of 
Internet sites. The enthusiastic 160-page how-to guide includes a 
chapter on bomb-making that notes, ``The formulas and recipes in 
here are real, they can be made by almost anyone and they can be 
performed in the kitchen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most students could find the guns used in Littleton in a day or  
two, said Alan Lizotte, a professor at the State University of New 
York at Albany who has tracked the gun habits of more than 1,000 
Rochester, N.Y.-area youths for 13 years. Once, on a bet, a fellow 
researcher went to Boston Common to see how long it would take to 
find a black-market assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took him about an hour to find someone who wanted to know  
how many M-16 automatics he wanted,'' Lizotte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands have found them. More than 6,000 American students  
were kicked out of school for toting weapons in the 1996-97 
academic year, according to the Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Because no paperwork is required in a private gun sale, a buyer  
can find a private seller at a gun show and exchange cash for a 
weapon without informing anyone. That includes sales of the TEC 
DC-9 the boys used. The gun was made illegal for manufacture in the 
1994 federal assault weapons ban but can still be legally sold. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a lead sponsor of the  
assault weapons ban, cited several Web sites where buyers can make 
similar private sales without the waiting period and background 
check required in a sale by a licensed dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World Wide Web has now become an international, electronic  
gun show,'' Schumer said. ``These are two glaring loopholes that 
allow criminals and kids to get guns. The future of the black 
market in guns is the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 19, 1995, the day of the Oklahoma City bombing, Simon  
Wiesenthal Center found only one Web site it considered a ``hate'' 
site. Today it catalogs 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``The battlefield on hate has forever shifted in America,'' said  
the center's associate dean, Rabbi Abraham Cooper. ``Everything now 
is on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plans Discussion on Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders hope to  
announce plans Tuesday for a ``national dialogue on youth and 
culture'' as a response to last week's shootings in a Colorado high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity,  
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert hope to announce that one or more nationally recognized 
figures would be involved in the effort envisioned as a series of 
events outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	One GOP aide said Republicans hoped to make the point that gun  
control isn't automatically the answer to the shootings that 
stunned the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has already proposed legislation to keep guns  
away from juveniles, and gun-control advocates in Congress have 
renewed their call for mandatory safety devices on firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and their political allies in the National Rifle  
Association historically have opposed such proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the emerging GOP proposal were extremely sketchy,  
including its financing. 
</P>
<P>
	One official said Lott and Hastert envision a series of public  
events where leaders of religious institutions, teachers, parents, 
community leaders, the media, Hollywood could ``inform the nation'' 
about modern culture and its impact on youth. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is expected to be made at a ceremony  
Republicans are holding at a middle school in Alexandria, Va., to 
publicize passage of legislation designed to loosen restrictions on 
education aid to the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors also are expected to attend.  
</P>
<P>
	The GOP approach first began emerging over the weekend, when  
Colorado Gov. Bill Owens delivered the party's response to 
Clinton's regular Saturday radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Events like this one warn us there is a virus loose within our  
culture,'' Owens said. ``Too many of our young people are 
susceptible to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens urged parents to play more active roles in their  
children's lives, particularly to pay more attention to what their 
children may be watching on television, what video games they play, 
what World Wide Web sites they log onto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know if your child has a home page?'' Owens asked. ``Do  
you know what is on your child's home page, or whom they talk with 
on the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
	``If not, please find out.''

<HEADLINE> Rally Recalls Armenian Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 2,000 people rallied in Times Square on  
Sunday to remember the deaths and displacement of an estimated 1.5 
million Armenians by the Ottoman Turks -- 80 years before Yugoslavia 
added the term ``ethnic cleansing'' to the world's lexicon of 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of academics and lawmakers, including Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., demanded that the present-day Turkish government 
abandon what they called a policy of denial that the 1915-23 
diaspora of Turkey's Armenian minority even occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Armenian genocide is the model, the prototype, for the  
genocides of the 20th century,'' said Roger Smith, a college 
professor who heads the Association of Genocide Scholars, a group 
committed to preventing genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith noted that the Holocaust and every other attempt at  
systematic eradication of a people or culture has its individual 
critics and deniers, but the Armenian bloodbath is the only one 
denied by a government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three successive Turkish regimes have denied it from 1915 to  
the present, over 84 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Turkish officials have denied that the Ottoman  
empire killed massive numbers of Armenians 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer said the Turkish government's ``utterly appalling''  
policy of denial offered a guideline to such leaders such as 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, whose armed forces have 
driven hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars from their homes 
despite NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A person answering the phone at the Turkish consulate said  
nobody was available to answer questions.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drugs Hiding, Not Curing HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The AIDS virus might be able to hide undetected  
for 60 years in people taking powerful anti-viral drugs, says a 
study that underlines a major obstacle to the bold notion of curing 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't going to be able to simply wait it out,'' said Dr.  
Robert Siliciano, senior author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drugs can drive the body's supply of HIV down to  
undetectable levels, they can't attack virus that lies quietly in 
cells. Such hidden ``reservoirs'' of HIV have long been recognized, 
and these new calulations confirm the belief that they could harbor 
the virus for a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``this doesn't mean a cure is impossible,'' said  
Siliciano, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of 
Medicine in Baltimore. It means some additional therapy would have 
to be created to eradicate the hidden virus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have already started studying that, as well as the  
alternative idea of leaving reservoirs alone but revving up the 
immune system enough to kill any virus that emerges from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Siliciano also stressed that the finding doesn't mean that  
people who are keeping HIV at bay with current medication will go 
on to develop AIDS. ``As long as they stay on the regimen they may 
do perfectly well for a long period of time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is ``a caution against stopping treatment or thinking  
that having an undetectable plasma virus (in the blood) means 
there's no virus left,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siliciano, with colleagues at Hopkins and elsewhere, describes a  
study of 34 infected adults in the May issue of the journal Nature 
Medicine. All were taking the powerful virus-suppressing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers sampled so-called ``resting'' CD4 T cells from the  
patients' blood and used special detecton techniques to find HIV in 
them. They then estimated how many cells were harboring hidden 
virus at various times over the course of treatment. From that, 
they calculated how long it would take for this reservoir of 
silently infected cells to die off. 
</P>
<P>
	The best estimate was about 60 years. The result wasn't a  
surprise, given the results of earlier research, Siliciano said. 
The period might be shorter in some people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The work ``probably codifies what a lot of us have known for a  
while,'' said Dr. Roger Pomerantz of Thomas Jefferson University in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone thought HAART'' -- the virus-suppressing  
therapy -- ``would eradicate the virus in patients in a short amount 
of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have already started studying how to eradicate hidden  
HIV in reservoirs, which could include cells in several parts of 
the body. It's still not clear what's going on in those hiding 
places. Is the HIV truly not reproducing? Or is it replicating at a 
very low level and infecting new cells to keep the reservoir going 
as old cells die? 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers focusing on the first possibility are looking for  
ways to stimulate the cells that harbor HIV so that they will 
produce virus and then die. The new virus would be attacked by 
anti-viral therapy. Scientists focusing on the second possibility 
believe that more intensive anti-virus therapy might shut down the 
low-level replication.

<HEADLINE> States Compete for Spaceports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEPORT, Texas (AP) -- When Fred Welch surveys 1,000 acres of  
prairie near the Texas coast, he thinks not of the land before him 
but of the stars above. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch has a vision for this stretch of soil about an hour south  
of Houston. He sees a spaceport, with rocketships coming and going 
as easily as 747s at an airport. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a vision shared by Andy Poole in Montana and William  
Dettmer in New Mexico, who both have several thousand of acres 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	They all are competitors in a new space race, where the prize is  
a slice of a multibillion-dollar industry -- launching cargo into 
orbit -- that could provide thousands of jobs and create a new hub 
in the next era of space transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will just be the start of a space enterprise -- a new  
Canaveral, so to speak,'' says Dettmer, chairman of the New Mexico 
Space Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of states are trying to get into the wave of the future.  
If you have it, we believe people will come -- like a field of 
dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spaceports would be home to reusable space vehicles intended to  
launch telecommunications satellites and other freight at a 
fraction of today's cost: $1,000 a pound compared with the current 
$10,000 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called space planes would feature more efficient engines,  
lighter fuel tanks and more durable thermal insulation than today's 
launch vehicles. More importantly, they would have no throwaway 
parts -- saving money and turnaround time. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's space shuttles discard fuel tanks and rocket boosters.  
Every time a shuttle launches, for example, the external fuel tank 
and two solid-fuel rocket boosters are discarded. The boosters are 
recovered and used again, but only after costly refurbishment. 
</P>
<P>
	With an estimated 1,700 satellites being prepared for launch  
over the next decade, at least six private companies are designing 
reusable space planes that they hope will become the transportation 
system of choice in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	If the vehicles work as well as hoped, they could ferry supplies  
to the International Space Station and eventually replace the 
shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to at least start demonstrating technology leading to  
a vehicle that could reduce the cost of getting into space,'' says 
Jim Cast, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the reusable vehicles under development, probably the  
best-known is Lockheed Martin's VentureStar, a wedge-shaped 
spaceship designed to lift more than 50,000 pounds of payload into 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, NASA awarded the company a $900 million contract to  
build a half-scale prototype known as the X-33, scheduled for test 
flights next year. If all goes well, VentureStar could be in 
operation by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 15 states are pitching 31 potential sites for spaceports  
to serve as homes for VentureStar. Besides Texas, Montana and New 
Mexico, they are Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, 
Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin plans to choose two sites late next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever establishes itself as the commercial space  
transportation hub, it's going to be the major place of operations 
for decades to come,'' says Tom Moser, a former NASA executive who 
heads the Texas Aerospace Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	With three Texas sites under consideration, Welch -- who heads an  
economic development group in the Freeport area -- is working with 
Moser and officials from the other sites to obtain $1.3 million 
from the Legislature to help the state compete. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are pushing legislation that would allow a county or  
city to create an economic authority to foster spaceport 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montana, legislators have exempted VentureStar from business  
equipment taxes and provided funds toward spaceport infrastructure, 
says Poole, deputy director of the state Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico has set aside millions of dollars to obtain land and  
conduct environmental studies should it be chosen as a site. 
</P>
<P>
	Several states, including Florida and California, already have  
licensed, commercial spaceports. But because vehicles such as 
VentureStar would have no expendable parts, they don't have to take 
off from coastal launch pads. 
</P>
<P>
	That, says Dettmer, gives inland states with little or no space  
industry presence a chance to break into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move from government space into commercial space, we're  
looking at a whole new paradigm, and I think a lot of states are 
interested in latching onto that,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Texas Tries to Halt Slide Vs. Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers dreamed about this all  
winter: Roger Clemens pitching in Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	They just hoped he'd be pitching for them, not against them.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Yankees pretty much have had their way with us the last  
two, three years,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said as his team 
prepared for Tuesday night's series opener against Clemens and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens showed Texas what it could have had by beating the  
Rangers 4-2 last Thursday, tying an AL record with his 17th 
consecutive victory. His first chance to set the mark comes against 
Aaron Sele, Texas' most consistent starter thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens (2-0, 4.07 ERA) hasn't been his usual, dominating self  
this year, but expect his emotions to be high against the Rangers, 
fueled by likely boos from fans feeling jilted after he said he 
wanted to be traded to a Texas team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees swept the Rangers from the playoffs last year, then  
won their first two games of this year at Yankee Stadium last week. 
That's why Oates views this week's three-game series as more 
important than most April matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a do-or-die situation, but I think it's important  
that we beat the Yankees,'' Oates said. ``I think it's important to 
our ballclub because, No. 1, we need to let the Yankees know we can 
beat them, and, No. 2, we need to let our club know we can beat 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York has beaten Texas in 13 of their last 16 games and 23 of  
the last 31 -- a .742 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sele (3-1, 3.22) lost his only regular-season start to New York  
last year and also lost the third and final playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez pitches for New York against Mark Clark on  
Wednesday night, and the Yankees' Ramiro Mendoza faces Mike Morgan 
on Thursday. Andy Pettitte was to have started Thursday but didn't 
bounce back well after throwing 108 pitches Saturday against 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Since losing two in New York, the Rangers have won their last  
four. The Yankees gave won five straight and moved past Toronto 
into the AL East lead.

<HEADLINE> Palladium Falls Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Palladium futures fell sharply Monday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid expectations Russia soon will begin large-scale 
shipments to Western manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, crude, corn and soybean futures also  
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium tumbled a third consecutive session amid  
still-unconfirmed reports Russia, the world's largest supplier of 
the industrial metal, will begin shipping new inventories after a 
four-month delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium is used in catalysts to provide cleaner-burning cars  
and in electronic devices such as cellular phones. Russia supplies 
more than three-fourths of the world's needs, but for three years 
running has virtually halted all shipments because of bureaucratic 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	After jumping more than 30 percent on the delays, futures prices  
have been under pressure amid concern manufacturers wearying of the 
problem are actively seeking alternatives to the metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for June delivery fell $6.20 to $349.75 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude continued its retreat on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
as investors took profits from sharp recent gains that pushed 
prices above $18 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculators have driven prices sharply higher, betting that  
world oil producers mean it this time when they say they are 
serious about sharply reducing daily output. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other  
key producers have agreed to slash 2.1 million barrels, or 2.7 
percent of daily supply, from output. That agreement went into 
effect on April 1, but independent confirmation that the cuts are 
being made will not be available for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have been skeptical that top producers will meet  
their goals anytime soon, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures, meanwhile, jumped to their highest in 22  
months amid concern about the slow pace of rebuilding winter 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	June crude fell 28 cents to $17.66 a barrel; May heating oil  
fell .68 cent to 42.74 cents a gallon; May unleaded gasoline fell 
.33 cent to 52.39 cents a gallon; May natural gas rose 7.3 cents to 
$2.299 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade  
amid a return of drier weather in the Midwest following nearly a 
week of rain. The dry conditions should allow farmers to return to 
their fieldwork by midweek, while the moisture should help early 
plantings, agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reported after trading had ended  
that plantings were 10 percent completed as of Friday, below the 
five-year average of 15 percent. But analysts say a few days of dry 
weather will allow farmers to quickly catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also were pressured by reports China had made a large sale  
of competing corn to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	July corn fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.21 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans fell 4  
cents to $4.90 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Studio OKs Advance Ticket Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Force has returned -- to the scalpers.  
</P>
<P>
	Bowing to pressure from movie theater owners, 20th Century Fox  
has backed away from its absolute ban on the selling of advance 
tickets to the ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit of compromise for us, but the theaters have  
invested a lot of equipment and money into providing the advance 
ticket service to their customers,'' Fox spokesman Tom Sherak said. 
``They really wanted this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox and LucasFilm Ltd. originally banned advance ticket sales to  
stave off scalpers who they feared would hog all the seats, Sherak 
said. They lifted the ban on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	While theaters are restricted from selling more than 12 advance  
tickets for each person, there are now no formal ways to stop 
scalpers from snagging multiple tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theater owners promised sellers would watch so that some  
guy doesn't buy tickets and then get right back in line,'' Sherak 
said. ``But if somebody wants to do it bad enough, they will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tickets will become available on May 12 at 3:00 p.m. EDT at  
theater and ticket outlets in North America that offer the advance 
sales service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opens on May 19.  
Some ``Star Wars'' fans have already begun camping in front of 
theaters in anticipation of the movie.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Promises Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boeing Co. executives on Monday promised to  
deliver higher profits and stock value to shareholders despite the 
continued challenge from European rival Airbus Industrie, Boeing's 
chief competitor in the commercial aircraft business. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Condit, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Seattle-based Boeing, told shareholders the company is solving 
problems that led to losses in 1997 and depressed earnings in 1998. 
He touted profits that rose to $469 million in the first quarter of 
1999, compared to $50 million during the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a very challenging one and an experience I never  
intend to repeat,'' Condit said. ``... I believe we have turned the 
corner. This is a team that knows what success looks like. We are 
going to win. Watch us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has made significant changes to boost profit margins  
during the past year, although big challenges still remain, said 
Paul Nisbet, an aerospace industry analyst with JSA Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of hurdles here for Boeing to jump,'' he said.  
``The biggest one is probably getting back on track so that their 
costs and pricing of future aircraft are such that they can get 
back into the double-digit margins that they're looking for. That 
probably will take two to four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The generally upbeat meeting opened a few hours after Airbus  
Industrie announced in Paris that it plans to build the A318, a 
107-seat passenger jet that competes with Boeing's 717. Boeing has 
about 115 orders for the 717, but has failed to crack the regional 
airline market for which the plane is intended. Airbus said it has 
109 firm orders for the A318. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference that followed the shareholders meeting,  
Condit said the 717 is a better plane. He acknowledged that Boeing 
still is evaluating whether to continue the jet, which was 
developed by McDonnell Douglas before Boeing purchased the company 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It is among a number of programs Boeing is reviewing under a  
companywide effort to eliminate all but the most profitable 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big question as they go through the valuation of  
their various programs, whether the 717 will survive,'' Nisbet 
said. ``The key to that program succeeding is being able to sell 
that aircraft to the regional airlines, which they haven't been 
able to do yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condit suggested it was unlikely Boeing would compete with  
Airbus to build superjumbo aircraft capable of seating as many as 
600 passengers. Airbus has said it is considering such a project, 
although no final decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think there is a market to support development of a  
very large airplane,'' Condit said.

<HEADLINE> Blues Revue Teaches History Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They are birthing the blues at the Vivian  
Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center these days, teaching a musical 
history lesson that is chock full of emotion and remarkably free of 
dry and dusty facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues,'' which opened Monday, spans  
more than 250 years of joy and sorrow, pain and pleasure. The 
evening, which arrived in New York after regional theater 
productions in Alabama, Colorado and New Jersey, is a spirited 
musical revue, modest in its production values, but lavish in the 
talent it presents. 
</P>
<P>
	We know the songs are good -- even before the show starts. Many  
are classic numbers, ranging from ``St. Louis Blues'' to ``I Can't 
Stop Lovin' You.'' What makes the production soar is its cast, 
seven terrific performers -- four men and three women -- who know how 
to sell what they are singing. 
</P>
<P>
	From the despair of African slave trade to modern-day urban  
jazz, the music gets quite a workout from these artists. Leading 
the parade is Ron Taylor, one of a half-dozen creators of the show. 
Taylor is a large man, with an even larger voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor knows how to inhabit a song and seduce an audience,  
particularly with a mysterious, voodoo-flavored number called ``I'm 
Your Hoochie Coochie Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blues often is an unusual mixture of the sacred and the profane.  
Both are well-represented here. Eloise Laws gets the lion's share 
of the sexy songs, strutting her way through ``My Man Rocks Me'' 
and ``Someone Else Is Steppin' In.'' The woman can also handle the 
darker side of love with a mesmerizing ``I Put a Spell on You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretha Boston, who scored several seasons back as Queenie in the  
Broadway revival of ``Show Boat,'' delivers several extraordinary 
musical moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among these is her heart-stopping rendition of a Billie  
Holiday classic ``Strange Fruit'' from 1939. Its description of a 
lynching still chills. So does Boston's smoky version of ``St. 
Louis Blues,'' which, despite the song's familiarity, makes the 
hurt sound brand new. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the woman can switch gears quickly, getting spiritual  
in ``I Know I've Been Changed'' or sultry in ``Please Don't Stop 
Him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The definition of blues gets stretched a bit in this show, to  
include such country and western giants as Jimmie Rogers, Hank 
Williams and Patsy Cline, who fell under its influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter Calvert, a cool blonde, does an astonishing imitation of  
Cline, singing ``Walking After Midnight.'' And Dan Wheetman, 
another of the show's authors, twangs and strums through a Hank 
Williams favorite, ``Mind Your Own Business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is minimal dancing, although Donald McKayle is credited  
with the show's ``movement.'' When cast members are not performing, 
they sit quietly on wood chairs in front of a small combo. Still 
Gregory Porter swivels and slides effectively in the raunchy 
``Crawlin' King Snake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mississippi'' Charles Bevel completes the cast. Bevel, who  
also helped put the revue together, champions the Delta blues with 
a growling, raspy voice worthy of Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues'' demonstrates  
there are many kinds of blues, and this entertainment celebrates 
them all with style and sass.

<HEADLINE> Lott Says Social Security Bill Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore says he believes  
Congress and the Clinton administration can still agree on Social 
Security reforms this year, despite a weekend prediction by Senate 
Majority Leader Trent that it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Social Security reform absolutely can be done this  
year -- if Republican leaders make a clear decision to put Social 
Security first,'' Gore said in a speech to the Communications 
Workers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge the Republican leadership to send not mixed signals,  
but one clear signal: that they will work across party lines, in 
good faith, until America's retirement program is strong for our 
future,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week'' that the White House has  
failed to get serious about Social Security, preventing Congress 
from acting on reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House fired back that it's Lott and other Republicans  
who haven't gotten serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have made shoring up Social  
Security a primary goal of the 106th Congress, mindful that the 
national pension system is expected to hit financial turmoil once 
baby boomers begin retiring in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again,'' Lott said Sunday, ``we need some leadership from  
the president. He backed away from real reform of Medicare. He's 
really proposed nothing on Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically if Social Security is dead, the Mississippi  
Republican said: ``I don't see it happening this year, because I 
don't believe the president will really honestly address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said it's the  
Republicans who are stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	``If instead of looking for the opportunity to declare Social  
Security (reform) dead, the Republican leadership were putting 
forth some of their own specific ideas for finding common ground, 
the prospects could still be good for this year,'' Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate majority leader, while criticizing the president's  
plans, has offered no specific measures of his own,'' he added, 
echoing President Clinton's comments last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Lott also predicted Congress will tap Social  
Security's surplus for as much as $6 billion more than the $6.05 
billion Clinton requested to pay for the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
The additional money will be for other military needs, which Lott 
says are direly needed. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders spread word last week among GOP members  
in the House that trying to overhaul Social Security before the 
2000 election campaign could involve too much political risk 
without strong Democratic involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union speech in January, Clinton proposed  
setting aside most of the Social Security surplus to keep the 
system solvent when baby boomers begin retiring in a few years. The 
plan would invest some of the money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's expected federal surplus is $110 billion, all from  
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said it is clear Social Security surpluses should be held  
in safekeeping for the nation's retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put it in a lock-box. Have a procedure where it can't be just  
used for every spending program -- or for that matter tax cuts -- 
that comes along,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said dipping into the surplus for the campaign in Yugoslavia  
is required because Clinton requested the money on an emergency 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an emergency, if it is approved, that means it doesn't have  
to be offset by cutting other programs or other spending. It comes 
out of the surplus net,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only surplus we have is Social Security. But that's what  
the president has asked for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans understand that a military emergency would  
require using the surplus, ``but I think we need to understand ... 
it's really coming from Social Security, which we need to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's request was solely for money to cover the cost of the  
Kosovo conflict. Republicans have demanded add-ons to alleviate 
what they consider Clinton administration slights to the military. 
Some lawmakers have suggested raising the total to $18 billion to 
$20 billion, or even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should take this opportunity to look at  
adding every military need might have been aware of,'' Lott said on 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``I personally think it should include a pay  
raise'' and other things that would push the cost ``probably 
somewhere in the range of'' $10 billion to $12 billion. Lott 
previously advocated a bill of less than $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Jumps 61.44; Dow Up 28.92 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Renewed strength in technology shares took the  
Nasdaq composite index easily into record territory Monday, 
extending a hearty rebound from last Monday's 5.6 percent plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks also rose, with the Dow industrials moving  
within 9 points of a new high and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock 
setting a record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted in technology  
shares, rose 61.36 to 2,652.05, its first close above 2,600 as it 
cruised past its previous high of 2,598.81, set April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 28.92 to 10,718.59  
after wobbling no more than 40 points up or down throughout the 
day. The Dow ended Friday's session down 37 points at 10,689.67 but 
it set two records last week, the latest one on Thursday at 
10,727.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index added 3.19 at 1,360.04, topping  
Thursday's high of 1,358.82. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare departure from the normal scramble on Wall Street,  
trading was halted for one minute of silence at noon on the New 
York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market 
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange in memory of the Colorado high 
school shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were back in the limelight, as investors  
digested encouraging personal-computer sales data ahead of some key 
earnings reports in the computer sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Market research firms International Data Corp. found that  
worldwide PC shipments rose 19 percent in the first three months of 
the year, while Gartner Group Inc.'s Dataquest unit reported an 
increase of 17 percent. The reports, along with expectations that 
important Internet companies would report strong earnings, prompted 
aggressive buying of computer-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speculation in technology stocks continues to be the  
dominant theme,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ``It goes away for a while, 
but then it comes right back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which rose sharply last Friday on a strong earnings report,  
advanced an additional 10 1/8 to 209 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of eBay climbed 8 7/8 to 209 on anticipation that the online  
auction company would report strong earnings. In addition, eBay 
reached agreement to acquire auction house Butterfield &AMP; 
Butterfield in a deal valued at $260 million. After the close of 
trading Monday, eBay reported first-quarter operating earnings of 5 
cents a share, beating analysts' estimates of 2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though investors were back buying technology, they did  
not completely abandon the shares of economically sensitive 
companies that had their day in the sun earlier this month. These 
cyclical shares had been briefly popular because they were viewed 
as a bargain by investors who have faith that the world economy is 
improving, a belief that remains strong on Wall Street, and that 
perception hasn't changed, said Tony Dwyer, chief equity strategist 
at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. ``The same fundamentals that have taken 
us higher for four years are still intact,'' Dwyer said, such as 
low interest rates and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 30 Dow components, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing  
added 1 1/16 to 81 7/8, and Caterpillar advanced 1 7/16 to 62. But 
Union Carbide shares slid 3 1/2 to 48 1/4, after the chemical company 
said it wasn't sure how second-quarter earnings would turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumer stocks were also higher. Dow components Procter &AMP;  
Gamble rose 4 5/16 to 94 13/16, but McDonald's fell 11/16 to 43 
7/16. Drug stocks fell, with Merck losing nearly 1 3/4 to 74. Merck 
reported strong first-quarter earnings but they were tied mostly to 
benefits from its restructuring with Astra AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks fell in response to early weakness in  
bond prices, which later recovered. Citigroup shares shed 1 1/16 to 
73 13/16. Oil stocks slid as oil prices backed off, with Dow 
component Exxon losing 5/8 to 77 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a thin 7-to-6 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 
885.43 million shares, off from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.47 to 638.83, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.24 to 771.60, surpassing 
Friday's record. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 
3.24 to 434.97. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo ended a mixed day  
down 0.03 percent. European indexes rose ahead of this week's 
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 
Seven leading industrial nations in Washington. In Frankfurt, 
Germany, the DAX index rose 1.17 percent, the FT-SE in London rose 
1.18 percent, and the CAC in Paris rose 0.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sale Agreement Is Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins have another sale  
agreement for $800 million, meaning coach Norv Turner and general 
manager Charley Casserly will keep their jobs if the deal goes 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective buyer Daniel Snyder, a communications executive, and  
trustees of Jack Kent Cooke's estate announced an agreement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which must be approved by NFL owners, includes Jack  
Kent Cooke Stadium and the $800 million would be a record price a 
North American sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said he will retain Turner and Casserly for the 1999  
season. He also sent a letter to employees at Redskin Park, 
notifying them that all their jobs are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football will be a new business for me,'' Snyder said. ``And I  
am going to need experienced football personnel to run the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a partner with Howard Milstein in an $800 million bid  
that was withdrawn this month when it was apparent it would not be 
approved by NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Snyder heads the group by himself. His minority  
partners include family members, publishing executive Mort 
Zuckerman and Zuckerman's longtime business associate, Fred 
Drasner. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, 34, stands to become the league's youngest current  
owner. The $800 million purchase price would shatter the $530 
million paid by Alfred Lerner last year for the expansion Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's bid will be examined by the NFL's finance committee and  
most likely will be submitted before league owners at their May 
25-26 meetings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based of our own review ... and our discussions with the  
league office, we believe the financing and ownership structure 
will comply with NFL rules,'' the trustees said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the sweeping changes expected at Redskin Park had the  
Milstein-Snyder bid prevailed, Snyder is keeping everyone for now. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Snyder, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
told The Associated Press that Snyder will not clean house in part 
because the draft has already taken place, spring practices have 
begun and it would maintain continuity to keep Turner and Casserly 
at least one more year. The Redskins haven't made the playoffs 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the commitment to retain Turner and Casserly is expected  
to gain favor with some NFL owners as when they prepare to vote on 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder had strongly hinted at changes when he was partnered with  
Milstein, expressing his desire to win and following it with 
comments such as ``We've got to get the right people.'' Vinny 
Cerrato, former director of player personnel with San Francisco, 
was even hired to prepare for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milstein pulled out of the process at a league meeting on  
April 7 when it became obvious that he did not have the 24 of 31 
owners' votes needed for approval. Some owners said Milstein was 
borrowing too much money to finance his part of the bid, and others 
were concerned that he would be confrontational owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's new group has more ready cash behind it -- more than  
$100 million. The trustees, hoping avoid the errors that doomed the 
Milstein bid, have worked closely with the league and met with 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue to ensure that, this time, they are 
submitting an offer that has a good chance of approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke, who became the Redskins majority owner in 1974, died  
April 6, 1997. Rather than leave the team to his son John, he 
instructed that the team and stadium be sold and the money used to 
establish a scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kent Cooke made several bids for the a team, but was among  
many contenders that lost an extensive round of bidding to the 
Milstein-Snyder group in January. Cooke made a new offer this month 
after Milstein withdrew, but withdrew it last week when it because 
apparent that the trustees were negotiating only with Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder is chief executive of Snyder Communications in Bethesda,  
Md., a marketing firm that employs 8,000 people in 80 locations in 
12 countries. It is particularly big in pharmaceutical and 
long-distance telephone marketing.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Discuss WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Senior U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators  
discussed differences over China's bid to enter the World Trade 
Organization in an unexpected meeting Monday, state media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy U.S. trade representative, Robert Cassidy, had been  
scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday. The delay of his 
departure underscored the importance that both sides have placed on 
reaching a market-opening agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy and three other U.S. negotiators met Monday afternoon  
with China's top WTO negotiator, Long Yongtu, at the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, Long described the talks as ``constructive''  
and ``beneficial to both sides,'' the agency said. He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have held talks in Beijing since Thursday to wrap  
up an agreement based on the market-opening offer made by Premier 
Zhu Rongji during his visit to Washington two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton rejected it as insufficient but agreed with  
Zhu to try to conclude negotiations by June. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Chinese negotiators have discussed opening China's  
financial, insurance and service industries to foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the sweeping concessions made by Zhu reflect China's  
eagerness to use membership to the WTO to secure access to key 
export markets like the United States and to regain the confidence 
of foreign banks and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Long also opened talks Monday morning with a team of negotiators  
from the European Union to try to secure European backing for 
China's entry into the world trade body, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing and Washington have been engaged in on-again, off-again  
talks over China's entry into WTO and its predecessor since 1986.

<HEADLINE>  India To Hold Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India will hold its third national  
elections in three years after opposition parties failed to cobble 
together a coalition to replace the collapsed Hindu nationalist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	President K. R. Narayanan today dissolved the lower house of  
parliament so new elections in the world's largest democracy can be 
called. No date was immediately announced for elections, which must 
be held within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time had arrived for the democratic will of the people to  
be ascertained once again so that a government can be formed,'' the 
president said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after more than a week of political  
turmoil, which began when a coalition led by Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee was defeated April 17 by one vote in a 
parliamentary confidence ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Gandhi's Congress party, India's second largest, tried to  
persuade parliament's many opposition parties to back it in a new 
government. But, unable to gain support for a joint government led 
by Congress, Mrs. Gandhi told Narayanan, the ceremonial head of 
state, that she was giving up Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a last-minute meeting with the president, Vajpayee was  
unable to put together a replacement coalition comprising more than 
half the 543 legislators in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial markets dipped nervously today, as industry and  
business braced itself for the coming volatile months of 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bombay Stock Exchange index fell nearly 5 percent and the  
National Stock Exchange, the country's largest, fell just over 5 
percent at closing. But analysts were saying that in the long run, 
if an election produced a more stable government, the economy would 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Indians wanted to avoid another election. The last one,  
only 13 months ago, cost at least $189 million. But with 45 parties 
in parliament, many with clashing political interests and 
personalities, a stable government appeared beyond any group's 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party believe they will  
benefit from voter sympathy arising from the manner in which the 
government was ousted. ``We hope the people of India will punish 
them for this,'' Information Minister Pramod Mahajan said. ``This 
is against the wishes of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two weeks, the BJP has accused the opposition of  
destabilizing the country in their greed for power. Accusations 
appeared to stick as Indians saw small groups in parliament 
furiously bargaining for power and the Congress party refusing 
their demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress party would like elections to be delayed until  
sympathy for the BJP wanes, the Indian Express newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Political reasons apart, most Indians would prefer elections to  
be delayed until the worst of summer heat is over. Already, 43 
people have died in a heat wave as temperatures have soared to 110 
degrees.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans New Gun-Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One week after the Colorado shootings,  
President Clinton will propose legislation Tuesday that would 
require background checks on sales of explosives and hold parents 
liable when their children commit crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is counting on outrage over the shootings to help push  
the bill through Congress. ``The prospects are good,'' White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said Monday. ``Unfortunately, 
oftentimes it takes tragic events to catalyze work here in 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president planned a White House ceremony to announce his new  
omnibus anticrime package. It will contain the restriction on 
explosives sales as well as measures that died in the last 
Congress, according to sources familiar with the proposals, 
speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials were still working on the explosives  
provision, which would aim to treat their sale the same way gun 
sales are treated under the Brady law, congressional sources said. 
It was unclear how ``explosives'' would be defined. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Colo., the killers had homemade hand grenades and  
pipe bombs as well as guns. In Oklahoma City, two tons of explosive 
fertilizer were used to blow up the federal building. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., applauded Clinton's initiative at  
cracking down on explosives but wondered if it was a problem too 
loosely defined to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're talking about propane gas tanks and agricultural  
chemicals, I'm anxious to see how they define the component parts 
of this,'' Durbin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is proposing:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory child-safety locks on all guns sold.  
</P>
<P>
	--All gun-show sales be subject to background checks on buyers.  
</P>
<P>
	--A lifetime ban on gun ownership for people who commit violent  
crimes as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	--A three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases. Up to  
last year, the Brady Act provided five days for police to conduct 
background checks on buyers if they needed that much time. Now, it 
provides up to three days, but most checks are instantaneous. There 
never has been a minimum, mandatory waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	--Criminal liability and a $10,000 fine for adults, including  
parents, who allow children access to guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult could be held liable whenever a juvenile crime is  
committed and the adult ``knowingly or recklessly allowed it to 
occur,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. He added that the 
legislation's standard of reckless conduct would be ``a difficult 
standard to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised this liability issue long before the Colorado  
shootings and it is not now meant to suggest that those parents 
should be blamed, said Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, announcing the general proposal though not the details  
on Monday, criticized the National Rifle Association for fighting 
Clinton on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a consensus in this country that we need to  
do more; the president will propose to do more and it is time for 
the NRA to get out of the past and get on the right side of this 
issue,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA spokesman Jim Manown replied: ``It's inappropriate for us to  
engage in a political debate at this moment.'' He said NRA 
officials would address the issue at their trimmed-down annual 
conference in Denver this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, championed a  
more limited liability than Clinton is proposing. The limited 
version -- for situations where a gun owner shows negligence by not 
safely storing firearms -- gained just 31 votes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Durbin said, ``with presidential leadership and  
public support, I think this Littleton, Colo., tragedy can 
galvanize the majority we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, who represents South  
Dakota, where guns are popular among ranchers and sportsmen, was 
skeptical about passing any new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that gun legislation is what we need,'' Daschle  
told reporters. He suggested the school shootings were more of a 
societal problem stemming from adults' neglect and violence in the 
media and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the kinds of things we better be looking at,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Molchan, director of the National Association of  
Federally Licensed Gun Dealers, said the 7,000 gun dealers he 
represents support a lifetime ban on gun ownership for anyone who 
commits a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Clinton's package, Molchan said, ``is an  
unfortunate diversion and, in our view, a dangerous diversion that 
takes energy, time and thought away from the real issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody doesn't decide to walk into a school and murder  
several people because of lack of a gun lock or something,'' he 
said. ``It's a horrible, profound, moral issue.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,  
with the key index in Hong Kong rising to an 18-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 221.72 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 
13,127.02, its highest close since Oct. 17, 1997, when the index 
stood at 13,601,01. On Friday, the index had slipped 28.24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnover fell to 8.21 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $1.05  
billion), down from Friday's 14.71 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
$1.88 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers attributed the rise to continued bullish sentiment about  
the Hong Kong market, which has risen sharply in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the index rose more than 260 points at one point  
before giving up some of its gains on profit-taking, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares surged on rumors that the country would be  
reinstated into the widely-tracked Morgan Stanley Capital 
International Indexes as early as next month, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Morgan Stanley were't immediately available for  
comment, but the rumors triggered foreign buying of blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index soared 4.2  
percent, or 26.98 points, to close at 673.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Tokyo closed mixed after a two-day rally.  
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.74 points,  
or 0.03 percent, to close at 16,918.51. Before Monday's close, the 
Nikkei had gained some 428 points in the previous two trading days, 
including Friday's 257.37-point, or 1.54 percent, gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes that the Japanese government will come up with more  
measures to boost the weak economy pushed the Nikkei to as high as 
17,143.49 points at one point earlier in the day. It was the first 
time since April 9 that the Nikkei moved above the 17,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders expect finance ministers and central bankers of the  
Group of Seven industrialized nations to pressure Japan to work 
harder to get its economy back on track at their meeting in 
Washington later Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.86 yen in late  
afternoon, down 0.72 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below 
its late New York level of 119.41 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed sharply higher as foreign  
investors continued to buy banking and finance stocks. The Stock 
Exchange of Thailand index rose 14.61, or 3.6 percent, to 415.68. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher as increasing market liquidity  
amid lower local interest rates continued to drive the market 
higher. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 25.31 points, or 
3.4 percent, to 776.30, its highest level since July 5, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed marginally higher,  
making for the third record high close by the key index in three 
sessions. The All Ordinaries Index rose 8.0 points, or 0.3 percent, 
to 3,129.7. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed slightly higher after trading in  
a narrow range for most of the day. The Straits Times Index rose 
4.34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,869.92. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on bargain-hunting. The  
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 16.29 points, or 0.2 
percent, to 7,629.09. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 5.21 points, or 0.23 percent, 
to 2,236.51. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher. The 30-company  
Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 11.00 points, or 0.46 percent, 
to 2,395.47. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Injury Woes Plague Cavs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Shawn Kemp, Cleveland's leading scorer and  
rebounder, will not travel with the Cavaliers for two road games 
this week because of a sprained left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp, averaging 20.5 points and 9.2 rebounds this season, was  
listed as doubtful for Monday night's game against the Miami Heat. 
But just before the Cavs took the floor for pregame warmups, a team 
spokesman said Kemp would not play and will be staying behind when 
the team goes to Philadelphia and Washington this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp injured his foot last week in a game against the Heat. He  
has also been treated with intravenous antibiotics for an inflamed 
bursar sac in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The news seems to be getting worse for the Cavs by the day as  
they limp down the playoff stretch. On Monday, the club placed 
guard Brevin Knight on the injured list with a fractured hand and 
activated guard Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland entered Monday night 1 1/2 games out of the eighth and  
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with seven games 
remaining. The Cavs will be without Knight, their starting point 
guard, for the rest of the season after he injured his hand Friday 
night in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight underwent surgery on Saturday and had two screws inserted  
in his hand. In his second season, Knight was averaging 9.6 points 
and 7.7 assists for the Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was placed on the injured list on April 14 with a  
bruised right knee. He is averaging 10.2 points and 3.5 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Key injuries have plagued the Cavs since early in the season.  
Starting center Zydrunas Ilgauskas was lost for the year after the 
fifth game with a fractured left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's starting lineup Monday night consisted of Wesley  
Person, Bob Sura, Danny Ferry, Cedric Henderson and Andrew 
DeClercq.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Honors Late Lord Killanin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee led  
tributes today for Lord Killanin, who headed the organization 
during a turbulent period that included the 1976 and 1980 Olympic 
boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin, who had been ill for a long time, died Sunday at his  
home in Dublin. The cause of death was not announced. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was elected the sixth president of the IOC in 1972 at  
age 50, taking over from Avery Brundage just after the massacre of 
Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Munich massacre was followed in 1976 by the African boycott  
of the debt-ridden Montreal Olympics. And in 1980 the Americans led 
a boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion 
of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	When Killanin stepped down as IOC president in 1980, the IOC was  
on the verge of bankruptcy and the Olympics were threatened with 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, his successor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, has turned  
the Olympics into a multibillion dollar industry, which is 
currently suffering its worst corruption crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is grateful to president Killanin for leading the  
Olympic movement through the difficult period of political turmoil 
in the 1970s,'' Samaranch said in a statement today from IOC 
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. ``His presidency was 
decisive for the survival of the Olympic ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch joined IOC staff in observing a minute's silence for  
Killanin, and the Olypmic flag was flown at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC statement noted that Killanin had played a moderating  
role in disputes between China and Taiwan, and succeeded in 
bringing China back into the Olympic fold. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Killanin always  
represented Ireland at home and abroad with style, distinction and 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a charismatic and dynamic individual who was passionate  
about every task he took on,'' Ahern said. ``We are deeply indebted 
to him and his family for his long years of public service to Irish 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his eight-year tenure, Killanin was known for  
democratizing the IOC, bringing in younger blood and breaking with 
the tradition of appointing only older aristocrats. He also 
expanded the membership from 71 to 89 members. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the key reforms under his presidency was the relaxation  
of the rule on amateurism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe in professional Olympics, I do not believe in  
open Olympics, but I think we have to recognize we are about to 
enter the last quarter of the 20th century,'' Killanin said shortly 
after his election. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first sign that reforms in eligibility rules, which  
Brundage had fought so vigorously, would be introduced. And in 
1974, the word amateur was removed from the Olympic Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be remembered as a genial reformer who spread goodwill  
and laughter and quietly discarded the worn-out ideas of a past 
age,'' said author Geoffrey Miller in his 1979 book, ``Behind the 
Olympic Rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was appointed to the IOC in 1952 and moved up the  
hierarchy to eventually become senior vice president. He accepted 
the IOC presidency only on condition that his expenses were paid, 
which was a break in the tradition of the presidency being only the 
preserve of rich men. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin represented a stark contrast in personality and  
leadership style from Brundage, who was widely regarded as an 
autocrat during his 20-year tenure 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was credited with a more consultative style. He was  
known for his discretion and diplomacy. He avoided controversial 
statements and sought to divert attention from himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was born Michael Morris in London on July 30, 1914. His  
mother was Australian and his father was an officer in the Irish 
Guards. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeded to his title in 1927 when his uncle died. He was  
the third holder of the peerage which Queen Victoria bestowed on 
his grandfather, who was chief justice of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was educated at Eton College, the Sorbonne in Paris and  
at Cambridge University before embarking on a career in journalism 
in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked at the Daily Express and was a war correspondent in  
China in 1937 for the Daily Mail and was a D-Day veteran. After the 
war, he wrote a political column. He later became a film producer, 
making such movies as ``The Playboy of the Western World'' and 
``The Quiet Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was also an author and art critic.  
</P>
<P>
	Irish Sports Minister John McDaid said Killanin's ``status and  
the worldwide esteem in which he was held in Olympic circles was a 
source of pride for all Irish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pipe-smoking peer was himself a keen sportsman. He rowed,  
boxed and played rugby at school before moving on to favor horse 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Honors Late Lord Killanin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee led  
tributes today for Lord Killanin, who headed the organization 
during a turbulent period that included the 1976 and 1980 Olympic 
boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin, who had been ill for a long time, died Sunday at his  
home in Dublin. The cause of death was not announced. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was elected the sixth president of the IOC in 1972 at  
age 50, taking over from Avery Brundage just after the massacre of 
Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Munich massacre was followed in 1976 by the African boycott  
of the debt-ridden Montreal Olympics. And in 1980 the Americans led 
a boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion 
of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	When Killanin stepped down as IOC president in 1980, the IOC was  
on the verge of bankruptcy and the Olympics were threatened with 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, his successor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, has turned  
the Olympics into a multibillion dollar industry, which is 
currently suffering its worst corruption crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is grateful to president Killanin for leading the  
Olympic movement through the difficult period of political turmoil 
in the 1970s,'' Samaranch said in a statement today from IOC 
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. ``His presidency was 
decisive for the survival of the Olympic ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch joined IOC staff in observing a minute's silence for  
Killanin, and the Olypmic flag was flown at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC statement noted that Killanin had played a moderating  
role in disputes between China and Taiwan, and succeeded in 
bringing China back into the Olympic fold.

<HEADLINE> Critics Seek To Cancel Manson Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Critics of shock rocker Marilyn Manson want  
his next show canceled in light of what they say may have been his 
appeal to the students who opened fire at a Littleton, Colo., high 
school last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manson's message, which targets youth, is one of destruction,  
hopelessness and violence,'' said Tom Prichard, president of the 
Minnesota Family Council. ``It preys on vulnerable youth and may be 
just what causes some to take action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton said Monday her office  
had received hundreds of calls to protest the show, which was 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are opposed to Marilyn Manson, assume your parental  
responsibility and don't let your child attend the concert,'' she 
said. ``An empty house ... is the best way to discourage future 
concerts of this genre in our community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson had been scheduled to headline a show in Denver on  
Friday, but the event was canceled by the sponsor, a radio station.

<HEADLINE> Breaking-News Guidelines Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Local broadcasters are being urged to decide now  
how they would cover the next breaking story like the Colorado 
massacre, and to consider staying off the air to avoid endangering 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	News directors and general managers at more than 1,800 TV and  
radio stations will receive guidelines this week on how to handle 
these news emergencies from the Radio and Television News Directors 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group hopes station operators develop plans or at  
least talk about what they would do if thrust into the national 
spotlight like Denver broadcasters were last week when two gunmen 
killed 13 people and themselves at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't plan for everything,'' said Barbara Cochran, RTNDA  
president. ``You couldn't plan for a situation where kids hiding in 
a school would have cell phones. What you can do is have a dialogue 
in the newsrooms ahead of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's KUSA-TV was criticized for broadcasting a cell phone  
conversation with a Columbine student before the massacre had 
ended. Critics said the student's life could have been endangered 
if a gunman had heard where he was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters should always assume that a hostage taker or  
terrorist has access to their reporting, the suggested guidelines 
say. And stations should not divulge police tactics or SWAT team 
locations and fight any urge to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	News directors should ask themselves if the value of a live  
report on a hostage-taking situation ``is really justifiable 
compared to the harm that could occur,'' the guidelines say. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Boston-area TV stations have agreed to voluntary rules for  
covering such situations, including no live footage of victims or 
SWAT teams. In several communities, like Portland, Ore., and Tampa, 
Fla., broadcasters have self-regulated the use of news helicopters 
after negotiations with local police forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The RTNDA guidelines also call on stations to show care in  
interviewing family members of victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Make sure the interviews legitimately advance the story and are  
``not simply conducted for the shock value of the emotions 
conveyed,'' they suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps learning from past disasters, TV networks appeared in  
Colorado to seek out for interviews people who really wanted to 
talk, said Av Westin, a former ABC executive and now a Freedom 
Forum fellow at the Media Studies Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Westin is working with networks and local broadcasters to  
develop a ``fairness handbook'' for television journalists. Due by 
the end of this year, the handbook will deal with live coverage of 
events and questions surrounding hidden cameras, sourcing and other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's necessary to help regain the confidence of a public often  
resentful of television, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is increasingly seeing that television is arrogant,  
television is pushy, television has cameras stuck in people's 
faces,'' he said. ``The public is beginning to regard the public as 
much an enemy as they used to regard a corrupt government.''

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Urge Early Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Developing nations want the United States and  
other wealthy nations to act pre-emptively to avoid future global 
financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued after a daylong meeting at the  
International Monetary Fund, the 24 developing nations also said 
IMF belt-tightening measures urged on them during these crises 
harmed their economies. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the IMF should constantly review its response to  
crises and welcomed the fund's willingness to ease application of 
the restrictions it recommends when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the 24 nations welcomed the establishment of a kind  
of IMF contingency loan that countries could receive before 
financial disaster strikes. The IMF approved the U.S.-proposed loan 
facility Sunday during the annual spring meeting it holds along 
with the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	G.L. Peiris of Sri Lanka, the chairman of the so-called Group of  
24, said that although there is a fragile global economic recovery, 
the crisis that spread last year from Asia to Latin America is not 
over yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The paramount necessity is not to dismantle the international  
financial system and build from scratch,'' Peiris said, ``but to 
strengthen the existing framework and learn from past mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and other wealthy nations met Monday to seek a  
coordinated approach to boost economic growth and see what steps 
can be taken to remodel the global financial system so it can 
withstand future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	In their statement, the developing nations said it was essential  
that the wealthy nations act now ``in a pre-emptive manner to deal 
effectively with these adverse trends in the world economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said that while there were some indications of economic  
recovery in some parts of the developing world, the ``decline in 
commodity prices and the massive reversals of private capital 
flows'' were causing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Commodity prices, which developing countries rely on for 80  
percent of their revenues, have declined sharply in recent months 
although oil prices have begun to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-24 ministers welcomed the ``many avenues being explored to  
involve the private sector in both forestalling and resolving 
financial crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said that in dealing with financial crisis, developing  
countries should be allowed to impose controls on disruptive 
capital flows, if necessary. Both Chile and Malaysia have 
experimented with such controls in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-24 comprises eight members each from Africa, Asia and  
Latin America. China attends as an invitee.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Strips Race Medal From Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Mary Slaney was stripped of her  
silver medal from the 1997 world championships after track 
authorities determined Monday she failed a drug test three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the premier U.S. distance runner said the ruling by  
the International Amateur Athletic Federation was based on ``legal 
fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sad that the worldwide governing body for the sport of  
track and field would choose to prop up its sham drug-testing 
program at the expense of one of its greatest athletes,'' lawyer 
Doriane Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney is free to compete since the IAAF said she had  
retroactively completed her two-year ban. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-man IAAF arbitration panel said the 40-year-old runner  
tested positive for high testosterone levels before the 1996 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed a ban on Slaney that ran from June 1996, when  
the test was administered, to June 1998. Thus, Slaney loses the 
medal she won at Paris in the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them come and try to get the $20,000 (in prize money) that  
she won in Paris,'' lawyer Jim Coleman, Doriane's husband, said. 
``They don't say they're going to ask for it back, but the order 
suggested they might. ... They'll never see the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the test ``bogus.''  
</P>
<P>
	``What they should have been doing is trying to find a way to  
prove when a female athlete has used testosterone. Rather than 
doing that, they've been trying to find a way to save a test that 
doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Slaney's husband, Richard: ``According to the IAAF, you're  
guilty until you prove your innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney repeatedly has proclaimed her innocence. Earlier this  
month, she sued the IAAF and the U.S. Olympic Committee, which 
administered the original test. 
</P>
<P>
	She claims the testosterone-epitestosterone test is unreliable  
for women who take birth control pills in their late 30s or 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF disputes that argument and said the decision by USA  
Track &AMP; Field on Sept. 16, 1997, to clear Slaney was ``erroneous.'' 
The IAAF said Monday's ruling was ``final and binding,'' with no 
right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mary is fine,'' Jim Coleman said. ``She was prepared for what  
happened in Monaco. It's of no concern to her. She's totally 
ignored it. It's a nonevent as far as we're concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF executive director Craig Masback called the decision ``a  
tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, she's one of the great athletes in the sport and a  
pioneer,'' Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	``T-E testing for women is not supported by scientific evidence  
... never mind for her particular test. I think it's unfortunate 
that the IAAF decided to pursue this case after we exonerated her. 
They should come up with a legal test, not pursue someone who is 
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed the ban after the arbitration panel said there  
was ``failure to establish by clear evidence that an abnormal T-E 
test was attributable to pathological or physiological 
conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters, gave  
a urine sample during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials that showed a 
T-E ratio above the 6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E test detects the presence of testosterone, a naturally  
occurring muscle-building hormone that also is taken in 
concentrated form to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF suspended Slaney, claiming USATF was slow to  
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF imposed its own suspension. But Slaney, backed by her  
sponsor Nike, challenged the ruling, and in September 1997 the U.S. 
federation cleared her. The IAAF also later cleared Slaney to 
compete but referred the case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney now joins other prominent names in track found guilty by  
the IAAF: Ben Johnson, Butch Reynolds and Katrin Krabbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Another high-profile case is pending. U.S. sprinter Dennis  
Mitchell is going to arbitration after testing positive for high 
testosterone.

<HEADLINE> Case Against Microsoft Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Executives from the nation's fifth-largest  
computer maker complain in newly disclosed testimony about 
restrictions they face from industry-giant Microsoft Corp., which 
the government contends limits choices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a surprising admission, one of those executives from  
Packard Bell NEC Inc. also complained that Microsoft refused to let 
Packard Bell impose its own limits on which Internet providers 
customers could easily use. 
</P>
<P>
	The frank exchange was included in 270 pages of transcripts  
released Monday, and came during a deposition last fall with 
lawyers preparing for the Microsoft antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is currently in a lengthy recess and is not expected  
to resume before the middle of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange twist to government claims that Microsoft restricts  
consumer choice, Mark Donahue told lawyers that Packard Bell NEC 
over the summer had asked to remove the software giant's list of 
Internet providers within Windows and substitute its own. Microsoft 
balked. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies, listed within a special ``Online Services''  
folder, allow consumers to open subscription accounts easily and 
begin using the Internet within minutes of turning on a new 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Karma Giulianelli, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Donahue  
how Microsoft's decision affected Packard Bell NEC's ability to 
make lucrative sales deals, called ``bounties,'' for itself with 
Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose it allows for multiple choices for the end user,  
whereas Packard Bell NEC would like to limit the choices to the end 
user for the purpose of signing up for an online service,'' said 
Donahue, a senior product manager. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that his company's request to Microsoft was motivated  
by ``financial reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giulianelli appeared so surprised by Donahue's candor that she  
said abruptly: ``I have no further questions right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three interviews with Packard Bell NEC officials,  
Donahue's was by far the most favorable toward Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior executive for the computer maker, Mal Ransom,  
complained that Microsoft can afford to impose tight restrictions 
because Windows is ``the only viable choice'' among computer 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Another official, Jon Kies, told lawyers that previous requests  
for Microsoft to be more flexible, such as allowing tailored 
installations of Windows for some customers, are met with the 
question: ``What is the benefit to Microsoft?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we cannot find or provide a solid benefit to Microsoft,  
then there's not much likelihood that the request is going to be 
granted,'' complained Kies, a senior product manager. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft illegally wields its influence as the manufacturer of 
Windows, the software that runs most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	It complains, for example, that Microsoft forces computer makers  
who buy Windows also to include its Web software, discouraging them 
from distributing rival Internet software, such as Netscape's 
popular browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransom, a senior vice president of marketing, said it makes no  
sense for computer makers to offer both Internet products because 
they're so similar: ``It's kind of like which brand of water do you 
want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts from those interviews were among the first to be  
released of more than 90 taken in preparation for the trial. The 
others, including those of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, were 
expected to be made public later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled this year that an obscure 1913 law  
allows the public to read the transcripts from those depositions, 
which come from some of the high-tech industry's most powerful 
players.

<HEADLINE> Senators Haggle Over HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partisan warfare over patient protections  
resumed Monday as Senate Republicans and Democrats seized contrary 
estimates of the cost of the Democratic bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and their allies trumpeted an estimate from the  
Congressional Budget Office that the Democratic bill would 
ultimately increase private health insurance premiums by 6.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats fired back that they are making changes to the  
legislation that will cause an increase of 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very minimal increase, well in line with every other  
independent estimate we've seen to date of the patient bill of 
rights,'' said Jim Manley, spokesman for Sen. Edward Kennedy, 
D-Mass., one of the chief sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The typical individual health plan costs about $2,200 per year,  
with a family plan costing about $5,500. Employers typically pay 
much of these premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	For an individual, a 4.8 percent premium increase would  
translate to an extra $106 per year, or $9 per month. For a family 
plan, it would add $264 per year, or $22 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Should premiums rise 6.1 percent, the increase would average  
$134 per year for an individual, $11 per month, and $336 per year 
for a family, $28 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans have their own HMO legislation that would  
cost less but would cover fewer Americans and include fewer 
provisions. The budget office has already said it would increase 
premiums by less than 1 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Democratic bill would cover all Americans, give  
them the right to sue their health plans and add a number of other 
provisions meant to ensure easier access to care. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Republicans were promoting new budget estimates,  
arguing that increased costs will simply lead employers to drop 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats' bill fails the single most important test of  
any managed care legislation: helping people obtain affordable 
health care,'' said a statement by Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., who 
chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But in providing the CBO's 6.1 percent estimate of the  
Democratic bill, Jeffords' office failed to note that the budget 
office also indicated the cost might be lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have indicated their intention to clarify the  
bill in ways that could reduce the premium increase to 4.8 
percent,'' CBO Director Dan L. Crippen wrote to Jeffords. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said he was dismayed that Republicans hadn't included  
that information. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another typical ploy by the Republicans and the  
special interests downtown designed to derail passage of this 
important legislation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget office says it would take about three years for most  
of the increases to be phased in.

<HEADLINE> Starbucks May Buy Thailand Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Once they grew opium, the raw material  
for the deadly drug heroin. Soon, they may be growing coffee for 
Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company is in discussions with the aid group  
CARE and representatives of a project run by Thailand's royal 
family to begin buying arabica coffee beans from the country's hill 
tribe farmers, a company executive said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, opium was the leading cash crop for Thailand's hill  
tribes. But over the past 25 years, under a program sponsored by 
Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, they have slowly switched to 
other crops, including coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coffee is the right species, arabica,'' said Dave Olsen,  
senior vice president for research and development, as he toured 
Starbucks' four stores in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the quality isn't good enough. But we want to work  
with them to improve it so, hopefully, we can buy from them,'' 
Olsen said. ``That would be good for the hill tribe people, good 
for Starbucks and good for Thailand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the discussions are part of Starbucks' goal of  
increasing its presence in Asia and elsewhere overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, only 175 of the company's more than 2,000 stores are  
outside North America. However, within the next five years, 
Starbucks expects to have more stores outside North America than 
within, Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Asians are traditionally tea drinkers, the increasing  
passion for coffee in the region will drive that growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, Starbucks already has stores in China, Japan, the  
Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, and plans to expand 
into South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen said the company, with its joint-venture partner Central  
Pattana, a hotel and retail group, plans on opening a store a month 
in Bangkok over the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunities for growth in Asia are impressive,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Asian countries, however, if not battling deep recessions,  
are in economic doldrums. And by local standards, Starbucks coffee 
is expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	With $533 a month considered a decent salary for a Bangkok  
office worker, will they be willing to shell out $2.50 for an Iced 
Frappucino? 
</P>
<P>
	``To the greatest extent possible, we like to think of our  
coffee as the affordable luxury,'' Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic in Bangkok's four Starbucks' branches seem to bear him  
out. They are frequently jammed with office workers, shoppers and 
students sipping away.

<HEADLINE> Japan Car Production Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Auto production in Japan fell to its lowest level  
in 20 years for the fiscal year ending in March because of slumping 
sales hurt by a recession at home and throughout ailing Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Production for fiscal 1998 totaled 9.97 million, down 7.5  
percent from 10.78 million in 1997, the trade group Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The level for the year marked the first drop in three years and  
was the lowest for auto production in Japan since fiscal 1978, when 
8.95 million vehicles were produced. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese auto production has been dragged down by a recession at  
home as well as the regional economic turmoil that has damped auto 
sales throughout Asia. Japanese automakers have also been shifting 
production abroad as part of their business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunging production is likely to increase pressures for cuts in  
the work force at automakers. Troubled Nissan Motor Co. has said it 
will decrease its office staff worldwide by 10 percent, or 5,000 
workers, by March 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	For March, domestic vehicle production rose 3.8 percent from the  
same month a year ago to 1.01 million -- the first time in five 
months that domestic automobile production rose -- the association 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic vehicle demand in March totaled 830,958, down 2.1  
percent from a year earlier. The association estimated vehicle 
exports in March dropped about 2 percent. It is releasing export 
figures later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said that auto production for the latest fiscal  
year was lower than that of the previous fiscal year at all 
automakers, except for Daihatsu, a minicar-maker that is a Toyota 
affiliate, and Nissan Diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Output at Toyota Motor Corp. was down by about 10 percent to  
3.09 million vehicles, the association said. Production at Nissan 
Motor Co. fell 9 percent to 1.53 million, while production at Honda 
Motor Co. shrank 8 percent to 1.22 million.

<HEADLINE> Brit Co. To Sell Power Plants to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- PowerGen PLC, Britain's third-largest electricity  
generating firm, is expected soon to announce the sale of two power 
plants to Edison Mission Energy of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	PowerGen hopes to sell the coal-fired stations by the end of the  
week, spokeswoman Esther Kaposi said Monday, in a deal reported to 
be worth about $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaposi refused to confirm the identify of the buyer. The  
Financial Times said it was Edison Mission Energy, a utility 
company based in Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	PowerGen is selling the plants to satisfy government regulators  
who were concerned that the company's purchase last year of a 
regional power distribution firm, East Midlands Electricity, might 
give it too large a share of Britain's electricity market, Kaposi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	PowerGen, which has 18 percent of Britain's market for  
electricity generation, wants to become a vertically integrated gas 
and electric utility. To acquire East Midlands, the Coventry-based 
company had to assure the Department of Trade and Industry that it 
would sell the two power stations -- Fiddler's Ferry in the western 
city of Warrington, Cheshire, and Ferrybridge C in the northern 
county of West Yorkshire. 
</P>
<P>
	PowerGen posted revenues of $3.71 billion during the last nine  
months of 1998. Its operating income for the same period was $471 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also operates in Germany, Hungary, Portugal, India,  
South Korea, Australia, Thailand and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> AP To Add Internet Site, News Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Technological improvements in how The  
Associated Press delivers its news report, a new Internet site to 
provide members with easier access to that report, and plans to 
enlarge AP's state news staff were announced by Louis D. Boccardi, 
president and chief executive officer, at the news cooperative's 
annual meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was opened by AP chairman Donald E. Newhouse,  
president of Advance Publications and The Star-Ledger of Newark, 
N.J. The meeting and luncheon, attended by executives representing 
AP's 1,545 daily newspapers, were the opening events of the first 
full day of activities of the Newspaper Association of America's 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the annual meeting, Boccardi moderated a conversation  
on Kosovo with three AP correspondents, an AP photographer and a 
San Diego professor -- two people speaking via satellite from an 
Albanian refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Richardson, secretary of energy and former U.S. ambassador  
to the United Nations, was scheduled as the featured speaker at the 
luncheon following the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi started his report to the AP members by showing the AP  
photo portfolios that won both Pulitzer photo prizes this year. AP 
was cited for spot coverage of the terrorist bombings of two 
American embassies in Africa and feature photography for coverage 
of the White House scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi paid tribute to AP television producer Myles Tierney,  
who was killed by rebel gunmen in Sierra Leone, and he spoke of the 
risks taken by AP staffers to cover the struggles in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud of the work being done by some very courageous AP  
people who've been beaten, robbed and shot at as they reported from 
the Balkans,'' Boccardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi said the international video service AP started four  
years ago, now known as APTN, had its first profitable quarter this 
year and had ``begun to fulfill the expectations we've had all 
along that it would generate new revenue for our general funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In connection with AP services, Boccardi announced that the AP  
Leaf Desk will be replaced starting later this year with an all-new 
AP Server. It will go to all PhotoStream subscribers, including 
those who already own the current version of AP Server, at no 
additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Leaf Desk, with which AP led the industry's way to  
electronic picture handling just a few years ago, has served you 
and us well. But it's time to move ahead,'' Boccardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with a new and improved satellite distribution system  
called ObjectStream, the new receivers will make it possible for AP 
to retire its aging AP GraphicsNet system and deliver photos and 
news graphics on the same circuit to the same up-to-date receiver, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later on, AP will add text to ObjectStream so that related  
stories, photos and graphics will be linked when they arrive in 
newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the next few months, Boccardi said, AP will give member  
newspapers a new Internet site at no charge called ``Your AP.'' It 
will provide a directory to access every story, picture and graphic 
available on any subject in the AP news report, and it can be 
customized by editors for their specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take the place of the systems we use for delivering  
our news to your production systems,'' Boccardi said. ``What we're 
doing here is using the Internet to offer another way to look at 
your AP news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, some 950 AP member newspapers will have  
Web sites, Boccardi said, and more than 300 will subscribe to The 
WIRE, AP's Web-based members-only service started more than two 
years ago. To make member sites more attractive to online readers, 
he said, the AP recently launched the MoneyWIRE, which allows users 
to retrieve specific mutual fund and stock listings by company 
name, ticker symbol or AP stock table abbreviation. 
</P>
<P>
	For editors who want to build their own multimedia  
presentations, Boccardi said the AP will soon offer ``multimedia 
components'' on all major stories, including audio and video clips. 
He said the AP is working with RealNetworks Inc. to let Web sites 
offer audio and news programming directly from their pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi also announced that as many as 10 new staffers will be  
added this year to domestic bureaus in a program AP hopes to 
continue for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The first additions will be in Houston; Jackson, Miss.;  
Columbia, S.C.; a Washington-based regional reporter for Utah, 
Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico; and a technology writer based in 
San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In results of all-mail balloting for the AP's board of  
directors, four incumbents were re-elected and two new members were 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-elected were Judith W. Brown, editor, The Herald, New  
Britain, Conn.; Joe Hladky, president and publisher, The Gazette 
Co., Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Burl Osborne, president and CEO of The 
Dallas Morning News and president, publishing division, of the 
newspaper's parent company, A.H. Belo Corp.; and representing a 
city of less than 50,000 population, R. Victor Dix, chairman of Dix 
Communications, and president and publisher of The Daily Record, 
Wooster, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	New members are Richard D. Gottlieb, president and CEO, Lee  
Enterprises Inc., Quad-City Times, Davenport, Iowa, and W. Dean 
Singleton, vice chairman, president and CEO, MediaNews Group, and 
chairman of The Denver Post Co.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- He was a cross country runner who had  
recently returned from a two-week trip to Paris with the French 
club. She was an aspiring songwriter and author who was eager to 
get her driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered to  
remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16 -- just two of the 
13 lives cut short in a fusillade of bullets fired by two students 
at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners filed by the open caskets at St. Frances Cabrini  
Catholic Church before family members approached to give their 
final good-byes to the two sophomores. Mauser's father ran his 
fingers through his son's blond hair and kissed his face before 
lowering the casket lid. 
</P>
<P>
	The caskets were then pushed on carts to the center of the  
church and draped in white cloth. The victims' families, who held 
the dual funeral because they belong to neighboring churches of the 
same archdiocese, sat on either side of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Mass, Denver Archbishop Charles J. Chaput directed  
his remarks to the parents when he said: ``Tuesday was your descent 
into hell. I don't know any way we can describe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mass was held after 70,000 people attended an outdoor  
memorial service for all 13 victims attended by Vice President Al 
Gore and Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	The families grieved for Mauser, a thin, bespectacled sophomore  
who excelled in math and science, and earned straight A's on his 
last report card. He joined the debate team to overcome his 
shyness. 
</P>
<P>
	And they grieved for Fleming who moved to Littleton 18 months  
ago from Phoenix. She turned to writing song lyrics and fiction to 
express her feelings. She died while trying to help others. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting from a biblical passage, Chaput talked about a ``corrupt  
generation'' that could be saved by taking responsibility and 
repenting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our culture is a culture that is permeated by violence, and  
somehow we have allowed that to happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``we are not powerless. We can repent ... We can  
change the structures of our society.''

<HEADLINE> Short-Term Treasury Rates Rise / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in about a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.335 percent, up from 4.230 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.410 percent, up from 4.370 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since March 29, when the  
bills sold for 4.380 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since March 22, when the rate was 4.420. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.457 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,890.40, and 4.585 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,777.10. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.70 
percent last week from 4.67 percent.

<HEADLINE> 'The Matrix' Returns to No. 1 / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The sci-fi thriller ``The Matrix,'' still  
cruising while movie theaters await the summer's blockbuster 
releases, returned for a third time to top the North American box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Most films in theaters now represent the lull before the release  
of the ``Star Wars'' prequel, the ``Austin Powers'' sequel, the 
Will Smith action movie ``Wild, Wild West,'' and Stanley Kubrick's 
last movie ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $66 million in weekend ticket sales by the Top 10 movies was  
down 28 percent from a week earlier but about even with this time 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' returned to No. 1 with a $12.6 million take and  
the Eddie Murphy-Martin Lawrence prison comedy ``Life'' fell to 
second place with $11.3 million in receipts, a 45 percent drop from 
its previous weekend debut, according to industry figures released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drew Barrymore high school comedy ``Never Been Kissed'' was  
a bright spot in the box office lineup, placing third with $6 
million. It has earned $31 million in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weekend newcomers had disappointing debuts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pushing Tin,'' the John Cusack-Billy Bob Thornton air traffic  
controller comedy, opened with $3.6 million for fourth place. 
``Lost &AMP; Found,'' featuring David Spade as a lovesick dognapper, 
opened in sixth place with $3 million.

<HEADLINE> USOC Marketing Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Krimsky, who helped raise more than $2  
billion as the U.S. Olympic Committee's marketing chief but has 
been buffeted by the Salt Lake bribery scandal, resigned today to 
return to private business. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky will be succeeded by Dave Ogrean, executive director of  
USA Hockey, the national federation for Olympic-level ice hockey. 
The starting date is June 4 but Krimsky and Ogrean said a 
transition period will begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogrean is a former broadcasting director for the USOC and has  
been mentioned as a potential successor to Dick Schultz, the 
committee's executive director who is expected to step down after 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote-buying scandal involved in Utah's successful bid for  
those games has left the Olympics to deal with its worst corruption 
crisis over the last five months and made fundraising more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	But Krimsky said the scandal had no effect on his decision to  
leave the job he has held for 13 years to become president and CEO 
of Relationship Management Programs Inc., the management company of 
United Airlines' Silver Wings Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a $300 million gap in sponsorship revenues for Salt Lake  
Games, he said there was no way he was jumping ship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not true,'' Krimsky said by telephone from Colorado  
Springs, Colo. ``While there have been a lot of things that have 
happened to the Olympic community in the last six months, this is 
an opportune time to look at what I am going to do with the last 
five years of what would typically be a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old executive said the shakeup in the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee that followed news of the scandal last 
November had left the organization in good shape, and noted that 
that OPUS, the joint fund-raising program he headed for the Salt 
Lake Games, had signed sponsor contracts covering two-thirds of the 
budgeted $859 million in marketing revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the plans in place to raise the dollars,'' he said,  
adding the change would not affect contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, in Australia for an International Olympic Committee  
meeting on the 2000 Sydney Games, said Krimsky had first mentioned 
the chances of leaving in late January or early February. He, too, 
downplayed any disruption in marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was a super salesman, but people are buying the U.S.  
Olympic committee.'' said Schultz, who will take over for Krimsky 
as head of OPUS. ``It might be a different person and personality 
but the product hasn't changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said he had told IOC vice president and marketing chief  
Dick Pound about his decision but had not spoken with Michael 
Payne, the committee's Swiss-based marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also had talked with several sponsors ``and they said  
they will miss me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogrean said his first task would be to meet with staff and  
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	While no sponsors have pulled out because of the million-dollar  
scandal, two asked Krimsky to withhold announcement of their deals 
until the case died down and at least one other company, Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson, cut off negotiations on a $30 million endorsement package.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Report Hurts Lufthansa Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Shares in Lufthansa dropped today  
despite the airline's denial of a magazine report that said it was 
losing millions of dollars a day due to the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lufthansa stock fell more than 4 percent in Frankfurt trading,  
despite a 1.6 percent rise in the market's blue chip index. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel magazine reported over the weekend that Lufthansa  
was losing $5.6 million a day because of delays and detours caused 
by military refueling operations at Frankfurt airport, continental 
Europe's busiest and Lufthansa's main hub. 
</P>
<P>
	But airline spokesman Thomas Jachnow said the airline would only  
lose that much in the case of ``a total breakdown of operations,'' 
which hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is beyond us how the magazine could come up with this  
figure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the magazine had taken comments from chairman Juergen  
Weber, in which he complained about Frankfurt being turned into a 
military airport, out of context. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased military air traffic due to NATO's airstrikes on  
Kosovo is ``compounding the tightness of European air traffic 
control,'' Jachnow conceded. He said Weber had been negotiating 
with German and U.S. military officials on how to lower the impact 
on civilian air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, construction work in Frankfurt has virtually  
reduced landings to one runway, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Forces Imetal Divestiture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved Imetal's $1.24  
billion cash offer to acquire English China Clays PLC, after the 
companies agreed Monday to sell mining, production and sales assets 
of minerals used in papermaking and related industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust division filed a lawsuit in U.S.  
District Court here to block the original acquisition. But at the 
same time, it filed the agreement that, if approved by the court, 
would settle the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the divestitures would eliminate the deal's  
potential harm to competition in four markets: water-washed kaolin, 
calcine kaolin, ground calcium carbonate and fused silica. 
</P>
<P>
	Imetal and ECC are two of only five producers of water-washed  
kaolin and calcined kaolin and are the dominant producers of fused 
silica in the United States. Imetal, through a joint venture called 
Alabama Carbonates, and ECC are the only two suppliers of ground 
calcium carbonate to paper mills in the southeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Water-washed kaolin is a clay used as pigment for coating paper  
and as a filler in the body of paper. It adds brightness, gloss and 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Calcined kaolin is heat-treated water-washed kaolin and has  
enhanced whitening and brightening capabilities. It is used to make 
paper more opaque. Ground calcium carbonate also is a papermaking 
pigment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fused silica is used in high-grade glass and in the preparation  
of ceramics and epoxy molding compounds in the electronics 
industry. It improves resistance to heat and corrosion and reduces 
electrical conductivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Imetal agreed to sell a water-washed kaolin plant in  
Sandersville, Ga., and two calciners, which are used to produce 
calcined kaolin. It also will sell its interest in Alabama 
Carbonates along with stone reserves. And it will sell ECC's fused 
silica operations, known as Minco, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Imetal is a French company that owns a U.S. subsidiary, DBK  
Minerals Inc., which in turn owns Dry Branch Kaolin Co. and Georgia 
Marble Co. In 1997, Imetal's U.S. operations had domestic revenues 
of more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	ECC is a British company that owns a U.S. subsidiary, English  
China Clays Inc. In 1997, its U.S. operations had domestic revenues 
of $600 million.

<HEADLINE> IOC Salutes Killanin's Reign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee led  
tributes Monday to Lord Killanin, the organization's president 
during the turbulent period that included the 1976 and 1980 
boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin, who had been ill for some time, died Sunday at his  
home in Dublin, his family said. He was 84. The cause of death was 
not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is grateful to president Killanin for leading the  
Olympic movement through the difficult period of political turmoil 
in the 1970s,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch, his successor as IOC 
president, said in a statement. ``His presidency was decisive for 
the survival of the Olympic ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch joined the IOC staff in observing a minute's silence  
for Killanin, and the Olympic flag was flown at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC statement noted that Killanin had played a moderating  
role in disputes between China and Taiwan, and succeeded in 
bringing China back into the Olympic fold. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Killanin always  
represented Ireland at home and abroad with style, distinction and 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a charismatic and dynamic individual who was passionate  
about every task he took on,'' Ahern said. ``We are deeply indebted 
to him and his family for his long years of public service to Irish 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irish Sports Minister John McDaid said Killanin's ``status and  
the worldwide esteem in which he was held in Olympic circles was a 
source of pride for all Irish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was elected the sixth president of the IOC in 1972 at  
the age of 50, taking over from American Avery Brundage just after 
the massacre of Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings were followed in 1976 by the African boycott of the  
debt-ridden Montreal Olympics. And in 1980 the United States led a 
boycott of the Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	When Killanin stepped down as IOC president in 1980, the IOC was  
on the verge of bankruptcy and the Olympics were threatened with 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Samaranch has turned the Olympics into a  
multibillion- dollar industry, which is currently suffering its 
worst corruption crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	During his eight-year tenure, Killanin was known for  
democratizing the IOC, bringing in younger blood and breaking with 
the tradition of appointing only older aristocrats. He also 
expanded the membership from 71 to 89 members. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the key changes was the relaxation of the rule on  
amateurism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe in professional Olympics, I do not believe in  
open Olympics, but I think we have to recognize we are about to 
enter the last quarter of the 20th century,'' Killanin said shortly 
after his election. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first sign that reforms in eligibility rules, which  
Brundage had fought so vigorously, would be introduced. In 1974, 
the word amateur was removed from the Olympic Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be remembered as a genial reformer who spread goodwill  
and laughter and quietly discarded the worn-out ideas of a past 
age,'' Geoffrey Miller, the late European sports editor of The 
Associated Press, wrote in his 1979 book, ``Behind the Olympic 
Rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was appointed to the IOC in 1952 and moved up the  
hierarchy to eventually become senior vice president. He accepted 
the IOC presidency only on condition that his expenses were paid, 
which was a break in the tradition of the presidency being only the 
preserve of rich men. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin represented a stark contrast in personality and  
leadership style from Brundage, who was widely regarded as an 
autocrat during his 20-year tenure 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was credited with a more consultative style. He was  
known for his discretion and diplomacy. He avoided controversial 
statements and sought to divert attention from himself.

<HEADLINE> Meadowlands Won't Let Brennan Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Meadowlands Racetrack is not  
going to let harness driver George Brennan race even though a state 
appellate court has stayed a suspension of his license by the New 
Jersey Racing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing the driver said Monday they planned to go  
to court soon to force the track to let Brennan work. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to Brennan on Monday, Chris McErlean, the  
track's vice president and general manager, said track officials 
felt the driver did not give his best effort in finishing last in a 
March 10 race at Freehold Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of effort calls into question the integrity of your  
drive in the race and is inconsistent with the quality of racing 
presented at the Meadowlands Racetrack,'' McErlean wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts of the letter were sent to the media by the track.  
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, who was the nation's leading driver at the time, and  
fellow drivers Howard Parker and Jim Morrill Jr., had their 
licenses suspended for six months for unsatisfactory drives in the 
race by the commission on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
	A state investigation found suspicious betting patterns in the  
race. It discovered that Parker's chauffeur earned $24,000 wagering 
heavily on exactas and trifectas. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan has denied any wrongdoing in the race in which all three  
drivers finished out of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Brennan want to file an appeal by Wednesday in a  
court Chancery Division, forcing the New Jersey Sports and 
Exposition Authority, the operators of the track, to let Brennan 
drive, attorney Bill Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said the sports authority does not have the authority to  
suspend a driver, adding it didn't even give Brennan due process in 
making its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In past decisions, courts have ruled that the sports authority,  
a quasi-state agency, is bound by rulings dealing with other state 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the odds we are up against,'' McErlean said. ``I think  
we now want to make a statement that this is something we feel 
strongly about. We want to pursue this as vigorously as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the racing commission denied Brennan's  
appeal of his suspension last Monday. However, an appellate judge, 
Paul G. Levy, issued a stay of the license suspension on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadowlands officials, who had revoked Brennan's driving  
privileges after his suspension, met with the driver Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No evidence was presented and there were no witnesses,''  
Wilson said. ``We only viewed the tape of the race one time and Mr. 
Brennan offered comments.''

<HEADLINE> Ascent To Sell Nuggets, Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Ascent Entertainment Group Inc. has agreed to sell  
the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and the teams' future 
home, the Pepsi Center, in a deal valued at $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale will be to a partnership controlled by Bill Laurie and  
his wife, Wal-Mart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie of Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Lyons, currently chief executive officer of Ascent  
Entertainment, will become president of the partnership and will 
own an interest in the partnership, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes $260 million in cash and about $140 million in  
financing obligations for the Pepsi Center, Ascent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing on the transaction is set for June 30. Lyons will  
continue as CEO of Ascent Entertainment Group until the closing, 
after which he will become president of the new sports company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent officials set a news conference for Wednesday to discuss  
the sale in detail, declining initial comment out of respect for 
the families of victims in last week's shootings at Columbine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, a former basketball player at Memphis State, and Walton  
own Crown Center Farms in Columbia, which raises quarter horses and 
Appaloosas. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is subject to the approval of the NBA, NHL, and  
the City and County of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent's stock dropped $1.25 to $11.13 a share Monday, fueling  
speculation among some analysts that the proposed sale of the two 
teams and the state-of-the-art Pepsi Center, which is under 
construction, may have been undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be like the price is low for the group of assets  
that are being sold,'' said Marc Ganis of Sportscorp Ltd. in 
Chicago. ``It's very easy to come up with a valuation of $500 
million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Murray Arenson of Hoak Breedlove Wesneski &AMP; Co. said the  
price ``came in a little light of what we expected,'' which was a 
range of $400 million to $435 million. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, ``From an Ascent shareholder's standpoint, I  
think this is good news, contrary to what the market said today 
(Monday). 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave us a way to value the other components of Ascent,  
which then brings us back to On Command and Ascent network,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts estimated the value of the Avalanche between $138  
million and $140 million, with the Nuggets at $110 million to $125 
million, which would put the combined total at a minimum of $248 
million. The arena's value has been put between $169 million and 
$175 million, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent acquired its ownership in the Nuggets through a series of  
transactions from 1989 to 1992 at a total cost of $60.2 million and 
acquired the Avalanche in 1995 at a cost of $75.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent's equity investment in the Pepsi Center and related  
development property is approximately $25 million, not including 
the arena indebtedness.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The NBA fined Utah Jazz owner Larry Miller  
$10,000 Monday for arguing with Portland guard Greg Anthony during 
Utah's win over the Trail Blazers last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said Miller made ``inappropriate comments'' in the  
fourth quarter of the game when he told Anthony, who had just 
committed a hard foul on John Stockton, he was a ``cheap-shot 
artist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony replied angrily and walked toward the Jazz owner, and  
Miller rose from his courtside seat. After a heated exchange, 
Anthony backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't repeat the words (Miller said), but I'm going to  
report him to the league, because I was told we're not allowed to 
talk that way out there,'' Anthony told The Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he met with league commissioner David Stern and  
deputy commissioner Russ Granik by phone Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed with their decision, but I understood where  
they were coming from,'' Miller said. ``I guess this helps me 
understand what the guidelines are. I've had a hard time this 
season with all the physical play that's going on, and I let David 
and Russ know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony also said he would consult with an attorney and demand a  
public apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen guys who play like that, and I don't like it,''  
Miller said of Anthony. ``I understand hard play, but it looked 
like all he was assigned to do was take Stockton out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz were leading the Blazers at the time and went on to win  
96-85, increasing Utah's Western Conference lead over Portland. 
Miller didn't attend Utah's Sunday win over Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think being on national TV exacerbates these things a lot,''  
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC featured extensive footage of the confrontation at halftime  
of a Lakers-Spurs game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time Miller, the Jazz's owner for the last  
14 seasons, has been involved in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had numerous similar run-ins with opposing players over  
the years at the Delta Center, and in 1994, he settled out of court 
with a Nuggets fan Miller attempted to choke after being heckled 
during a playoff game in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the owner of an extensive string of car dealerships  
throughout the West, is a beloved figure in Salt Lake City. His 
purchase of the Jazz in 1985 prevented the previous owners from 
moving the team to Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Virus Not Spreading Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The computer virus known as Chernobyl seemed to  
be affecting few computers Monday, allaying fears that the computer 
bug would sweep the world as another virus did several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday Monday, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear  
disaster, only four sites with 30 individual computers had been 
infected, the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly not comparable to what we saw with Melissa,''  
said CERT's Bill Pollak, referring to the recent computer virus. 
``It would be a big surprise if it were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most common version of the Chernobyl virus, also known as  
``CIH,'' was programmed to activate on computers using Windows 95 
and Windows 98 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another version, less common, strikes computers on the 26th day  
of any month. 
</P>
<P>
	The viruses, believed to originate in Taiwan, attempt to erase a  
computer's hard-drive and write gibberish to the computer's system 
settings, called its BIOS, that would prevent the machine from 
being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the recent ``Melissa'' scare, which automatically  
propagated via e-mail but did no direct damage, the Chernobyl virus 
didn't spread as quickly because it required a person to launch an 
infected program file to contaminate a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts seemed sanguine because Chernobyl was discovered last  
summer, giving antivirus companies time to develop free software 
updates to identify and destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of those products will be protected if they've retrieved  
the free updates. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, both Network Associates Inc., which makes the  
popular McAfee software, and Symantec Corp., which has the Norton 
Antivirus program, identified Chernobyl last summer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, NRA Agree on One Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Finding a rare point of agreement, the Clinton  
administration and the National Rifle Association would prohibit 
juveniles who commit violent crimes from ever owning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, they have major differences on how to prevent a  
recurrence of last week's school shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
President Clinton is backing several gun control measures while the 
NRA says the answer is to more strenuously prosecute those who 
violate existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, stepping around a  
question about whether the NRA was partly to blame for the 
Littleton shootings, criticized the group today for opposing the 
Clinton administration's gun-control policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a consensus in this country that we need to  
do more; the president will propose to do more and it is time for 
the NRA to get out of the past and get on the right side of this 
issue,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to unveil his omnibus crime package Tuesday, and  
Lockhart said it would contain new gun-control proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA and other pro-gun organizations need to support the  
administration's efforts ... to put reasonable regulations on the 
use and the possession of guns,'' said Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder, Justice's No. 2 official. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those initiatives, he said, are extending the Brady Law,  
which requires background checks for gun buyers, to bar juveniles 
who have committed violent crimes from owning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' he also said there is a  
``need to deal with adults who make guns available to kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his Saturday radio address, said he would  
push for legislation that would crack down on gun shows and illegal 
gun trafficking, prohibit violent juveniles from buying guns and 
close loopholes that let juveniles own assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, as with  
similar school killings in the past, have spurred the demand for 
tougher gun-control laws. Dozens of gun-control bills are now 
pending in Congress, including a trigger lock bill actively 
supported by the administration, but the Republican majority has 
been reluctant to impose new restrictions on gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, also appearing on  
CBS, said the best approach was to fully prosecute people, 
including juveniles, who break existing gun laws. ``When you let 
bad people go home they do bad things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaPierre agreed that ``violent juveniles that commit violent  
crimes with guns should forever be prohibited from owning a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But officials first need to get serious about prosecuting and  
expelling kids who show up at schools with guns, he said. Of 6,000 
such incidents in the past two years, there have been only 13 
prosecutions, LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NRA support for state laws allowing people with permits  
to carry concealed weapons was ``simply off the point'' from the 
school shootings. People who apply for permits are not the type to 
commit crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Littleton case, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens repeated Sunday  
that adults who supplied the weapons to the two suspects or knew 
they had guns could be charged as accomplices, but Justice 
Department officials urged caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' would  
say only that it was important to identify those responsible for 
the student suspects having guns and what the parents knew before 
taking ``appropriate steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holder added that the charging adults because they ``should have  
known'' that children had guns was a ``dangerous thing.''

<HEADLINE> Moon Signs 2-Year Deal With Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Warren Moon, who started 10 games for  
Seattle last season, signed a two-year contract with the Kansas 
City Chiefs on Monday to serve as the backup for Elvis Grbac. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, 42, was signed as an unrestricted free agent. Terms of the  
deal were not announced by the Chiefs, who scheduled a news 
conference for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac missed 16 games over the past two seasons because of  
injury and ineffectiveness as he has struggled to take control of 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after recovering from an injury in last season's opening  
game, Grbac was kept on the bench in favor of Rich Gannon until he 
came back to start the season finale at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Gannon has signed as a free agent with the Raiders  
and Marty Schottenheimer resigned as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer insisted even through the consistently fine play  
of Gannon that Grbac was the Chiefs' quarterback of the future. New 
coach Gunther Cunningham has repeated the refrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon was sought by the Chiefs both as insurance for another  
injury to Grbac and for his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	He continues a Chiefs trend that has brought both Joe Montana  
and Marcus Allen into the clubhouse in the twilight of their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``His experience on the field, in the classroom and in the  
locker room will be similar to that which Marcus Allen brought 
us,'' Chiefs president and general manager Carl Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be very helpful to Elvis Grbac in his  
development,'' Cunningham said. ``I think the players will respond 
well to him because I think he carries respect throughout the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac, signed as a free agent from the 49ers in 1997, got the  
Chiefs off to an 8-1 start that season before he fractured his left 
clavicle while being sacked against Pittsburgh and missed six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a shoulder injury against Oakland in the opener last  
season and remained out until making a start Nov. 8 at Seattle. 
After throwing two first-half interceptions that led to two 
touchdowns, Grbac was replaced by Gannon and remained on the bench 
until he started the final game at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw two interceptions in the victory over the Raiders that  
was small consolation for a team that finished 7-9 and was among 
the NFL's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon passed for 1,632 yards with 11 touchdown passes and eight  
interceptions for the Seahawks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon played in the Canadian Football League joining the Houston  
Oilers. He played at Minnesota before going to the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Moon has completed 3,972 of 6,786 passes for 49,097  
yards with 290 touchdown passes and 232 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks third in NFL history in pass attempts, pass completions  
and passing yardage. He is tied for fourth with Johnny Unitas in 
touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon has passed for 3,000 yards in a season nine times, and for  
300 yards in a game 49 times. 
</P>
<P>
	His 527 yards against the Chiefs in Kansas City on Dec. 16,  
1990, was the second most in NFL history behind the 554 yards of 
Norm Van Brocklin in 1951.

<HEADLINE> Court To Make FDA-Tobacco Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court stepped into a major dispute  
over smoking Monday, agreeing to decide whether the Food and Drug 
Administration can regulate tobacco and crack down on cigarette 
sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and the tobacco industry will square  
off in oral arguments this fall over the FDA's 1996 decision to 
start regulating tobacco. The government says the policy switch was 
justified by new evidence that the tobacco industry intended its 
products to feed consumers' nicotine habits. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower court threw out the rules, saying it is up to Congress --  
not the FDA -- to make the ``major policy decision'' of how to 
regulate cigarettes and chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton released a statement saying he was pleased the  
court would take up the case. ``Every day, 3,000 young people 
become regular smokers and 1,000 will have their lives cut short as 
a result,'' he said. ``I remain firmly committed to the FDA rule, 
which will help stop young people from smoking before they start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the most important public health case the Supreme  
Court hears in decades,'' said David Kessler, FDA commissioner in 
1996 and now dean of Yale University Medical School. ``The goal is 
certainly to reduce the number of people who smoke and the best way 
to do that is to reduce the number of young people who start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. called the FDA's rule an example  
of ``government overreaching'' and said it expected the Supreme 
Court to deny the agency the authority to regulate tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris Inc. issued a statement saying it has sought to  
curb smoking by minors but also will ``continue to work to protect 
the rights of our adult consumers to make informed choices about 
the use of tobacco products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry officials have argued that FDA regulation of  
tobacco would force a ban, or short of that, would let the agency 
control the contents of cigarettes or limit where they can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states already ban tobacco sales to anyone under 18. In  
addition to adopting that rule, the FDA required stores to demand 
photo I.D. from all tobacco purchasers under age 27 and limited 
vending-machine cigarette sales to adult-only locations, such as 
bars. Those rules remain in effect during the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA rules are part of growing efforts to curb the tobacco  
industry, spurred by disclosures of secret industry documents that 
showed companies long knew of nicotine's addictive quality and that 
they targeted teen-agers as potential smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Congress failed to pass a nationwide settlement last  
year, all 50 states have reached settlements in which tobacco 
companies will pay them $246 billion for the cost of treating 
smoking-related illnesses. Cigarette billboards around the country 
were taken down last week as part of that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government plans to sue the industry to recover  
federal health-insurance costs, and the industry faces individual 
and class-action lawsuits by smokers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, the FDA said it lacked authority to regulate  
tobacco so long as cigarette makers did not claim that smoking 
provided health benefits. But the government reversed itself in 
1996 and said it would begin regulating tobacco products as 
``devices'' that deliver addictive nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies challenged the FDA rules. In April 1997, U.S.  
District Judge William Osteen upheld the government's authority to 
regulate tobacco and upheld the crackdown on sales to minors, but 
threw out other restrictions on tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the  
FDA could not regulate tobacco at all. ``Congress never intended to 
give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products,'' the appeals 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration's appeal, supported by 39 states,  
said the appeals court's ruling ``invalidated the most important 
public health and safety rulemaking that FDA had conducted in the 
past 50 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry lawyers said that setting tobacco policy is a political  
task for Congress, which has prohibited tobacco advertising on 
radio and television, banned smoking on airplanes and required 
warning labels on cigarette packages. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling is expected by summer 2000.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch: Beware Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Political interference in the Salt Lake City  
bribery scandal represents the gravest danger to the Olympics, 
according to the top official of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in a Russian newspaper, International Olympic  
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the panel will 
recover from the scandal if governments leave it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask me what the main danger for the Olympic movement is  
at present, I will respond: The interference of politicians,'' 
Samaranch told the weekly Sunday Sport Express. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did not identify the politicians, but was apparently  
referring to moves in the U.S. Congress to punish the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders have been highly critical of the IOC in  
the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate hearings on the scandal were held earlier this month,  
with lawmakers accusing the IOC of failing to act swiftly or 
decisively enough on reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation has been drafted to strip the IOC of its tax-exempt  
status in the United States and redirect television rights fees 
from the IOC to the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the Salt Lake  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said the IOC shouldn't shoulder all the blame. He  
reiterated his claim that the scandal has been blown out of 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scandal surrounding the choice of Salt Lake City as the  
host of the 2002 Winter Olympics has been artificially and 
incredibly fanned up,'' Samaranch said in the interview, which was 
cited by the Interfax news agency. ``The International Olympic 
Committee can be responsible only for 50 percent of what happened. 
The other 50 percent belongs to those who headed Salt Lake City's 
bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch made similar comments in an interview Sunday in  
Spain's El Pais. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been an amazing media scandal, and if you start to  
analyze it, you can see it's a relative corruption case,'' he said. 
``Except in one specific case, there are no cases about pocketing 
money. We are talking about scholarships, vacations, presents. ... 
In total, it's $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That figure compared to other corruption scandals today, well  
... However, either if it was for a dollar, or if it was for a 
million, we consider that the people involved have already been 
punished and I think that the decision we have taken was just and 
very fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the ``crisis has played itself out. Now we have  
to take advantage of this crisis in a positive way. We have to 
change the structure. That would be my last will as president: to 
start an IOC to face the new millennium with all the guaranties of 
success.''

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Colo. Teens Wanted 'Big Kill' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who killed 13 people at  
Columbine High wanted to kill at least 500 others, attack nearby 
homes and then hijack a plane and crash it into New York City, 
investigators said today. Authorities also were questioning an 
18-year-old girl about whether she purchased two guns used in the 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone earlier told reporters the  
goal of the killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, was to strike 
during the busy lunch hour to go for ``a big kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But sheriff's department spokesman Steve Davis said the gunmen's  
diary indicates that if they survived, they wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to kill 500 people, hijack a plane and take it to  
New York City,'' Davis said. ``If in fact they were able to carry 
out the entire plan, there could have been quite a bit more damage 
and quite a few more fatalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the gunmen were thinking of New York, he said: ``I  
have no idea. Maybe the density of population, for all I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose when you first hear it, you think that it's some  
horrible fantasy,'' District Attorney Dave Thomas told NBC's 
``Today'' show. ``But we now know that at least the first portion 
of those planned activities were in fact carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we also know that had a couple of the devices  
in the school actually detonated as they had planned, the death 
toll could have been much higher than it was,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail was found in  
Harris' bedroom, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the pair, enraged by what they considered insults  
from classmates, rampaged through their school with guns and bombs 
before turning their weapons on themselves. Investigators, amazed 
at the sheer firepower, are trying to determine if others were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said an 18-year-old woman, described as Klebold's  
girlfriend, was being questioned about whether she had purchased 
two of the four firearms used in Tuesday's massacre, a 9 mm carbine 
rifle and a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the woman has not been named as a suspect and no  
arrests were imminent. He said he didn't know if she supplied the 
guns or, if she did, whether she knew what Harris and Klebold 
planned to do with them. He wouldn't say what information had led 
authorities to think she might have supplied the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	As for whether anyone other than Harris, Klebold and the young  
woman were under investigation, Thomas said: ``We believe more than 
three were certainly aware of it. Whether more than three were 
involved in it, that's really the essence of our investigation at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 students slain, three were being laid to rest today. A  
funeral was held this morning for Dave Sanders, a popular teacher 
praised for his bravery in shepherding students to safety during 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was and always will be a hero in my heart,'' niece Kim  
Sanders told mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine principal Frank De Angelis said Sanders' selflessness  
as a coach and teacher prepared him for his courage during the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hear what a hero Dave was on Tuesday,'' DeAngelis said.  
``But I need to tell you he was a hero before that. He impacted so 
many of our students and teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street came to a halt at noon EDT today to observe a minute  
of silence for the victims. Trading was halted at the New York 
Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, and on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, 70,000 students, friends, relatives and strangers  
turned a strip-mall parking lot into an arena of grief and promised 
each other they would reach past their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was a mass catharsis at the foot of the snow-capped  
Rockies. People hugged and wept as a parade of students, singers 
and public officials tried to make sense of the week's events. Many 
wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight -- even portable 
toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High  
School,'' Gov. Bill Owens said. ``One thing is clear: This 
community will not be beaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore told them: ``You are not alone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  
students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at 
Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate 
Columbine's overflow. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's graduation ceremony will be held May 22 at a  
suburban amphitheater normally used for rock concerts, a baby step 
toward normalcy and in defiance of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted death and destruction. Instead, we've all come  
together,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends 
Columbine. ``They can't kill the message. They can't kill the 
hope.''

	The Nasdaq composite was up 61.44 at 2,652.13, according to  
preliminary figures, its first close above 2,600 and easily 
surpassing its previous high of 2,598.81, set April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 28.92 at 10,718.59,  
within 9 points of a new high, after wobbling no more than 40 
points up or down throughout the day. The Dow ended Friday's 
session down 37 points at 10,689.67 but it reached two record 
closing highs last week, the latest one on Thursday at 10,727.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.19 at 1,360.04.  
</P>
<P>
	In a rare departure from the normal scramble on Wall Street,  
trading was halted for one minute of silence at noon on the New 
York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market 
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange in memory of the Colorado high 
school shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were back in the limelight today, as investors  
digested encouraging personal-computer sales data ahead of some key 
earnings reports in the computer sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Market research firms International Data Corp. found that  
worldwide PC shipments rose 19 percent in the first three months of 
the year, while Gartner Group Inc.'s Dataquest unit reported an 
increase of 17 percent. The reports, along with expectations that 
important Internet companies would report strong earnings, prompted 
aggressive buying of computer-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speculation in technology stocks continues to be the  
dominant theme,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ``It goes away for a while, 
but then it comes right back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which rose sharply last Friday on a strong earnings report,  
were up sharply again today. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of e-Bay soared on anticipation that the online auction  
company would report strong earnings after the close of trading 
today. In addition, eBay reached agreement to acquire auction house 
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield in a deal valued at $260 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com shares were higher as well, ahead of that company's  
earnings report, scheduled for release on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though investors were back buying technology, they did  
not completely abandon the shares of economically sensitive 
companies that had their day in the sun earlier this month. These 
cyclical shares had been briefly popular because they were viewed 
as a bargain by investors who have faith that the world economy is 
improving, a belief that remains strong on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 30 Dow components, for example, Minnesota Mining and  
Manufacturing was up 2, and Caterpillar was up more than 1. But 
Union Carbide shares were lower after the company said it wasn't 
sure how second-quarter earnings would turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumer stocks were also higher. Dow components Procter &AMP;  
Gamble and Coca-Cola were higher, although Johnson &AMP; Johnson and 
McDonald's were lower. Drug stocks fell, with Merck losing nearly 
2. Merck reported strong first-quarter earnings but they were tied 
mostly to benefits from its restructuring with Astra AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors had mixed reactions to earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust, for example, which this morning reported  
first-quarter profit numbers that beat Wall Street's estimates, was 
higher despite a general weakness in financial stocks that was tied 
to lower bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues had a small lead on advancers on the NYSE,  
where volume was moderately heavy but well below last week's heady 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo ended a mixed day  
down 0.03 percent. European indexes rose ahead of this week's 
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 
Seven leading industrial nations in Washington. In Frankfurt, 
Germany, the DAX index rose 1.17 percent, the FT-SE in London rose 
1.18 percent, and the CAC in Paris rose 0.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,398 up, 1,618 down and 537 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 706.61 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
741.49 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.47 to 638.83, and the American

<HEADLINE> Britain Bombings Reward Offered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- One minority leader warned today that volunteers  
will begin patrolling Southall, a racially mixed south London 
district, to prevent further bombings by a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and other organizations have posted an $80,000 reward for  
the arrest of the neo-Nazis from Combat 18 who have been attacking 
minorities, most recently setting a bomb off Saturday that injured 
seven people in Brick Hall, a district in London's East End. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan police Assistant Commissioner David Vaness said  
police feared ``a continuing series of vicious attacks,'' possibly 
spreading to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Suresh Gover said 100 volunteers from the Southall Monitoring  
Project and local mosques and temples would patrol Southall next 
Saturday wearing distinctive armbands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have suffered a long history of racial hostility ... but  
this is racial terrorism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group in the central England city of Leicester, the  
Montserrat Community Association, warned that vigilante groups 
might take to the streets if the attacks continue, the Times of 
London reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, in the second attack in eight days, a bomb exploded  
in Brick Lane, which has a high concentration of Bangladeshis. 
Combat 18 claimed responsibility for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was also among four far-right organizations that each  
claimed to have planted a nail bomb April 17 that injured 39 people 
in Brixton, a racially mixed south London neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the two attacks, both with crude nail bombs,  
appeared linked and were clearly racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, several black lawmakers reported receiving  
threatening letters signed by ``White Wolves,'' a name that has 
cropped up before under racist threats. 
</P>
<P>
	London's Sunday Telegraph reported that a 15-page document  
signed ``White Wolves'' and giving instructions on orchestrating a 
bombing campaign was faxed to a radio station a week before the 
Brixton bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Britain's largest Asian community newspapers also  
received a threatening letter from the ``White Wolves,'' its editor 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's state-funded Commission for Racial Equality said the  
bombings were a backlash against an official inquiry into the 
bungled police investigation of the fatal stabbing of a black 
London teen-ager in 1993. The report, released in February, said 
the London police force was riddled with racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Five white youths suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence have  
never been successfully prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chairman Claude Moreas said far-right elements  
``don't like the idea of lifting the rock and seeing racism 
underneath.''

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Colo. Teens Wanted 'Big Kill' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who killed 13 people at  
Columbine High wanted to kill at least 500 others, attack nearby 
homes and then hijack a plane and crash it into New York City, 
investigators said today. Authorities also were questioning an 
18-year-old girl about whether she purchased two guns used in the 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone earlier told reporters the  
goal of the killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, was to strike 
during the busy lunch hour to go for ``a big kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But sheriff's department spokesman Steve Davis said the gunmen's  
diary indicates that if they survived, they wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to kill 500 people, hijack a plane and take it to  
New York City,'' Davis said. ``If in fact they were able to carry 
out the entire plan, there could have been quite a bit more damage 
and quite a few more fatalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the gunmen were thinking of New York, he said: ``I  
have no idea. Maybe the density of population, for all I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose when you first hear it, you think that it's some  
horrible fantasy,'' District Attorney Dave Thomas told NBC's 
``Today'' show. ``But we now know that at least the first portion 
of those planned activities were in fact carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we also know that had a couple of the devices  
in the school actually detonated as they had planned, the death 
toll could have been much higher than it was,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail was found in  
Harris' bedroom, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the pair, enraged by what they considered insults  
from classmates, rampaged through their school with guns and bombs 
before turning their weapons on themselves. Investigators, amazed 
at the sheer firepower, are trying to determine if others were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said an 18-year-old woman, described as Klebold's  
girlfriend, was being questioned about whether she had purchased 
two of the four firearms used in Tuesday's massacre, a 9 mm carbine 
rifle and a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the woman has not been named as a suspect and no  
arrests were imminent. He said he didn't know if she supplied the 
guns or, if she did, whether she knew what Harris and Klebold 
planned to do with them. He wouldn't say what information had led 
authorities to think she might have supplied the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	As for whether anyone other than Harris, Klebold and the young  
woman were under investigation, Thomas said: ``We believe more than 
three were certainly aware of it. Whether more than three were 
involved in it, that's really the essence of our investigation at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 students slain, three were being laid to rest today. A  
funeral was held this morning for Dave Sanders, a popular teacher 
praised for his bravery in shepherding students to safety during 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was and always will be a hero in my heart,'' niece Kim  
Sanders told mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine principal Frank De Angelis said Sanders' selflessness  
as a coach and teacher prepared him for his courage during the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hear what a hero Dave was on Tuesday,'' DeAngelis said.  
``But I need to tell you he was a hero before that. He impacted so 
many of our students and teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street came to a halt at noon EDT today to observe a minute  
of silence for the victims. Trading was halted at the New York 
Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, and on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, 70,000 students, friends, relatives and strangers  
turned a strip-mall parking lot into an arena of grief and promised 
each other they would reach past their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was a mass catharsis at the foot of the snow-capped  
Rockies. People hugged and wept as a parade of students, singers 
and public officials tried to make sense of the week's events. Many 
wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight -- even portable 
toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High  
School,'' Gov. Bill Owens said. ``One thing is clear: This 
community will not be beaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore told them: ``You are not alone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  
students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at 
Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate 
Columbine's overflow. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's graduation ceremony will be held May 22 at a  
suburban amphitheater normally used for rock concerts, a baby step 
toward normalcy and in defiance of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted death and destruction. Instead, we've all come  
together,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends 
Columbine. ``They can't kill the message. They can't kill the 
hope.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Many Wary on School Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four in 10 high school students and nearly  
half of parents questioned in a new poll say it's likely that a 
Littleton, Colo.-style attack could take place at their school. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the students also answered yes when asked if  
any of their fellow students might be troubled enough to do 
something like last week's slayings at Columbine High School in 
suburban Denver, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students shocked the nation a week ago when they shot their  
way through the high school, killing 12 students and a teacher 
before shooting themselves to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the students considered the chances likely that  
such an attack could happen at their school, against 58 percent who 
considered it unlikely, and 49 percent of parents said the chances 
were likely, opposed to 48 percent who said it was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that 23 percent of students and parents  
considered violence a serious problem at their school, while 77 
percent of teens and 76 percent of parents did not. The poll said 
88 percent of students felt safe at their school, while 11 percent 
felt unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, taken by International Communications Research, was  
conducted by telephone April 22-25 among a national sampling of 500 
high school students and 522 parents of students. The margin of 
error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Anaheim's Grimson Out for One Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anaheim wing Stu Grimson was suspended for one  
game Monday by the NHL for cross-checking Detroit's Kris Draper 
during Game 3 of their Western Conference quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	The cross-check occurred in Sunday's game at 3:04 of the second  
period when Grimson delivered a check to Draper's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimson will miss Game 4 of the series, Tuesday night at  
Anaheim. He is eligible to return for Game 5, if necessary, on 
April 29 at Detroit. The Red Wings lead the best-of-7 series 3-0.

<HEADLINE> The World of Automated Annoyances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Technology hasn't eliminated life's annoyances and irritations,  
it has merely automated them. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider some bumps encountered on a recent drive along  
Technology Highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Expert Software, of Coral Gables, Fla., sent Expert Anti-Virus  
for review consideration with an attractive $14.99 price tag. 
Installation went pretty much as advertised. On system restart, the 
software pronounced the system virus-free and then went wherever it 
is that anti-virus software goes to stand guard. 
</P>
<P>
	It's outstanding at preventing virus infection from the Net,  
because any attempt by Netscape Navigator 4.51 to start Java 
instantly froze the system. There wasn't even time for Windows to 
whine out an error message. 
</P>
<P>
	When Expert Anti-Virus was uninstalled, Netscape worked just  
fine again. A call to Expert's tech support got a response that 
began with a pitch for ``stocking stuffers,'' which, in April, was 
either very late or very early. Finally, a human being answered, 
who noted the problem and took the phone number and e-mail address. 
Results pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the Web design genius corps that puts text in white  
letters against a dark background. Printing the page from the 
browser produces white letters, which are basically illegible on 
the white paper commonly stocked in printers. 
</P>
<P>
	And you can't be a certified techie without a satellite dish,  
right? But that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
	After DirecTV, a direct-to-home satellite TV service, stopped  
working at the house, a call to DirecTV's 800 help-line quickly 
determined that the satellite was still in the sky and eliminated 
the common causes of signal loss -- accidentally moving the dish, 
blocking its view of the satellite, and loose cables. The system 
had been professionally and, it seemed, properly installed. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the two other components, the LNB and the receiver.  
The LNB is the widget at the focal point of the satellite dish that 
collects the signals. The receiver is the widget that converts the 
signal to viewable channels. 
</P>
<P>
	The helpful soul at DirecTV provided the help number of the  
receiver's manufacturer, Hughes Network Systems. And another 
concerned person, having taken down pertinent information, 
suggested some diagnostics with a voltmeter, something everyone has 
in the basement workshop, right? 
</P>
<P>
	The best thing to do when you don't understand why a piece of  
gear is cranky is to take it to an authorized dealer. That is, if 
you can find one. DirecTV's Web site generated a list of every 
dealer within 50 miles of Summit, N.J., but none offers Hughes 
equipment, although DirecTV and Hughes Networking Services are both 
units of Hughes Electronics, itself a unit of General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Now to find a voltmeter, something no one had to do when TV sets  
had rabbit ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Ain't technology grand?  
</P>
<P>
	Stay tuned.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> San Jose Reaches Critical Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Sharks need to stay out of  
the penalty box if they hope to catch the Colorado Avalanche in 
their first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche capitalized on San Jose penalties for a 3-1  
victory in the opening game Saturday night. Game 2 is set for 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, which finished fifth in the league on the power play  
during the season, was 2-for-8 with the man advantage in the opener 
at the San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it would be a key to our playoff success,'' Avalanche  
right wing Theoren Fleury said. ``We practiced it all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks are well aware of the opposition's talent.  
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be one little flaw,'' San Jose coach Darryl Sutter  
said. ``You can't have a weak couple of minutes against them, you 
can't have a weak shift against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series was started on Saturday in San Jose because of the  
mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The 
first two games originally were scheduled in Denver on Wednesday 
and Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	During the series, both teams will honor those slain -- the  
Sharks have stickers on their helmets and the Avalanche have 
patches on their jerseys reading CHS for Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to captain Joe Sakic's two goals and an assist,  
goaltender Patrick Roy helped Colorado's effort with 42 saves in 
Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy said the playoff future of the team depends on its proven  
ability to win on the road. The Avalanche finished 23-14-4 away 
from home this season, the fourth-best road record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success on the road is key to us winning the series,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, known for his postseason prowess, claimed his 100th career  
playoff victory in the opener, an ongoing NHL record. He is 16-3-1 
against the Sharks over his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get more traffic in front of him, and do a good  
job of getting the rebounds,'' Sharks left wing Jeff Friesen said. 
``We have to play more disciplined and play harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose goalie Mike Vernon, who stopped 28 shots, has 75  
postseason victories and Stanley Cup wins in Detroit and Calgary. 
However, his backup, Steve Shields, was hot down the stretch in the 
regular season while Vernon healed a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Vernon stays in goal on Monday night remained to be  
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask the coach. He makes all the decisions,''  
Vernon said. ``(But) I'm preparing myself like I'm playing.''

<HEADLINE> McCartney Painting Exhibit To Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Paul McCartney has something he can fall back on  
if this music thing doesn't work out: He paints. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 70 McCartney oil paintings, featuring John Lennon, Andy  
Warhol, David Bowie, Charlie Watts and other friends, are included 
in a show opening this weekend in the small town of Siegen, 
Germany, near Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are a couple of whimsical portraits of Queen  
Elizabeth II -- ``The Queen Getting a Joke'' and ``The Queen After 
Her First Cigarette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Beatle said he took up painting after his 40th  
birthday in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until then I had this big block in my head that only people  
who went to art school were allowed to paint,'' he said. ``But when 
I got to 40, I realized this block was madness. I wanted to paint 
and the only person not allowing me a canvas was me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Quotes from Sunday's memorial services for victims of the  
Columbine High School shooting: 

</P>
<P>
	``A tragedy like this could have torn this community apart, but  
instead it united this city and you have become a family. We have 
seen people coming together in a way that we never could have 
imagined. And that is an example to all of us and our entire 
nation.'' -- The Rev. Franklin Graham. 

</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday was your descent into hell. I don't know any way we  
can describe it.'' -- Denver Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, speaking 
to the parents of slain students Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly 
Fleming, 16. 

</P>
<P>
	``So much pain and no reason why.'' -- Singer Amy Grant, first  
line of her song. 

</P>
<P>
	``(God) forgive those who've created this tragedy, and by your  
grace, help us to forgive them as well.'' -- Archbishop Charles 
Chaput. 

</P>
<P>
	``All of us must change our lives to honor these children. More  
than ever, I realize that every one of us is responsible for all 
the children. There are children today hungering for their parents 
to become more involved in their schools and to fill the spiritual 
void in their lives. If you are a parent, your children need 
attention. If you are a grandparent, they need your time. If you do 
not have children, there are kids who need your example and 
presence.'' -- Vice President Al Gore. 

</P>
<P>
	``Coach Sanders, I love you and I will miss you. I know that  
each day your memory will push me to become a better person and to 
live my life to its fullest.'' -- Amber Burgess, student. 

</P>
<P>
	``We just wrote this song in dedication and pray that God's  
comfort can come through it. Everyone has been affected by it.'' -- 
Jonathan Cohen before he and his brother sang ``Friend of Mine.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``Friends, we've lost too many treasured lives. But we are here  
today to celebrate that these Coloradans from Columbine High 
School, they graced our lives these sons and daughters, students 
and teacher, friends and neighbors brought joy and hope into our 
world. Let us honor and celebrate them.'' -- Colorado Gov. Bill 
Owens. 

</P>
<P>
	``I always knew this school was very strong and this is a good  
community, and all the kids love each other. But to see the kids 
and the community come together was just amazing.'' -- Scott 
Rathbun, a senior at Columbine. 

</P>
<P>
	``If they (the killers) would have know the revival they have  
started, they never would have done what they did. They wanted 
death and destruction. Instead, we've all come together. I 
guarantee if they knew what was going to happen, they wouldn't have 
done this. ... They can't kill the message, they can't kill the 
hopes.'' -- Phyllis Cain, the mother of a Columbine student. 

</P>
<P>
	``Our brilliance has developed technology that affords even  
children the networking and the know-how to be effective, if not 
sophisticated, mass killers. But we can't seem to show them why not 
to be killers in the first place.'' -- The Rev. Richard R. 
Wolschlaeger at Swarthmore Presbyterian Church in Swarthmore, Pa. 

</P>
<P>
	``I pray that you will not let bitterness poison your soul, that  
you'll turn to faith and trust God, even if we cannot understand.'' 
-- The Rev. Franklin Graham.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Suspect Hid Dark Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) -- Identified as the prime suspect  
in the deaths of two college students, Rex Allen Krebs says he's a 
monster and deserves to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he certainly kept that dark side from his girlfriend,  
co-workers and other locals who met him as he went about his 
business in this close-knit university town on California's central 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Jailed last month on unrelated parole violations, Krebs has been  
linked by police to the deaths of Aundria Crawford and Rachel 
Newhouse, both 20. Their bodies were pulled from his property 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two girls are dead. If I'm not a monster, then what am  
I?'' Krebs said Saturday in an interview with The Fresno Bee at San 
Luis Obispo County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	He also apologized to the parents of the two women and told the  
newspaper he hopes to receive the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they give it to me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Crawford, a Cuesta College sophomore, was kidnapped March 12  
from her duplex near downtown. Ms. Newhouse, a junior at California 
Polytechnic State University, was assaulted near the Amtrak station 
last Nov. 12 as she walked home from a fraternity party at a local 
bar. Her blood was found on a nearby bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Jim Gardiner, noting that investigators had been  
able to link the two cases only within the past two weeks, said 
today that murder, kidnap and possibly other charges were expected 
to be filed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe he acted alone in each of these cases. There's no  
evidence that he's been involved in any other crimes in this 
area,'' Gardiner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardiner told a news conference that autopsies showed the women  
had been asphyxiated, but he released no other information on how 
the killings were carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for the bodies was prompted by a parole officer's  
discovery of property from one of the victims at Krebs' home. 
Gardiner would not say what was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Krebs, a 33-year-old registered sex offender, has been in  
custody since March 20 on possession of a simulated weapon and 
alcohol -- both parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he was named the ``sole suspect,'' Krebs didn't come  
across as someone who was hiding a criminal past. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to the community eight months ago, not long after  
serving 10 years in a state prison for rape, sodomy, assault with 
intent to commit rape and three burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Krebs was living in a home in Davis Canyon, a remote area about  
a mile from a road that snakes nearly 15 miles behind Avila Beach. 
Neighbors sometimes go months without seeing each other. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an employee at a lumber store near downtown and  
socialized with his co-workers. He shopped at one of the two Lucky 
grocery stores in town, and had a couple of favorite watering 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was Carlin's BBQ &AMP; Brew, where he usually joined  
co-workers for lunch. He often sat on the patio with his pit bull, 
Buddy. Sometimes his 23-year-old girlfriend -- who Krebs said was 
pregnant with his child -- came along, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Wilkins, a 22-year-old Cal Poly student who lives across  
the street from Carlin's, said he and his roommates often saw Krebs 
there alone or with his dog, especially Tuesday nights, when beers 
are 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd be over there many times,'' Wilkins said. ``We talked  
about his dog a lot. He seemed like a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So nice, Wilkins said, that he and his roommates would invite  
Krebs over for after-hour bonfires. He can't remember if Krebs ever 
came, and said he last saw him a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggie Romweber, a 23-year-old Cal Poly senior, recalls seeing  
Krebs at a local liquor store. Like many other residents, she finds 
it disturbing and slightly eerie that such a man could be living in 
the community without raising much suspicion, and come across as 
such a regular guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' she said, adding how she and her friends have  
taken extra safety precautions -- changing daily running routes, 
getting escorts to their cars at night, not walking around downtown 
after dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps even more upsetting is that Krebs' girlfriend, who child  
is due in four months, was apparently not aware of his alleged 
involvement with the disappearances of Crawford and Newhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leave her out of this,'' Krebs told the Bee. ``She doesn't  
know anything.''

<HEADLINE> Kings' Webber Misses Warriors Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento Kings forward Chris Webber,  
who leads the NBA with an average of 13 rebounds per game, missed 
Monday night's game against the Golden State Warriors because of 
lower back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, second in the league with 42 minutes per game, was  
forced to leave Saturday's win over Dallas with 4:20 left in the 
third quarter because of the back spasms. He also missed three 
games in late March with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, who ranks 13th in the league in scoring with 20.1 points  
per game, returned briefly in that game against Dallas but could 
not finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Webber did not travel with the Kings to Monday  
night's game at Golden State, in hopes he'll be ready to play 
Tuesday night at home against San Antonio.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth, US West Appeals Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal in  
which two of the nation's largest local phone companies accused 
Congress of unlawfully restricting how they provide sports scores, 
stock quotes and other electronic publishing services. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the  
restrictions violate the companies' free-speech rights and 
represent a ``bill of attainder'' that targets only five regional 
Bell telephone companies for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenges were filed by lawyers for BellSouth and US West.  
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth's appeal called the restrictions, contained in the  
Telecommunications Act of 1996, ``an unprecedented targeted ban on 
an otherwise lawful ... line of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court upheld the challenged restrictions last  
year but the justices were told that ruling, ``if permitted to 
stand, would set a dangerous blueprint for the evisceration of 
fundamental constitutional guarantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the five Baby Bells provide more than 80 percent of  
the local phone service in the United States. Last January, the 
justices rejected appeals aimed at overturning provisions in the 
1996 law that make it exceedingly difficult for those five 
companies to break into the $90 billion long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	Today' court action focused on just one part of the 1996 law, a  
provision that requires the Baby Bells to provide electronic 
publishing services through separate subsidiaries. The provision 
does not apply to other local phone companies, such as GET or 
Southern New England Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Having to go through a separate subsidiary to provide electronic  
publishing services raises the expense, leaving the regional phone 
companies at a competitive disadvantage, the appeals said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other Baby Bells are SBC Communications, Bell Atlantic  
and Ameritech. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the 1996 law took effect, Baby Bells had used their basic  
telephone service to provide certain electronic publishing 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenged provision, however, was created by Congress to be  
in effect for only four years -- until Feb. 8, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that limited duration, Justice Department lawyers urged  
the court to reject the two appeals. ``Any decision ... would ... 
have very limited practical significance even if the decision could 
be issued before the parties' dispute becomes moot,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government lawyers also noted that the appeals rejected in  
January also raised bill-of-attainder arguments. ``Nothing has 
happened in the intervening weeks to make (high court review) more 
appropriate now than it was then,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are BellSouth vs. FCC, 98-1046, and US West vs. FCC,  
98-1153.

<HEADLINE> Low Pay May Deter Truck Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Trucks with bald tires, worn brakes and loose  
bolts are being allowed to barrel down Illinois and Indiana roads 
because of a shortage of inspectors, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint investigation, the Chicago Sun-Times and Post-Tribune  
of Gary, Ind., found that both their states do fewer in-depth 
inspections, take fewer truckers off the roads and invest fewer 
resources in truck safety than other states with comparable 
commercial traffic volume. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, key stretches of highway are left without surprise  
inspections for weeks at a time because there are only 56 state 
troopers conducting inspections -- one for every 45,551 trucks 
registered, the newspapers reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana has 32 state troopers assigned to commercial vehicle  
code enforcement full time and 20 part time. The state also uses 
civilian inspectors -- currently 105 -- said Lt. Col. Dean Petree of 
the Indiana State Police Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Division. 
</P>
<P>
	But largely because of the low wages paid to civilian  
inspectors, many of those positions remain unfilled. Since 1995, 
starting pay has been frozen at $16,190 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more inspectors,'' said Jerry Bell, assistant vice  
president of the National Association of Independent Insurers in 
Des Plaines. ``It doesn't take many unsafe vehicles to create 
absolute carnage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two states also do not conduct many intensive inspections,  
the newspapers reported. Of the 89,680 inspections in Illinois in 
1997, only 18.7 percent were intensive -- Level I -- checks in which 
everything from brakes to driver's logs and medical certificates 
are examined. Indiana did 88,051 inspections in 1997, 30.1 percent 
of them Level I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun-Times said that other states with heavy truck traffic,  
such as New York and California, do intensive inspections 80 
percent of the time or more. Nationally, 43.6 percent of 
inspections are of the most thorough variety. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois ranks near the bottom in the nation for the number of  
vehicles it takes out of service -- 14 percent of trucks and buses 
inspected -- and drivers it orders off the road -- 5.1 percent of 
those inspected. Indiana idles 15.5 percent of inspected trucks and 
buses and 6.5 percent of drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the average for vehicles taken out of service is  
20.4 percent and the average for drivers taken out of service is 
7.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1996 and 1997, fatalities in large-truck crashes rose 14  
percent in Illinois, resulting 166 deaths. In Indiana, deaths were 
down 9 percent, to 157, during the same period.

<HEADLINE> IOC Honors Late Lord Killanin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee led  
tributes today for Lord Killanin, who headed the organization 
during a turbulent period that included the 1976 and 1980 Olympic 
boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin, who had been ill for a long time, died Sunday at his  
home in Dublin. The cause of death was not announced. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was elected the sixth president of the IOC in 1972 at  
age 50, taking over from Avery Brundage just after the massacre of 
Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Munich massacre was followed in 1976 by the African boycott  
of the debt-ridden Montreal Olympics. And in 1980 the Americans led 
a boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion 
of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	When Killanin stepped down as IOC president in 1980, the IOC was  
on the verge of bankruptcy and the Olympics were threatened with 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, his successor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, has turned  
the Olympics into a multibillion dollar industry, which is 
currently suffering its worst corruption crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is grateful to president Killanin for leading the  
Olympic movement through the difficult period of political turmoil 
in the 1970s,'' Samaranch said in a statement today from IOC 
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. ``His presidency was 
decisive for the survival of the Olympic ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch joined IOC staff in observing a minute's silence for  
Killanin, and the Olypmic flag was flown at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC statement noted that Killanin had played a moderating  
role in disputes between China and Taiwan, and succeeded in 
bringing China back into the Olympic fold. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Killanin always  
represented Ireland at home and abroad with style, distinction and 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a charismatic and dynamic individual who was passionate  
about every task he took on,'' Ahern said. ``We are deeply indebted 
to him and his family for his long years of public service to Irish 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his eight-year tenure, Killanin was known for  
democratizing the IOC, bringing in younger blood and breaking with 
the tradition of appointing only older aristocrats. He also 
expanded the membership from 71 to 89 members. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the key reforms under his presidency was the relaxation  
of the rule on amateurism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe in professional Olympics, I do not believe in  
open Olympics, but I think we have to recognize we are about to 
enter the last quarter of the 20th century,'' Killanin said shortly 
after his election. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first sign that reforms in eligibility rules, which  
Brundage had fought so vigorously, would be introduced. And in 
1974, the word amateur was removed from the Olympic Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be remembered as a genial reformer who spread goodwill  
and laughter and quietly discarded the worn-out ideas of a past 
age,'' said author Geoffrey Miller in his 1979 book, ``Behind the 
Olympic Rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was appointed to the IOC in 1952 and moved up the  
hierarchy to eventually become senior vice president. He accepted 
the IOC presidency only on condition that his expenses were paid, 
which was a break in the tradition of the presidency being only the 
preserve of rich men. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin represented a stark contrast in personality and  
leadership style from Brundage, who was widely regarded as an 
autocrat during his 20-year tenure 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was credited with a more consultative style. He was  
known for his discretion and diplomacy. He avoided controversial 
statements and sought to divert attention from himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was born Michael Morris in London on July 30, 1914. His  
mother was Australian and his father was an officer in the Irish 
Guards. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeded to his title in 1927 when his uncle died. He was  
the third holder of the peerage which Queen Victoria bestowed on 
his grandfather, who was chief justice of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was educated at Eton College, the Sorbonne in Paris and  
at Cambridge University before embarking on a career in journalism 
in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked at the Daily Express and was a war correspondent in  
China in 1937 for the Daily Mail and was a D-Day veteran. After the 
war, he wrote a political column. He later became a film producer, 
making such movies as ``The Playboy of the Western World'' and 
``The Quiet Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was also an author and art critic.  
</P>
<P>
	Irish Sports Minister John McDaid said Killanin's ``status and  
the worldwide esteem in which he was held in Olympic circles was a 
source of pride for all Irish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pipe-smoking peer was himself a keen sportsman. He rowed,  
boxed and played rugby at school before moving on to favor horse 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

	Cops: Colo. Gunmen Wanted 500 Dead  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two students who killed 13 people at  
Columbine High School wanted to kill at least 500 classmates and 
teachers, attack neighborhood homes and then hijack a plane and 
crash it into New York City, investigators said. They also said 
today they plan to question an 18-year-old girl about whether she 
purchased any firearms used in the rampage. In an interview 
published today in The Denver Post, Jefferson County Sheriff John 
Stone said the gunmen's diary indicates that if they survived, they 
wanted to ``hijack an airplane and crash it into a major city.'' He

president, said he hopes a doctor would visit the soldiers on 
Tuesday. He gave no information about their physical condition. It 
is the first time any outside visitor has been allowed to see the 
soldiers, who were taken captive near the Macedonian border March 
31. Sommaruga also met today with Yugoslav President Slobodan

	India To Hold Early Elections

<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India will hold its third national

opposition parties failed to cobble together a coalition to replace 
the collapsed Hindu nationalist government. The election in India 
must be held within six months, but no date was immediately set. 
The announcement came after more than a week of political turmoil, 
which began when a coalition led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee was defeated April 17 by one vote in a parliamentary 
confidence ballot.

	China Considers Protest Reaction  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese leaders wrestled today with the challenge  
presented by a popular group that surprised authorities and held 
the largest protest in Beijing since the crushing of the Tiananmen 
Square democracy movement 10 years ago. Government leaders decided 
to act publicly as if Sunday's protest by 10,000 people never 
happened. They ordered official silence by all government offices 
and news media on the protest, according to an official who 
attended the meeting. The reaction underscores the unease China's 
leadership feels about the demonstrators, followers of a martial 
arts master who teaches a form of meditation and exercise known as 
Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> Interview Sought With McDougal Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr's  
office said Monday it wants to talk to jurors who acquitted Susan 
McDougal of obstruction charges to see whether she should be 
retried on two contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Post-trial contacts with the trial jurors may help save the  
United States, the court and the defendant from undergoing another 
judicial proceeding ...'' prosecutor Julie Myers said in a court 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos objected to the request,  
saying federal rules do not allow an inquiry into the ``mental 
processes or the juror deliberation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted Mrs. McDougal on April 12 of the obstruction  
charge but deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal on the contempt 
charges. The judge declared a mistrial on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office is trying to determine whether it would be worth  
it to go to trial on the outstanding charges, which stem from Mrs. 
McDougal's refusal to answer grand jury questions about President 
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal says she refused to cooperate with Starr's office  
because he wanted her to lie against the Clintons, her former 
business partners in the failed Whitewater land development in 
Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Paper Giant Sells Packaging Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The maker of Quilted Northern bathroom  
tissue, Brawny paper towels and Dixie cups has agreed to sell its 
packaging business for $830 million to the Golden, Colo.-based ACX 
Technologies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort James Corp., the third largest producer of folding cartons  
in the United States, decided to sell the packaging operations so 
it could focus on tissue, paper towels and other consumer products 
for which it is best known, chairman and chief executive Miles 
Marsh announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which will make ACX the largest folding carton  
producer in the United States, is expected to be completed by 
mid-1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 Fort James facilities to be sold make folding cartons and  
health-care and microwave packaging for packaged good companies. 
The facilities have 2,600 employees and last year reported sales of 
$590 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale involves 12 folding carton converting plants, along  
with a paperboard mill in Kalamazoo, Mich. The plants are located 
in Kalamazoo; Charlotte, N.C.; Garden Grove, Calif.; Gordonsville, 
Tenn.; Kendalville, Ind.; Menasha and Wausau, Wis.; Newnan, Ga.; 
North Portland and Portland, Ore.; Perrysburg, Ohio; and 
Mississauga, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included in the transaction are Fort James' two bleached  
paperboard machines at the company's Pennington, Ala. towel and 
tissue mill.

<HEADLINE> Brits, AT&AMP;T Buy Into Japan Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC will  
take a combined 30 percent stake in Japan Telecom Co. for $1.84 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first joint investment by AT&AMP;T and BT since the two  
companies announced plans last summer their intention to form a 
global venture to serve international business customers and 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has one of the largest concentrations of multinational  
companies in the world,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and 
chief executive of AT&AMP;T. ``It's an essential growth opportunity for 
all three companies and it is essential that the global venture 
have a strong distributor in this key market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T and BT will each hold a 15 percent stake in  
Japan Telecom, the companies said in a statement on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firms are planning a broad alliance in which AT&AMP;T and  
BT will integrate most of their Japanese operations with Japan 
Telecom's units. In addition, the two companies will dispatch 
executives to the Japanese firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times reported that BT is paying $1 billion and  
its Japanese assets, worth $257 million, will be folded into Japan 
Telecom. AT&AMP;T is reportedly paying $209 million in cash and 
contributing assets worth $435 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A holding company will be established in which BT will have a 20  
percent interest and AT&AMP;T 10 percent. The stake will be jointly 
managed by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom had reportedly been looking for a partner to  
survive tough competition, with many Japanese telecom companies 
cutting rates for domestic and international calls. It is Japan's 
third-largest long-distance and international carrier, serving more 
than 17 million customers. It also has stakes in digital mobile 
companies that serve 6 million customers. Its biggest shareholder 
is East Japan Railway Co. being the biggest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the largest long-distance and international carrier in  
the United States, while BT is Britain's biggest telecom company. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is the latest in a wave of recent telecom deals.  
Last week, Deutsche Telekom AG and Telecom Italia SpA announced 
plans to merge in an $82 billion deal, while AT&AMP;T launched a 
surprise $58 billion bid for cable company MediaOne Group.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Stress Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For 118 minutes over two games, the  
Philadelphia Flyers shut down the high-scoring Toronto Maple Leafs 
with a combination of tight checking, great goaltending and 
excellent penalty killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Two goals in the last couple minutes of Game 2 solved that  
problem and lifted Toronto to a stunning 2-1 win that evened the 
best-of-7 Stanley Cup playoff series at a game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect the Flyers to stray from their defense-first  
strategy when the two teams resume their first-round series today 
in Philadelphia, Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put it out of the zone and chase you down. And they're  
going to force you to beat them to bring it out,'' Quinn said of 
the Flyers' game plan. ``We bought ourselves a breather evening the 
series up and hopefully we can go into Philly and take a step 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers would like to do the same thing and get the  
third-period collapse in Game 2 out of their minds about as quickly 
as a Maple Leaf odd-man rush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen quick in the playoffs,'' defenseman Eric  
Desjardins said after practice Sunday. ``You think about what 
happens in the past and the first thing you know it's over, and 
you're golfing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So instead the Flyers tried to concentrate on the good things.  
Take away Game 2's last two minutes and the ``Broad Street 
Bullies'' certainly lived up to their nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie John Vanbiesbrouck had been superb in goal in the first  
game, holding the highest-scoring team in the league without a 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Philly led 1-0 going into the third behind Keith  
Jones' acrobatic goal, good forechecking and their outstanding 
penalty killing. In one stretch of three Toronto power plays, the 
Flyers had three scoring chances while allowing one relatively 
harmless shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn took particular notice.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been slow to move the puck and a lot of it is because  
they've been very aggressive. And their checking has been 
excellent,'' he said. ``We've got to move the puck from the defense 
to the forwards faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mats Sundin, whose goal with 52.4 seconds left clinched  
Toronto's dramatic win, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems we can't get any chances to get 2-on-1s or get our  
momentum going or our transition game,'' said Sundin, who led 
Toronto in the regular season with 83 points. ``We played pretty 
well defensively, too. If we have to win this way, it's nice to see 
we can do it, that we can play strong defensively, and be patient 
and wait for our chances to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be a little tougher on Philadelphia's home ice, even  
without star center Eric Lindros, who is still recovering from a 
collapsed right lung. The Flyers' 21-9-11 record tied the Boston 
Bruins for the best home mark in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Games 3 and 4 are in Philadelphia today and Wednesday, and Game  
5, if necessary, will be back at the Air Canada Centre on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Flyers defenseman Chris Therien would prefer if they  
could wrap up the series before Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played a really solid game but now it's back to our barn,''  
said Therien, who allowed Steve Thomas to cut around him late in 
the third period Saturday and score the game-tying goal. ``We 
wanted the two wins but everybody is pretty positive about how 
we're playing and know how we have to play to be successful.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Up in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose moderately Tuesday morning  
following a surge in share prices of U.S. technology companies in 
New York. The dollar gained against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 77.86 points, or 0.46 percent, to  
finish the morning session at 16,996.37. On Monday, it lost 4.74 
points, or 0.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.40 yen at late morning, up 0.54 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its level of 119.26 yen of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, investors bid up shares of  
high-tech companies on the back of a rally in technology-related 
stocks in New York on Monday, traders said. That helped buoy the 
broader market, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	But players remained somewhat reluctant to take aggressive  
positions ahead of an upcoming string of national holidays in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dealers are lessening the positions they take ahead of the  
holidays,'' said Hidenori Karaki, general manager of the stock 
division at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's ``Golden Week'' holidays start April 29 and last through  
next week. Tokyo financial markets will be closed on April 29 and 
May 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said share prices were little affected by Monday's  
meeting of top finance officials from the world's major economies 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement from the Group of Seven industrialized  
nations, issued at the meeting's conclusion, said it is essential 
``that Japan implement stimulus measures until growth is restored, 
using all available tools to support strong, domestic demand-led 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of the G7 show no change to the direction of  
current policy,'' Karaki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 6.17 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,350.01. 
The TOPIX had risen 8.37 points, or 0.63 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 28.92  
points Monday to close at 10,718.59, while the technology-oriented 
Nasdaq composite shot up 61.36 points to a new record high of 
2,652.05. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher against the yen as  
dealers covered short, or oversold, positions after Japan's Finance 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters his nation doesn't plan any 
new economic stimulus measures, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 126.62 yen, up from  
126.17 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.465  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.490 percent, driving its price up 
to 102.94 yen from 102.71 yen.

<HEADLINE> Wis. School Uses Metal Detectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) -- Students at a high school walked through  
metal detectors Monday after investigators found a Web page that 
targeted 17 students on a ``hit list'' and mentioned the 
``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 650 of Oshkosh West High School's 1,800 students attended a  
full day of classes after parents chose to keep children at home, 
Principal Keith Rodda said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site specifically mentioned the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' a  
group linked to the two gunmen in last week's school massacre in 
Littleton, Colo., and expressed anger toward ``jocks and 
minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People, like everywhere else, are afraid,'' Rodda said.  
</P>
<P>
	Oshkosh Police Lt. David Rapp said he was confident  
investigators would track down whoever created the page. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wimberley, Texas, students returned to a junior high school  
Monday as four classmates accused of plotting a potentially deadly 
attack at Danforth Junior High remained in juvenile custody. 
</P>
<P>
	A search of the suspects' homes turned up crude explosive  
devices and gunpowder, as well as computer disks and Internet 
documents about bomb-making, authorities said.

<HEADLINE>  China Weighs Response to Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese leaders wrestled today with the challenge  
presented by a popular group that surprised authorities and held 
the largest protest in Beijing since the crushing of the Tiananmen 
Square democracy movement 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Government leaders met to form a strategy and decided to act  
publicly as if Sunday's protest by 10,000 people in the heart of 
Beijing never happened. They ordered official silence by all 
government offices and news media on the protest, according to an 
official who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction underscores the unease China's communist leadership  
feels about the demonstrators, followers of a martial arts master 
who teaches a form of meditation and exercise known as Falun Gong. 
</P>
<P>
	The police presence in central Beijing remained heavy today.  
Police also visited political dissidents not known to be affiliated 
to the group, asking their opinions about Sunday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters made a powerful display of their group's potential  
strength both in their numbers and discipline. All day Sunday, they 
stood or sat in silence on the sidewalks outside Zhongnanhai, the 
compound housing China's leadership, and dispersed peacefully late 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, Premier Zhu Rongji intervened personally to  
try to defuse the protest, meeting with several representatives of 
the demonstrators, said the government official. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1992 by Li Hongzhi, a martial arts master who now  
lives in New York, Falun Gong offers a blend of meditation, 
exercise and repackaged ideas from Buddhism and Taoism. At least 70 
million Chinese follow Li's teachings, according to an official 
government estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun followers converged on Beijing to protest an incident in  
Tianjin, a port city 60 miles southeast of the capital, said Rong 
Yi, a spokeswoman for Li in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Tianjin youth magazine ran an article maligning Falun  
Gong, practitioners staged a protest and police used force to drive 
away the Falun believers, briefly detaining some, Yi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was also having problems getting Falun books published  
in China, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's protesters wanted the central government to clarify its  
stand on Falun and ensure the group can practice legally, Yi and 
participants the protest said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government distributed a leaflet Sunday urging demonstrators  
to ignore rumors of a ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Yi said that Falun is not political or anti-government, but  
rather teaches practitioners to be good citizens and improve their 
health. ``It is inconceivable that the government is not 
recognizing these points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falun is one of the many schools of qigong, a traditional  
Chinese practice using meditation and martial arts exercises that 
attempt to channel powers and improve health. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Falun practitioners have openly but quietly limited  
their activities to group exercise and meditation in parks and 
followers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Their gathering Sunday seemed to defy a ban on mass gatherings  
that has prevented large protests in Beijing since the military 
assault on June 4, 1989, that ended the Tiananmen democracy 
demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Intel CEO Advises Asia on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Countries in the Asian Pacific region risk  
being left behind by the world economy unless they radically 
improve their infrastructure for access to the Internet, Craig 
Barrett, president and CEO of computer chip maker Intel Corp., said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet access in most parts of Asia is still seriously  
restricted by a lack of bandwidth -- a measure of how much data can 
be stuffed through the wires and cables of the country's 
telecommunications networks, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet access is going to be very important for every  
economy to allow it to grow and prosper,'' said Barrett. ``Right 
now, any country that wants to be an economic hub has to have 
bandwidth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many countries, the relatively high cost of Internet access  
keeps users away and limits the potential of the Internet to play a 
major role in the economy, Barrett said in a speech to students at 
National Taiwan University, the island's top school. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett, who is touring the region to promote Internet use,  
cited Intel's experience with e-commerce, or conducting business 
over the Internet, as an example of the potential inherent in the 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel began doing business over the Internet with some of its  
largest customers last summer. This year it expects that half of 
total revenue will come over the Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has made increasing bandwidth a priority for continued  
expansion of its core business -- the semiconductors that make 
computers work -- because the Internet is replacing actual computers 
as the engine of growth in the industry, Barrett said. In the 
United States Intel is part of a consortium developing a system 
that will increase the speed of Internet service by 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett praised Taiwan's computer design and manufacturing  
business but said the island's computer industry needs to move up 
the next rung of technology to develop workstations and servers 
that are the backbone of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, Intel's purchases of semiconductor, peripheral, and  
personal computer-related components from Taiwan manufacturers 
increased 200 percent to U.S. dlrs 400 million. Intel is based in 
Santa Clara, California.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Offering 'E-Cards' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com is entering the crowded electronic  
greeting card business, the rapidly growing online bookseller and 
general retailer announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Tuesday, Amazon will offer more than 800 cards in 45  
categories, all without charge or registration, some geared to 
annual occasions such as ``Kiss Your Mate Day'' this Tuesday, 
``Moment of Laughter Day'' Wednesday and ``Hairstylist Appreciation 
Day'' Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As with most e-cards, Amazon's offerings are designed for  
Internet viewing rather than for printing and mailing, said David 
Risher, senior vice president of product development. Card senders 
can design their own messages to accompany hundreds of 
illustrations, photographs and animations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting weekly and later daily, Amazon will also list the most  
popular and least popular selections, with the most popular sorted 
by category. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeting card Web sites have proliferated in recent years. Many,  
like Hallmark's hallmark.com, charge as much as $2.50. Others, like 
industry leader Blue Mountain Arts of Boulder, Colo., charge 
nothing and try to make money from online advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon's e-card site, accessible by link from the company's home  
page, also will be available at http://www.cards.amazon.com.

                        *William F. Achatz Jr.    	
</P>
<P>
	POTTSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Longtime Associated Press photo editor  
William F. Achatz Jr., who supervised photo coverage of the Korean 
War, Latin American revolutions and civil rights marches in 
Alabama, died Sunday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a down-to-earth, wonderful guy. He knew pictures,''  
said Paul Vathis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning AP photographer who 
worked with Achatz for many years. ``Treated us excellent. He knew 
what a photo was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vathis said during the Korean War, Achatz was able to get photos  
of a North Korean prisoner-of-war camp by persuading North Korean 
officials to let a captured photographer continue plying his trade 
while he was held. 
</P>
<P>
	Achatz was Vathis' editor in 1961, when Dwight D. Eisenhower and  
John F. Kennedy were meeting at Camp David. Vathis got a shot of 
the two men that no one else had by aiming his camera between a 
Secret Service man's legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He edited the picture that won me the Pulitzer Prize,'' said  
Vathis, one of three AP photographers who won Pulitzers under 
Achatz's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Achatz began working in journalism in 1931 at The Mercury, when  
it was established as Pottstown's second daily newspaper. He 
covered crime and government for 10 years before joining the Marine 
Corps and serving in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Achatz was hired by the AP as a photographer in 1946 in  
Harrisburg. He soon moved to Philadelphia to become photo editor 
for Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Before retiring from the AP in 1976, Achatz secured a front-row  
seat to many of the defining moments of the late 20th century. But 
he said his biggest thrill came in covering two murders for The 
Mercury, both of which resulted in executions.

	KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Manmohan Adhikari, Nepal's first  
communist prime minister, died today. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of  
Nepal collapsed during an election rally last week and slipped into 
a coma. He was declared brain dead on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Adhikari, who helped popularize communism in Nepal, became prime  
minister in November 1994. But his minority government was ousted 
in a vote of confidence nine months later. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected general-secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal  
in 1953 and remained its head until it merged with another 
communist group in 1990 to become the United Marxist-Leninist 
Communist Party of Nepal. He was elected its chairman the same 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He was part of a popular movement that stripped Nepal's King  
Birendra of absolute power and turned him into a constitutional 
monarch. Nepal became a multiparty democracy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Adhikari was elected to Nepal's lower house of parliament in  
1991 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a respected national leader, Adhikari could not prevent a  
split in his own party last year that reduced it to half its 
strength. He was fighting for its revival in the May 3 general 
elections in which he was contesting from Katmandu, the Nepalese 
capital.

nonprofit research firm that charted the South's trends and 
economic prospects, died Sunday after an apparent heart attack. He 
was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Autry was president for 32 years of MDC Inc., which issued  
reports on ``The State of the South'' in 1996 and 1998 and 
``Shadows in the Sunbelt,'' which warned Southern leaders against 
relying on low-wage, low-skill industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Autry graduated from Duke University in 1958 and earned a law  
degree from the school in 1961. He became chief counsel and staff 
director for the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, 
then chaired by Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C. 
</P>

	In 1967, Autry returned to his home state to head the North  
Carolina Manpower Development Corp., which later shortened its name 
to MDC Inc. as it took on a regional scope.

from an allergic reaction to something he ingested. He was 37.

dramatic helicopter rescue of a couple stranded atop their car 
during the January flood of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he won a Northern California Emmy Award for outstanding  
achievement in camera news for a portfolio featuring three videos 
with remarkable vantage points: aerial views of Lake Tahoe, scenes 
aboard the USS Nimitz in the Persian Gulf, and looking down on the 
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as it was being painted.
