IT'S TIME FOR BILL R. TO STEP ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, Bill, there is a way out. You have the blessing of
precedent, and it happened in your hometown.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia McCaskey can fire her son, so can you.
</P>
<P>
   A few details while you roll your eyes:
</P>
<P>
   Do you know that your son, Bill Bidwill Jr., recently received a
phone call from Jake Plummer? A call pleading for Lomas Brown. A
call that didn't produce the answer Plummer expected.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know that Eric Hill, a former employee, had a bachelor's
party in Las Vegas over the weekend? Do you know what some of your
current employees were saying?
</P>
<P>
   Same Old Bleeping Cardinals. And a few other things unfit to
print.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the qualified one _ player personnel boss Bob
Ferguson _ is stuck in an office watching film while your son is
crunching numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, aside from the quarterback, every recent negotiation
spearheaded by Bill Jr. has been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   For a time on Tuesday, Brown, in fact, wasn't a Brown. Wasn't a
Cardinal, either. Somewhere off in Bidwillian limbo, wondering
whether to block for Jake or crouch for Couch. And leaving us to
wonder whether a third party had once again emerged, trying to
rescue Brown and cover Junior's behind.
</P>
<P>
   You can haggle over Brown's worth. Or how a team sinks $30
million into a quarterback, slaps the franchise tag on a wide
receiver, only to waffle with a man designated to watch the
quarterback's back.
</P>
<P>
   You can dream of Matt Joyce or Anthony Clement filling the void
at left tackle. But you can't debate how the Cardinals have once
again arrived at their favorite intersection _ Vision and
Indecision _ and took the wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   This is bigger than Brown, more important than the momentum that
can be saved by signing Jamir Miller. This is, once again, about a
dysfunctional front office.
</P>
<P>
   And really, this is about you, Mr. Bidwill. About recognizing
the consequences. Remembering what nepotism smelled like under the
armpits of Buddy Ryan. Realizing how close you could be to the
trophy. And how far away you'll always be when blood runs thicker
than intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after Bill Jr. fumbled and couldn't close a deal with
Andre Wadsworth _ his popular brother had to swoop in and save the
day - conditions in Tempe worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bill Jr. wanted to prove himself. Maybe he chafed at the
bouquets constantly thrown at Ferguson. Whatever, he orchestrated
the Plummer deal all by himself. And, in some ways, he blew the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   That Ferguson was left out of the loop is an important note. The
Cardinals are $15 million under the cap and in a spot of trouble.
The rookie pool will eat up cap space. So will Moore and, perhaps,
Miller. Then what?
</P>
<P>
   Progressive organizations would seek out volunteers to
restructure their contracts, which requires signing bonuses. Except
the Cardinals are dry in that department, floating out $33.5
million of them over the last calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   Think. Was Plummer adamant over a $15 million bonus? Wouldn't
$12 million and a penny to punk Deion have done the trick? Of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Would Ferguson have envisioned this? The record speaks for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how you felt standing on that field in Dallas, two wins
from the Super Bowl? Surely, you can't doubt his judgment. ``His''
vision.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ferguson might have done Jake last. After everyone
else. Like, on May 15, a few days before that referendum you've
waited on for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there is negative energy. It's your son who's
raising voices while Ferguson is keeping quiet, wondering more and
more how he wants to spend the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's personality has caught fire in this town. He is more
BOB than Bob, like the ballpark but friendlier. A man who can sell
used cars and new stadiums. If you let him.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Bill Jr. needs to leave the organization. After
all, in Chicago, Michael McCaskey will get paid to attend tea
parties. Your son can simply be re-assigned.
</P>
<P>
   One man in charge. One to inflate the footballs. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Can we give Clyde Drexler extra power-rating
points for candor? Although his Cougars blew a ``million chances''
to obtain the fourth seed in the Conference USA tournament, he
admits they weren't exactly worthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our record,'' Drexler said, ``it would have been a
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'd have taken it,'' he admitted. ``Yes, we would have.''
</P>
<P>
   So scrambled was the C-USA tournament picture that Houston
tumbled eight spots by losing a three-point game on the final
evening of the regular season. It's unlikely any team in any
conference ever suffered such theoretically grave consequences
because of a single misstep, the result of, among many gaffes, the
Cougars' bricking 17 of 29 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler must have had some painful flashbacks during the ugly
ordeal against Marquette on Saturday night. After all, in his final
game as a player for UH, he saw a seemingly sure-fire NCAA
championship slip from his grasp because he and his Phi Slama Jama
frat brothers found the charity line to be the most uncharitable
place on earth at exactly the wrong moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   That long-ago defeat at the hands of North Carolina State will
hurt forever. What happened against Marquette, however, had no real
bearing on how the world will judge Clyde's debut year as a coach.
These Cougars, minus the two best players off a team that went 9-20
a year ago, weren't supposed to go anywhere, and they won't. Bye or
no bye, they're destined for a quick bye-bye here in Birmingham,
Drexler's mild protestations to the contrary notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   While he senses the Cougars are demoralized by the unhappy way
their season ended, like any coach who ever lived, Clyde wants to
believe good things are still possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we start over,'' he said. ``Our core guys know what needs
to be done. It's a one-game elimination. It gives you a chance to
see what you're made of. We have a couple guys who should be
(angry) after what occurred in the last couple of games. Young
teams sometimes find ways to lose, and we have. But this is no time
to pontificate. It's time to step up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   And, OK, maybe they can play with North Carolina Charlotte. Why
not? Just last week, the Cougars had a chance to beat the 49ers in
the final seconds before Galen Young sank a beauty of a shot, then
blocked Kenny Younger's potential winning 3-point try. That victory
meant the Niners, with a highly respectable RPI of 24, appear
assured of a March Madness berth, although UH might still be able
to spoil the celebration for them.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Lutz, a first-year coach like Clyde, doesn't think the
afternoon should be a gotta-win deal for him, but he concedes his
lads, to a man, had better believe it is. RPI or no RPI, stumbling
to a 10-16 outfit such as the Cougars could spell R.I.P.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tad unfair, the situation Lutz finds himself in. Because
the C-USA decision-makers awarded byes to the top two teams in each
of the divisions, paying no heed to records, 10-6 Charlotte (as
well as 10-6 DePaul) is playing, while 6-10 Southern Mississippi is
resting, waiting for the Niners-Cougars winner on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's just a one-time deal,'' Lutz said, forcing a
diplomatic tone. ``But it's important we figure out what's the
fairest and the best (system) for our league as far as getting as
many teams as possible into the (NCAA) Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   C-USA, expected to be a nationally prominent basketball beast
when formed, hasn't won any awards for excellence of late, with
only No. 9 Cincinnati ranked in the Top 25. The 25-4 Bearcats,
coming off a fourth consecutive conference title, are the lone
absolute lock of the mostly so-so lot.
</P>
<P>
   And the 'Cats have had their lapses, too. A 12-4 record, made
respectable by a recent four-game winning streak, in such a tepid
C-USA race isn't worth roaring about. But they did beat Duke,
something nobody else has done.
</P>
<P>
   After Cincy? Lots of Fricks and Fracks. Five of the six teams in
the National (Disgrace) Division went 6-10 or 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it's gone,'' Lutz said, ``it doesn't really matter who
you play in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   But playing in the first round is, by any measure, a burden. To
win the tournament, you have to win four days in a row. A demanding
task, that, although Marquette managed same a couple years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Golden Eagles head coach Mike Deane, also sitting ugly
in the C-USA throng at 6-10, his run of 20-victory seasons a faint
memory, might be fired. A rough business, his, as Drexler learns
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been quite phenomenal,'' Drexler said of how his
inaugural C-USA season shook out. ``I guess it means there's a lot
of parity in our league.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a polite way to explain it. But it's typical Clyde.
Always trying to take the high road.

BROWN MIGHT RE-SIGN WITH CARDS AFTER ALL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the Waffle House, formerly known as the Valley of the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the large footsteps of Suns/Nuggets/Suns/Nuggets
forward Antonio McDyess, who took indecisiveness to a new level,
Cardinals offensive tackle Lomas Brown has backed off his decision
to sign with the Cleveland Browns and could re-sign with the
Cardinals as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's agent, Lamont Smith, negotiated with the Cardinals for
much of Tuesday, one day after Brown said he had agreed to a
three-year deal with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the situation, however, said Tuesday it appears
more likely now that Brown, an unrestricted free agent, will
re-sign with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals apparently entered the picture Tuesday by
improving their offer to Brown, a 36-year-old left tackle
considered essential to the team's success next season.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Brown accepted Cleveland's contract offer worth $10.5
million over three years, including a $3 million signing bonus, and
was supposed to sign the deal as soon as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were offering a two-year deal worth about $6
million, including a $2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had declined to add a third year for Brown because
of his age, but they might have sweetened the two-year deal Tuesday
to equal the $6.4 million he would earn in the first two years with
the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   About $4 million of the Browns' three-year offer is in the final
year of the deal, making it money Brown might not earn. That salary
is not guaranteed, and Brown, who will be 39 then, could be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials and Smith, one of Brown's agent, did not
return phone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland President Carmen Policy told a radio station Tuesday
that his club was still negotiating with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals did lose one player Tuesday, backup quarterback
Stoney Case, who signed a 2-year, $2 million deal with the
Indianapolis Colts that included a $500,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Case's departure leaves two quarterbacks on the Cardinals'
roster, Jake Plummer and Dave Brown. It's likely the Cardinals will
draft a quarterback in next month's draft, which is considered deep
in quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals chose Case in the third round of the 1995 draft,
but in four seasons he played in just four games, starting one. He
was the third-team quarterback in 1998 and did not take a snap
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, he will back up Peyton Manning, said Case's
agent, Gary Wichard. ``It's an opportunity to be a snap away (from
playing) instead of two snaps away,'' Wichard said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cardinals continued Tuesday to negotiate with
Steve Baker, the agent for outside linebacker Jamir Miller. Like
Brown, Miller is an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bears are the only team Miller has visited since the
free-agency period opened last month, but they have yet to make him
an offer.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in Miller's decision, in addition to money, will be
how a team plans to use him. He wants to become a pass rusher,
Baker said, something he only occasionally has been asked to do in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's drastically hurt his value,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals were to lose Miller, they probably would have
to fill his spot through the draft or free agency. One veteran
linebacker available is Rob Frederickson, who has played for the
Raiders and Lions and lives in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves living here and would love to play football here the
rest of his career,'' said Frederickson's agent, Eric Metz of
Phoenix. ``Rob would be more than accommodating from a financial
standpoint in order to get here.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Most places that he goes on the road, they
are there.
</P>
<P>
   They thrust pens and programs or pictures for Clyde Drexler to
sign, sometimes standing in the rain. At South Florida recently,
walking down the stands to the barrier just behind the bench, they
asked for a signature seconds before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cougars won their first Conference USA road game
earlier this season, Drexler exchanged quips during the game with
Memphis students who wanted to know if he coached Gee Gervin on his
floating moves to the basket. ``No, not me,'' Drexler assured them,
smiling. ``His dad (Hall of Famer George Gervin) taught him that.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just another celebrity, Drexler today will coach what
may be the final game of his first season as the University of
Houston coach. The Cougars play North Carolina Charlotte in the
opening round of the Conference USA tournament. The previous three
seasons, it has been one game and out in conference tournaments for
the Cougars, whose last conference-tournament win was against TCU
in 1995 in the first round of the Southwest Conference's tourney.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-October, when he called his first team meeting for the
start of preseason practice, Drexler clearly has relished much of
this new career change. There are other nights, especially after a
one-sided loss like the one at Louisville, when he still can manage
an attempt at a joke. ``I can't lose any more hair,'' he said. ``So
this wasn't much fun, but there won't be any hair lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice or during most games, Drexler's familiar, calm
demeanor seldom changes. Not that it can't, because he doesn't long
tolerate what he considers a below-par performance by an official
or one of his players. He was ejected late in the game at North
Carolina State after two technical fouls, but even then he managed
to joke with Wolfpack fans who applied a few verbal needles during
his walk down the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there were several dozen fans, standing in the rain,
asking for an autograph as he walked to the team's bus.
</P>
<P>
   During a home game against Saint Louis, Drexler kept raising his
voice before the official on the far side of the floor noticed his
obvious anger. A rare expletive helped get Drexler a technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's an official or a player, I feel like it's part of the
job to let them know what I expect,'' said Drexler. ``My goal is
the same as when I took the job, to bring the program back to where
it was when I played here. There's no promise of when that will be,
but I'm committed to doing that kind of job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars, as expected, clearly struggled to win 10 of their
26 regular-season games, highlighted by back-to-back conference
road wins at Memphis and South Florida. Gervin, their new point
guard, and juniors Kenny Younger and William Stringfellow are the
only players to start every game. Drexler used 13 starting lineups.
Five walk-ons _ Derrick Fernandez, Jake Ballis, Torrence Botts,
Willie Moore and Tega Moceanu _ combined for 27 starts and about 16
points and nine rebounds a game, more than 20 percent of the team
scoring/rebounding totals.
</P>
<P>
   Every little bit has counted, because, as Drexler has steadily
reminded, ``We have little margin for error.'' Seven of their 10
wins were decided by 17 total points. They lost their final two
regular-season games by five total points to Marquette (65-62) and
UNC Charlotte (68-66).
</P>
<P>
   Gervin and Younger noticed a different aspect of Drexler's
coaching style as the season evolved. ``We got more comfortable
with one another, and we tried to get set in our roles,'' said
Gervin. ``Clyde was usually real calm. He'd have that little smirk,
that little smile, a lot of the time. Then, later in the season, he
was more intense, picking at the little things that were costing
us, letting us know we had to pick things up, that he wasn't going
to tolerate it. It's like he smells blood now with the conference
tournament coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would prefer more wins, but athletic director Chet
Gladchuk isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly jump-started the program again,'' Gladchuk
said. ``A transition year is tough for any coach and the players
and his staff. We had some trials and tribulations, but clearly a
major step was taken. They rose to the occasion. You could see the
fire in the players' eyes, even in the close losses at the end of
the regular season. I'm extremely pleased with them on and off the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk also has heard the innuendo _ that Drexler, stepping
out of the world of NBA superstardom, will tire of the huge task
before completing his five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it,'' Gladchuk said. ``Clyde is synonymous
with success at every stage of his career. I am convinced he is
dedicated totally to taking this program back to the national
stature it has had. There has never been the slightest indication
he is not focused on taking us to an NCAA championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The first steps back up the ladder have been taken. Stay tuned.

WILSON CLOUDS STADIUM ISSUE AT CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge President Blenda Wilson, who
announced her resignation Tuesday, could still make a decision on
the site of a new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   David Honda, the site-committee chair, said he will submit his
report recommending three options to Wilson within two weeks.
Wilson is expected to finish her term as president in late May or
early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to affect our report,'' Honda said. ``It will
still be presented to Blenda in a couple of weeks. What she does
with it from there is up to her. I don't know if she'll make the
decision, but there's nothing that precludes her from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did not speak specifically on the football-stadium report
on Tuesday. Larry Cox, director of CSUN public relations, said
Wilson probably won't speculate in the next few days on how she
will treat the site-committee report simply because she hasn't seen
it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's in the report,'' Cox said. ``We'll see
what's in the report and go from that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Interim athletic director Sam Jankovich said he was surprised by
Wilson's resignation. He felt the drive to issue a recommendation
for the site of the stadium will not be derailed by her decision to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wilson) will have the responsibility to do what's right by
this program,'' Jankovich said. ``We're going to keep doing the
things we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the table are three proposed sites: an 8,000-seat on-campus
stadium that would be built 75 yards south of the existing North
Campus Stadium; a renovation of Pierce College as an off-campus
site; or a residents' recommendation, which would put a stadium
anywhere but on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, whose contract ends in late May, said he will not
stay longer because of the changeover in leadership. He wouldn't
comment on what input he will have in Wilson's decision on the new
stadium. Honda said he thinks Jankovich will have a major
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume Sam will have a larger say in the decision,'' he
said. ``He's a ball-of-fire guy and he realizes that you have to
have a football stadium on campus to recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-campus-stadium issue has put a strain on university
relations with the surrounding neighborhood. The Lindley West
Coalition vocally opposed an on-campus stadium during each of the
nine open meetings held by the site committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that a decision would be made by the new
president and new administration,'' Coalition president said Pat
LoPresti said. ``We would hope that the new administration would
have the OPPORTUNITY to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said one of the goals in her final months as president is
to create a better dialogue between the university and the
outspoken homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I regretting that I won't see a football stadium being
built? The only things I regret are issues . . . (such as) the need
to have a better understanding between the university and neighbors
and about (how) the needs of both can be served,'' Wilson said.
``That's an issue I (hope) to get done (by the end of my term.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN head football coach Ron Ponciano, who was on the practice
field Tuesday afternoon when he heard about Wilson's resignation,
said he is concentrating solely on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can control is who I recruit, what we do with
(players) when they are here and when they get their degrees,''
Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ponciano savors the opportunity to play on campus in a
superior facility to dilapidated North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be nice?'' he asked. ``Yeah.''

REYNOSO'S AIM TRUE  
 DIAMONDBACKS PLEASED WITH NEWCOMER'S START 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON _ Although Armando Reynoso's fastball has some
get-up-and-go, it is unlikely he will be issued a speeding ticket
like his new Diamondbacks teammate, Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It is Reynoso's consistent control that makes him effective and
is the reason Arizona signed the right-hander to a two-year
free-agent deal that will pay him $2.5 million in each of the next
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter and his staff got the first close look at
Reynoso in a game situation in Tuesday's intrasquad game.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso, 32, pitched two innings, giving up one run on one hit.
He also walked a batter and threw a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good start,'' pitching coach Mark Connor said. ``He
threw free and easy. He doesn't give in to the hitter and is always
around the plate, moving it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reynoso: ``I'm not a power pitcher, so that's what I have
to do. I can use the fastball when I need to, but I rely more on my
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso is hoping the location of his new team will help him
become more relaxed than ever. He arrives from the New York Mets,
home to the deafening roar of jets taking off over Shea Stadium and
the concrete canyons of Manhattan. Now, he is a short trip away
from his home in San Luis Potosi, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of family and friends around here, yes, and
Tucson is familiar because I trained here for four years with the
Colorado Rockies (1993-96),'' Reynoso said.
</P>
<P>
   His happiness also is tied into his health. Though he posted a
combined 13-6 record in two seasons with the Mets, he struggled
because of a partially torn rotator cuff and labrum and bone chips
in his elbow, both requiring surgery in 1997. He spent the first
three months of the 1998 season on the disabled list, then went
7-3.
</P>
<P>
   One of those victories came on Aug. 15 over the Diamondbacks at
Bank One Ballpark. Arizona officials knew he would be a free agent
at the end of the season, and put him high on their list. But
before they would agree to sign him, they asked that their team
physicians be able to give Reynoso a thorough physical examination.
They gave their approval, and the deal was completed on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Reynoso's intrasquad outing was encouraging. The
club is walking a fine line, hoping to increase Reynoso's work load
as spring unfolds, but wanting to be cautious at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Home in Mexico, Reynoso began a moderate throwing program about
a month before reporting to camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``This is probably the best I've felt
in the spring in a long time. It gives me encouragement. I just
want to stay healthy and help the team win. Each time I pitch, I
become more and more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller was on the receiving end of Reynoso's pitches on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell he's feeling more comfortable, getting more
confidence,'' Miller said. ``The important thing now for the
catchers is to get a feel for what he likes to throw in certain
situations, like if he gets behind in the count. That shouldn't
take long, though. He communicates pretty well out there.'' &QL;

BUCKS DEFEAT NETS, 94-86 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Jayson Williams appears to be asking the
impossible. On Tuesday night, moments after he and the New Jersey
Nets lost for the seventh time in eight games, he spoke about the
need to ``have fun, play loose and let it fly.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the Nets continue to baffle and disappoint
themselves, their coach, their fans and the entire National
Basketball Association, enjoyment will be hard to come by, and the
only thing flying will be rumors of coaching and player personnel
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic and accommodating Williams means well, but the
Nets' problems appear to be much deeper than their state of mind.
To watch them lose to the Milwaukee Bucks, 94-86, before a
Continental Arena crowd of 15,180 was not to watch them give up or
play tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets played hard. They hustled. They dived for loose balls.
They battled for rebounds and disrupted shots. And still, they were
beaten by a team that had lost four of its last five games,
including two to lowly Toronto and Denver, and was playing without
its injured point guard, Terrell Brandon, whom Bucks Coach George
Karl calls his best player.
</P>
<P>
   Nets Coach John Calipari tried to put a positive spin on the
defeat, saying: ``We had more hustle plays in the second half than
we've ever had here. To say we didn't play hard is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets' rally from a 19-point second-quarter deficit to
take the lead with three minutes remaining means nothing. When you
are as talented as New Jersey but reeling with a 3-11 record, moral
victories are irrelevant and Monday's euphoric
losing-streak-busting victory over Boston seems to be as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This basically negates that win,'' said Kendall Gill, who
endured another poor night, shooting 3 for 14 in scoring 7 points.
``They didn't have Brandon, so I thought we could win this game
going away. But the way we started, we killed ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With Brandon, who was offered to the Nets this week in a trade
involving Sam Cassell, sitting on the sideline with bruises on his
ribs and left thigh, the Bucks started the slow-footed shooting
guard Vinny Del Negro at the point.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milwaukee (7-5) was able to break away from the Nets in
the second quarter and hold them off in the end. New Jersey missed
a golden opportunity to get back into the playoff picture because
struggling Charlotte (3-9) visits on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling, man, struggling,'' said Williams, who
grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds but scored just 5 points. ``We've
got to play with more energy. I think we're pressing ourselves too
much. We've go to start having fun, giving high-fives and
chest-bumping. That's when we play our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen paced the Bucks with 19 points, and Glenn Robinson had
18. Keith Van Horn led the Nets with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing for all but the first four minutes of the game,
the Nets mounted a devastating charge over the third and fourth
quarters, turning the double-digit deficit into an 84-83 lead on an
Eric Murdock 3-pointer with 3 minutes 2 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   But the fervent rally might have sapped the Nets' energy,
because Milwaukee ran off 7 straight points to regain control. The
Nets had their chances, but their execution and shooting failed
them. After baskets by Robinson and Del Negro put the Bucks up by
87-84, Kerry Kittles was caught in a sea of defenders, which led to
a shot-clock violation on the Nets. Then, after holding Milwaukee,
Van Horn had a nine-foot bank shot bounce in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson then made two foul shots, and Ervin Johnson one to put
the Bucks ahead by 90-84 with 41 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 14 points at halftime, the Nets showed heart in the
third quarter. Desperately needing to get back in the game after
being booed by the home crowd in the second, New Jersey used a
trapping, three-quarter-court defense for the first time this
season. The unorthodox move by Calipari rattled the Bucks, forcing
them into six turnovers and enabling the Nets to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure defense made the game hectic and led to numerous
dunks and layups for the Nets. So after shooting a frightening 25
percent in the first half, New Jersey made 11 of 19 field goals in
the third for 58 percent. With Milwaukee buckling under the heat,
the Nets moved within 7 points on a 3-point play by the reserve
center Jim McIlvaine. &QL;

MISSING CHINESE STUDENTS FOUND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: The Redlands (Calif.) Daily Facts contributed to this
story.) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The sudden disappearance of 32 Chinese students
from Los Angeles International Airport Monday turned out to be a
bizarre misunderstanding between two tour companies coordinating
their trip, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While authorities investigated the incident as a kidnapping or
mass defection, the mystery was cleared when several of the
students were located and interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The official explanation: The students were no sooner dropped
off at Los Angeles International for the return flight to Shanghai
than they were picked up by drivers for a second tour company to
continue their U.S. visit after completing a four-week English
language course.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the students were safely settled with new host
families, and well within the time limits of their student visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has truly been a bizarre incident,'' said Los Angeles
Police Department Cmdr. Dave Kalish. ``But it appears it will have
a happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   The students had completed a one-month English language course
with ELS Learning Centers at the University of Redlands and were
scheduled to return to China on a 1 p.m. flight Monday from LAX,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ELS officials did not know, however, that the students and their
parents had decided to extend their stay with another company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students were taken to the airport, they had their
passports and their airline tickets, they had their luggage
packed,'' said Ray Trantham, director of admissions and student
services for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were never made aware that they were in any other
program other than our program.''
</P>
<P>
   When the chartered bus arrived at LAX about 10:30 a.m., the
students were met by several men who took the students' passports,
loaded their luggage and drove them away in a caravan of four or
five minivans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, immediately investigated as a possible crime,
turned out to be a strange miscommunication, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some obligations by the original tour company and
subsequently another tour company was introduced into the situation
by what we believe were the parents, working through some
intermediaries, that was not known to the original tour company,''
said LAPD West Bureau Deputy Chief Rick Dinse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why it occurred in the way it did is still not clear yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear how they arranged the transfer to the second
company.
</P>
<P>
   Trantham said the ELS Learning Center prohibited the students
from contacting people outside the program during their stay to
prevent any attempts at illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese students in particular are at high risk for
defection,'' he said. ``So we maintained strict rules as far as
their being contacted by any friends or relatives who are in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   People who knew the students in the Redlands area in San
Bernardino County said they saw no evidence of any defection plans.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Schlanser, the ESL program's local international student
adviser, said most of the students made it clear that they were
anxious to return to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these children have been very vocal about their intent
to go home,'' Schlanser said.
</P>
<P>
   Mentone resident Sue Bailey, who hosted one girl, said the guest
never intimated any plans to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't say anything about not going home,'' said Bailey,
who declined to give the girl's name or age. ``She talked about
being excited to see her mom again.''
</P>
<P>
   Marina Tse, chairwoman of the Chinese American Education
Association and a former State Board of Education member, said the
situation is reminiscent of ``parachute kids'' from Taiwan and Hong
Kong, who are sent alone by parents to study in the United States
-- frequently in Asian-American communities of the San Gabriel
Valley east of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents in China or the Orient, they really think
their kids will get a better education in the United States,'' Tse
said. ``So they find any way to get their kids to study here.''
</P>
<P>
   Police located two of the students in suburban Covina early
Tuesday morning and contacted their parents, who said they
authorized the extension of their stay, Kalish said. Seventeen
other students were contacted later.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it was dramatic, it was nothing apparently illegal from
what we can determine,'' Dinse said. ``There is no indication that
any of these kids or their families are trying to have them defect
to the U.S. There has been no request for asylum. They are merely
here on their student visas to attend school. Once they have done
that they fully intend to return to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Bill
Strassberger said the students apparently had the financial means
to study for an extended period in the United States. Whether that
was their original intention is unclear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible they wanted to stay longer and they saw this as
a way to do this,'' Strassberger said. ``On the other hand maybe
they came here for a short course with the intention of going back,
and the idea of staying longer was presented to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that regardless of the students' intentions, their
student visas are still valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bizarre situation, but there aren't any immigration
violations in the situation up until now,'' he said.

TCU MAKES QUICK EXIT AT TOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Forget for a second, Marquise Gainous' decision to
bench himself, referees' calls and BYU's once-in-a-lifetime display
of long-distance marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Billy Tubbs said TCU's game against Brigham Young had been
decided six weeks ago anyway.
</P>
<P>
   From Tubbs' perspective, TCU's 90-74 loss to BYU in the first
round of the Western Athletic Conference tournament yesterday began
when officials ejected Lee Nailon for fighting against Nevada-Las
Vegas on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a call that maybe cost me a game,'' Tubbs said.
``I've never had a call like the call in the Vegas game that cost
me a season. Because that's virtually what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been the same basketball team since. ... That was a
critical call that I said at the time cost us a chance at the NCAA
playoffs, and I truly believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU has gone 4-6 since and probably has no chance of landing an
at-large NCAA bid.
</P>
<P>
   In losing to BYU, Tubbs and his Horned Frogs (19-10) definitely
looked like a fragment of a team that began this season ranked 24th
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   BYU (12-15) had a losing mark coming in, yet played with a
swagger that used to define TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost that swagger awhile ago,'' Nailon admitted, his
game-high 33 points and 16 rebounds unable to save TCU.
</P>
<P>
   He simply shrugged his shoulders when trying to explain why. He
blamed that Vegas game, although, Gainous' decision, referees'
calls and BYU's shooting display played roles, too.
</P>
<P>
   BYU jumped on TCU, stayed on TCU then easily finished TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began for Tubbs and his Frogs before a single second
had expired. Gainous told Tubbs that he'd be unable to go against
BYU despite being cleared to play by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous, TCU's second-leading scorer and second-leading
rebounder, bruised his left palm almost 10 days ago. He landed
awkwardly in practice on Monday, but X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in Marquise's shoes,'' Tubbs said. ``He was really in
a lot of pain, and he felt like he couldn't play. ... Of course, he
wouldn't have stopped them from making those 3s early in the game
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   BYU began by burying seven of eight 3-point attempts, had 10 by
halftime and finished with 13, enough to get a line in TCU's record
book as the most by an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Vranes led BYU's long-distance attack, burying five of seven and
finishing with 19 points, and got help from Mark Bigelow (4-of-7,
20 points) and Nathan Cooper (3-of-6, 24 points).
</P>
<P>
   TCU trailed all game, including double-digit deficits that
lasted for long stretches. Yet, TCU had trimmed BYU's lead to a
pliable 60-57 with slightly less than 14 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then began a symphony of whistles that lasted for almost two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, two technicals had been called (on Tubbs and
Nailon), 10 free throws had been attempted (by BYU) and a 12-point
lead had been secured (by BYU).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to consider that the turning point of the game,''
Cooper said. ``You could tell it took some of the air out of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU looked to be beaten from then on.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon said he had simply been talking to Ryan Carroll when
referees whistled him for a technical with 12:54 remaining. Tubbs
had been whistled for a technical 22 seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He said he said two words, ``Hey, Mike,'' to Mike Saia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as far as I got,'' Tubbs said later. ``I think they had
a nervy attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU's rally basically ended then, and the final 12:32 became a
countdown to BYU's biggest upset this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we could outshoot TCU and beat them at their
own game,'' Cougars coach Steve Cleveland said.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been TCU's game since the Vegas loss on Jan. 24,
the confidence, the swagger long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is the whole game,'' Tubbs said. ``When you lose
that edge everything goes with it. You're not as quick. You don't
jump as high. You're not as excited to play, and then the other
team has an idea that they're going to be able to beat you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The older children need attention, too.
</P>
<P>
   In simplest of terms, that's the answer to the question that
people are asking everywhere except to Arizona State women's
basketball Coach Charli Turner Thorne's face: Is this woman crazy?
</P>
<P>
   How else does one explain:
</P>
<P>
   Reporting to practice two days after giving birth and just 1{
hours after being released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Making a recruiting appearance the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Working an overtime game against Arizona another day later.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a 9-day-old on a flight through San Francisco to Eugene,
Ore., for a four-day trip, and a now 3-week-old on a trip to Los
Angeles this weekend. Not to mention the passport that will be
needed for a 15-hour team journey to Australia in late May.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't come up to me and say anything,'' said the
32-year-old Turner Thorne, who gave birth to Conor Troy Thorne on
Feb. 9. But neither did anyone except her mother say anything about
her determination to accompany her team to the Bay area little more
than a week before her Feb. 6 due date. Only when university
lawyers and her conscience prevailed did others admit their relief
that Turner Thorne did not make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly out of politeness, Turner Thorne doesn't hear the
water-cooler critiques of arguably the most publicized collegiate
delivery since Tennessee's Pat Summitt went into labor at a
recruit's home in Pennsylvania in 1990 and demanded that she be
flown home immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell those pilots that if they land this plane any place but
Tennessee, they're going to have a madwoman on their hands,'' the
six-time NCAA champion coach related in her book, ``Reach for the
Summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne has never been that over the top _ ``I'm not going
to be the CNN Play of the Day,'' she promised at Pac-10 media day
in November _ but is close enough to make others squirm in an era
when the stay-at-home parent is highly prized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I'm interacting with are the other coaches and
people on the job, and their response has kind of been disbelief,''
said Turner Thorne. ``To me, it's not like I have a choice. It's a
discipline thing and a commitment thing, and that's the way I look
at it. That's the way I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I like to be at home taking a break? Yeah. Am I
thoroughly exhausted? Yeah. But I don't really have an option.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because she has 15 women in her still-emerging third-year
program who were family before Conor was born and have their own
surrogate-parenting needs. And other than the Stanford trip and the
two days after giving birth, Turner Thorne has been there for them
_ all the while dealing with the latter stages of pregnancy and the
early stages of motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not only a coach, but a parent and a counselor helping
18- to 21-year-olds get through that portion of life,'' said her
husband, Will Thorne. ``Parenting is not really new to Charli. It's
just that her other kids can communicate their problems a little
more succinctly than Conor right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorne admits to being ``sheepishly embarrassed'' by the
publicity accorded the in-season pregnancy. Not only in the Phoenix
area but nationally in newspapers from Cleveland to St. Louis to
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone say in joking, `Geez, you'd think a working
woman never had a baby before,' '' Thorne said. ``That's just
someone not knowing anything about Charli's situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that includes grueling hours, constant travel,
pressure to turn around a program that hasn't won since 1992-93,
and the desire to validate Athletic Director Kevin White's faith in
negotiating a new five-year contract that runs through 2004 when
she has yet to achieve a .500 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people can relate to what I've been going through with
this (pregnancy),'' Turner Thorne said. ``Nobody understands my
job. They don't know what I do or what I go through. Anybody who
calls me a typical working mother, that shows a lack of
understanding of my profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Hatfield Clubb couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   She is the Arizona State associate athletic director who
convinced Turner Thorne to tackle the ASU job when there was more
talent in her former program at Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered within a day of each other that they were
pregnant, and the same doctor ultimately delivered their sons at
the same hospital within three hours of each other.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the road diverges. Hatfield Clubb is on an
eight-week leave of absence, interrupted only by a weekly trip to
the office to ``pass the baby around'' and some telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honest to goodness don't know how she (Turner Thorne) does
it,'' Hatfield Clubb said. ``But I know her so well and her job so
well, she wouldn't do it any other way. She'd do it the way she is
no matter what anybody thought about it, and she's not being pushed
by Kevin. But selfishly as an administrator, that's why we hired
her because she's got that attitude and never says quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I hurt for her because she is burning the
candle at both ends. I know it's got to be emotionally hard on her
not to have time to get to know her son.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach's plate is full, but help from family has relieved
some of the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we could do it without back-to-back
grandmas,'' said Thorne, who is in the busy season of his job with
Swank Audio Visuals. ``It would have been overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne's mother arrived first, caring for Conor in the
locker room during some practices at Wells Fargo Arena and making
the Oregon trip.
</P>
<P>
   Now Thorne's mother is here.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne wonders about the serenity of maternity leave, but
not at the expense of a team that despite last week's losses to
Stanford and California is beginning to show her character: focus,
resiliency, competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a different job, I think I might be jealous (of
Hatfield Clubb),'' she said. ``I think if we were struggling and
still had injuries, if things were a little bit disappointing or
frustrating, it would be a lot harder. But we're improving and
continuing to get better. It's really a fun time, and I'm enjoying
the growth we've made over these past three-four weeks. Between the
team and Conor, there's a lot of growth going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Conor's weigh-in of 8 pounds, 3 ounces was the most shocking
part of the entire process for the 120-pound Turner Thorne, who
added 21 pounds during her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure there was no way I was going to have a baby over 7
and change,'' she said. ``I thought, `I've got to get him up to 7
so he's not this fragile thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found myself thinking babies are not quite as delicate as
you imagine,'' said Thorne, who is traveling with the team this
weekend. ``Once we take the necessary precautions and cover all the
things we're going to need, I don't expect too much of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's strong as an ox for a newborn. He's awake and alert and
wants to be in the room with other people. He has the intense
stare-through-the-back-of-the-head glare like his mommy when Pac-10
officials interpret a situation differently than she would have
hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne was fretful about traveling to Oregon with even
the strongest of infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just was praying he didn't get sick,'' she said. ``On the
flight back, there was a cougher right in front of us. He slept on
the plane except at the end of the flight from Phoenix to San
Francisco when he was getting hungry, and through the entire
(Oregon State) game despite the band. I was so relieved at the end
of that trip.''
</P>
<P>
   When this second trip is complete and the uniforms put away for
the year, Mary Hauser, a friend, believes the magnitude of what
Turner Thorne has taken on this season will hit.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser, who now coaches the Arizona Elite AAU team, was pregnant
with all three of her sons while coaching at Mater Dei High School
in Santa Ana, Calif. She was close to delivery with her middle
child while coaching in the 1996 state championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many uncertainties you go through, especially at
the beginning,'' Hauser said. ``Why do I feel this way? Should I
feel like this? Is this OK? It's good to have somebody to bounce
things off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser has been checking for signs of postpartum depression,
which Turner Thorne isn't experiencing, and suspects a letdown is
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting when she finally has some down time to
realize how she did it all,'' Hauser said. ``With mine, it wasn't
until maybe four weeks after the baby, when the season was over,
that I really felt the most tired. That's the nice part of
athletics, there is a lot of excitement involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser was amazed to see Turner Thorne at Chandler High School
on Feb. 12, three days after the birth, to scout the Mountain
Pointe-Chandler region championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne felt her appearance was critical because ASU had a
game that prevented she and her staff from attending the 5A state
championship rematch between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell she was pretty uncomfortable,'' Hauser said,
``but if I was a high school player, that would show me how much
she cares.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Sun Devils know as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the same Charli that recruited me last year,'' freshman
forward Theresa Jantzen said in January, when her coach was eight
months pregnant. ``She's still real focused. It's like a
non-factor. I don't even look at her as being pregnant. She is so
strong. I really admire her. I was talking to my mom on the phone
and she said, `I don't know how Charli does it.' I do really admire
her for how strong she is and not letting it become a factor with
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Natalie Tucker is observing a baby up close for the
first time. ``I think he's a little miracle. He's the cutest little
thing. I'm in awe of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was not surprised when Turner Thorne showed up for
practice less than 60 hours after her 3:55 a.m. delivery. ``I
personally knew she was going to do that, that's the kind of person
Charli is. I would have been surprised if she wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne, high school valedictorian and Stanford graduate
who studied at Oxford University for a semester, is no dummy. She
has closely monitored Conor's pre- and post-delivery impact on her
players, intent on it not detracting from their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them have been wonderful,'' she said. ``Some of them
are more comfortable around him, and some of them are more
hesitant. I think it's been kind of a fun distraction for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even beyond the team, the thing I've realized because maybe
I've never taken the time is how much people love babies. I've
never been one of those ooh-ah baby types, but tons of people come
up and just want to see the baby. I've honestly been completely
overwhelmed with how wonderful and supportive everybody has been,
from fans to friends to boosters to other coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Turner Thorne is hoping for a sequel, but determined to do
her part for baby No. 2 to be an out-of-season release.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve a coach's sanity. &QL;

COYOTES SEARCH FOR POSITIVES AS LOSS ENDS MISERABLE TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's finally over.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the Coyotes' losing ways. That continued Tuesday night
at the FleetCenter with a 3-2 loss to the Boston Bruins in a game
in which Phoenix actually played well enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   What's over is their exhausting two-week, seven-game trip, the
Coyotes' longest of the season in more ways than one. They limped
home having lost six, including three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But in losing this time, the Coyotes (30-21-10) provided more
than just a glimpse that better times might lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing yet again without injured forwards Greg Adams,
Juha Ylonen, Mike Stapleton and Brad Isbister, and starting rookie
goalie Robert Esche to give Nikolai Khabibulin a much-needed rest,
the team made major strides against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   They unleashed 51 hits, including 10 by center Bob Corkum. They
officially were credited with allowing only one giveaway. They got
back to playing as they did early in the season _ and it almost
paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep swinging,'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld said.
``I know the players are trying to gut it out and I know they're
going to turn it around, but while you're mired in it, it hurts
like hell. The most important thing is that they stay the course
because if we don't stay tenacious and committed, we won't get out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed a lot of evidence tonight that we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it show on the scoreboard, though, their next time out,
which comes Friday at home against two-time defending Stanley Cup
champion Detroit?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep working like that, we'll come out on the right end
most of the time,'' forward Mike Stapleton said. ``We just didn't
get that final punch that we needed to overcome the hump in this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been a difficult hurdle all season. The Coyotes' record
in games in which they trail by at least two goals, as was the case
Tuesday, isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' Stapleton asked.
</P>
<P>
   It's 0-17-0.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to ask a team to rally from a 3-1 deficit when
that team has managed only 11 goals in its past nine games. As a
result, the Coyotes have lost eight of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard and we had a couple chances in the third, but
we just couldn't put them away,'' center Jeremy Roenick said.
</P>
<P>
   Esche was rudely welcomed in his first NHL start by an all-out
attack on the Bruins' second shift of the game. One rush resulted
in three straight shots. Esche stopped the first two, but Cameron
Mann buried the third one for a 1-0 lead only 53 seconds into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes could have thrown in the towel right away and nobody
probably would have blamed them. Not after what they've been
through lately.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they did the complete opposite. They started playing as
they did in October and November. They kept the puck in Boston's
end of the rink. They forced the Bruins into seven bad turnovers.
They won every one-on-one battle.
</P>
<P>
   Their hard work was rewarded when Roenick knocked in a rebound
from a missed shot by Rick Tocchet, who would add another assist on
Phoenix's second goal. Roenick, who had tallied only three goals in
his previous 22 games and none in his past eight, paused
momentarily before a fist-pumping celebration, almost as if he
couldn't believe he actually scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight games, damn right,'' Roenick said of his 20th goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum hit a speed bump when Jim Cummins got whistled for
interference, but the Coyotes got it back as soon as they killed
the penalty and Cummins nearly scored on a rush right out of the
box.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, though, the momentum took a turn for the worse. Only
1:45 into the second period, wing Rob DiMaio took a feed in his own
zone from P.J. Axelsson and streaked in to score on Esche for a 2-1
Boston lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Keith Tkachuk in the penalty box after a fight with Jason
Allison, Axelsson made the score 3-1 midway through the second. The
Coyotes cut the lead to 3-2 on Deron Quint's third goal of the
season at the 5:21 mark of the third, his first since being moved
to left wing from defense. But it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to score, but a win would have been nicer,'' Quint
said. ``Personal stuff is great, but when the team's not
successful, it hurts a little bit.'' &QL;

GAINOUS' CHOICE INDICATIVE OF TCU'S SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ On a day when his team most needed him to answer the
roll call, TCU's Marquise Gainous didn't want to talk.
</P>
<P>
   He preferred to sit.
</P>
<P>
   The junior forward and second-leading scorer on the team had a
bruised hand. A wrist sprain. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cleared him to play in yesterday's Western Athletic
Conference tournament opener. But according to team
representatives, Gainous chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   Marquise Gainous is 22 years old. So let's not mince words here.
</P>
<P>
   How does a kid _ excuse me, an adult _ not play when his team
knows that it needs at least one, and probably two, respectable
showings at the conference tournament in order to gain an NCAA
Tournament invitation?
</P>
<P>
   Gainous didn't answer. But so it's been for TCU in this most
disappointing of basketball seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs couldn't answer the bell against a hot-shooting
Brigham Young team yesterday, losing 90-74. The Frogs haven't
answered much of anything for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not talking,'' a sullen Prince Fowler said, as the Frogs
strode silently to their postgame bus.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs had no answer for a fair-haired BYU team that made 10
of 17 3-point attempts in the first half. The Frogs had no answer _
again _ for a team that double-teamed, body-checked and tugged at
Lee Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs, coach Billy Tubbs admitted frankly, haven't answered
the challenge since the night of Jan. 23. The game where Nailon was
ejected _ and eventually suspended _ for slapping Nevada-Las Vegas'
Mark Dickel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been the same team,'' Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   TCU was 15-3 going into that home game against UNLV. Without
Nailon, it lost in overtime, lost two nights later at Tulsa and
dropped two more conference games before it could halt the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into that UNLV game thinking we could beat any team in
America,'' Tubbs said. ``By the time we got back home to play a
game, we were not the same basketball team. We'd had a tremendous
loss of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as costly, Tubbs theorized, was that the Frogs' veneer of
superiority had come crashing down. TCU, remember, was undefeated
in conference play in 1997-98. The Frogs had become regular
vote-getters in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden,'' Tubbs said, ``the other team has the idea
that it might be able to beat you. We lost that edge. And we never
seemed to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   When you have a Mike Jones or a Malcolm Johnson, you work
through those kinds of setbacks. You bear down. You toil a little
harder.
</P>
<P>
   But without Jones and Johnson this season, the Frogs never did
embrace the work ethic that last season's division champs showed.
Tough times seemed to bother this TCU team, not energize it.
Instead of rallying around its tag of being a victim, it hid behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs will get some blame for that, but he was voicing private
concerns about this team's competitive fires as far back as
December. Victim is a role that Billy plays well _ and he played it
to the max here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But Tubbs never got the desired response from his Horned Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not yesterday against BYU. With Nailon playing hard,
but laboring with foul trouble and wearing BYU defenders on both
flanks, no one stepped up to shoulder the load. Without Gainous,
Nailon was the whole TCU scoring and rebounding show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought \RGainous\S was the critical thing to the game,''
Tubbs admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous, a junior-college transfer from Jacksonville, Fla., had
been bothered by his left hand for about two weeks. He felt it was
hurting his shooting touch. In practice Monday, Gainous slipped and
used the hand to break his fall, further increasing the pain, Tubbs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors X-rayed the hand, however, and found no evidence of a
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in Marquise's shoes,'' Tubbs said. ``I think he was
really in a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But the doctors, the coach added, cleared Gainous to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his choice,'' Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a choice that young Gainous will have to live with. He
didn't even dress out for the game. Instead, dressed in a purple
warmup suit, he sat on a chair behind the TCU bench, not even
joining in the team huddles.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there had to be something that an 18.4-point scorer and
8.8 per-game rebounder could do. Play at least some token defense?
Use his five personal fouls?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marquise Gainous became the symbol of the Frogs' crater
of a season yesterday. Given the choice, they took the quiet and
easy way out. They said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA surely will do likewise.

DOCUMENTS OUTLINE INSURANCE FRAUD CASE AGAINST JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The checks had travelled thousands of miles before they reached
the window of J. Brian Lamb's pickup truck, parked just behind the
office where the Chandler justice of the peace held court.
</P>
<P>
   The checks came to Lamb at the end of a marathon
trans-Caribbean, trans-continental journey. They had been written
by truckers for what federal investigators say were bogus insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb and three others allegedly got more than $1.5 million from
the scam. Last week they were slapped with a 37-count fraud
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released court documents gave the best picture to date of
the federal case while Lamb on Tuesday fiercely denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an innocent man, and I'm going to fight this to the bitter
end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hiding from anything. I'm fighting this head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old father of three said his life ``is in a spin
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Postal inspectors laid out part of their money travelogue in
the indictment, which climaxed a four-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money story can be put together from affidavits
that lead U.S. postal inspector James Tendick prepared to support
search warrants on Lamb's truck and home and on the home of alleged
co-conspirator Laura Palacios.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators used wiretaps and surveillance of the
suspects, and they subpoenaed telephone, bank and mail records.
They also drew on investigative files from state insurance agencies
in Arizona and four other states and even an insurance policy they
purchased themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to inspectors and Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles
Steele, Lamb and his alleged accomplices attracted customers by
mailing fliers that offered cut-rate insurance and by ``falsely
claiming that they worked for and represented certain insurance
agencies'' and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The scam's first victims, according to Florida state insurance
fraud investigator Seleina Porter, were the truckers who bought the
useless insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Porter said the ultimate victims were drivers and passengers
injured in accidents caused by the misinsured drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Porter documented dozens of them. One man was paralyzed, she
said, another was severely burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they were out of luck,'' said Porter.
</P>
<P>
   According to the postal inspectors, by the time the truckers'
insurance premium checks reached Lamb's truck outside the Chandler
Justice Court, they had traveled from across the United States to
Miami, on to the Caribbean island of Antigua and back to a
commercial mailbox in Chandler rented by Lamb employee Palacios.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the tortuous route was intended to confuse
anyone who tried to trace it. They suspect the Antigua connection
may have been used to claim that the operation was not subject to
U.S. taxes or regulations. To complete the money trail, the
inspectors relied on surveillance and wiretaps of telephone
conversations between Lamb and Palacios.
</P>
<P>
   One Tendick affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix
said that in a pair of conversations last October and November,
``Palacios told Lamb she had client premium checks and she agreed
to transfer them into Lamb's vehicle at the Chandler Justice
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tendick's affidavit, Lamb on several occasions took
two final steps on the money trail, both of which kept his name
away from paper records.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits said Lamb cashed the checks at a south Phoenix
market and then deposited the money in checking accounts of his
alleged co-conspirator, Darin Tarwater.
</P>
<P>
   Tarwater, one of the defendants in the case, is scheduled to
make his initial court appearance Wednesday in U.S. District Court
in Phoenix. Palacios pleaded innocent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth person charged in he case, Nelly Herrera, lives in
Canada and has not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tendick gave this step-by-step account of the surveillance of
Palacios and Lamb last May 21:
</P>
<P>
   Palacios went to the Chandler mailbox shortly before &UR; noon and
picked up a Federal Express package from Antigua. The package was
addressed to Transportation Management, one of the allegedly bogus
companies through which Lamb sold insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Palacios drove to the rear alley of the Chandler Justice Court,
parked near Lamb's pickup truck and ``was observed sliding what
appeared to be a large envelope into Lamb's vehicle through the
driver's side window.'' The window was ``cracked open about one
inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb took the envelope to Mary Lou's Market on West Mohave
Street in south Phoenix, emerging about 12 minutes later ``carrying
what appeared to be a priority mail envelope and paper bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Tendick's account of the transaction cited subpoenaed Bank of
America records that show that $32,037 was posted to the Mary Lou's
Market checking account the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector closed the Lamb-Tarwater loop on other
check-cashing transactions between Lamb and the market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last Nov. 5, shortly after leaving the market, Lamb
allegedly deposited $2,000 in cash into Darin Tarwater's checking
account at Wells Fargo Bank in Chandler. That transaction is
recorded on deposit records and tape from a bank surveillance
camera, Tendick said in the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, between July 1997 and November of
last year, the market cashed checks totalling $197,000 for the
alleged conspirators. A call to the market was referred to a woman
named Annette, who refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said some of the truckers' checks were cashed in
Panama, the home of Lamb's uncle David Lamb, who left the United
States nearly a decade ago after federal investigators probed
allegations that he ran a similar insurance scam.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in the case of Brian Lamb say they identified a
scam within the scam. They say Palacios carried out this interior
scam with Herrera, who sold insurance for Lamb from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   and Herrera skimmed thousands of dollars in checks for
themselves, Tendick said, and had recently been setting up their
own bogus insurance business. Tendick said wiretaps showed the two

RAMBIS IS GOOD LISTENER

<P>
   Kurt Rambis wore a black suit and wire-rim glasses. To his left
was Dennis Rodman, with hair that resembled a Brillo pad in the
early stages of rust.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of meeting that can happen only in comic books
and the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were, Clark Kent and The Joker, standing near the
press table as center Shaquille O'Neal stood at the free throw line
Monday night in the second half of the Los Angles Lakers' 97-91
victory over the Suns at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say their exchange didn't include grooming tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was betting Shaq would hit those free throws,'' Rambis said.
``Dennis was betting he wouldn't. When Shaq drained the first one,
I kind of jostled Dennis and said, `Hey, that's my man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, a decided underdog a week ago, already is ahead in what
some believe is a losing proposition. With Rodman, O'Neal, young
Kobe Bryant and the Lakers' Showtime reputation, Hollywood's
favorite team has all the elements of a ``Titanic'' sequel. Rambis
figures to be the next man overboard. About that, he harbors no
illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cotton Fitzsimmons told me a long time ago, coaches are hired
to be fired,'' Rambis said as he prepared to take his Lakers home
for tonight's game with the Suns at the Great Western Forum. ``So
I'm the next Lakers coach to get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, only one plank is evident in a new Lakers regime.
And nobody is going to walk it. Instead, it is part of a reinforced
platform that has renewed the team's confidence in the week since
Rambis succeeded Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, the Lakers have gone from a team on a three-game
skid to one on a four-win run. It's not enough to declare a
turnaround. In the NBA, a single week is a little like one slam
dunk. Who remembers?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Lakers themselves are talking as if they
finally found a coach who understands them and their talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what to do now,'' Bryant said. ``Rambis is very big on
roles. Everybody has particular roles that were unclear before.
From top to bottom, I think everybody is a little more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a comfort level achieved through communication. In his
first few days on the job, Rambis has sought advice from everybody,
Rodman included. After Monday night's victory, he ducked behind a
door to the America West Arena practice court for a meeting with
Fitzsimmons, who coached him throughout his three seasons (1989-92)
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, he took advice from Derek Harper. With 1:08
remaining, Harper hit a three-point shot that put the Lakers ahead
for good, 87-85. It was Harper's call. Initially, Rambis asked
Harper to drive the lane. But Harper said he had been open
repeatedly for a three-point attempt because Jason Kidd was
dropping off to double-team O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to him, and he kind of waved me off,'' Harper said.
``It was like he was saying, `You take care of it.' As a player,
that really gives you a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis is not far removed from his days as a player. Then, as
now, he was always seeking advice. His survival in the league
depended on his ability to learn and adjust. He played in Greece
before he landed with the Lakers. He was never as talented as most
of the players around him. Yet he was an important piece to the
title teams of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy.
</P>
<P>
   A key then, he said, was to listen carefully and apply
diligently. Other than the wardrobe, not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Rodman suggested defensive alignments. Rambis
listened. Once, Rodman walked over to the scorer's table to check
on the foul situation. He passed on the information. Rambis
listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to love that stuff as a coach,'' said Rambis, who
also called Magic Johnson in Hawaii last week for tips on how to
handle everything from personalities to pressure defense. ``You
have to absolutely love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis said he even thanked Rodman for his suggestions. Of
course, Rambis also fined Rodman for showing up late for Saturday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for isolated incidents, I don't think anyone has ever
criticized Dennis for what he does on the basketball floor,''
Rambis said. ``I don't care what Dennis does off the court as long
as he doesn't hurt anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have hired a staff of 450 to make sure he doesn't get
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just joking.''
</P>
<P>
   Or just hoping?
</P>
<P>
   Rambis has won all the early bets. But the game has just
started. &QL;

BAYLOR WOMEN DROP THE BALL IN NCAA QUEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Baylor adopted ``Reaching New Horizons'' as
its motto for the women's basketball season, doing little to
downplay expectations of the first NCAA Tournament berth in school
history.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a team that reached the finals of the 1998 Women's
National Invitation Tournament probably began a quiet postseason
last night well short of its implied goal. Baylor fell to Missouri,
60-55, in the first round of the Big 12 tournament at Municipal
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   In the estimation of Bears coach Sonja Hogg, the loss to the
10th-seeded Tigers eliminated Baylor (16-13) from realistic
consideration as an NCAA participant. Afterward, Hogg actively
lobbied against her team's receiving a return invitation to the
WNIT because the school lost money despite being host to four games
in the 1998 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would like to return to the WNIT, Hogg said: ``No.
I think that would be almost anticlimactic. I say that now and I've
pretty well thought that through.''
</P>
<P>
   In her mind, as well as in the minds of Baylor players, the
1998-99 season ended with the Bears being outhustled and
outrebounded, 49-27, by a Missouri team that Baylor defeated by 24
points on Jan. 27. Missouri (13-14) advances to today's
second-round matchup against Iowa State (20-6).
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, which returned its top three scorers from a team that
finished 20-11 a year ago, watched that trio combine to shoot 27.2
percent against Missouri. Guard Lara Webb (2-of-15) struggled most,
but neither guard Toya Ellis (4-of-10) nor center Kacy Moffitt
(3-of-8) found the going much easier on a night when Baylor shot
31.6 percent and held only three brief, one-point leads in the
final 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, meanwhile, watched guard Julie Helm (26 points) and
forward Kesha Bonds (17 points, 14 rebounds) step up repeatedly
during crunch time. Bonds' free throws with 5.7 seconds remaining
sealed the victory. And Baylor's postseason fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to continue playing,'' Moffitt said, addressing
the Bears' postseason possibilities. ``But I don't know if a lot of
people on our team have the drive to compete any more.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NO GRETZKY, BUT THE SHOW DOES GO ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Nicole Kidman came down with a bronchial
infection last week and could not display her acting skill to eager
Broadway throngs, the producers closed ``The Blue Room'' a bit
early. Miss Kidman regrets, and all that.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway Blues do not have the option of posting a notice in
the lobby of Madison Square Garden, advising: ``Mr. Wayne Gretzky
is indisposed for today's performance. All patrons who would like a
refund may apply at the box office.'' Refunds are just not done in
sports, even if the Great One is watching from on high. Hockey is,
after all, a team game, and the New York Rangers are demonstrating
that.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gretzky went out with a bulging disk in his neck, the
Rangers have gone on a downright rampage, for them, and won two
straight games, before tying the Dallas Stars, 2-2, on Tuesday
night in a game of playoff intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge game,'' admitted Adam Graves beforehand, referring to
the Stars' having the best record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Then Graves busted onto the ice and scored his 30th goal and
energized the Rangers, who are all making the most of the
responsibility without Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought we'd get 5 of 6 points against
very good teams,'' said John Muckler, the somewhat surprised coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers actually lost ground to their competitors for the
last playoff spot in the East. Expansion may have watered down the
talent in hockey, and made the last surviving Canadian teams seem
marginal and remote compared to all these burgeoning Sun Belt
franchises, but expansion has accomplished one positive thing _ it
has made qualifying for the playoffs seem almost respectable.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer a matter of culling a few strays from the pack.
With 27 teams, there is now some legitimate competition for the
eight spots in the East and the West. The Rangers are struggling to
justify their gigantic payroll without their marquee player, the
man who eclipsed George Mikan of the Minneapolis Lakers (Tonight:
Mikan vs. Knicks, the Garden marquee once proclaimed) as the
greatest No. 99 in sports history. Since Gretzky arrived in the
fall of 1996, the Rangers have been doing their utmost to tune into
his other-worldly passes and intuitive feints. As Graves said,
``Sometimes you need a goal and Gretz makes a great play.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky went out, the Rangers had to rethink their
approach. ``We've talked about keeping it simple _ puck in, puck
out,'' Graves said the other day. ``Muck says: `Try to play safe
and sound. Don't take chances.'''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Gretzky is out another week or two, the Rangers
will have more minutes and more challenge to do it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a healthy fear of the unknown,'' Graves said. ``You
don't want to embarrass yourselves. With Gretz out, you have to do
it yourself. You have to be at your top form. There's a fine line
between doing too much, and being yourself, but collectively, we
can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Deferring to a brilliant teammate _ even one as self-effacing
and generous as Gretzky _ can be a subtle and destructive impulse.
In his absence, other players see the puck skittering on the ice
and they wonder, do they go toward it _ or drift into the corners?
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect example is the first game, when Manny Malhotra comes
out of the gate and pops a big one,'' Graves said, referring to the
big kid who was the top draft choice in 1998, but has been breaking
in slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Then against Philadelphia last Sunday, Petr Nedved scored enough
goals to guarantee headgear for all those damp and chilly days, as
the Rangers try to extend their season without Gretzky, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're concerned because you don't want him to play hurt,''
Graves said. ``We feel the same way about Todd Harvey and the other
guys who are hurt. It tells me something about this team that Gretz
and all of them are waiting in the room after the game, standing
right by the door, shaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In professional football, injured players are considered a
distraction, maybe even an unwanted reminder that bones and muscles
and brains do get banged up. In hockey, the injured players are
still part of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rangers are discovering they can bluster and pass and
even score without Gretzky. ``Gretzky improves us terrifically,''
said Scott Fraser, who has played well in the three games. ``We've
got to have him back and we are anxiously awaiting his return.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest scoring touch in the history of the sport is
currently unavailable, but the other Rangers do not consider
themselves understudies. In sports, they are called teammates. &QL;

MAVS PROTECT HOME-COURT STREAK

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mavericks coach Don Nelson gave the game ball to A.C.
Green for his sterling performance last night against the Los
Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   He could have also given one to Shawn Bradley, Steve Nash,
Hubert Davis, Michael Finley or Gary Trent. All six players played
solid basketball as the Mavericks had their highest scoring output
of the season in ousting the hapless Clippers, 112-99, before
13,492 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have won four consecutive home games for the first
time since March 25-April 7, 1994. They also have won five of their
past seven games to improve to 6-10 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Green set the tone with his aggressive play at both ends of the
court. He finished with a season-high 19 points and a season-high
12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the role is, I'm ready to do it,'' said Green, who
entered he game averaging 4.2 points per game. ``Being the leader
on this team, you've just got to get out and sacrifice a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (0-13) appear on the brink of establishing some NBA
history. The NBA record for futility to start the season is 0-17 by
the Miami Heat in its expansion year of 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who had 20 points and nine assists, said the Clippers'
sorry state of affairs was extra motivation for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be their first win, and you don't want to be
part of history, so to speak,'' he said. ``You just want to go out
and destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash got out of the sick bed and scored 16 points for Dallas. He
was 4-of-6 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Trent had 16 points, while Davis poured in a season-high 18
points and was 6-of-14 from the field. Davis had seven points in
the first quarter, when the Mavericks compiled their highest
scoring quarter of the season and led, 38-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good out there,'' Davis said. ``I think everyone had
really good looks, because everyone was unselfish. It's not a
coincidence that everyone shoots well when they pass the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley contributed 10 points and seven rebounds, and collected
a season-high nine blocked shots. He got two blocks within a span
of one minute as Dunbar High School alumnus Charles Smith
challenged the 7-foot-6 center and failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks had 26 assists. They also shot 50.6 percent from
the field and put more than four players in double-figure scoring
for the first time all season.

</HEADLINE>
 BKN-CELTICS-CAVALIERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ They did not lose because of a bad call, bad free
throw shooting, or Paul Pierce's very bad night (0 for 11, 2
points). The Celtics are 6-7 this morning because they went to Gund
Arena and decided not to guard any Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   There are some complicated elements to this game. But you don't
need a Basketball Think Tank to understand why the Celtics lost,
116-99, before 12,906 shocked fans. A team that shoots 58 percent
from the field and takes 49 free throws is probably going to win.
</P>
<P>
   And about those shocked fans. You'd be shocked, too, if you were
a Cavs fan and watched your team surpass 100 points for the first
time all season. But, most likely, you are a Celtics fan. So when
you look at that ``116,'' it should scare you more than Pierce's
25-minute display of putting up shots that were too long, too
short, and too wide. That's because the Cavs are in the NBA's
ultra-slow lane, playing with their hazard lights on at all times.
They scored 73 points in a loss to the Celtics at the FleetCenter
last month. Tuesday night, they had reached that number early in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Cavs' explosion was a one-night thing. But Rick Pitino
isn't worried about them. He is concerned about the Celtics and
their defense. It is not a one-night problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's defensive talent,'' the coach said. ``I think
we've got very good offensive talent. I think we're very lacking in
defensive talent. It's not effort. I think they are willing to work
hard, but I think it's defensive talent, which is a talent. That's
what keeps Bruce Bowen on the team. It's a lack of defensive talent
that's hurting us right now. It's hurting us on the backboard. It's
hurting us in the halfcourt game.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was not finished. Before he spoke those words, he had
looked at an alarming stat sheet. It showed that starting point
guard Brevin Knight didn't even play for the Cavs because of a
sprained right finger. The Cavs had said Knight would be available
if they needed him. They never needed him, despite trailing, 20-9,
in the first quarter. The sheet also showed every Cav starter
making at least half of his field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   So, you ask, what about the Pitino Press?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run around and press all you want and camouflage your
weaknesses, but you're pressing on weakness instead of strength,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker agreed. He said the Celtics are trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never be able to knock our effort,'' said the Celtics
captain, who had 17 points and 5 rebounds before fouling out.
``We're always going to try.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kenny Anderson said earlier this week, you can have all
the heart in the universe and still not be able to make a jump
shot. Or defend. Tuesday night the Celtics could do neither,
shooting 41 percent and giving up 56 points by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Before the half, Pitino had waved his hand in disgust at the
Boston players on the floor and said, ``OK, you can't press. Forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes into the third quarter, he pulled all his starters
and went to the Bomb Squad, his pressing unit. They watched a
15-point lead swell to 20 before cutting it in half. But they
defended and pressed so much that they couldn't score.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cavs? They scored and scored. Shawn Kemp had 22 points,
Bob Sura had 19, and Wesley Person 17 off the bench. Person had 14
in the second quarter, his season high. The points for the game
were a Cavs season high. The points at halftime were a season high
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a couple of rotations,'' said Ron Mercer, who led
the Celtics with 22 points, ``but you have to give Cleveland a lot
of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino will give the Cavs credit in some areas. Their coaches
get credit for studying Pierce's moves and screaming out
``Baseline!'' each time he touched the ball. ``I noticed they were
trying to cut that off,'' the rookie said. They also get credit for
making 6 of 10 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino also knows that the trading deadline is less than two
weeks away. He has to ask himself if this team, as constructed,
will grow into better defenders. And if the answer is no, he has to
ask himself if he wants to make a trade. He has said that he does
have an opportunity to secure a big man. Will he make a move?
</P>
<P>
   If he watches tapes of Tuesday night's game, he probably will.
His team cut the deficit to 7 in the third quarter, but it didn't
have the defense to make a serious run. And yes, they were
outrebounded, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cavs coach Mike Fratello said he knows how Pitino feels about
his team's offensive struggles. But offense was the last concern on
Pitino's mind.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes of the early season were a formidable
opponent _ big, strong, fast, and able to score almost at will.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins played them back in October, the Coyotes looked
like world-beaters who surely would contend for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Times are tougher now. The Bruins stood up to everything the
Coyotes threw at them Tuesday night, earning a 3-2 victory at the
FleetCenter that sent Phoenix limping home after a 1-6 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   You want to fight? The Bruins fought. You want to hit? The
Bruins hit. You want to muscle in the corners? The Bruins muscled
in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   The win extended Boston's unbeaten streak to five games (4-0-1)
and made it 3-0-1 on this homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd been on a long road trip and we wanted to make
sure we sent them home thinking about it anyway,'' said Bruins
coach Pat Burns. ``It was a big win. It was very important for us
because every game is going to be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston took the lead less than a minute into the game, on
Cameron Mann's fifth goal of the year. Mattias Timander blasted a
shot from the right point that was saved by goalie Robert Esche,
making his first NHL start. Sergei Samsonov got to the rebound and
fired from the inside edge of the right circle, but Esche turned
that back, too. Mann swooped in down the slot and beat the
netminder with a backhander at the 53-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the period, the Coyotes pulled even. Former
Bruin Rick Tocchet, who is having a stellar season, ripped a
slapper from the right circle that goalie Byron Dafoe stopped. The
puck bounced in front past Ray Bourque and Jeremy Roenick was on
the left side of the crease to put the rebound home at 10:31.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took the lead again in the early going of the middle
period, with checking-line right wing Rob DiMaio finishing off a
nice individual effort. Tim Taylor relayed a pass up to left P.J.
Axelsson in neutral ice. Axelsson backhanded a pass, banking it off
the boards, to DiMaio, who charged down the left side. He skated
through the left circle, cut in on Esche, and beat him with a
forehander for the 2-1 lead at 1:45. It was DiMaio's fourth goal of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the period, the Bruins built on that lead, with
Axelsson, another member of the top defensive line, scoring what
proved to be the winner at 9:48. Anson Carter passed to Axelsson,
whose shot from the slot sailed over the goalie for his seventh of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The second period also featured a heavyweight bout between the
No. 2 scorers on each team. At the 3:13 mark, Jason Allison took
issue with the Coyotes' Keith Tkachuk crushing Carter, so Allison
went after him. The two squared off and exchanged blows before they
were separated. Allison wound up with two minutes for interference,
and each received five minutes for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, normally not one to fight, said he made an exception
because he thought the Coyotes' best players were the ones crossing
the line between hits and cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to dish it out, they're going to have to take
it, too,'' he said. ``A lot of those guys, they think they're
untouchable. They can go around elbowing guys but they get hit once
and it's like, `What are you doing hitting me?' We matched their
toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the period, DiMaio and Roenick also mixed it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes came as close as they would with a goal at 5:21 of
the third period. Defenseman-turned-wing Deron Quint took a
backdoor pass from center Daniel Briere and beat Dafoe near the
right post.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' frustration was evident. As time expired, Tkachuk
smashed his stick against the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last game of the trip and we thought maybe they'd
come out and give it everything they got,'' said Dafoe.
``Unfortunately we kept them in the game in the first period, we
kind of took it away in the second, and they came out very hard in
the third. I was surprised. I thought they might have given up, but
it's a team that plays right to the end.''

MUDSLIDE-DAMAGED HOUSE SEEN AS THREAT BY DOWNHILL L.A. NEIGHBOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Robert Weinstein says an earthquake- and
mudslide-mangled house is about to slide onto his home -- and the
city has done little to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Tuesday there is no imminent danger to
Weinstein's house in the suburban San Fernando Valley community of
Woodland Hills, and they are trying to deal with a problem that
goes back six years to the mudslide. The house has been declared a
nuisance, and the owner is paying to stabilize a steep slope behind
Weinstein's house and fix other problems, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein is not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city, and now I'm embroiled in this fight with City Hall,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is a blight on the neighborhood. It's a nuisance
and a hazard, and the city is just dragging this thing out. I think
this is one reason the Valley wants to break away from the city --
they're just not responding to our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials conceded that six years is too long to deal with
the problem, but Senior City Building Inspector Ted Marko said they
are responding as best they can to correct problems at the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Since the house poses no ``imminent danger'' to Weinstein's
house, the city can't order it to be demolished, Marko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on bedrock. Where it's sitting now, the house isn't going
down the hill,'' he said. ``What we're attempting to get the
homeowner to do now is stabilize the hill so water will go down to
the right places.''
</P>
<P>
   A back-and-forth battle between the city, the property owners
and Weinstein has left the shattered house in legal limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ring, a Santa Barbara, Calif., lawyer representing
owners Douglas and Joyce Maskart, said the couple is doing all they
can to deal with the problem, but their plans have been hampered by
legal battles and city regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to work out a resolution now,'' Ring said.
``We're working with the city. The Maskarts want a resolution. They
want to fix the slope. My clients are far more victims in this case
than Mr. Weinstein -- just look at that hillside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ring said the couple bought the house in December 1978, not
knowing that a retaining wall was inadequate. When that wall failed
in a 1993 mudslide, their problems began.
</P>
<P>
   They unsuccessfully sued the former owner, who has since died.
Meanwhile, the Northridge Earthquake in 1994 caused more damage to
the shattered house and forced them to move.
</P>
<P>
   Marko said the Maskarts were taken to court and convicted of
allowing their property to become a nuisance. Since then, the city
and the Maskarts have been haggling over how to repair the
property. Recently, the couple got approval to encase the hill in a
soil-cement mixture that should prevent future mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   But things aren't happening fast enough for Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   He sued the Maskarts, and he's continuing a push to make the
city demolish the house. His own experts say a portion of the San
Blas Avenue house is beginning to separate from its foundation and
could tumble down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   He said City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski has ignored his
pleas until he called the local homeowners association Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Levy, Miscikowski's chief field deputy, drove up to the
damaged house on Tuesday so building inspectors could give her a
progress report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go with our experts on this,'' she said. ``They've
been looking at the property for several years, and they are taking
the proper steps. It would have to be a significant problem for the
city to come in and demolish it.''

DODGERS MULLING MOVE FROM VERO BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Their options hardly seem like options.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can sculpt a new spring-training site on the Fort
McDowell Indian Community in Arizona, tailoring every last detail
to their exact specifications, and camp could be a one-hour plane
ride from home.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can sell Dodgertown to Indian River County and the city
of the Vero Beach, lease it back and make alterations to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seems to be clear-cut, and speculation is the Dodgers
are holding their final spring training at Dodgertown. But it is
more than just ``new'' vs. ``used.'' No one with the team is ready
to say the outcome has already been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is twofold,'' Dodgers CEO and President Bob
Graziano said. ``First, what is the most economical way for us to
go through spring training? Second, what is the best
baseball-operations way to go through spring training?
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the Dodgers responsibility is the relationships we've
been able to build and maintain over the years. The relationships
we've had over the last 50 years is important, but at the same time
it's got to be mutually beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the biggest issue.
</P>
<P>
   Spring training has become big business, with many new stadiums
holding 10,000-12,000 fans. Vero Beach's historic Holman Stadium
has a capacity of 6,500, which decreases its potential revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And the nostalgia and tradition come with a price. The Dodgers
own the 450-acre facility, employ 250 people there and must pay for
maintenance and year-round upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring training here is very expensive and I would venture to
say more expensive than most other facilities because of the nature
of the facility and the services rendered,'' said Craig Callan,
managing director of Dodgertown and a Vero Beach resident.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, located
approximately 30 miles northeast of Phoenix, is offering to build a
$30 million complex that could put the Dodgers in Arizona by next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Peaks Sports Complex, as it would be called, would
include a 12,500-seat stadium, six full-sized practice fields, two
half-sized practice fields, a dining facility and a conference
center.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the Dodgers would be $1 per year for a 30-year
lease, a Yavapai tribe official said, althoughdetails of how to
split the revenue and maintenance costs have yet to be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is you'd be ripping the heart out of Vero
Beach (if the Dodgers left) because Vero Beach and the Dodgers are
one and the same,'' Callan said. ``But I've researched every team .
. . and if those teams can have a $30 million facility and have
favorable terms, why should the Dodgers settle for anything but at
least that? I think that's only fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sweetheart deal the Dodgers would get, the
location and new facilities are big factors.
</P>
<P>
   While Dodgertown's charm can't be overstated _ players walk
through the crowds to get to Holman Stadium and the practice fields
_ integral parts of the complex are antiquated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the new complexes in which four baseball practice fields
are clustered together, which makes it easier for the coaching
staff to evaluate players on different fields _ Dodgertown's fields
are grouped in pairs and spread about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier to get around if you know how to drive a
golf cart, and there's been a lot of clubs that left here and
became championship teams,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson.
``You couldn't get me to say anything bad about Vero. It's a jewel
of the intercoastal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grapefruit League travel is also difficult on the team. Only
the Mets, who train at Port St. Lucie, are within 50 miles of Vero
Beach. In Arizona's Cactus League, six teams train in the greater
Phoenix area. All of the National League West teams _ San
Francisco, San Diego, Colorado and Arizona _ train in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A move appears to makes sense on all fronts. But tradition and
nostalgia, two of baseball's most appealing characteristics, have
kept Vero Beach's hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1948, the Dodgers have trained in Vero Beach. The area
even named a school after the complex, Dodgertown Elementary
School, and a group of community leaders have started a ``Keep Our
Dodgers'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgertown is a one-of-a-kind shrine to the organization, from
Vin Scully Way and Jackie Robinson Avenue to the barracks that
house players and front-office staff, to old-time photos that
capture great Dodgers moments dating back to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Dodgers would be catastrophic to the area's
economy. Vero Beach city manager Rex Taylor estimated the Dodgers
bring $20-30 million into the community annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would hurt the community because the whole economy is based
upon the six weeks the Dodgers train down here,'' said Frank Brush,
82, a Vero Bech resident. ``I'm from Brooklyn (and the Dodgers) are
why I moved here. The Dodgers have a special relationship with
their fans and this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach/Indian River County are proposing to purchase
Dodgertown, with the help of a ``bed tax'' within the county, and
lease it back to the Dodgers. Appraisals for Dodgertown are
expected to be near $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we've been very honest with the county
and city . . is stating that once we make a proposal to them of
minimum requirements, they will be able to sit down and say, `Wow,
can we afford this or not?' '' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the negotiations start. At this point, we haven't
even got there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian River County administrator Jim Chandler said the
community wouldn't have gotten involved in the process if it
couldn't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers are looking economically at the bottom line and so
are we,'' Chandler said. ``Up to this point, we're considering an
awful lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers work with Vero Beach in what is being termed
``good faith'' discussions, the Yavapais are waiting for the team
to sign a contract so they can start construction. Conceptual
drawings have been completed by HOK Sports Facilities Group, the
firm that designed Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations began with Fort McDowell Indian Community,
Clinton Pattea was the president. Two weeks ago Bernadine Boyd
became the president, although the community's desire to lure the
Dodgers to Arizona hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pattea left office, word from Arizona was a deal was all
but consummated, which has caused an air of uncertainty at
Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this point I do (feel confident),'' Boyd said. ``We're
optimistic and we're excited about them coming to our area. We were
surprised that Fort McDowell was named as one of the sites they
would want to come to. We've given our proposal to them, but we
haven't received a counterproposal from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are expected to announce a decision shortly after
spring training concludes, but the general feeling is that
Dodgertown won't be inhabited by the Dodgers next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what Vero Beach would be like if (the Dodgers)
left,'' resident Lucille Gladness said. ``It's something that I
hope doesn't happen.'' &QL;

CHECKING IN WITH OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world where points count, and goals count more than
anything, Rob DiMaio's value can be easily overlooked. It's the
checker's life. Score a couple of goals and the whole world loves
you. Spend 60 minutes racing around the ice with a fire
extinguisher, pulling on Superman's cape, poking multimillionaires
in the ribs, and nobody knows your name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get stuck with that stigma sometimes,'' said DiMaio, whose
goal, his fourth of the season, helped the Bruins to a 3-2 win over
the Coyotes Tuesday night at the Vault. ``That you're only a
checker.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shaking that label now, not unless, at the age of
31, the rugged, durable, tenacious DiMaio suddenly reinvents
himself as some latent run-'n'-gunner. He has the legs to be a
scorer. He has the will for it. He has the spatial sense it takes
to be a producer. He lacks only the hands, the finishing touch,
which is always what separates those who dig ditches in the ice for
a living from those who live the sweet life of scoring success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have the ability to score,'' said DiMaio, referring to
himself and his running mates on the Boston checking line, P.J.
Axelsson and Tim Taylor. ``Timmy led the AHL one year in scoring.
And I had some good years, in junior hockey and in the minors. P.J.
can be a scorer. So I don't think you can categorize us as solely a
checking line.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the case against the Coyotes. DiMaio had his
strike, lifting the Bruins to a 2-1 lead in the second. Just over
eight minutes later, Axelsson popped in his seventh this year,
collecting a feed from Anson Carter as he stood alone in the slot,
not a single Phoenix sweater within 10-10-321 dialing distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I stood there for a couple of seconds before I shot,''
said a pleasantly perplexed Axelsson, who also supplied the key
assist on DiMaio's goal, chipping a perfect pass off the sideboard
to send his linemate galloping down the left side. ``I was really
surprised about that.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio looked every bit the sniper on his goal. He raced into
Axelsson's relay and blew past defenseman Keith Carney at the blue
line, his legs buzzing to stay ahead of the former Providence
defenseman. Cutting in from the left circle, he rushed through the
slot and slid a forehander under rookie netminder Robert Esche.
</P>
<P>
   For a second, DiMaio was a highlight clip out of the old
Canadiens skate-and-shoot handbook, a little Lafleur come to life
in a black-and-gold sweater. More rushes like that and he'd have
more career goals than he does career broken noses. It was a piece
of work in the most complimentary sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got their noses dirty, too, that's why they get their
points,'' said coach Pat Burns, referring to his trusted checking
triumvirate. ``Rob gets down on the boards. Like on his goal. He
goes there knowing he'll get by the guy or he'll be completely
creamed. Not everyone wants to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, DiMaio got into a jabbering match with Jeremy Roenick,
another of those big-coin guys DiMaio chases for a living. DiMaio
got hit by Roenick and there was something about the former Thayer
Academy star's style that DiMaio didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaves his feet when he hits guys,'' said DiMaio. ``I don't
like that. You can really hurt people that way. He tells me he
always hits like that. That's fine, but I told him he's not going
to hit me like that. If he does, then I'm going to do something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another thing to like about DiMaio. In his world, it's
still OK to get angry at the guys who wear the other sweaters. Too
many games now look like NHLPA pep rallies (feel the love, guys,
feel the love). Many nights are absent big hits and rarely does
anyone say a discouraging word about the other side. Roenick plays
with an edge. DiMaio does the same. The two met and some sparks
flew. The same thing happened when Jason Allison and Keith Tkachuk
banged around in a center-ice rotary. But the DiMaio-Roenick
exchange had a touch of the old Johnny McKenzie ``check this''
attitude in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a knock against Jeremy,'' said DiMaio. ``But I told him, I
find that kind of stuff cheap. Hey, I'm not the cleanest guy in the
world, but I just don't do that. I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Checkers aren't about style and artistic form. They're about
rolling over the boards every third shift, sometimes more if the
game dictates, and yapping, clawing, even scoring to get the job
done. DiMaio's line was on for both Phoenix goals. In that sense,
he said, the two goals his line scored were just a matter of making
things even.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of us know we can score,'' said DiMaio. ``All of us
believe, if we're given the opportunity to play that way, we can
put the puck in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the checker's dream. And for a night it came true.

JAPANESE SUPERSTAR SUZUKI THE NOMO OF POSITION PLAYERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ If it plays in Kobe, can it play in Peoria?
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Suzuki will have a good idea starting Thursday when the
Japanese superstar takes part in his first exhibition game with the
Mariners. Suzuki is just visiting, but he's embarking on something
no Japanese position player has done: test his talents in the
American major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hideo Nomo joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995, other
Japanese pitchers have followed his lead. Shigetoshi Hasegawa of
the Anaheim Angels led baseball in relief innings last year, and
Hideki Irabu of the New York Yankees and Masato Yoshii of the New
York Mets were effective as starters.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, 25, is the best position player in Japan, drawing
comparisons to Ken Griffey Jr. for his baseball ability and Michael
Jordan for his celebrity. The left-handed hitter has won five
batting titles with the Orix Blue Wave and has won league MVP
honors three times. He has stolen as many as 49 bases in a season,
and his outfield arm ranks with any in the States.
</P>
<P>
   Though Suzuki can't become a free agent until midway through the
2001 season, at the earliest, it's obvious to those around the
Mariners that he could be a trailblazer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with and against some guys that obviously had the
ability to have success over here,'' said Mariners hitting coach
Jesse Barfield, who finished his playing career with the Yomiuri
Giants in 1993. ``But to me, if anybody could do it and have
success, it's Ichiro, because he's so fundamentally sound in
everything he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki said he isn't motivated by the chance to do for hitters
what Nomo did for pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if I'm the first one or not, I just would
like the opportunity to do it,'' he said. ``I want to face the best
in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki is careful not to disparage the talent in the Japanese
major leagues. Proving to Americans that Japan can produce good
offensive players is of minimal concern. But the fact that Nomo &AMP;
Co. have been joined by no Japanese hitters after five years does
raise the question of why.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the answer is that, from an offensive standpoint, Japan
produces what America already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their players are more line-drive, gap-to-gap hitters,'' said
Roger Hansen, an M's minor league instructor now working for the
Blue Wave. ``There are tons of those in the States, so how many can
you really bring?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Colborn, M's director of Pacific Rim scouting, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The style of play we look for is different than what they have
to offer,'' he said. ``We want big, powerful guys with size, and a
lot of their guys are contact hitters and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   No player in Japan's 135-game season hit even 35 homers last
year, and M's pitcher Jamie Moyer, who played in Japan this winter
with a team of major league stars, said he noticed parks were
smaller and balls didn't carry as well in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Barfield said the game is played differently there, with more
emphasis on the one- or two-run inning. In the first inning, he
said, it's common to see hitters bunting and corner infielders
guarding the line against extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching dominates games more,'' said Roger Jongewaard, M's
vice president for scouting and player development. ``Their
pitchers have excellent control, and it's easier to scout pitching.
You see one or two games, and you feel pretty good about what a guy
can or can't do. With a position player, if he has an uneventful
one or two games, you walk away not knowing for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Age and size also matter. With no role models who have made the
jump, Japanese amateurs are less inclined to dream of coming to the
States. Professionally, Japanese players need nine years' service
time before becoming free agents, and many would-be prospects are
too old for consideration when their time comes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Japanese game emphasizes pitching, Jongewaard said,
many larger Japanese players are pitchers, not sluggers. Colborn
said it's less common to find players with legs as long and upper
bodies as big as a lot of American players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a choice between a player that looked like Joey
Cora and a player that looked like Alex Rodriguez, you'd take
Alex,'' Colborn said. ``That doesn't mean there aren't Joey Coras
in the big leagues, because there are, but a lot of their players
look like Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   Colborn also noted the social difficulties in leaving Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big gamble to leave Japan, psychologically, because
it's such a tight-knit society,'' said Colborn, who was pitching
coach for the Blue Wave from 1990-93. ``They're not brought up to
be as independent as much as Americans are. We're taught to be
individuals, they're taught to consider the group. When you leave,
you lose that security.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the first (position player) that leaves is facing
ostracization, which is exactly what Nomo got. But he redeemed
himself by competing and becoming a hero. The first hitter who
comes over here is blazing a new path. Does he have the
personality, is he strong enough to do it? Those are the main
things, and then, are the circumstances right?''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki recognizes the same issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baseball part will take care of itself; if you're good
enough to play, you're good enough to play,'' he said. ``His
lifestyle, his strength and his ability to handle stress and
opposition _ it will take the right person to be able to accomplish
all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of Japan will be watching as Suzuki begins his quest.
The Mariners announced Tuesday that exhibition games on March 5 and
6 will be televised live in Japan by NHK Broadcast Services. Never
before has NHK televised a major league spring training game.
</P>
<P>
   MARINER NOTES: Agent Scott Boras, who represents Rodriguez,
David Segui and other Mariners, chatted with M's vice president of
baseball operations Woody Woodward at practice Tuesday. ``I don't
see anybody tense here,'' Woodward said. ``We'll talk through the
spring and see what we can get done.'' Segui's contract expires at
the end of this year, Rodriguez's after the 2000 season. ... Also
spotted Tuesday: union chief Donald Fehr, who delivered his annual
address to Mariners players. ... Remember all that skepticism over
the composition of the sod at Safeco Field? At least one team
thinks the M's have the right mix. The Arizona Diamondbacks, who
also have a retractable-roof ballpark with a grass field, announced
they are changing their turf to the same blend of 80-percent
Kentucky bluegrass and 20-percent perennial ryegrass the Mariners
will use. ... Griffey took his son Trey to a Lakers-Suns basketball
game in Phoenix Monday night and met Dennis Rodman for the first
time. ``I'm going to get a tattoo,'' Griffey said, without
specifying what kind. A Mariners compass rose, perhaps? ``No,''
Griffey said, smiling. ``I might be traded.''

AGENT IRWIN DIES, REPRESENTED CARDS' WILSON 
</HEADLINE>

 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Irwin, a prominent Valley sports agent, died Saturday
morning at his Scottsdale home of an apparent heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, 41, is survived by his wife, Christine; son, Daniel John,
15; and daughter, McKenna Christine, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was the agent for several notable players, including
Cardinals defensive tackle Bernard Wilson and Chicago Bears
cornerback Tom Carter.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, he had represented several other Cardinals,
including fullback Larry Centers and safety Lorenzo Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always seemed to be upbeat and have an optimistic view of
the world,'' Wilson said Tuesday shortly before services for Irwin
were held at the Ascension Lutheran Church in Paradise Valley. ``He
always kept his word to me. He will be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin also represented Channel 10 sportscaster Kevin McCabe.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, he didn't stand to make any money, but he still gave
me the utmost attention,'' said McCabe, who remembers that Irwin
visited him at Cardinals training camp in Flagstaff shortly after
McCabe agreed to a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was drinking a Diet Coke and eating some Red Vines and
said, `This is what I made off of you,' '' McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin also owned The Firm, a fitness center in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always in great shape and in a good frame of mind,''
said Sondra Como, who had worked for Irwin at his agency for eight
years. ``He had a great charisma and presence about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin coached his son's basketball team, the Arizona Heat, and
the family has asked that contributions be made to Arizona Heat
Basketball, 204 E. Tremaine Drive, Chandler, AZ 85255. &QL;

<P>
   SQUINT, Ariz. _ Lost my sunglasses on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what could be expected? I haven't needed them for almost
half a year. I forgot the transport requirements, not to mention
the operating instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Heading to the Mariners' spring training camp, I had no
protection from the local atmospheric treacheries. Due to lack of
exercise, the muscles in my molelike eyes didn't dilate.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't see a thing.
</P>
<P>
   No, there is no place called Squint, Ariz. Yet it is all I can
do.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, through the use of multiple baseball caps and a
cardboard shield, my eyes were sufficiently sheltered to provide me
some bearings. I drove along Bell Road in 80-degree heat until the
strip malls ended and the home-run balls thwacked against the
rental car _ unmistakable evidence of Peoria and the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The next observation didn't need unimpaired vision: The more
both change, the more they remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   The main arterial to the spring training site is now swollen
into one solid conga line of overneoned national fast-food joints
and megastores. Like the Mariners, it's a lot of familiar flash.
And about as unlikely to distinguish itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest,'' said Woody Woodward, Mariner vice president
of baseball operations. ``Regardless of what's been said, Lou
(Piniella) likes hitting, period.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it with a small smile, not intending a criticism but
offering a frank portrayal of the essential M's of the '90s _ good
hit, no pitch or field.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to the fact that the first fake game isn't until Thursday,
it's a tad early to conclude firmly that the '99 Mariners will be a
replica of past Piniella teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the take on this squad was apparent months ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the annual offseason rhetoric included the standard
bromides about bumping up pitching and defense _ a refrain that
sounds suspiciously like the old Soviet five-year economic plans to
increase production of tractors and potatoes _ the Mariners failed
to replace Randy Johnson with another No. 1 pitcher, failed to find
a fast leadoff hitter, and didn't add much glovework.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the B-list newcomers to the Mariner veterans, it's
obvious that another formidable array of missiles and artillery is
ready. Again shy of quota: tractors and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Woodward tell it, the situation is epidemic in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to every club this offseason, and what you'll see
starting the season is more than 20 clubs still looking for
pitching,'' he said. ``That includes the Yankees, who need a
left-handed relief pitcher. When you see the kind of money that was
given for pitchers such as Tim Belcher and Todd Stottlemyre, teams
are trying to make their offenses as good as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Add in the '98 jolt created by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa in
the home-run chase, install Albert Belle in the shoebox of Camden
Yards, and baseball figures to be in for another year of rotund
round-trippin' led, presumably, by the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   While topping the game again in homers (234), the Mariners last
season also set a major league record for fewest one-run wins (they
needed to win their final six one-run games to finish 10-20).
Although that is partly due to bullpen failures, the offense
continued to be mostly an all-or-nothing proposition with limited
capacity for manufacturing runs or creating a late rally.
</P>
<P>
   Players see little reason to abandon the macho tradition, now
given further legitimacy by the ardor that enveloped McGwire and
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``More fans come to see home runs than they do anything else,''
said Jay Buhner. ``We have one of the most potent offenses in
baseball history. The big gray cloud over us has been pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. claims the home-run chase to be a false god.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home runs are not why I play,'' he said. ``The Yankees didn't
have anybody hit more than 25 home runs, and what did they win _
120 games?''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Griffey emphatically insists he's not a home-run
hitter. Yet his 56 last year was only the seventh-highest total in
history. Like Buhner, Griffey has grown accustomed to the American
League and Piniella-endorsed style that calls for the three-run
dinger as the easiest cure-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it is in this league,'' said former
National Leaguer David Segui, who said the infrequency with which
Mariner hitters sacrifice an at-bat to advance a runner ``is no
more than on any other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the big-bopper emphasis, coupled with the lack of
pitcher development, adds up to this:
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' total of 583 extra-base hits last year was
third-highest in baseball history, edging out the 1936 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 was the 597 of the '97 Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 was the 607 of the '96 Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   In those three seasons, the Mariners have won one postseason
game.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has been baseball's Great Squandering _ a
spotlight offense with refrigerator-light pitching and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my undilated eyes betray me. Maybe all the new players
will change things for Seattle in '99.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe McGwire, Sosa, Belle, Griffey, Vaughn, et al. will
punch little rollers to the right side of the infield to get the
runner to third.
</P>
<P>
   Right.

PARKER RETURNS TO PHOENIX AREA PREP SCENE AS GILBERT COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Parker, the man who implemented the pink bellies that got
Mesa Mountain View's coaches in trouble last season, was handed the
Gilbert High School football program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the challenge, and it will be a
challenge,'' said Parker, who won 232 games before leaving Arizona
for Texas high school football in 1995. ``I'm looking at it as an
opportunity to sort of start over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who will meet with Gilbert players today and will begin
work during spring drills in April, will have to change his
wardrobe. He stalked the Mountain View sidelines from the late
1970s to mid-'90s in short-sleeved, red-and-blue striped golf
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got black and gold stripes all over him now,'' said
Gilbert District Athletic Director Joe Pico, who helped Parker
start Mountain View's program in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Pink definitely will be out.
</P>
<P>
   Parker has said he began having players inflict pink bellies to
each other in Mountain View's program in the 1980s as a consequence
of losing off-season conditioning contests so they would know how
it feels to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View coaches continued the tradition after Parker left
in 1995 to try to win a title in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Coach Bernie Busken and assistant Jerry Wheeler
were suspended for one playoff game for violating a Mesa district
policy against such forms of discipline. That issue was addressed
in the interview process, Pico said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a policy like Mesa, but our coaches damn well
understand what happens in terms of pink bellies and cruelty to
children,'' Pico said. ``Jesse understands that. He'll do us
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker is grateful for the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of admiration for Gilbert to be willing to
go out on a limb,'' said Parker, who won four state titles at
Mountain View and one at Camelback. ``Not many educators take the
chance to bring about success.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker returns to the east Valley after ending a coaching stint
in Texas amid controversy over his methods of discipline.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned from Texas High in Texarkana just before the start
of last season because of a dispute over discipline with the new
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obstacles to overcome that I had at Texas High were a lot
more than I realized,'' Parker said. ``I know something about
Gilbert from the past, and we won't have the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from the Texas experience. The thing that hurt
me the most in the long run was the lack of support within the
administration and even some of the coaches who weren't supportive.
I don't think that will happen at Gilbert.''
</P>
<P>
   Pico said the players will benefit from Parker's strict
discipline and work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game should be in big bold letters: WORK,''
Pico said. ``Parker is in town. We will all get together and become
a family and go to work. Discipline will be in the line of work.
They're going to be working. If you run it halfway, you're going to
run it 15 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, a highly decorated educator who will teach in the social
studies department, competed for the job with former Alhambra Coach
Paul Hoffland and Gilbert assistants Luis Nightengale and Mark
Nolen, Athletic Director Mark Cisterna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited to have Jesse just based on his accomplishments
in the east Valley,'' Cisterna said. ``I think he's going to bring
high energy to the program. It's hard to argue with his record.'' &QL;

CATS AWAIT BIG UNIT  
 JOHNSON EXPECTS AGGRESSIVE SWINGS

<P>
   TUCSON _ If there are extra coins in the University of Arizona
Wildcats' athletics kitty, baseball Coach Jerry Stitt might want to
use them to buy parachutes for his players when they play the
Diamondbacks today at Tucson Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   Flame-throwing left-hander Randy Johnson will be on the mound
for the Diamondbacks, and the Wildcats might be inclined to bail
out of the batter's box in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, who pitched for the University of Southern
California before turning pro, says he isn't looking to teach the
young whippersnappers a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still hitters and they're still aggressive, whether
they're in college or the major leagues,'' Johnson said Tuesday.
``There's a bit of pride on the line for them and me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get the ball in the strike zone, work on a few
pitches and build a little more stamina each time out, make sure my
endurance is there. I'll probably have only about 30 pitches, but I
don't want to use them all in the first two innings.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Paying tribute &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence will be observed before today's game to pay
respect to Ken Robinson, a minor league pitcher who was killed in
an auto accident early Sunday morning in northwest Tucson. &QL;  &QL; 
Playing it safe &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kelly Stinnett did not play in Tuesday's intrasquad game
and likely will be out a few more days with a bit of stiffness and
soreness in his back just below his right (throwing) shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were the regular season and I needed to, I could play
on it, but there's no sense in pushing it at this point,'' Stinnett
said. ``There's kind of a knot back there that won't let go.
Hopefully, a little rest and some anti-inflammatories will take
care of it.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Where's Womack? &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter says that recent trade acquisition Tony
Womack will play today, but where? The club wants to move him from
second base to right field, but he is unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Womack took more work in the infield during a Tuesday morning
workout, but he also did some shagging in the outfield for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rome wasn't built in a day,'' Showalter said. ``Let's just say
he'll be out on the field _ somewhere.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Lee-doff hitter? &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is such a thing as a sophomore jinx, first baseman
Travis Lee apparently hasn't heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   He was 4 for 4 in Tuesday's intrasquad game, including a
three-run homer off right-hander Dan Carlson and a double off
left-hander Matt Ruebel. After the double, Lee took off for third
base and made it safely on a head-first slide for the steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he must be working for that leadoff spot,'' Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the normal scheme, Lee is expected to hit third or fourth. &QL;  &QL; 
Turning it &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most encouraging signs of Tuesday's game, Showalter
said, was the footwork of Jay Bell around the second-base bag on
double-play attempts. Bell is making the move from shortstop to
second base this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was the middle man on a double play started by third
baseman Matt Williams and narrowly had another when he took a throw
from pitcher Aaron Small and got the throw to first a tad late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was over there at second for the final 15 games last year,
and not once was I involved on a double-play ball hit to the left
side,'' Bell said. ``There were a few 4-6-3's, but nothing over
there. So it was good to be able to have that chance today.'' &QL;

 UW's EDMUNDSON PAVILION, 71, BRACES FOR A MAKEOVER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Experiencing the ultimate midlife crisis, Hec
Edmundson Pavilion is prepared to trade in its white socks and
black wing tips this weekend, promising to emerge in 18 months much
more hip, vibrant, a trend-setter.
</P>
<P>
   Get out the gold chains and deep tans, the city's most
moth-eaten athletic facility is headed for a major makeover. Not
one red brick will be displaced from the outer walls, but the
interior will lose all of its early 20th century feel.
</P>
<P>
   Stodgy Hec Ed is about to become ultra-chic Hectoro Eduardo.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old building will be vacated this weekend _ or after
possible University of Washington NIT postseason basketball games
are completed _ setting in motion a $39 million renovation project
that begins April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ceremonial touches have been added to Saturday's
Husky-Cougar men's matchup _ the return of former players and
coaches, a game ball presentation, net-cutting, reception and
opening of a time capsule _ to signal impending change.
</P>
<P>
   Seats and memories will be ripped away, but apparently no one
feels an overwhelming need to retain them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to want comfort,'' said Marv Harshman, 81, who
played in Edmundson Pavilion as a high schooler and collegian, and
coached there for the Huskies and as an opponent while at WSU. ``At
my age, I think it's kind of nice to have comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone will be the 20 posts that have obstructed views for seven
decades. Gone will be the acoustical tiles that have hung
grotesquely from the rafters for 31 years. Gone will be an
old-fashioned way of serving up a constantly evolving game.
</P>
<P>
   People like Addis Gutmann will tell you the place has always
carried a great deal of charm. The Laurelhurst travel agent and UW
grad, now 68, practically spent his childhood there. He went to
games with his father, climbed through Hec Ed windows with friends
to sneak into Husky football games and was personally acquainted
with basketball coach and gym namesake Clarence ``Hec'' Edmundson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pavilion had its own smell, a warm smell,'' Gutmann said.
``You walked in there and felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have never cared much for the place. Or
understood how it has survived intact so long.
</P>
<P>
   Humzey Vessin was the student manager for a Kentucky team that
won a national championship at Hec Ed in 1949. For some unknown
reason, he recently stayed up past midnight in Lexington watching a
televised Husky game. He couldn't believe his eyes _ in the
backdrop was the same facility, virtually unchanged after 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Washington was still playing in that old gym
that we played in,'' said Vessin, now 71 and a retired golf
professional. ``That was fascinating to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Beard, a starting forward on the same Kentucky team and
later a convicted point-shaver, played in gyms all over the
country. He played in Europe as an Olympian. With so much at stake,
he wondered what he and his teammates were doing in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gym was not very good at all,'' said Beard, also 71 and
living in Louisville. ``Anybody who took one look at it could tell.
It was not any Madison Square Garden by any means; it was dark and
dank in comparison. I know no one has probably said all that
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a letdown, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Told the building is scheduled for a two-year remodel, Beard
didn't change his tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's 50 years overdue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other VIP visitors were more congenial in their assessment of
the local basketball accommodations. In 1952, Hec Ed hosted its
second NCAA championship event, and what would be the first Final
Four format used ('49 involved a title game and consolation
contest).
</P>
<P>
   Guests this time were the Kansas Jayhawks and their 6-foot-9,
240-pound All-America center, Clyde Lovellette. To the big guy, Hec
Ed was unique. Besides, he had a 33-point, 17-rebound title game on
that floor, one good for MVP honors and an 80-63 victory over St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter where we played, in a high school gym,
college gym or arena,'' said Lovellette, now 69. ``We were just
happy to play in it. (Hec Ed) was huge. Most us were farm kids and
it looked like one of the big barns where we used to store things.
We had seen nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   People voiced a similar reaction when Edmundson Pavilion was
unveiled in 1927, seven years after a deckless Husky Stadium was
built. The pricetag was $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The state high school tournament, which was created by Edmundson
in 1923 and hosted in another, tiny UW gym, was moved to the
spacious new arena in '28. For the next 50 years, the place became
a mecca for basketball fans across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a romantic place for a kid like me from a place like
Lake Stevens,'' Harshman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hec Ed's attendance record, which will stand for perpetuity, is
12,961, established during the 1957 state tourney semifinals that
featured a repeat title run by Seattle's Lincoln High. That's 400
more than were crammed into each of the gym's two NCAA title games.
</P>
<P>
   When redone, Hec Ed's new capacity will be just under 10,000, up
from the 7,900 seating arrangement used in recent years. There will
be no more 12,000-plus gatherings, which were made possible by
nearly all bleacher seating and a severe test of fire codes.
</P>
<P>
   The new facility will offer three kinds of seating _ bleachers,
bleachers with backing and theater chairs _ but no luxury boxes.
The ceiling will have a girdered look, with roof support provided
by four super-sized posts placed inauspicuously in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Gothic art windows to the west will be uncovered on the inside,
with hope that the place can once again enjoy natural light. The
second-level Hall of Fame Room will be extended the length of the
building, giving it a museum atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion originally was designed as a multi-purpose
facility, handling six or seven men's sports _ including use as an
indoor football field and track _ and housing coaching offices,
classes and intramural gyms. Seating and flooring were meant to be
mobile. After the remodel, everything will be permanently attached.
</P>
<P>
   For ideas, UW officials toured refurbished campus arenas at
Duke, Kansas, Oklahoma State, Butler and Northwestern, and came
away encouraged. The first three have supported Final Four teams,
and the film ``Hoosiers'' was filmed at Butler in Indianapolis.
Only Northwestern, recovering from a gambling scandal, has failed
to enhance its basketball program with its new digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is to maintain the tradition and history of Hec
Edmundson in an updated fashion,'' UW assistant athletic director
Chip Lydum said. ``Instead of renovation, it's restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Husky men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the women's
volleyball team, will be displaced for a year while Hec Ed is
gutted. The men will play at KeyArena, the women at Mercer Arena
and the volleyball team at the former naval station at Sand Point.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic offices, lockers and the training room have been moved
to the Hec Ed Addition, though the football team will be permitted
to use its existing dressing quarters through spring drills.
</P>
<P>
   While there aren't any protesters chained to the sight-impairing
posts, deploring the desecration of a Seattle landmark, there is
concern among longtime fans that memories might be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Houbregs tossing up his soft hook from anywhere on the
floor. Rafael Stone, just 5-9, driving down the middle of the lane
and going over UCLA's 7-foot Lew Alcindor, now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
to score. Sammy White leaping and hanging in the air like an early
day Michael Jordan before becoming, unlike Mike, an accomplished
major league baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   There also was the bizarre and near-tragic. The Hec Ed roof had
skylights until a 1938 windstorm caused one to fall and injure two
spectators. Then there was the night in the 1940s when timer Bill
Belshaw, using a pistol to start and stop the halves, shot himself
in the hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He swore roundly and they had to take him to the trainer's
room and fix him up,'' said Wendell Broyles, former UW football and
basketball P.A. announcer. ``I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   By sprucing up Hec Ed, people hope to keep the region's wide
array of high school basketball talent from leaving for other
programs. Newness sells.
</P>
<P>
   From what he's seen of the new plans, Harshman thinks new seats
will mean more wins. He always was convinced the crowd was too far
removed from the action, that the noise level was effectively
muffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought old Hec Ed was one of the easiest places for
a visiting team to play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Let the wrecking ball swing.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The San Antonio Spurs entered Tuesday night's game against the
Rockets as one of the worst offensive teams in the Western
Confernce.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But they were the best team in the NBA when it came to defense,
and they proved that from start to finish in their 99-82 victory
before 16,285 Compaq Center fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who set an NBA record last season by holding
opponents to 41-percent shooting from the field, are even better
this season, limiting teams to 39.6-percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets got a good look at that defense, shooting 41.3
percent _ and they had to rally to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The fans made their displeasure known, booing the Rockets as
they walked off the court at halftime trailing by 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing,'' said Charles Barkley, one of the few
Rockets to exhibit any fire Tuesday night. ``We got our butts
kicked tonight. All we can do is apologize to the fans for putting
that effort out there. I'm not sure what happened, but it was just
embarrassing the way we played. It was an embarrassing effort.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much how the postgame analysis went from every
player wearing a Rockets uniform _ embarrassing, disappointing,
puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about a playoff-intensity-type game because it was a
big game, but it just wasn't there, and that puzzles me,'' said
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``I thought that they came out more
aggressively than we did. I thought they made the extra pass, and
we just didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets didn't do much of anything right, playing like a
teen-ager on his first date _ they pretty much had an idea of what
they were trying to do but made all the wrong moves at the worst
possible times.
</P>
<P>
   All those wrong moves were manifested in one six-minute stretch
as the Rockets watched _ and that is the precise word _ the Spurs
work them over for a 17-3 run to end the first half.
</P>
<P>
   And that run went a long way toward ending the game as well.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen couldn't understand the lack of intensity, saying
there was never a time during the game that he thought the Rockets
demonstrated any sort of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' said Pippen when asked if he was ever happy with
the way things were going Tuesday night. ``Not even from the
(start). We just never played aggressive enough or showed any type
of intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets finished with 20 turnovers _ the fourth time in
their past six games they had turned the ball over at least 20
times.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan was a force inside, scoring 23 points, pulling down
14 rebounds and blocking five shots for the Spurs (7-8).
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Hakeem Olajuwon struggled for the Rockets, making
just six of 19 shots to finish with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Like
the Spurs, the Rockets also nudged their way a bit closer to .500
at 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Cause for concern?
</P>
<P>
   You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to worry about our intensity lately,'' said Pippen,
who finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists. ``We
haven't come out with any fire or any sense of urgency. We're not
being aggressive enough on offense. It looks like we're back on our
heels, unsure of what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rocket Mario Elie knew exactly what he wanted to do,
getting the Spurs out and running, and getting some revenge on his
former employers, by scoring five of his 15 first-half points in
the 17-3 run that ended the first half, a spurt that gave the Spurs
a 53-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a team that entered the game averaging a paltry 87.9
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling it early, and it was really nice to come back to
Houston to play,'' said Elie, who sat out the second half with a
strained left hamstring. ``It was good to see my old buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to pardon the Rockets if they don't feel the same
toward Elie after watching him torch them in the first half. That
first-half pounding earned the Rockets a sustained serenade of boos
as they trudged off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That never makes you feel good, but I don't blame them with
the way we were playing,'' said guard Brent Price of the booing.
``We probably deserved it tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come with our best game faces on, and as Rudy said,
if you can't get up for a game like this with a team you might be
battling in the playoffs, then something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game where there's not much to say about it,''
Olajuwon said. ``It was just a terrible game. Period.''

LUCKY STARS GET TIE WITH RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The power play was powerless, the puck- handling
putrid and the defensive lapses laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's 2-2 tie against the New York Rangers was one of the
the Stars' worst performances this season, players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always heard about the circus here at Madison Square
Garden,'' Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said, ``And I finally got
to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the Dumbo plays and the clownlike bumbling, the
Stars left the venerable Garden with one point. What's so bad about
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to get a point,'' Ludwig said. ``At the same
time, we're disappointed we lost a point.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the game was a wash _ a wakeup call that the Stars
are moving down the road and they need to leave the circus tents
behind, along with a limp power play and some bad habits formed by
a week of nonpractice. When the team buses arrive in Long Island
today, they'll have a much-needed practice, coach Ken Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've had one practice in three weeks, and there were
times that we looked like it tonight,'' Hitchcock said of the team
playing its ninth game in 16 nights. ``We had made the decision
that we would focus on nothing but the games and throw all of our
energy into the games, and we have had some success with it. But I
think it's caught up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' power play was the worst example of bad timing. It
went 0-for-7 and actually hurt the team's momentum. Not only did
the Stars not get chances with the man advantage, they yielded some
of the Rangers' best chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we really got \Rcheated\S by the referee,''
Hitchcock joked. ``We felt pretty strongly that he didn't give us
the opportunity to decline all of those power plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all the bad news, the Stars were able to hold off a
sizzling Rangers team and neutralize one of the hottest lines in
hockey _ Petr Nedved, Adam Graves and John MacLean. While Hitchcock
said he felt that line won a chess match with Mike Modano's line,
the final score sheet read one goal for each line. The Rangers'
line had scored five goals on Sunday against the vaunted
Philadelphia Flyers line of Eric Lindros, John LeClair and Keith
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Chip in a hard-working goal for the Rangers' third line and a
well-timed goal (27.7 seconds left in the second period) by the
Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk, and the result was a well-earned draw.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 38-11-10 and keep alive their nine-game (7-0-2)
road unbeaten streak. They have 86 points, 16 better than
second-place Phoenix in the Western Conference. The Coyotes lost a
3-2 game to the Boston Bruins last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, despite a spirited effort, lost ground in their
race for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. With
wins by the Boston Bruins, Montreal Canadiens and Washington
Capitals, the Rangers are four points out of a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rangers exit a run against the Coyotes, Flyers and
Stars with five out of six points _ and that's a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to get the win,'' Nedved said. ``But I
thought it was a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing he didn't talk to Ludwig, who claimed the Stars made
like a vacuum for much of the darned night _ or words to that
effect. But maybe that's a lesson to be learned, he mused.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the key _ we can play 15 to 20 minutes of a 60-minute
game and still get a point out of it,'' Ludwig said. ``If that
doesn't knock you on the side of the head and tell you that if you
do play well, you're going to get the win, I don't know what
will.'' nn

DiSARCINA TRIES TO COPE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina finished an
interview Tuesday morning in the Tempe Diablo Stadium clubhouse,
and as he walked away mumbled, ``Now I get to go and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He is struggling with being away from the team while he recovers
from a broken bone in his left forearm. The injury occurred Feb. 21
when he stepped out of the batting cage and was hit by coach George
Hendrick's bat.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina is wearing a hard cast from his hand to his biceps and
will be examined today by Arizona Diamondbacks physician Dr. David
Zeman. Doctors have told him it'll take four to six weeks for the
bone to heal, but DiSarcina is planning to be ready by Opening Day,
April 6 vs. the Indians at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard right now, just being removed from the
guys,'' he said. ``I firmly believe spring training is the start of
the season, the camaraderie, the championship feeling. I'm lucky in
a way because I already know a lot of the guys well, but when you
bring into the clubhouse guys like Mo (Vaughn) and Tim Belcher,
unless you're on the field with them, it's tough to get a good vibe
with them. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Pumped up: Center fielder Jim Edmonds hit two home runs in
Tuesday's intrasquad game _ one off Shigetoshi Hasegawa and one off
Troy Percival. He also hit one in Monday's intrasquad game.
</P>
<P>
   He said he took two days off after the end of last season and
went straight to the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I take a whole month off, but it drains your energy,''
he said. ``So I thought I'd try something different.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the horn: Belcher started and went two innings in the
intrasquad game. He gave up two runs and three hits, including a
two-run home run by Troy Glaus. ``By no means was the ball jumping
out of my hand,'' Belcher said. . . . Vaughn struck out three times
in the game. . . . Chuck Finley, bothered by a muscle strain in his
back, played catch for about 10 minutes and is listed as
day-to-day. Manager Terry Collins said he hopes Finley will begin
throwing off the mound by the weekend.

<P>
   DALLAS _ It would be easy for someone just moving into this
locale, someone who hadn't been hanging around for the last decade
or so, to believe that folks around here have gifted the Mavericks
with some sort of cushy lifetime pass to be sorry and get away with
it.
</P>
<P>
   No win, no problem, man. Get 'em next year. Or the next. Or the
next. Or whenever. ``Yawn...''
</P>
<P>
   That, pilgrim, would be mistaking numbness for resignation.
There's a distinct difference.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-Dallas is notorious as a winners-only town, and no
one's going to show up on the latest turnip truck from Yankeeville
and try to tell us we've gone soft on the biggest losers in North
Texas professional sports history.
</P>
<P>
   I submit the more than 10,000 empty seats at Reunion Arena last
night as defense exhibit A.
</P>
<P>
   Here the Mavs were, needing only to beat the winless Los Angeles
Clippers to stitch together their first four-game home winning
streak in more than five years, and Reunion Arena looked like it
had been quarantined.
</P>
<P>
   A plethora of empty green seats saw the Mavs dump the Clippers,
112-99, for their fifth victory in their past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think this little run fools anybody, then you need to
take another look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the impression that the Metroplex has tolerated
this little `slump' the Mavs have been in,'' TV analyst Bob Ortegel
said before the Mavs lifted their season record to 6-10 after a 1-8
start. ``I think fans here are very frustrated with the situation.
It's just gotten to the point where there's almost nothing more to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the numbness we're talking about. There comes a point at
which the limits of disgust and loathing just can't be pushed any
further. The Mavs are 233-521 in the past decade. No one willingly
accepts that kind of futility, but when you get chafed raw long
enough, you do eventually get calloused.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs have won more than 28 games (36-46 in 1994-95) only
once in the past eight years. It has been nine years since they
last made the playoffs (1989-90), and they were swept in three
games by Portland. They've played host to exactly one playoff game
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd won three games in a row, and I turned the talk shows on
the other morning on the way to work,'' coach Don Nelson said,
``and we were getting roasted. I didn't get the idea that anybody
was taking it easy on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they be.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, I haven't figured out whether Nelson, along with
Pat Riley one of two three-time NBA coach-of-the-year winners, is
savior or snakeoil salesman, the builder of franchises or the
seller of dreams that will never come true.
</P>
<P>
   Is he the basketball genius we so desperately want to believe
in, or is he simply playing on house money with nothing to lose as
he cashes Junior Perot's ample checks?
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to fear it's the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I like about Nellie is that he doesn't deny
that he's responsible and if it doesn't happen, it's his fault,''
Ortegel said. ``Sometimes you've just got to ride with a guy. You
get a guy with Nelson's credentials, you tend to stay with him a
little longer than someone with lesser credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Adubato, Gar Heard, Quinn Buckner and Jim Cleamons, for
instance, may they rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   You can debate, however, whether the Mavs team that was in place
when Nelson arrived _ Sam Casell, Jim Jackson, George McCloud,
Chris Gatling, Eric Montross, Jamal Mashburn _ was a better team
with a better future than the one he put on the court last night.
At least that team had its No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has already traded next year's first-rounder, almost a
lock to be a lottery pick, to Phoenix for disappointing point guard
Steve Nash. Maybe the Suns knew what they were doing when they
listed him third on their depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Not that having a first-rounder is a guarantee that Nelson can
find a player. An accent, sure; a ``game,'' maybe not. Chris
Anstey, a first-round pick out of Australia, rarely leaves the
bench these days. Now he has been joined by struggling Dirk
Nowitzki, the German whiz kid Nelson traded for when he could have
drafted Boston rookie Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I thought \RNowitzki\S would at least be able to
do is score,'' Nelson said. ``We've had to bring him along slower
than I thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   Salary-cap restraints might even keep Nelson from being able to
keep fast-developing Gary Trent next season.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sense that the Mavs, with Perot willing to let Nelson
do what he wants, are simply waiting until the new arena opens,
hoping that renewed interest then will buy them even more time.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't count on it. The whispers that Tom Hicks will
eventually find a way to add the Mavs to his growing sports empire
grow louder almost daily. There'll be no more free lunch _ not even
for Nelson _ if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look as positive as I said it was'' before the
season, Nelson agreed. ``We haven't come together as quick as I'd
hoped, but I'm not discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that he does not speak for all of us.

WHO CARES ABOUT THESE BRICKLAYERS?

<P>
   DALLAS _ It would be easy for someone just moving into this
locale, someone who hadn't been hanging around for the last decade
or so, to believe that folks around here have gifted the Mavericks
with some sort of cushy lifetime pass to be sorry and get away with
it.
</P>
<P>
   No win, no problem, man. Get 'em next year. Or the next. Or the
next. Or whenever. ``Yawn...''
</P>
<P>
   That, pilgrim, would be mistaking numbness for resignation.
There's a distinct difference.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-Dallas is notorious as a winners-only town, and no
one's going to show up on the latest turnip truck from Yankeeville
and try to tell us we've gone soft on the biggest losers in North
Texas professional sports history.
</P>
<P>
   I submit the more than 10,000 empty seats at Reunion Arena last
night as defense exhibit A.
</P>
<P>
   Here the Mavs were, needing only to beat the winless Los Angeles
Clippers to stitch together their first four-game home winning
streak in more than five years, and Reunion Arena looked like it
had been quarantined.
</P>
<P>
   A plethora of empty green seats saw the Mavs dump the Clippers,
112-99, for their fifth victory in their past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think this little run fools anybody, then you need to
take another look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the impression that the Metroplex has tolerated
this little `slump' the Mavs have been in,'' TV analyst Bob Ortegel
said before the Mavs lifted their season record to 6-10 after a 1-8
start. ``I think fans here are very frustrated with the situation.
It's just gotten to the point where there's almost nothing more to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the numbness we're talking about. There comes a point at
which the limits of disgust and loathing just can't be pushed any
further. The Mavs are 233-521 in the past decade. No one willingly
accepts that kind of futility, but when you get chafed raw long
enough, you do eventually get calloused.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs have won more than 28 games (36-46 in 1994-95) only
once in the past eight years. It has been nine years since they
last made the playoffs (1989-90), and they were swept in three
games by Portland. They've played host to exactly one playoff game
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd won three games in a row, and I turned the talk shows on
the other morning on the way to work,'' coach Don Nelson said,
``and we were getting roasted. I didn't get the idea that anybody
was taking it easy on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they be.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, I haven't figured out whether Nelson, along with
Pat Riley one of two three-time NBA coach-of-the-year winners, is
savior or snakeoil salesman, the builder of franchises or the
seller of dreams that will never come true.
</P>
<P>
   Is he the basketball genius we so desperately want to believe
in, or is he simply playing on house money with nothing to lose as
he cashes Junior Perot's ample checks?
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to fear it's the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I like about Nellie is that he doesn't deny
that he's responsible and if it doesn't happen, it's his fault,''
Ortegel said. ``Sometimes you've just got to ride with a guy. You
get a guy with Nelson's credentials, you tend to stay with him a
little longer than someone with lesser credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Adubato, Gar Heard, Quinn Buckner and Jim Cleamons, for
instance, may they rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   You can debate, however, whether the Mavs team that was in place
when Nelson arrived _ Sam Casell, Jim Jackson, George McCloud,
Chris Gatling, Eric Montross, Jamal Mashburn _ was a better team
with a better future than the one he put on the court last night.
At least that team had its No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has already traded next year's first-rounder, almost a
lock to be a lottery pick, to Phoenix for disappointing point guard
Steve Nash. Maybe the Suns knew what they were doing when they
listed him third on their depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Not that having a first-rounder is a guarantee that Nelson can
find a player. An accent, sure; a ``game,'' maybe not. Chris
Anstey, a first-round pick out of Australia, rarely leaves the
bench these days. Now he has been joined by struggling Dirk
Nowitzki, the German whiz kid Nelson traded for when he could have
drafted Boston rookie Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I thought \RNowitzki\S would at least be able to
do is score,'' Nelson said. ``We've had to bring him along slower
than I thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   Salary-cap restraints might even keep Nelson from being able to
keep fast-developing Gary Trent next season.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sense that the Mavs, with Perot willing to let Nelson
do what he wants, are simply waiting until the new arena opens,
hoping that renewed interest then will buy them even more time.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't count on it. The whispers that Tom Hicks will
eventually find a way to add the Mavs to his growing sports empire
grow louder almost daily. There'll be no more free lunch _ not even
for Nelson _ if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look as positive as I said it was'' before the
season, Nelson agreed. ``We haven't come together as quick as I'd
hoped, but I'm not discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that he does not speak for all of us.

VETERANS COMMITTEE WATERING DOWN THE HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Frank Selee?
</P>
<P>
   He died almost 90 years ago. What's the point?
</P>
<P>
   Did the Baseball Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee suddenly dig
up new information on the former Cubs manager that wasn't available
50 years ago to people who actually knew him?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Hall of Fame has only been in existence for 63
years. Surely if Selee was that deserving, somebody would have made
sure he was enshrined in Cooperstown long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the workings of the Veterans Committee, the Hall of
Fame's version of a mop-up crew, making sure all those oversights
of the Baseball Writers Association of America are rectified.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday the 12-man committee elected four more: Selee (who
probably was an excellent manager), slugging first baseman Orlando
Cepeda, umpire Nestor Chylak and Negro League star pitcher Smokey
Joe Williams, a native Texan born in Seguin.
</P>
<P>
   Enough.
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   No more electing any 19th century players, who have all long
since either gone to a far better place than Cooperstown or to a
place where the Hall of Fame is the least of their worries.
</P>
<P>
   And no more electing 20th century players who were unable to
muster the 75 percent needed in the regular election.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously it's nice when you hear Cepeda say: ``This is the
greatest day of my life. When I first heard it, I started crying,
my wife started crying. It's a wonderful feeling, beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Veterans Committee has long out-served it's original
intent of inducting worthy 19th century candidates, a duty it was
assigned 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's one final mission should be to make sure the appropriate
Negro League stars are considered. Once that's done, the committee
should be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the voting to the baseball writers, who for the most part
are unbiased and much stricter.
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda, even without considering his 1975 drug arrest, was a
borderline candidate. He had a nice career with some outstanding
moments but hardly more sterling than Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Dave
Parker or many others with similar statistics. None of those guys
are Cooperstown-bound.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball writers aren't perfect. My feeling is they botched
it completely by not electing Gold Glove third baseman Ron Santo, a
mistake the Veterans Committee will probably fix at some point. The
lack of support for catcher Gary Carter is also puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the writers have set their standards high. The
Veterans Committee almost ruined the Hall of Fame in the 1970s when
Frank Frisch, the former Giants and Cardinals star, became chairman
and elected almost every teammate and drinking buddy from the 1920s
and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you have the Baseball Encyclopedia out, look up Travis
Jackson and Fred Lindstrom and try to figure out what the committee
was thinking there.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball writers also do a much better job than their
AFL-smitten pigskin counterparts, and the past Football Hall of
Fame election proves that.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Lawrence Taylor controversy. Completely overlooked
was that the voters elected Buffalo Bills guard Billy Shaw, an NFL
reject who starred in the rebel league in the 1960s. But they have
yet to consider Green Bay Packers guard Jerry Kramer, who was a
five-time All-Pro on one of the greatest teams ever.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw should have waited at least as long as Frank Selee.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans Committee has done well in electing Negro League
stars and non-playing personnel, although Dick Williams remains a
major oversight. The man got the San Diego Padres into the World
Series; what other proof is needed.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to players, the committee has only served to
water down the Hall of Fame with borderline candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Enough is enough.

WETTELAND THROWS FROM MOUND WITHOUT PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers closer John Wetteland took a
significant step toward being available for Opening Day, throwing
batting practice yesterday for the first time this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland suffered a soft-tissue injury to his right ankle Feb.
22, when his ankle ``locked'' while he was throwing in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good session out there and showed myself and whoever
else was interested the ability to throw 15 minutes with decent
stuff,'' Wetteland said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider manager Johnny Oates among those most interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good on the mound,'' Oates said. ``As far as the
physical part, he went the full 15 minutes. He threw the ball well,
and he threw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland reported no pain afterward, but swelling restricted
the ankle's range of motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw well, and I felt fine until I took off the wrap and
saw the swelling,'' Wetteland said. ``That puzzles me because it's
around the area that's not injured, and I threw twice as long
\RSunday\S without it swelling. It's not painful at all. There's
just some swelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland appeared encouraged by his workout, in which he threw
all four of his pitches: fastball, curve, slider and changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? That's 15 minutes already?'' Wetteland asked after his
final delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's right-handed, Wetteland uses his right foot to push
away from the rubber and drive toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no small-time injury for a pitcher,'' catcher Joey
Goodwin said, ``and he's out there throwing for 15 minutes when I
haven't seen him throw live B.P. this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, a non-roster invitee to camp who was the Rangers'
bullpen catcher for five months last season, was one of several
hitters who faced Wetteland yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it wasn't John Wetteland's big-league fastball, but
he definitely had something on it,'' Goodwin said. ``He wasn't just
flipping it in there.''
CLAYTON LOOKING FOR WALKS
</P>
<P>
   Rangers center fielder Tom Goodwin, whose .383 on-base
percentage led American League leadoff hitters last year, serves as
a model for shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin dramatically increased his on-base percentage by drawing
a career-high 73 walks, 29 more than his previous best.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton drew a career-high 53 walks in 1998, and the Rangers
want more improvement so Clayton can take advantage of his speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any one thing you want to improve, it's getting on
base, no matter how you do it,'' Clayton said. ``I made some pretty
significant progress for me last year, and I feel it's something I
can improve upon.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will be without three regulars for the exhibition
opener Friday against Cincinnati in Sarasota, Fla. Right fielder
Juan Gonzalez, first baseman Rafael Palmeiro and third baseman Todd
Zeile will remain in Port Charlotte for their workout, along with
reserve infielder Luis Alicea and catchers Gregg Zaun and Cesar
King, manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers excused pitcher Dan Kolb from yesterday's workout to
tend to a personal matter.

IN BOOK, LEWINSKY LASHES OUT AGAINST STARR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a book to be published later this week, Monica
Lewinsky is so critical of the independent counsel Kenneth Starr
that several of her friends and associates say they fear that Starr
will become angry and try to revoke her immunity agreement and
prosecute her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky says in the book, ``Monica's Story'' by Andrew
Morton, that she was so despondent at her treatment by prosecutors
who confronted her at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Pentagon City, in
suburban Virginia, on Jan. 16, 1998, that she briefly considered
killing herself in their presence, said two people familiar with
the contents of her book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is described as being deeply sympathetic to the
president. Immediately after she was confronted by Starr's
prosecutors, Morton writes that Ms. Lewinsky ``said she had this
overwhelming thought: She must warn the President.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, one of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, said on Tuesday
night that neither he nor her other lead lawyer, Jacob A. Stein,
had seen the book's manuscript or galleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and Andrew Morton did this on their own,'' Cacheris
said. ``We did not vet the book.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate about how Starr would react.
</P>
<P>
   But several friends of the Lewinsky family said on Tuesday that
they were worried that Ms. Lewinsky's remarks might backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big concern to us,'' an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said
on Tuesday night. ``She's bound by this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the immunity agreement under which Ms. Lewinsky testified
about her affair with President Clinton and efforts to cover it up,
Starr did not permit Ms. Lewinsky to discuss his office's conduct
in a two-hour interview with Barbara Walters to be broadcast on ABC
on Wednesday night. But Ms. Lewinsky was free to discuss Starr's
office with Morton because her agreement did not apply to the book.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ms. Lewinsky says that after one of Starr's
prosecutors told her she faced 27 years in jail if she refused to
cooperate with their criminal inquiry of the president, she
contemplated throwing herself out a window on the hotel's 10th
floor, where she stood at the time with several prosecutors, the
people familiar with the book said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky says she ``couldn't bear to go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would come out an old lady and no one would ever want to
marry me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She continues: ``I thought there was no way out other than
killing myself. If I killed myself, then there would be no
information and I wouldn't have to deal with the hurt and the
trouble I had caused the President.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky complains in her book that her efforts to call her
lawyer and her mother were rebuffed by prosecutors and agents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that on Jan. 16, 1998, prosecutors had
confronted her with a copy of her false affidavit in which she
swore that she had not had an affair with Clinton. But at that
time, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Francis Carter, had still not filed
the affidavit yet with a federal court in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has said his office was sent the affidavit anonymously by
James A. Moody, a lawyer for Linda R. Tripp who had obtained it
from lawyers for Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors are facing an investigation by the Justice
Department on their conduct in the Lewinsky inquiry, including
whether they had improperly tried to coerce Ms. Lewinsky to
cooperate with their investigation while her lawyer was not present
and had improper contacts with lawyers for Ms. Jones that were not
disclosed to Justice Department lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, Ms. Lewinsky said that after she
told the prosecutors that she needed to consult her mother, Marcia
Lewis, a prosecutor, Jackie M. Bennett, told her: ``You're 24.
You're smart. You're old enough. You don't need to call your
mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under her immunity agreement, Ms. Lewinsky is not allowed to
speak with the news media without Starr's permission. For months,
Starr had insisted that Ms. Lewinsky remain silent. Several weeks
ago, he permitted her to speak with Ms. Walters only after
insisting that she not discuss her knowledge of the continuing
investigation or any issues involving Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr, did not return
telephone calls on Tuesday night. But in the past, Bakaly has
defended the treatment of Ms. Lewinsky as ethical. In his testimony
before the House Judiciary Committee in November, Starr said Ms.
Lewinsky was incorrect that prosecutors had barred her from calling
anyone she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it clear to the witness that she was, in fact, free to
leave,'' Starr said then. ``And the Ritz-Carlton, shall I say, is a
fairly comfortable and commodious place.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``bankruptcy'' has an air of finality, but the reality
often does not. Companies go bankrupt, then re-emerge with former
creditors as the owners. Customers may not even notice.
</P>
<P>
   But such will evidently not be the case with J. Peterman, the
catalog clothing company that gained fame, and hubris, from being
satirized on the ``Seinfeld'' television show. The costs of opening
13 stores, combined with a poor Christmas season, left it short of
money and in bankruptcy. With no buyers having appeared, it has
stopped taking phone orders and its assets will be liquidated in a
court auction on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The J. Peterman catalog never used photographs, instead
combining florid prose with drawings that were none too precise.
Perhaps it was the stark reality of seeing the actual product at
the stores that led to the company's demise. In any case, J.
Peterman has joined a not-very-select group of retailers _
including Korvette's and W.T. Grant _ whose creditors decided they
were worth more dead than alive.

   There is no immortality quite like the immortality of the

   True, Veronica now has a column on the Archie Comics Web site,
where you can e-mail her directly, and Reggie has lightened up on
the hair tonic. The girls seem to have a more knowing look than
they used to, as well as more revealing wardrobes. But Archie's
eyes have always popped out of his head at the sight of Betty and
Veronica, and he still seems transfixed by a desire that is only as
deep as his attention span is long.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years John Goldwater was president of an organization he
helped found _ the Comics Magazine Association of America, whose
Comics Code Authority insured that the comics it certified were as
clean as a table top in the Riverdale Chok'lit Shop that Archie and
his friends frequented. Nobody looks to the comics for realism, of
course, certainly not the 15 million people who buy ``Archie'' each
year. Nor do they buy it because it unleashes fantasies of power,
like the superhero comics. What ``Archie'' offers, instead, is the
fantasy of surviving adolescence, forever. &UR;  &LR;

AWARDS ABOUND, BUT THE ACADEMY RULES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only two weeks to go until the Oscars, my local movie
theater is running a promotional spot for this year's Academy
Awards show. There they are, all the memories _ James Cameron
crowing, David Niven fielding the streaker, Cher winning for
``Moonstruck'' in the bird headdress _ in a pitch meant to trumpet
Oscar's glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the night that brings the whole world together and sets
Hollywood apart!'' the ad exclaims. Since when do we need
reminding?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, America's love-hate relationship with the
most divine of traditional awards shows should mean a red-circled
date on the calendar. Yet each year, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences comes closer to weakening its franchise and its
hold on our collective imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Little gold gentlemen abound: this very Sunday evening, the
Screen Actors' Guild will be handing out its own Oscar clone (the
Saggy?), a svelte statuette that is now poaching on the academy's
terrain for the fifth year in a row. At least from afar, this looks
like a reasonable alternative. And the Screen Actors' Guild didn't
forget to nominate Joseph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the academy must still be reeling from its
splashiest challenge yet: January's Golden Globe Awards telecast,
in which the year's hottest screen celebrities lit up a rival
television show while thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association from the bottoms of their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the once tacky Golden Globes event has become so
glittery that it's now a serious spectacle in its own right _ even
if the small, starstruck Hollywood Foreign Press Association could
better spend its time explaining why ``Jack Frost'' is a top-10 hit
in Ireland than annointing great artistic achievements of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With substance so easily eclipsed by flashy packaging, we are
fast approaching the time when a glittery television show and a
prize for Gwyneth Paltrow will be enough to guarantee any
award-givers' credibility. But however quickly these back-patting
rituals proliferate, and however interchangeable they become, the
blue-chip status of the Academy Awards miraculously survives.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it's a leap of faith that we still choose to make.
It's a link to the past magic of American filmmaking and the hope,
against heavy odds, that such magic still exists. It's the memory
of fabulous, half-imaginary Hollywood in the face of the workaday
film industry and business as usual. And it's the essence of our
current awards-show fever. None of this copycat hoopla would exist
if the Oscar show itself weren't such an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Though period pieces _ men with guns and women with handmaidens
_ dominate this year's nominations, Oscar night always works as a
barometer of current attitudes; that remains a large part of its
fascination. We can always look back and head-scratch about what
brought forth the year of ``Gandhi'' or ``Forrest Gump.'
</P>
<P>
   ' And this time we can wonder not so much about the
preponderance of war stories and costume dramas as about the
striking absence of films dealing with contemporary life. Among
this year's various nominees, the few that do grapple with the
present are either fraught with pain (``Affliction,'' ``A Simple
Plan,'' ``American History X,'' ``A Civil Action,'' ``One True
Thing'') or fearful of an Orwellian future (``Pleasantville,''
``The Truman Show''). As the best original screenplay nominee
``Bulworth'' demonstrated, a film that tries to take on
contemporary political or social realities is such a rarity these
days that it's a shock to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Count on the television cameras to seek out Warren Beatty not
only when that screenwriting prize is handed out but also when Elia
Kazan receives his Lifetime Achievement Award. As the director of
``Reds,'' Beatty should be among those whose reactions to that
controversial choice will be most revealing. Outspoken opposition
to this overdue honor for Kazan has already colored this year's
event.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts remain that he is a figure of vast and enduring
artistic influence, one of the visionary directors of this century,
and that acknowledging such work is part of the academy's mandate.
Political censure never has been. It will be an important measure
of the academy's mettle if audience members can make their feelings
known without diminishing the dignity of the evening.
((italics)That(end italics) remains the job of outrageously-dressed
actresses and winners who won't shut up.)
</P>
<P>
   The hard decision to honor Kazan is consistent with other
difficult choices to be made this year. The best picture category
is always a tough horse race, but this year it's a killer. At least
there is one ringer amid such formidable nominees as ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The Thin Red Line'' and
``Life is Beautiful'': ``Elizabeth,'' a flamboyant throwback to the
days when academy voters imagined themselves to be edified by
historical spectacle, even though sex, violence, scheming and fancy
royal costuming were really all any audience had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   I have yet to encounter anyone who learned much about England's
16th-century religious wars by watching a saucy young queen with a
gifted hairdresser find her way to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever hopes there were to pass off ``Elizabeth'' as an
edifying experience should surely have been punctured (despite Cate
Blanchett's intelligent allure in the title role) by the advent of
``Shakespeare In Love.'' In the year when no hit movie lacked a
twin, ``Shakespeare in Love'' was everything that ``Elizabeth''
meant to be, and so much more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here was beauty with brains: a glittering, splendidly
entertaining film ablaze with wit and romance, and the one that
achieved the year's most amazing feat. Even harder than finding
humor amid the Holocaust or catapulting present-day viewers back to
Omaha Beach was re-inventing Shakespeare as pin-up of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the delights of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' it's
quietly unmistakable that ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the cinematic
achievement of 1998. It was by far the most visceral, moving and
meaningful experience to be had in a movie theater this year, and
the one with the deepest ramifications for those who saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's rekindling of the all-but-lost values of
patriotism, sacrifice and moral outrage at the savagery of war came
as an enormous surprise, not only because it became an improbable
box office winner but because it refuted all known wisdom about
when and how a film ought to arrive on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   None of the master planners or focus groups who govern the film
industry could have guessed that a ``Saving Private Ryan'' throws
conventional wisdom to the winds. A film this serious and
substantial makes its own rules, and lingers in the memory long
after easier filmgoing experiences have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the long shadow of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the nominations
for the year's other war epic, ``The Thin Red Line,'' acknowledge a
different kind of honor from the academy. Regardless of whether it
wins prizes, Terrence Malick's comeback film has received the vote
of confidence it deserves and shows how nominations are often ends
in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Other legitimate but left-field choices like Edward Norton for
best actor in ``American History X'' and Roberto Benigni's ``Life
is Beautiful'' in the best picture category deliver the same kind
of prize-free validation.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd-pleasing Benigni is sure to win something, somewhere,
but it's not apt to be in the best actor category either _ not with
Nick Nolte and Ian McKellen so deserving of that award. (Though
arguably Tom Hanks did his best work ever in ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' two-time winners play the Oscar game by different rules.)
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Affliction'' and ``Gods and Monsters,'' for which Nolte
and McKellen are respectively nominated, must be among the year's
least widely seen major films, both are works sure to impress
academy members who do see them. The same is true of ``Central
Station,'' though the performance of Fernanda Montenegro as an
embittered, complicated and heartbreaking character is far and away
the best actress' work I saw last year.
</P>
<P>
   No matter: Gwyneth Paltrow was a breathtaking presence in
``Shakespeare in Love'' and far outshone most of her previous work.
(Her first film appearance, in ``Flesh and Bone,'' remains
indelible.) By all the measures that make Hollywood a dream
factory, she deserves to be crowned an Oscar queen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paltrow is, along with the costume designer Sandy Powell
(both ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Velvet Goldmine''), the closest
this year's Oscar show may come to a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, what a pleasure it is to report that the
documentary category features five strong candidates and is
entirely up for grabs this year. ``Dancemaker'' (about the
choreographer Paul Taylor) and ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the
Truth'' were both nominated, in a year with many strong
behind-the-scenes films about entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   And both ``Regret to Inform,'' about widows of the Vietnam War,
and ``The Last Days,'' another somberly affecting Holocaust film,
are also in the running. But I'm partial to ``The Farm: Angola
U.S.A.'' and its deeply surprising portrait of no-exit life in a
Louisiana prison.
</P>
<P>
   It does what award-winners should always accomplish: It takes
audiences where they could not otherwise go.

THE MILLENNIUM IN PERSPECTIVE, WITHOUT HOOPLA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Karen Durbin is the film critic for Mirabella magazine. Her most
recent article for the Arts and Leisure section was about Liv
Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman.  
 By KAREN DURBIN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Dec. 31, 1999. Jesus arrives in New York with his assistant
Magdalena on his arm and a vexing question on his mind: should he
start the Apocalypse or not?
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, a travel agent invites his closest friends to escape
the millennial hoopla by retreating to a primitive island paradise
off the French coast, only to discover that, freed from the demands
of his busy urban life, he becomes someone he can't stand.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of a serenely beautiful red-clay village in Mali
pass the time visiting, doing chores, listening to the radio and
trying to call distant relatives from the post office telephone.
Desperately poor, they live with the kind of unself-conscious
simplicity that the Parisian travel agent seeks.
</P>
<P>
   These are story lines from ``2000 Seen By,'' a series of roughly
hour-long millennial films from seven countries that opens in New
York on Friday for the first leg of a tour around the country. The
three films described are, respectively, by the American director
Hal Hartley, the French filmmaker Laurent Cantet and the
Mauritanian-born Abderrahmane Sissako, whose family lives in Mali.
</P>
<P>
   The series also includes a smartly silly screwball comedy from
Spain's Miguel Albaladejo; a tale of star-crossed Hungarian lovers
by Ildiko Enyedi (the only woman filmmaker in the group); a darkly
comic dystopia by the Taiwanese director Tsai Ming liang set in a
crumbling, rain-soaked housing project whose inhabitants fall prey
to a mysterious plague, and a politically pointed fable by Alain
Berliner in which Belgium marks the millennium with a vicious civil
war between its two main ethnic groups, the Flemish and the
Walloons.
</P>
<P>
   Portmanteau film projects tend to be traps for second-rate work,
but this collection is an exception to the dismal rule. Ming
liang's ``Hole'' and Sissako's ``Life on Earth'' are the standouts
in the series, but even the least successful films are far from
duds. If Hartley's jazzy-looking ``Book of Life'' is more than a
tad literal-minded, things pick up whenever Martin Donovan's grumpy
Jesus appears on screen in a Brooks Brothers suit with the singer
P.J. Harvey as his punk Magdalene.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the terminal romanticism of Ms. Enyedi's ``Tamas et
Juli'' is redeemed by a bluntly graphic sex scene lighted and
staged with such startling originality that it remains etched in
one's mind long after the rest of the film has faded into one of
the picturesque mists that the director favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``2000 Seen By'' is the brainchild of Carole Scotta and Caroline
Benjo, two young partners in Haut et Court, a French production and
distribution company specializing in independent cinema. The women
struck a deal with Arte, the European cultural television channel,
which provided seed money in exchange for broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   To insure the project's global scope, they solicited proposals
from an international roster of directors and selected 10 for
production. (The Brazilian, Canadian and German films broke away
from the series and are being released individually.) The only
full-length feature that remains is ``The Hole,'' at 89 minutes,
with the other six films running 60 to 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Like all but the best short stories, movies of less than feature
length can feel like minor work. But the brevity of these films
turns out to have unexpected virtues. With ``The First Night of My
Life,'' for example, Miguel Albaladejo manages to pack eight vivid
characters, an ingeniously complicated plot, stylish visuals and
deft social commentary into little more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American films have fallen prey to a mystifying
case of bloat, such artistic economy is both a tonic and a
reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the specter of another sort of bloat is invoked
simply by the occasion. Fox Lorber, the series' United States
distributor, is releasing these films now, says Wendy Lidell, a
company vice president, because ``I want to be ahead of the
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be so much of this millennium branding, so
much stuff coming out, I don't know when interest will peak,'' Ms.
Lidell says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The approach of the last millennium triggered mass panic
and the threat of hysterical violence. Today, Y2K glitches aside,
the worst danger we're likely to face is hysterical boredom.
</P>
<P>
   The most overanticipated New Year's Eve in 1,000 years is
threatening to roll in on a tidal wave of conspicuous consumption
and commercial tie-ins. The T-shirts alone may bury us all.
</P>
<P>
   As a subject for a movie, the millennium arrives pre-bloated, at
once too grand and too trivial. On one hand, it seems to demand
work that not only predicts the future but survives it. On the
other, people can't even agree on when it begins (mathematically,
with the first nanosecond of 2001, but viscerally, a year earlier,
when all those nines turn into zeroes).
</P>
<P>
   Like all attempts to fix time, to pin it down and make it stop,
``the millennium'' is an artificial construct, fragile and doomed
to deflate. Once the last horn is tooted, what remains but the
novelty of writing the date with odd-looking numbers?
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``2000 Seen By's'' directors solved this problem with
their own deflationary tactics, treating the subject obliquely and
with humor. ``The concept of the year 2000 was really a pretext to
gather filmmakers together whom we believed in,'' Carole Scotta
says. ``When they submitted their synopses, we were happy to see
that they dealt with the subject in very personal ways.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most personal film is Sissako's ``Life on Earth.''
Ms. Scotta describes the way he worked. ``Abderrahmane convinced
Arte to let him go to his father's village with an idea but no
script. He stayed for two weeks, taking notes. Then, still with no
script, he went back with a four-person crew. The actress in the
film wasn't planned; this beautiful woman on her bike passed in
front of his camera, and he decided to make her a central
character. Abderrahmane really conceived this film in the
editing.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a movie of such uncommon delicacy and melancholy
grace it looks like the result of months of careful planning.
Deploying a soundtrack that moves seamlessly from a Schubert
quintet to the artful tenor of the great Malian singer Salif Keita,
Sissako weaves his day-in-the-life footage into a compelling lament
for a beloved country impoverished by colonialism and stranded in
time.
</P>
<P>
   The village is African, but French is the only language anyone
speaks: the eloquent French of the anticolonialist Martinique
writer Aime Cesaire (``Do not be a sterile spectator/A screaming
man is not a dancing bear'') being read aloud on the local radio
station, and, finally, the millennial broadcast from Paris,
babbling inanely about the Eiffel Tower as the symbol ``of our
entry into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers, who have all they can do to maintain a shaky
foothold in the 20th, listen carefully, and then pick up their
chairs and go home.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN things are going bad _ really bad, like they were for the San
Antonio Spurs before the slump-busting Rockets brushed off the
welcome mat Tuesday night _ everything is magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Every miss looks devastating. Every lazy turnover looks
boneheaded. Every blown play, every flat-footed moment, makes fans
start screaming ``Pig'' even when Anthony Miller is sitting on the
bench in his warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The team is horrible. The coach is a bum. Something needs to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I caused El Nio, and I also tripped Mary Decker,''
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of his troubles, which some
believed would have led to his firing today had the Spurs continued
their misery against the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But Popovich is alive and coaching. The Spurs apparently have a
pulse. Perhaps the more pertinent question is, Do the Rockets?
</P>
<P>
   The troubles that Tuesday's 99-82 Spurs walk over the Rockets at
Compaq Center brought forth need no magnification. They were as big
as a JumboTron, as vexing as a bad vertical hold.
</P>
<P>
   They slapped 16,285 fans in the face. They were real.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like we were playing with strangers,'' Rockets coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days after the Spurs were run out of their own gym by
Utah in maybe the most humiliating San Antonio effort since Santa
Anna, the Rockets showed every flaw in their increasingly worrisome
game.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every hustle and effort statistic that has for years
been the cornerstone to Rockets glory went San Antonio's way.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive rebounding was again nowhere near adequate, with San
Antonio earning an 18-10 edge. Shooting (41 percent) was miserable
and made to look worse by the Rockets' putting up 20 fewer shots
(95-75) than the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon was 6-for-19 and on a few occasions
uncharacteristically pushed away from his favorite spots on the
baseline and in the lane. Othella Harrington was 1-for-6, Brent
Price 2-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets committed more turnovers (19-12) and had more fouls
(20-15), sure signs of a team feeling its way across the floor _
tentative, flat-footed and confused.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a bunch of strangers, as Tomjanovich put it, saying
hello to misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really need to do is get to know each other,''
Tomjanovich said. ``In this game, practice and organization is
everything. Guys have the freedom to do what they do best. We need
fire. It mystifies me that we don't have it. We were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed mystifying, particularly when the opponent was a
team widely considered the most disappointing in the NBA thus far.
It's time to worry.
</P>
<P>
   No longer should the lockout-shortened season be wholly blamed.
No longer should the addition of Scottie Pippen be a crutch. No
more should rookies in key roles, or Olajuwon's adjustment to
playing with Pippen, or the backcourt's still trying to find its
main man, be talked about.
</P>
<P>
   Everything should be talked about. It's time to search for a
cure and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley said he wouldn't go crazy over Tuesday's effort.
It's just one game, he said. But it was one like the bad one
against Atlanta earlier. It was one that only briefly even was
close.
</P>
<P>
   And considering all the troubles the Spurs have experienced and
all the pressure heaped upon Popovich's shoulders, the Rockets now
have lost exactly one fewer game than San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   When Pippen was asked if it's still too early to worry, he
shrugged and hesitated. Then, he stated the obvious: ``No. Not
really. It's not too early to worry. It seems like we're not sure
what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Worry.
</P>
<P>
   It never has been more obvious than Tuesday that uncertainties
and holes are clear. And nowhere is it more clear than in the
much-talked-about backcourt, where the trio of Brent Price, Bryce
Drew and Matt Maloney watched the Spurs' Avery Johnson put on a
scorching performance.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson finished with 18 points, 13 assists and only two
turnovers, Price finished with six points and only one assist with
four turnovers. Drew was 0-for-4 from the field, and Maloney did
not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever they put in at point guard, we have to support them
100 percent,'' Barkley said. ``We'll get better. The bad thing is
losing to a bad team.''
</P>
<P>
   But what did it say about the Rockets?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have guys understand that it's just not always X's
and O's,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's emotion and chemistry. It's got
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's still not.

A SINGLE GUY LOOKING FOR LOVE (THROUGH A LENS)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ted Loos' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
second-generation European film actors.  
 By TED LOOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For his first film, Myles Berkowitz set up his camera
and hoped for the worst. Inspired by Ross McElwee's personal
odyssey ``Sherman's March,'' a funny, rambling first-hand account
of that director's fraught relationship with women, Berkowitz
decided to film a series of his own dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to make a mean, vicious little comedy about
dating,'' said Berkowitz, who at the time was both recently
divorced and professionally stumped in Hollywood. The resulting
movie, ``20 Dates,'' nudges real life along by orchestrating its
humorous situations. Closer in technique to MTV's ``Real World''
than to ``Sherman's March,'' it is cinema verite that has slipped
on a banana peel.
</P>
<P>
   By bending the rules to send up the conventions of romance,
Berkowitz, 36, produced a movie that defies genre labels. ``It's a
screwball romantic comedy, it's a document of single life today,
it's guerrilla filmmaking,'' Berkowitz said recently over dinner in
SoHo, reeling off the possibilities in eager-to-please fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The Groucho Marx-style nose and glasses that Berkowitz wears in
one brief scene would probably not pass muster with the Maysles
brothers, Barbara Kopple or other rigorous documentarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``A documentary to me is putting a camera down and watching real
life happen,'' Berkowitz said. ``And I consciously provoked
situations. I'm a provocateur. So it's not fair to call it a
documentary. But is it real? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the editing room, where 120 hours of film was whittled down
to 88 minutes, there was one rule, said Berkowitz: ``We were going
for laughs.'' The film, which opened in New York on Feb. 26, got
enough laughs at last year's Slamdance festival, the alternative
film festival that has grown up around Sundance, to win its
Audience Award _ and a distribution deal with Fox Searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have seemed alternately irritated and charmed by
Berkowitz's antic film. ``Ingeniously conceived, `20 Dates' is a
laugh-out-loud chronicle of the struggling filmmaker's hunt for a
girlfriend (and, not incidentally, a cool Hollywood job),'' said
Eric Harrison of The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the focus on comedy allowed the director to include a
tongue-in-cheek cameo by the screenwriting guru Robert McKee, known
for his Story Structure classes. McKee tells Berkowitz, his former
student, that he may be ``incapable of love.''
</P>
<P>
   McKee calls ``20 Dates'' a ``mockumentary,'' a descendant of
``This is Spinal Tap'' and Federico Fellini's ``Clowns.'' And while
Berkowitz doesn't embrace the ``mockumentary'' label, since none of
the material was scripted, he acknowledges the debt. ``Part of the
fun of this movie is wondering whether it's real or not,'' he said.
``It provides a certain energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say that Berkowitz is not lacking that
quality himself. ``Myles has tremendous energy _ the kind of drive,
to be fair, that you need to succeed in Hollywood,'' said McKee. On
screen, Berkowitz comes across as alternately annoying and
endearing, an effect he was conscious of at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most obnoxious things about the movies from
first-time filmmakers is that they always try to come off as great
people,'' said Berkowitz. ``Well, you know what? That's not
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in person, erkowitz works to get a laugh. When an unsmiling
waiter at Monzu comes over to take his order, Berkowitz begins
bantering with him, to no effect. Only a story of his own days as a
waiter _ Berkowitz once instructed an obese diner to order a small
dinner salad and got fired for it _ produces a laugh. The filmmaker
almost sighs with relief.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the humor in ``20 Dates'' comes at the
director's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so self-effacing in his way,'' said the film's associate
producer Barbara Cameron, a friend of Berkowitz who provides some
female perspective on camera. ``He makes himself the buffoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Through friends and colleagues, Berkowitz was able to find women
who would agree to be filmed; this was Los Angeles, after all. Some
of the resulting experiences will be familiar to anyone who has
been on the dating front lines: a handshake offered to avoid a
good-night kiss, or the first time holding someone's hand.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But when he tried a hidden camera, the film did produce some of
the viciousness that Berkowitz had originally envisioned. When he
tells one unsuspecting date that she has been on camera all night,
she becomes visibly upset and walks out. By the end of the project,
Berkowitz had fended off two lawsuits; all participants eventually
signed release forms.
</P>
<P>
   In the final version, Berkowitz didn't include anything the
women objected to. Behind the scenes, one of the film's two editors
was a woman, and female friends urged him toward full disclosure.
``Usually, the women said: `Please show that. I went out with jerks
like you and I want to see it!''' said Berkowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the camera caught the one event the filmmaker never
expected. He fell in love with one of the dates, Elisabeth Wagner,
in the middle of the project.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had to finish his film, since his producer _ who
actually thought he was getting a cheap sex comedy _ insisted on
exactly 20 dates. The dilemma, and the way Berkowitz improvises a
solution, provides the momentum for the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   This unlikely triumph of love ``came out of a place of total
desperation,'' said Berkowitz, speaking about his career. ``I was
at wits' end.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker, who grew up in Pelham Manor, N.Y., and attended
Horace Mann High School in the Bronx, began his film career acting
in television commercials for Pepsi, Burger King and the Army. That
paid for his undergraduate years at the Wharton School of Business.
He tried acting in New York for a while, and then moved west.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 years before starting ``20 Dates,'' Berkowitz had
found Hollywood success sporadic at best, though he had created and
starred in a short-lived cable show, ``The Beef,'' and had written
for HBO's ``Tales From the Crypt.'' He also took part in
``thousands of meetings'' about film projects that never came to
fruition, in addition to many jobs as a waiter (he didn't get fired
from all of them).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was coming to the time when I had to move on,'' he said.
``I thought: `But I'm not done yet. I'm going to go down
fighting.''' Berkowitz decided to combine, as he says in the film,
``my two greatest failures: my professional and personal lives.''
Shot on videotape with a crew of two, ``20 Dates'' cost about
$70,000 to produce.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Berkowitz realizes that he was not in as much
control of his project as he thought. ``I got lost in this,'' he
said. ``I didn't know what was real and what wasn't. I kept telling
myself, `I am filming my life right now _ with the hope of
eventually having the life I want _ so that I can film things.' I
was so confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wagner provided the film's most potent reality check.
Berkowitz began by chatting up a beautiful woman in a decorating
shop, hoping for a funny, cinematic rejection; they plan to get
married in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``What ended up happening was so much better than anything I
could've written for a Hollywood movie,'' said Berkowitz. ``Now my
movie has a Hollywood ending. Of course, it's hard to believe.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance, like youth, may be wasted on the young. That
is one of the premises of DanceGalaxy, a new ballet troupe founded
by Judith Fugate and Medhi Bahiri, which makes its formal New York
debut on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers, who range in age from their late 20s to their late
30s, are not old by any normal standards. In classical ballet,
however, dancers start the approach to obsolescence at age 30. For
modern dancers, the age is 40.
</P>
<P>
   More attention is now being paid to finding jobs for dancers
after they leave the stage. But what about the dancers who do not
want to leave? The waste of precious resources can be troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fugate and Bahiri are part of a recent and growing trend, in
modern dance for the most part, of providing showcases for the kind
of burnished artistry that comes only with age.
</P>
<P>
   Also opening on Tuesday, a block east at Dance Theater Workshop,
is a program by two performer-choreographers over 40, James
Cunningham and Jane Comfort, that includes a continuing
improvisatory piece called ``The Horse's Mouth'' that documents the
lives and work of the older dancers who have performed in it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cunningham and Ms. Comfort, Ms. Fugate and Bahiri, who are
married, prefer to think of their work in terms of experience
rather than age. What is important, the founders of DanceGalaxy
say, is that all 14 dancers have absorbed immeasurable knowledge
during careers with companies that include American Ballet Theater,
the New York City Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and the Paris Opera
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   One dancer, Donald Williams, is still performing with the Dance
Theater of Harlem. Ms. Fugate is a former principal dancer with
City Ballet and Bahiri has performed with Maurice Bejart, the
Boston Ballet and Ballet West.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fugate, a former principal dancer with the New York City
Ballet, talked of all that she had learned from George Balanchine
and Jerome Robbins during her days with the company. Their
perspectives color all her dancing, she said, whether in ballets by
William Forsythe or by Michael Smuin, two of four choreographers
whose work will be presented by DanceGalaxy in New York premieres
at the Joyce. (The others are Ginger Thatcher and Dennis Wayne.)
</P>
<P>
   That kind of education may be fast becoming a thing of the past,
however, in the impoverished and hurried world of ballet today.
``There is less and less time in the major companies to stress the
kinds of personal things I learned from Balanchine and Robbins and
also from watching my predecessors,'' Ms. Fugate said. ``The
dancers only learn the ballets and then get them out on the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fugate and Bahiri picked their 14 dancers _ among them
Cornel Crabtree, Deborah Dawn, Christina Fagundes and Marie
Christine Mouis _ for their versatility and vivid personalities as
well as their technical skills. ``What's missing for me, in ballet
today, is (italics)heart,''(end italics) said Bahiri. ``And dancers
who have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancers also have to be quick studies. Time is money,
Bahiri, who is nicknamed ``the slave driver,'' said, grumbling
about dancers who put on their point shoes too slowly. (``Always
the women,'' Ms. Fugate said with a sigh, teasingly.)
</P>
<P>
   With age and experience there can also come an extra doggedness
about getting the work done. Ms. Fugate and Bahiri acknowledged
that raising money for the company, founded two years ago as an
outgrowth of small touring ensembles they put together, was an
unending uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Money is hard to come by, though the two said that the
choreographers and their dancers have been extraordinarily
generous. All the money has come from private sources, though Ms.
Fugate and Bahiri are hoping, they said, that success at their
Joyce season and their increasing tour dates will help them raise
more money from additional sources.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fugate said that the repertory, which includes a ballet by
Peter Martins and Adam Miller's ``Dracula,'' has also been been
chosen for its heart.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pieces you have to put yourself into as a woman or a
man as opposed to a dancer,'' she said. ``Our dancers have lived
lives. You carry so much of that on the stage with you, as opposed
to living in the theater and thinking about ballet 24 hours a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern dancers have historically lived more in the world outside
the studio. They required less stringent training than their ballet
peers, at least until recent years when the two forms began to
merge. But a wider vision of life does not entirely diminish the
pain of having to let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You develop the instrument so that you are an instrument,''
Cunningham said. ``Unfortunately, your body just can't do what you
did in your teens and 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern dancers over 40 have more choices today than ballet
dancers to do something other than simple guest performing. There
are at least three modern-dance groups and one soloist _ Dancers
Over 40, 40 Up, Paradigm and Richard Daniels _ that have become
involved in producing dance by older performers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dancers Over 40 and 40 Up companies feature mature dancers
performing pieces tailored to their gifts by choreographers who are
often also over 40. Paradigm, composed of Gus Solomons Jr., Carmen
de Lavallade and Dudley Williams, will perform in late April and
early May at Aaron Davis Hall and is commissioning work by
choreographers of all ages, among them Geoffrey Holder to Nicholas
Leichter.
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Daniels, who performs his own dances and pieces by
choreographers including Molissa Fenley, Christopher Gillis,
Eleanor King and Zvi Gotheiner, focuses not just on the possibility
of dancing past 40 but also on dancing as a performer with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In classical dance, Ballet: The Daring Project, a company
founded by Valentina Kozlova and Margo Sappington, makes use of
older dancers and will perform in Manhattan in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   What do middle-aged dance artists have to offer their audiences
that was unavailable to their younger performing selves? ``A
subtlety, nuance, texture,'' Cunningham said. ``I think this brings
up the whole question of whether dance is going to deal only with
the ideal young body. I don't think it has to. But it's different
from going to see ideal bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Such dancers also have memories to offer. ``When I first came to
New York, it would have been fascinating for me to hear these
stories people have,'' Ms. Comfort said. ``When you're young,
you're always in such a hurry. This is about process. What you are
as an artist. Not the flavor of the month that you have to have.
Just being a young hungry dancer, it might be fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horse's Mouth'' was created by Cunningham and the
choreographer Tina Croll as a group work for their dancer friends,
most of whom were of their generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked a few people, and it grew,'' Ms. Croll recalled.
``People who have danced for years have so much to say, so many
stories to tell. We wanted everyone's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece now incorporates young dancers and ballet performers
in its mix of improvised movement and anecdotes. To the great joy
of Cunningham and Ms. Croll, the young have freely interacted in
the improvisations with their older colleagues in rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tarnay, one of the older performers, described the sight
as being like ``dying and going to dancers' heaven.''

EVEN A LOWLY VAGABOND CAN BE LOVE'S FOOL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal, The Atlantic Monthly and other publications.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' which preceded it on the boards of La
Scala by nearly three and a half decades, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's
``Sly'' plays fast and loose with Shakespeare, in the process
enriching the material almost past recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Falstaff, who marched straight from Shakespeare's quill
onto the Great Stage of Archetypes, Sly is a character even his
begetter promptly forgot. But Giovacchino Forzano, a man of letters
and the theater active at La Scala in the first half of this
century, saw in him untapped potential.
</P>
<P>
   A play resulted, and eventually an opera, which receives its
belated American premiere on Wednesday at the Washington Opera.
Jose Carreras, absent from the American operatic stage since 1987,
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Sly? In ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' a drunken beggar and
occasional tinker. In most modern productions of the play, he never
appears. But in the full text, you will find him in the very first
line, brawling with the hostess, refusing to pay his bill (shades
of Falstaff with Mistress Quickly in ``Henry IV'').
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he collapses in a stupor. Discovering him thus, a
lord has him transported to the castle, dressed up and, when he
awakens, treated as a nobleman at last restored to sanity after
years of madness. He is reunited with his ``wife'': a pageboy in a
dress. By chance, a troupe of strolling players shows up (shades of
``Hamlet'') and is put to work performing ``The Taming of the
Shrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, except for one quick intervention, the few pages of
Shakespeare's framing play break off. A related comedy of obscure
origin, known to scholars of the Elizabethan theater as ``The
Taming of a Shrew'' (``A Shrew'' for short), supplies a few extra
bits of byplay and the predictable conclusion of Sly's
``awakening'' into sober reality (shades of Nick Bottom the weaver
at the close of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'').
</P>
<P>
   For other authors _ Cervantes in ``Don Quixote,'' for instance,
or Calderon in ``Life Is a Dream'' _ tricks like the one played on
Sly set off investigations into existential mysteries of identity
and character. In ``Shrew'' (``The'' or ``A''), it is a joke and
nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, where poetic justice sometimes reigns, when others have
been laughing at his expense, a fellow named Sly should by rights
get to laugh last. But Forzano saw the deception as the cruel setup
for a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   His Sly is scarcely more than a vagabond, lucky when he can stay
one step ahead of the law. An offstage bailiff _ the evil twin, as
it were, of the Night Watchman in Wagner's ``Meistersinger'' _
haunts him in a voice like an ogre's, threatening arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Shrew'' suggests how traumatic such a wretch would find that
prospect. When characters in the play he is watching are faced with
imminent apprehension, Sly stops everything. The stage events are
``in jest,'' his ``servant'' reassures him. ``I say we'll have no
sending to prison,'' Sly insists, unpacified until the script is
altered and the fugitives escape.
</P>
<P>
   But in the opera, poverty is not Sly's sole defining
characteristic. Forzano blesses him with the soul of a poet: but a
sad one, a second Hoffmann condemned to please the alehouse rowdies
with coarse songs it gives him little joy to sing. Secretly, he
longs for a love he knows the world too well to hope for. For love
and also for justice for all: an impossible dream particularly
poignant from one who has nothing.
</P>
<P>
   His Quixotic _ Messianic? _ vision of mounting to the sky
dispensing justice does not materialize. But a classy Dulcinea
comes his way in the person of Dolly, the bored, discontented
mistress of the Earl of Westmoreland, puller of the plot's strings.
</P>
<P>
   Playing along against her will as Sly's wife, she is won by his
innocence and tenderness. The bleak final act takes place in
prison, where through servants Sly is offered the post of
Westmoreland's house poet or buffoon. The party is definitely over:
apart from a single mood-setting chord, the servants sing their
humiliating lines without accompaniment. In despair over his lost
love, Sly slashes his wrists with a broken bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1900 and 1914, while in his 20s and 30s, Wolf-Ferrari
had produced a handful of comedies after Venetian plays of the 18th
century, with music to match. During the subsequent war years, he
fell virtually silent, too shattered to compose. The New Grove
Dictionary of Opera cites the toll on his ``hypersensitive yet
childlike temperament,'' arguing that a ``disturbed state of mind''
is evident in ``Sly,'' particularly in the hero's prison monologue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such subject matter demanded somber hues. But
elsewhere in the opera, the composer's delight in antique
gallantries is still much in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   By 1927, when ``Sly'' opened at La Scala, long after Strauss'
``Rosenkavalier'' and Stravinsky's ``Pulcinella,'' such pastiche
was no longer fresh. Milan's influential Corriere Della Sera noted
that ``Sly'' ``makes no pretense of modernity.'' But modernity is
not everything, and the reviewer reported a cordial reception,
seconded by his own. Aureliano Pertile, remembered as Toscanini's
favorite tenor, appeared in the title role. Ettore Pa-nizza was the
conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Other productions over the decades have been sparse. Fritz
Busch, pre-Glynde-bourne, led ``Sly'' in Dresden in 1928. The 50s
brought performances in East Germany, under the direction of Kurt
Masur. (Heinz Fricke, who conducts in Washington, appeared in a
minor tenor role.) In 1955, there was a BBC broadcast in English,
with Rudolf Kempe presiding.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To Robert Maxym, an unsung American maestro of surprising
credentials (degrees in history and Russian, research in
psychopharmacology, systems administration at IBM), goes the credit
for the first recording, in German, which documents a staging in
Hanover in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The score came to the attention of Carreras in connection with a
contemplated revival at La Scala, but he came down with leukemia
and the project was dropped. At his request, the Zurich Opera House
staged the work last May.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly available on the Acanta label, the Hanover version
revealed a score as noteworthy for its intricacy of detail as for
its broad, sure emotional sweep. Gorgeous melodies are the better
for being used thematically, gaining depth and meaning as they
recur and vary.
</P>
<P>
   The tavern scenes brim with vigor. Sensory pleasure receives its
due in pages that shimmer, gleam and sparkle. The inner world of
Sly's longings _ inalienable human sentiments to which a cynical
world denies a pauper's right _ glows in more golden, more inspired
hues, lending what in Forzano's text might look like sheer
self-pity a nobler, Virgilian compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Polaski, who has gone on to make an international career
as Brunnhilde, Ortrud and Elektra, lent Dolly the warm, ringing
tones of a gleaming Wagnerian and capped the evening with an
unwritten high C. (Like Sly, this character needs a name more in
line with her nature and her music: Amalia, perhaps, or Leonora.)
</P>
<P>
   Sly's part covers a vast spectrum from abjection to elation, not
excluding humor, pathos and romance. Hans-Dieter Bader filled the
bill handsomely. Klaus-Michael Reeh conveyed the breeding and
brutality of Westmoreland, who knows, like Scarpia, just when to
shed the velvet glove. The chorus, with a major role to play,
played it well; a humming episode, a la ``Madama Butterfly,''
particularly sticks in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   These are lean times for full-length opera recordings, but with
Carreras creating a market, the moment has come for a new ``Sly.''
And from his office in Barcelona, the tenor promised one, on his
calendar for 2000, in Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds better that way,'' said the tenor, whose own first
exposure to the work was through the Hanover recording. (That
``Sly'' has survived principally through German connections would
not have bothered Wolf-Ferrari, whose bloodlines were as much
German as Italian. He lived much of his life north of the Alps; one
of his operas is written in German.
</P>
<P>
   That German houses translated his Italian operas would not have
bothered him, either. It was standard practice, even in Berlin and
Vienna, and the thing was done right. Inevitably, though, German
pulls ``Sly'' in the direction of Strauss and Wagner.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that Carreras, at 52, is leading the way, other Latin tenors
with a streak of morbid romance may well follow. Placido Domingo,
the artistic director of the Washington Opera, revealed last week
that the piece has haunted him for years. He, too, now plans to
sing it on at least two continents, recycling the Washington
production by Marta Domingo, his wife. (A transfer to the Los
Angeles Opera, where Domingo soon takes over as general director,
seems a foregone conclusion.)
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, Carreras, who at this point can speak with the most
experience, characterizes Sly as a lirico-spinto part with strong
declamatory elements, in the manner of Mascagni and Giordano. Which
suggests that Domingo, now 58, might in his prime have worn it like
a glove.
</P>
<P>
   At performances later this month, Washingtonians will see and
hear the American Ian DeNolfo, 31, the winner of the 1996 Lauritz
Melchior Heldentenor Foundation award, with a contract for a
Washington ``Otello'' in his pocket. Sly's days as a forgotten man
may be numbered.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The actor David Marshall Grant knows a thing or two
about plays with big messages. His Broadway debut was in ``Bent''
by Martin Sherman, a visceral look at homosexuality and identity in
Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Tony Kushner's sweeping tale of AIDS and
redemption, ``Angels in America,'' in which Grant played Joe Pitt,
the sexually confused Mormon lawyer, for which he received a Tony
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the writer David Marshall Grant has gone his own subtle,
idiosyncratic way, as can be seen in his first play, ``Snakebit,''
which has just settled in for a commercial run at the Century
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened briefly late last year in Greenwich Village,
Peter Marks, writing in The New York Times, said it was the
``intimate sort of Off Broadway experience that has you picking
apart the recognizable characters long after the curtain calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that you would necessarily want to trade places with the
three main ones, all at various stages of anxiety or depression.
There is Michael (played by Geoffrey Nauffts), a gay social worker
whose lover has just left him for a younger man; Jenifer (Jodie
Markell), an ex-actress whose career has devolved into making ``the
greatest wheatless, dairyless, sugarless brownies in the world,''
except that she is spiking the mix with fructose; and Jonathan
(David Alan Basche), Jenifer's husband and Michael's oldest friend,
a combative actor whose family maxim was, ``Let them hate, so long
as they fear.'' A fourth character who enters late, is played by
Michael Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a comedy,'' said Grant, with a grin. ``So much of
suffering is hilarious when viewed at a distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of ``Snakebit'' has a tone of bittersweet
autobiography, which the author, 43, acknowledges, particularly
when the specter of disease is raised. Grant's mother suffers from
multiple sclerosis, and he has lost friends to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakebit'' also has much to do with his feelings about Los
Angeles, where the play is set and where he lived for 12 years
while pursuing a film and television career. He likened the
experience to working in a feudal society. ``If you're not a movie
star, you're a serf,'' he said. ``If your movie doesn't make enough
money, you go to the rack. Unless you hit the jackpot, it wears on
you. You start being conditioned by what `they' like. I felt
sometimes like my identity was being drained from me and replaced
with a cynical effort to please.''
</P>

   Grant is the third child of two doctors. His older brother and
sister became psychiatrists, while he quickly veered toward
theater. He attended the Yale School of Drama and, in 1979, landed
on Broadway in ``Bent'' at 24. Four years later, he headed for the
West Coast. With blue eyes and a boyish face, he had some success,
landing parts in movies, including ``American Flyers'' (1985),
``Bat 21'' (1988) and ``The Rock'' (1996), and a recurring role as
the artist Russell in the television series ``Thirtysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1990s, he found himself ``falling between the
cracks'' of leading-man roles and those of character actors. He
also wanted to return to New York and the theater. He began writing
``Snakebit'' in 1991 to examine ``the notion of what happens when
something terrible happens to one person and something great
happens to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The first draft took about six months to finish and was staged
in Chicago in 1993 by the actor Campbell Scott. A year later, Grant
and Joe Mantello, who had played his lover in ``Angels in
America,'' took the play to the New York Stage and Film summer
workshop at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where Mantello
staged it.
</P>
<P>
   Plans were made for a production by the Circle Repertory Company
in 1995, but scheduling difficulties and the company's financial
woes conspired against it. Finally, Ilana Levine, who is playing
Lucy in the Broadway musical ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,''
brought the script to the theater company Naked Angels, which
agreed to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   The play opened in November to very favorable reviews at the
Grove Street Theater, with Jace Alexander directing.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, like Grant, has been an actor (in John Sayles' film
``Matewan'' and in Stephen Sondheim's musical ``Assassins,'' for
example). The director said the fact that Grant had acted made him
flexible: ``A writer who is not experienced will hold onto his text
for dear life. David understood that cutting is part of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   So are changes. Grant said there has been a shift in the play's
philosophy. In earlier versions, Michael, the social worker, was
the hero, a victim of heartless love interests and thoughtless
friends. But eventually, Grant said, he began to feel that
Michael's plight was being romanticized: ``Michael's very much
stuck in his identity as a victim. And he has so internalized the
unfairness around him that he has begun to lose his own life.''
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, Grant made a small change in the final
scene, giving Jonathan, the impatient actor, a speech that Grant
said changed the play's message from ```Oh, look, life's so unfair'
to `Oh, look, life's so unfair _ what are we going to do about
it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mantello, who has known Grant for nine years, said: ``David
honestly believes you can make things better. He's earnest almost
to a fault. He's not anybody's poodle, but he'll give people the
benefit of the doubt, even if they don't deserve it.''

BEFORE TITLES, `COSI' BECAME `WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Mozart experts and opera buffs will no doubt dismiss a
recent release of ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' from Sony Classical with a
knowing huff. It is a reissue of a 1952 recording, with Fritz
Stiedry conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Metropolitan
Opera Association, as it was then called (Masterworks Heritage MH2K
60652; two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Stiedry, who was born in Austria, was an eminent opera
conductor. And the cast would seem to be impeccable. Eleanor
Steber, one of the most acclaimed Mozart sopranos ever, and the
respected mezzo-soprano Blanche Thebom are the sisters Fiordiligi
and Dorabella.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrando and Guglielmo, the self-absorbed suitors of those
endearingly inconstant women, are sung by Richard Tucker, in his
tenorial prime, and the beguiling baritone Frank Guarrera. The
soprano Roberta Peters, captured in her early days as a
fresh-voiced soubrette, is the clever maid Despina. The robust bass
Lorenzo Alvary sings the cynical bachelor Don Alfonso.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's opera, written in Italian, is performed in English.
``Cosi Fan Tutte'' becomes ``Women Are Like That.'' And the
recitatives are accompanied not by a historically appropriate
harpsichord or fortepiano, as they would be today, but by a modern
piano.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, to listeners who have become accustomed to the
lighter, lyric voices favored in Mozart recordings in recent
decades, Tucker, with his Radames-size tenor, may sound amusingly
old-fashioned. And although Stiedry conducts a shapely, unmannered
performance, he allows the singers no freedom to add embellishments
to their melodies, even where, as historians now realize, Mozart
clearly intended them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the score is cut: not just occasional bits of
recitative but also entire arias, including two of Ferrando's in
Act II.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the recording is a joy. The pleasure comes partly from
nostalgia. For American opera audiences in 1952, ``Cosi Fan Tutte''
was still on the margin of the repertory. This recording represents
an attempt by a mostly American cast to make the work come alive
for American listeners. Thus the use of English translation.
</P>
<P>
   Singers sing more communicatively when they know that listeners
understand what they are singing about. And listeners listen more
attentively when the text is in their native tongue. All of that is
obvious, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. The coming of titles to the opera house has changed
everything. By and large, American audiences embrace them as a
workable solution to a longstanding problem: how to present a
foreign-language opera as it was conceived yet make it
comprehensible to an English-speaking audience.
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback of titling is a division of attention, as you
try to immerse yourself in a musical-dramatic performance while
reading projected texts. But surely, the current boom in opera's
popularity in America is due in large part to titles, which are
especially helpful in less familiar repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Met's presentation of a talky, discursive opera like
Strauss' ``Capriccio'' last season have been as popular without
titles? It's doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of titling has meant the demise of the honored
tradition of performing opera in translation. Purists, of course,
have always howled in protest at the practice of translating texts
lovingly set to music. It's a travesty, they say; it negates the
nuances the composer devised to support and, in a sense, transport
the original words. And it is true that to accommodate existing
music, a translator has to refashion the words completely, with
results that can be stilted and sometimes silly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the awkwardness has to be measured against the increased
immediacy that results when an audience hears a work in its own
language. And those who argue that translating a libretto violates
a composer's intention have no historical leg to stand on. For
pragmatic theatrical creators like Verdi and Wagner, the idea of
routinely performing operas in languages audiences did not
understand would have been unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   True, Verdi did not have ``Aida'' translated into Egyptian for
its premiere in Cairo. In this unusual instance, he undoubtedly
assumed that Egyptians wanted the exotic experience of hearing a
genuine Italian opera. But when ``Don Carlos,'' a grand opera in
French written for the Paris Opera, was presented in Italy, Verdi
revised it in Italian translation.
</P>
<P>
   And though Wagner fretted constantly about the quality of
translations when his operas were performed in France, he never
questioned the necessity of translating them.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mozart found the Viennese public's taste for Italian
opera a bit odd, he complied with it. (It wasn't all that odd,
actually, since in Mozart's day Vienna was overrun with Italian
musicians and, musically, practically a bilingual city.) But when
he had a chance to write a German work for a German house in
Vienna, he leapt at it, as with ``Die Zauberflote.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would assert that performing opera in English translation
for American audiences is always preferable. But it is a valid and
rewarding alternative, and there should be a place for it. One of
my fondest early musical memories is of sitting in the fourth row
at the New York City Opera for Mozart's ``Marriage of Figaro'' in
English, with an American cast topped by a young soprano named
Catherine Malfitano and an emerging bass named Samuel Ramey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Opera Theater of St. Louis is one of the few
companies in America that perform operas with non-English librettos
exclusively in English translation. The English National Opera
upholds the tradition abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The American soprano Phyllis Curtin, a renowned voice teacher
and a longtime advocate of opera in English, stresses the value of
the practice particularly for students. ``If you are trying to
learn to act in a language neither you nor your audience
understands, you become generalized,'' she said recently. ``And
nothing in art should be general.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curtin had many memorable experiences performing opera in
the language of the audience in some of the world's foremost
houses, including ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' in Vienna. In the 1950s, it
was customary there to do Mozart's Italian operas in German
translation. But mostly due to the influence of the conductor (and
self-appointed Austrian cultural czar) Herbert von Karajan, Ms.
Curtin said, the practice was discontinued, and the Mozart operas
were presented in Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The results were dismaying, she added, even when her partners
included long-celebrated Viennese artists like the tenor Anton
Dermota and the bass-baritone Erich Kunz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their 60s Dermota and Kunz sounded fresher than most
singers in their 30s,'' Ms. Curtin said. ``And they were wonderful
and funny actors. But after we switched to Italian, all of a
sudden, because the Viennese audience didn't understand them in the
same way, these two consummate artists started acting like the Marx
Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Titling systems are credited with lessening the penchant for
exaggerated acting that has long characterized opera when performed
in languages foreign to audiences. Now singers can be subtler. But
here, too, Ms. Curtin believes, there remains a downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The titles can't be read fast enough,'' she said. ``So someone
may glance up or glance down just at the moment of a singer's
lovely, fresh or important gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the main reason for singing opera in English
translation has less to do with the shortcomings of titling systems
than with the heightened quality of communication that can result,
as this reissued recording of ``Cosi'' makes abundantly clear.
</P>
<P>
   From the first scene, with Ferrando and Guglielmo baited about
the constancy of their sweethearts by Don Alfonso, the performance
pulls you in. The translation used is by the veteran team of Ruth
and Thomas Martin. Ferrando's jaunty first utterance _ beginning,
``La mia Dorabella capace non e'' _ becomes: ``To doubt Dorabella
is simply absurd! Completely absurd! She'll always be faithful and
true to her word!'' Not Tom Stoppard, but it's cute, bouncy and
singable.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Guarrera deliver the text with crisp, clear
enunciation. Obviously, it's easier to project the text in a
recording situation. A frequent complaint about opera in English
translation is that the words cannot be understood from the stage,
especially in huge houses, a problem that has been compounded over
the years because opera singers have so few opportunities to
acquire skill for singing in English. And audiences, for their
part, have grown unaccustomed to paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   I have often been exasperated by lazy singers with
incomprehensible English diction. Yet often in such situations, one
member of the cast will make every word completely clear. So it can
be done, and this recording shows how involving the results can be.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alvary, who sings Don Alfonso with a pronounced Italian
accent, does a fine job of making the English text clear.
</P>
<P>
   Steber is marvelous, though devotees of the opera will have to
adjust. In the great aria ``Come scoglio,'' where Fiordiligi
describes her faithfulness as unassailable, like a fortress, the
English words are startling: ``Strongly founded, a marble tower,''
the first line is rendered here.
</P>
<P>
   But the inflated poetic tone of the words actually captures the
comic implausibility of the moment: whom is she kidding, you ask?
And one senses Steber's excitement at the chance to bring what was
then a connoisseur's opera to the larger record-buying public.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's ardent singing will not meet everyone's idea of
Classical style, but it is beautifully phrased and vocally
splendid. Ms. Peters makes a spunky Despina, and her English
diction is a model of clarity. Blanche Thebom brings vocal richness
and musical integrity to the role of Dorabella. The use of a piano
to accompany the recitatives is refreshing, a sort of unstuffy,
American way of making sung operatic dialogue sound up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   The one major drawback is the cutting of the score, especially
regrettable in a recording. This performance essentially documents
an acclaimed 1951 Met production, in English, directed by Alfred
Lunt.
</P>
<P>
   The few cuts were deemed helpful to the dramatic pacing of the
evening. And the impact of a staged performance comes through
vividly here. That immediacy was the point of this important
recording, and remains its great attraction.

 Joseph Hanania's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
``Network Q,'' a gay news program.  
 By JOSEPH HANANIA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the title character on ``Frasier'' wound up his radio show on
a recent episode, his straitlaced ex-wife, Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth),
arrived. ``Someone walked into the room and just frightened me,''
announced Frasier. ``It's my ex-wife, and if you're a regular
listener, you know what I'm talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Lilith revealed why she was seeking solace. Her
second husband, Brian, ``was looking for someone a bit more
feminine,'' she said, her voice breaking, ``and he found him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the premiere of ``Friends,'' Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), still
in her wedding dress, hysterically called her father from her
friend Monica's apartment. After realizing she loved a ``gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat'' more than she did her bridegroom, she had
walked out on her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   When her father threatened to cut her off, she answered, ``Well,
maybe I don't need your money.'' But as he hung up, she added,
``Well, wait, I said maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   The title character's corpulent mother on ``The Nanny,'' played
by Renee Taylor, announced to her daughter at the kitchen table:
``If no one is going to have any more of the cake, I'm going to put
it away. Out of sight, out of mind.'' Feinting toward the
refrigerator, she instead ran toward the kitchen door, absconding
with the cake.
</P>
<P>
   This was followed by quick cuts of Ms. Taylor stuffing down more
than a half-dozen dishes before telling her distraught daughter:
``Oh my God, I'm having palpitations. Get me my medicine.'' The
``medicine''? Hershey's chocolate syrup, straight from a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, these scenes are funny, but would they be any less
humorous if the butt of the jokes were not Jewish women? About 30
Jewish professionals in television and film think so, and a year
ago they organized as the Morning Star Commission under the
auspices of Hadassah to work toward changing the women's image.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish men, who a decade or so ago were primarily characterized
as angst-ridden Woody Allen types or as victims of anti-Semitism
rescued by Christian counterparts, have largely escaped stereotypes
in recent years. Compare Dr. Mark Greene on ``E.R.,'' for instance,
with Fran Drescher's high-maintenance Jewish American princess on
``The Nanny''; Ms. Neuwirth's sexless character on ``Cheers'' and
its spinoff ``Frasier''; Ms. Aniston's daddy-dependent princess on
``Friends'' and the overbearing Jewish mothers on ``Mad About You''
and ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Morning Star-sponsored focus groups composed of
both Jewish and non-Jewish viewers, these portrayals help promote
images of many non-Jewish women as ``athletic and very fun-loving''
while identifying Jewish women ``most obviously by their prominent
noses, their dark Middle Eastern complexions and an inclination to
be overweight.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus groups also characterized Jewish women on screen, in
general, as ``pushy, controlling, selfish, materialistic, shallow,
domineering,'' although the report doesn't reveal what specific
characters the groups had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Rubin, a professor of journalism at California State
University, Northridge, agrees with those findings, adding that
Jewish women are portrayed in a ``particularly disturbing''
stereotypical manner akin to that of blacks on early shows like
``Amos 'n' Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Jewish women characters are actually created for
the tube. The ones who aren't are more noticeable. Thus, ``Mad
About You's'' protagonist, Paul Buchman (Paul Reiser), puts up with
his mother's intrusive shenanigans, but only with the help of a
non-Jewish wife (Helen Hunt).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Michael Steadman (Ken Olin), the advertising
executive on ``Thirtysomething,'' explored his Jewish angst with
the help of his Christian wife, Hope (Mel Harris). And on
``Northern Exposure,'' Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow) was
obsessed with a sexy Christian airplane pilot, Maggie O'Connell
(Janine Turner).
</P>
<P>
   Why the stark differences in the treatment of the sexes? One
reason may be the discomfort many Jews feel about others who appear
``too Jewish,'' like the Hassidim with their long black coats,
sideburns and shawls. A similar kind of thinking may extend to
television executives, who have few objections to Jewish themes as
long as they, too, are not ``too Jewish.'' And what better way to
provide cover for a character's Jewishness than to give him a
non-Jewish mate?
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Liss, a screenwriter, encountered similar attitudes
when she was told to ``tone down the Jewish parts'' of her 1997
Lifetime film ``Hidden in Silence,'' about a Roman Catholic
teen-age girl who rescued Jewish women during the Holocaust. Scenes
of the Jewish Sabbath were cut, as were scenes exploring the
character of the Auschwitz-bound protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told it was the Catholic girl's story,'' said Ms. Liss.
``The Jewish women were relegated to background roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The often harsh depiction of Jewish women is also part of a
larger trend, however, one that encompasses nearly all women on the
small screen. ``We're at the end of the interesting, complex woman
on TV, the Rosanne, the Murphy Brown, the Cybill, the Ellen,'' said
Joan Hyler, a producer and personal manager and a former senior
vice president of the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few years ago, a show could be built around complexity of
character, she said, but now ``the whole trend on TV is to dumb
down women in order to sell product and get higher numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that Jewish women are victims of the ratings
game. ``Let's all relax and be able to laugh at ourselves,'' said
Chuck Lorre, the executive producer of ``Dharma and Greg.''
``Sometimes these identities get too heavy and rigid. Gee, lighten
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many New Age Americans prefer exploring various religions and
philosophies to limiting themselves to a single strong group
affiliation, says Lorre, who is Jewish. Thus, the character of
Dharma Finkelstein _ the Morning Star focus groups' favorite Jewish
woman on television _ was born to ``searchers, who found each other
in San Francisco in the 60s, trying to sculpt out a third identity
for themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Dharma, who has a Jewish father and a Catholic mother,
would not even be considered Jewish under religious law.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Herskovitz, the executive producer of
``Thirtysomething,'' says that Olin's character was given a
Christian wife for dramatic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Television dramas are built around conflicts that play out for
months or years, he points out. A couple of the same religion has
less conflict, he said, and thus less interesting dramatic
potential, than does one from differing religions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drescher, too, has little patience with criticism of Jewish
women characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the first Jewish woman in decades who is playing a Jewish
woman on TV,'' she said. ``My character does not try to assimilate
to a WASP ethic in appearance or speech. I speak Yiddish and
celebrate the Jewish holidays'' on the series.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drescher, whose character's frequently over-the-top costumes
include tight faux-leopard mini-dresses, takes umbrage at
suggestions that her character reinforces a stereotype. ``One law
in comedy is to write what you know, do what you feel is funny,''
she said. ``I can only represent one person, and that person is how
I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Drescher said, ``I understand why people take this
platform; they have a passion about this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no perfect ethnic examples,'' she continued. ``There
are a million different types of Jewish women. She doesn't have to
be educated, but she can be. She doesn't have to speak the King's
English, but some of us do. To even think there's one thing that's
politically acceptable is naive and rooted in a fearful post-World
War II mentality that a good Jew is an assimilated one.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, then, what's important is not to complain about what
isn't there but rather to build on what is. Although the first
talking picture, ``The Jazz Singer'' (1927), was about a cantor and
his son, Hollywood has only sporadically identified characters'
religions and rarely explored religious values. And when television
came along, stars like George Burns and Jack Benny avoided nearly
all on-air mention of their Judaism on their comedy shows.
</P>
<P>
   There are some positive roles on television, and the broader
range of characterizations may help dissipate negative stereotypes.
The characters on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' for instance,
include Willow (Alyson Hannigan), a Jewish 17-year-old who handles
herself just fine, thank you, said Gale Berman, a producer of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   When a trio of girlfriends recently discussed Christmas, Willow
reminded them that not everybody celebrated it. ```Hello, I'm a Jew
here,''' Ms. Berman said, suggesting a line the character might
have been thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the attractive if befuddled rabbi's wife played
by Kathy Griffin on ``Suddenly Susan'' seemed to be a historic
breakthrough in exploring her Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   In a Thanksgiving episode, at her husband's urging, she helped
feed the homeless as a mitzvah, or good deed, while insisting to a
friend that as a reward, ``He'd better get me a good Christmas
present.'' Unfortunately, the rabbi was killed off in an episode
last month. So much for happy Jewish marriages in prime time.

   The American couple killed in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in
Uganda on Monday had been so captivated by the idea of going to see
rare mountain gorillas that they persuaded another couple to
accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Haubner, 48, and Susan Miller, 42, the two Americans who
were among 12 people killed in an attack by Hutu rebels, had been
executives for the Intel Corp. since the mid-1980s. They were based
in Hillsboro, Ore. The trip to Africa was their third, including
their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went last year, enjoyed it very much, but didn't get to
the country where the gorillas were last year. This year they were
hoping to do that,'' said Rita Studd, the mother of Susan Studd,
46, who survived along with Bob McLaurin, 44.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened by gunfire, they fled their tent and hid. On Tuesday
they were in Kampala deciding whether to fly back with the bodies
of their friends, Ms. Studd's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the victims issued a statement saying, ``We are
shocked by this news and we are trying to cope with this
devastating situation as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the driveway of the couple's suburban home
overlooking Portland was jammed. Stunned friends and relatives
gathered inside. Haubner had a grown son from a previous marriage
who lives in Portland.

 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOCTOR CHARGED WITH MURDER IN DRUG DEATHS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  REDDING, Calif. _ Medical providers in the Shasta County area
are reeling in the aftermath of drug-related charges of murder and
fraud brought against Dr. Frank Bensell Fisher.
<P>
   Fisher ran a controversial clinic in the town of Anderson that
specialized in treating chronic pain. He was arrested February 18
along with Redding pharmacy owners Stephen and Madeline Miller.
</P>
<P>
   They are being held at Shasta County Jail, with Fisher's bail
set at $15 million, on three counts of murder and two dozen other
charges stemming from an alleged conspiracy to bilk the Medi-Cal
state health insurance system. They are expected to appear
Wednesday before Superior Court Judge James Ruggiero, when pleas
may be entered.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the conspiracy netted more than $2 million in
bogus Medi-Cal claims for potent painkillers. Fisher, at the core
of the alleged scheme, is said to have recklessly prescribed potent
narcotics at high dosages to people who had no medical need for the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he had a huge caseload of some 3,000 patients,
running as many as 400 people a week through his Westwood Walk-In
Clinic in downtown Anderson. Besides the three alleged murder
victims, officials are looking into at least three other possible
drug-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is not the first pain doctor to land in legal troubles
for prescribing high doses of opiates.
</P>
<P>
   But medical and legal experts say he appears to be the first in
California, and possibly the country, to face multiple counts of
murder in connection with prescribing narcotics, in particular a
slow-release form of opiate painkiller called OxyContin.
</P>
<P>
   During an exclusive interview with The Chronicle last week at
Shasta County Jail, Fisher, 45, denied any wrongdoing, saying he
ran a legitimate medical practice that specialized in treating
intractable pain suffered by an underserved, mostly low-income
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say it was all done for the money. And Fisher
admitted his practice may have cleared some $200,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   However, circumstances of the deaths he is said to have caused
raise questions about some key aspects of the prosecution's case.
Interviews with several of Fisher's patients and other pain
specialists showed that he is not without supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the guts to stand up to the system for people like
us,'' said Teresa Hignite, 28, of Redding, a student and mother of
two whose family received Medi-Cal-subsidized care at Fisher's
now-closed Westwood Walk-In Clinic in Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her husband, whom Fisher had on a regimen of
high-dose opiates to control the pain left by a San Diego freeway
accident 10 years ago, Hignite is among several hundred people now
scrambling to find an alternative source of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Working late one night last week at the Shasta Community Health
Center in Redding, medical director Ann Murphy called it ``a
calamity, a disaster on the scale of a natural disaster, like an
earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people have contacted local medical centers
seeking help. A few have shown up at emergency rooms in acute
withdrawal from high-dose opiate regimens Fisher had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Millers shut down, other local pharmacies have
been reluctant to prescribe narcotics even when the drugs are
ordered by other doctors trying to wean people off the medications.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the alleged murder victims _ Bruce Johannsen Jr.,
19, Rebecca Mae Williams, 34, and Tamara Stevens, 38 _ died with
what investigators considered to be high levels of oxycodone, the
active ingredient in OxyContin, in their system.
</P>
<P>
   However, determining the exact cause of the deaths may be
complicated by the very fact that all three apparently were used to
taking strong doses of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Pain specialist Harvey Rose of Sacramento, who has survived
scrapes of his own with drug-enforcement authorities, noted that
long-term narcotic use builds tolerance to effects that typically
can kill someone taking the medication for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even while he was troubled by Fisher's high-volume
style of operating, it was not necessarily wrong to prescribe high
dosages as long as care was taken to document that the drugs were
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no upper limit that can be considered toxic
for all patients. Doctors are supposed to start with a low dose,
then work up until symptoms are relieved with the least severe side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions arise concerning some of the circumstances of
each death:
</P>
<P>
   -- Williams was found dead in August with severe head trauma
after a vehicle accident. She had been the passenger in a pickup
truck that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic pathologists said that the woman was already dead or
dying when the accident occurred and that the real cause of death
was a ``lethal level'' of oxycodone they found in her blood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pathologists, Dr. Gregory Reiber, readily conceded
during a telephone interview that it was impossible to pinpoint the
exact time of death. He said the drug was ``inferred'' as the cause
based on the blood concentrations, along with indications that the
head injuries, although massive, caused relatively little bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   -- Johannsen, who died last July, is listed as having choked on
vomit ``due to oxycodone intoxication.'' However, there is no
indication that he had been a patient of Fisher's for several weeks
leading up to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, backed by members of his staff, said he had booted
Johannsen out of his practice for suspected drug misuse. Although
specifics could not be confirmed, several people said Johannsen was
getting controlled substances from street sources when he died.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stevens, the third alleged murder victim, was initially
considered to have been a suicide, although her husband, Robert
Stevens, said Tuesday that he did not believe she deliberately
overdosed.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he did not believe Fisher was responsible for his
wife's death in September. Stevens said that she had many serious
health problems and that he felt certain she died of natural
causes, not the drugs she was taking.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the forensic report shows she had prescriptions for
a number of opiates and other medications at her disposal. She is
said to have overdosed on a combination of these drugs, although
none showed up at levels individually high enough to explain death.

 ANCIENT HOROSCOPE FOUND AT UC-SANTA CRUZ  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. _ An astronomer burrowing in the library at
the University of California at Santa Cruz has stumbled upon a
400-year-old horoscope handwritten by Johannes Kepler, the
astronomer who discovered the fundamental laws of planetary motion.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Misch, an astronomer at UCSC's Lick Observatory atop
Mount Hamilton near San Jose, was researching in the university's
library not long ago and found a framed piece of ancient paper,
scrawled like chicken tracks with symbols, diagrams and some words
in German.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Misch is a book collector, and he knows
German, so after puzzling over the mysterious paper, he realized
what he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty thrilling moment,'' he said in a university
report released Tuesday. ``I knew right away this had potential to
be a pretty spectacular discovery. As I looked the document over,
my hand was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   One bit of the writing said in German that it was ``written in
the hand of Kepler, from the collection of Kepler Manuscripts in
Pulkovo.'' Pulkovo is an observatory founded near St. Petersburg,
Russia, nearly 200 years ago, and the inscription was signed ``W.
Struve'' and dated May 13, 1864.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve was then the director of the
Pulkovo Observatory and founded a dynasty of distinguished
astronomers that ended with his great-grandson, the late Otto
Struve, a radio astronomer who discovered matter in interstellar
space and calculated the existence of planets far beyond the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Kepler document records the birth of an Austrian
nobleman named Hans Hannibal Hutter von Hutterhofen, who was born
Sept. 10, 1586, at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kepler's accomplishments have long ranked him as equal to
Copernicus and Galileo, but in the 16th century, astronomers often
had to moonlight to make a living, and Kepler _ a phenomenal
mathematician _ apparently drew up elaborate horoscopes for wealthy
clients, even though he didn't believe in astrology.
</P>
<P>
   Misch traced the records of the Kepler manuscript and found that
it had been bought in Germany for the Lick Observatory in 1896. He
sent it to a Berlin firm specializing in old manuscripts, and it
was authenticated by the company, whose archives hold another copy
of a Kepler horoscope. The nobleman's fate, as limned in the Zodiac
signs as interpreted by Kepler, now lies in the university library
at Santa Cruz.

 HEWLETT-PACKARD TO SPLIT INTO TWO COMPANIES  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hewlett-Packard Co., the Silicon Valley pioneer
whose growth has slowed while other technology giants have
prospered, said it will split off its noncomputer business into a
separate company and replace chief executive Lewis Platt.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, announced Tuesday, are the most wrenching in the Palo
Alto company's long and storied history. They suggest that Hewlett
Packard's hands-off management style and progressive workplace
practices may not cut it in the fast-paced Internet environment
that Silicon Valley has become.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford engineering students William Hewlett and David Packard
started their company in a garage in 1938. Hewlett-Packard's nearly
unremitting success turned the company into the world's
second-largest computer maker and gave an aura to its corporate
culture, known simply as ``The HP Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a bid to boost its profits and stock price, the company
plans to separate its original business _ measurement equipment for
the semiconductor, telecommunications and medical industry _ from
its giant computer and printer operations, which accounted for 85
percent of its $47.1 billion in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-and-printer company will keep the name
Hewlett-Packard. A name has not yet been chosen for the new
measurement business, which will be run by its current general
manager, Edward ``Ned'' Barnholt.
</P>
<P>
   The measurement company, with annual sales of about $7.6
billion, probably will be spun off in a public offering later this
year. Hewlett-Packard is considering selling about 15 percent of
the new company's shares to the public and distributing the rest to
its stockholders. It would be the largest initial public offering
in Silicon Valley history. Hewlett-Packard officials expect no
significant workforce reductions as a result of the split.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcements drew polite applause from Wall Street,
which pushed the firm's stock up $2.75 a share to $68.63.
</P>
<P>
   Investors hope that Hewlett-Packard's move could parallel the
success of AT&AMP;T's spin-off of Lucent Technologies, the
telecommunications equipment maker. Lucent raised $3 billion in a
public offering in 1996 and has been a resounding success, posting
nearly $1 billion in earnings last year on revenues of $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, who has run Hewlett-Packard since 1992, will continue as
chairman, president and chief executive officer until the spin-off
is complete and a successor can be found. He said it was his
decision to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm approaching my 58th birthday, and that makes now the
appropriate time to begin planning for my successor,'' he said.
Hewlett-Packard's customary retirement age is 60.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, along with board members Sam Ginn and Richard Hackborn,
will search inside and outside of Hewlett-Packard for a new CEO.
Leading internal candidates include Ann Livermore, who runs the
company's new online commerce business, and Carolyn Ticknor, who
heads the LaserJet printer division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann Livermore is someone who has been really pretty visible
over the last year and is certainly well thought of,'' said Tony
Scott of the A.T. Kearney executive recruitment firm in Redwood
Shores.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said internal candidates are likely to have an edge,
although Hewlett-Packard could look for an alumnus. One possible
candidate is Richard Belluzzo, who was heir apparent to Platt
before leaving Hewlett-Packard to become CEO of Silicon Graphics
last year.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Hewlett-Packard's board said that Platt has
been a driving force behind the company split and is not being
forced out. ``This is his choice, and that's the real scoop,'' said
the source, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Platt said the move is designed ``to sharpen the strategic focus
of our businesses, improve their agility and increase their
responsiveness to consumers and partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly has not been Hewlett-Packard's forte in recent
years. Because it is decentralized, with each main business unit
semiautonomous, the company has been unable to respond rapidly to
changing market conditions. Most notably, it has failed to cash in
on the Internet the way IBM and Sun Microsystems have.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hewlett-Packard has had difficulty reining in
expenses, despite salary cuts for top managers, a cutback on
corporate travel and shutting down the entire company for two weeks
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard also has suffered from cutthroat price wars in
the market for personal computers and printers, as well as from the
economic downturn in Asia, which torpedoed its measurement
business.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's profits last year declined 6 percent from the
previous year to $2.9 billion. And revenues increased only 10
percent to $47.1 billion in a banner year for many technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's stock also has been flat for the past year.
Its first-quarter earnings beat expectations, but the company
expects only a modest increase in sales for the rest of this fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Steve Dube of Wasserstein Perella in New York said the
split-up was long overdue. Platt, he said, should not have to
oversee $7.6 billion a year in noncomputing business when he has a
$39 billion computer company to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``HP's been a computing company for over a decade, and it should
be run as a computer company,'' Dube said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Bruce Raabe of Collins &AMP; Co. said it's wise to separate
the computing and measurement operations, because they have
different customers and distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, this move will be good for the shareholders,
because it will allow the market to value those businesses
separately,'' said Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Hewlett-Packard may have been reluctant to split off
the measurement business is that it represents the origins of the
company. Hewlett-Packard's first product was an audio oscillator.
The fledgling company sold eight of them to Walt Disney, who used
them in making the film ``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent financial woes, Hewlett-Packard's measurement
businesses are leaders in their respective fields and are expected
to bounce back as the Asian crisis stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated that Hewlett-Packard in effect is
putting its measurement business up for sale. ``I wouldn't be
surprised in some of the medical and test and measurement
businesses if people came out of the woodwork'' to make offers,
said Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan.

   A TREATMENT BASED ON CHINESE ACUPUNCTURE is the key to unlocking
chronic pain in the lower back, according to a new study. The
results of the study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, could sway even those doctors who
have reserved skepticism about the effectiveness of non-Western
treatments. Unlike preceding studies, this one contrasts the
effects of the treatment with placebo, giving the results a
scientific edge previously lacking. (BACK-PAIN-MED -- 700 words)

   A LARGE STUDY HAS FOUND that annual screening for colorectal
cancer could cut deaths from the disease by one-third. Colorectal
cancer is the second leading cause of death among cancers
nationwide, killing more than 56,000 people every year. The
American Cancer Society recommends annual colorectal-cancer
screening for people older than 50, but fewer than half of people
in this age group undergo the test. (COLORECTAL-CANCER-MED) -- 500

<P>
   Seven years ago Dr. Yared Kebede Haile worked as a well-paid
physician for an American oil company in his native Ethiopia. He
remembers his American patients with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come in with a cold or a mild laceration and demand
antibiotics,'' he said, chuckling over the national idiosyncrasy of
self-treating even the most minor disorder with an array of
over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile found his work uninspiring. So he did what most
American doctors would never do: He traded his air-conditioned
office for a volunteer physician assignment that took him to
makeshift clinics and hospitals in war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told how difficult it would be for an African expatriate
who was Christian to work in Afghanistan, a Muslim country,'' said
Kebede Haile, now 32 and studying for his Master of Public Health
(MPH) degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead I found the Afghanis were very polite, very friendly
and respectful,'' he said, speaking Tuesday at the Montefiore
Medical Center in New York to promote the work of Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF), the Paris-based volunteer organization that
recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   After his three-month assignment in Afghanistan, Kebede Haile
worked for MSF in Uganda and later volunteered in Bangladesh,
Liberia and Ethiopia. His experiences of living in different
countries have been 100-percent positive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt I was not accepted and respected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of MSF's assignments last for a minimum of six months, but
this is a career path that does not come with job security. Last
year, volunteers were expelled from Kabul in Afghanistan, where MSF
had been providing medical services for eight years. And earlier
this month volunteers were evacuated from southern Sudan after
reports that pro-Sudanese government militia were raiding villages
and killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Many MSF assignments involve a precarious balancing act of
placating governments that resist volunteers' presence, maintaining
political neutrality and speaking out when atrocities are witnessed
without jeopardizing continuation of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile insists it is not difficult to remain politically
impartial. Nevertheless, the organization has frequently wrestled
with the dichotomy of maintaining neutrality while condemning
injustices. When the group was founded in 1971, its charter forbade
members to talk about what they had witnessed during missions. But
the group has subsequently spoken out about human rights violations
in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Ethiopia, and has even carried out
secret missions in countries where its presence was not welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 MSF established a United States headquarters in New York
with the name Doctors Without Borders. A second office was opened
in Los Angeles, and a drive for donations and volunteers was
initiated. Last year the organization recruited 110 volunteers from
the United States to work in countries as diverse as Sri Lanka,
Guatemala, Bosnia, Vietnam, China and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four-and-a-half years Kebede Haile has been with MSF
he has been surprised by the fact that American volunteers are
overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I have never seen an African-American involved
in [overseas] volunteer work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kebede Haile this is a statistic that undermines overseas
humanitarian efforts. Doctors Without Borders needs multiracial
teamwork to have credibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of minority groups, it could be argued
that Doctors Without Borders is vulnerable to misperceptions that
it is just another attempt to alleviate the ``white man's burden.''
</P>
<P>
   With the spotlight on trouble spots like Rwanda, Zaire and
southern Sudan, Kebede Haile is hoping that more black Americans
will consider volunteering in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with MSF has changed my whole way of thinking. I
have learned so much from other people and other cultures. I
believe everyone can benefit from this experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile also wants black Americans to discover the
``other'' side of Africa, a continent ``with a rich culture and
civilization.'' For the most part, Americans' only exposure to
Africa is images of war, famine and devastation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders is seeking specialists in internal
medicine, emergency medicine and infectious diseases, general
surgeons and practitioners, anesthesiologists and nurses. A
background in public health is especially desirable. Social
workers, psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are also required
for some assignments. Volunteers with non-medical backgrounds are
also invaluable to operations, especially civil engineers, people
with experience in finance, administration and accounting and those
with expertise in water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month minimum is waived for general surgeons and
anesthesiologists, who are allowed to work for six-week periods.
All volunteers receive paid expenses including accommodation and
modest allowances.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on Doctors Without Borders, the New York
office can be reached at (212) 679-6800. The organization has a Web
site at: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org.

   Kebede Haile insists it is not difficult to remain politically
impartial. Nevertheless, the organization has frequently wrestled
with the dichotomy of maintaining neutrality while condemning
injustices. When the group was founded in 1971, its charter forbade
members to talk about what they had witnessed during missions. But
the group has subsequently spoken out about human rights violations
in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Ethiopia, and has even carried out
secret missions in countries where its presence was not welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 MSF established a United States headquarters in New York
with the name Doctors Without Borders. A second office was opened
in Los Angeles, and a drive for donations and volunteers was
initiated. Last year the organization recruited 110 volunteers from
the United States to work in countries as diverse as Sri Lanka,
Guatemala, Bosnia, Vietnam, China and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four-and-a-half years Kebede Haile has been with MSF
he has been surprised by the fact that American volunteers are
overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I have never seen an African-American involved
in [overseas] volunteer work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kebede Haile this is a statistic that undermines overseas
humanitarian efforts. Doctors Without Borders needs multiracial
teamwork to have credibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of minority groups, it could be argued
that Doctors Without Borders is vulnerable to misperceptions that
it is just another attempt to alleviate the ``white man's burden.''
</P>
<P>
   With the spotlight on trouble spots like Rwanda, Zaire and
southern Sudan, Kebede Haile is hoping that more black Americans
will consider volunteering in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with MSF has changed my whole way of thinking. I
have learned so much from other people and other cultures. I
believe everyone can benefit from this experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile also wants black Americans to discover the
``other'' side of Africa, a continent ``with a rich culture and
civilization.'' For the most part, Americans' only exposure to
Africa is images of war, famine and devastation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders is seeking specialists in internal
medicine, emergency medicine and infectious diseases, general
surgeons and practitioners, anesthesiologists and nurses. A
background in public health is especially desirable. Social
workers, psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are also required
for some assignments. Volunteers with non-medical backgrounds are
also invaluable to operations, especially civil engineers, people
with experience in finance, administration and accounting and those
with expertise in water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month minimum is waived for general surgeons and
anesthesiologists, who are allowed to work for six-week periods.
All volunteers receive paid expenses including accommodation and
modest allowances.
</P>
<P>

office can be reached at (212) 679-6800. The organization has a Web
site at: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org.

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ She was born Barbie Millicent Roberts, springing into
the world fully grown, like Venus rising from the sea. Shapely,
wrinkle-free, with pouty lips and pert breasts, and hair that
flipped just so, Barbie began her reign in controversy: Some moms
thought her just a bit too developed. She was a doll, for goodness
sake.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, long after the little girls who made her the
world's best-selling fashion doll grew up to raise daughters of
their own, Barbie still is pert and perky with nary a sag or laugh
line. No control-top hose, no Lasting Color, no reading glasses for
this perennial spring chicken. She's still fresh and fine, changing
hairstyles, designer duds and careers like an ingenue with the
world at her pointy little feet.
</P>
<P>
   She's still controversial, too.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you believe, the foot-high vinyl bombshell is
an inspirational symbol of girl power or the black hole of feminine
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   She's a toy or she's a totem to materialism.
</P>
<P>
   She represents the best of America _ bright, beautiful, an
amazing success story (1 billion sold!). And the worst _
superficial, perennially immature, unable to commit to career or
long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A LITTLE HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's official birthday is March 9, 1959. The date marks her
introduction to the world at the New York City American Toy Fair.
Barbie No. 1 wore a black-and-white-striped bathing suit, had
arched come-hither eyebrows and holes in her feet (the better to
stand her up, my dear). She came blond or brunette.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Handler, Barbie's mom and co-founder of Mattel, the company
that Barbie built, was convinced that dolls with adult features
would spark girls' imaginations. That they'd want to dress them in
myriad outfits, create little fantasies around them. Ruth was
right. And the rest, as they say, is herstory.
</P>
<P>
   Ken, by the way, came along in 1961. Barbie needed someone to
escort her to the prom, someone who could look good in a tux. Can't
have a beautiful bride without a groom, even if he was a dud.
</P>
<P>
   Kandy Ferriby, owner of the Doll Company in Spring, Texas,
sounds dismissive when she says Ken was and is ``just an accessory
to Barbie. He's just another possession for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferriby says vintage Barbies go for hundreds of dollars, even
thousands. Ken? How's 30 bucks sound?
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Mattel has produced battalions of Barbies and
Barbie spinoffs besides Ken _ little sisters, friends and pets, to
say nothing of townhomes, dream homes, country homes _ and none
hold a candle to Barbie as icon or industry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MONEY, HONEY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Barbie brought $1.9 billion home to Mattel. Not bad for
a one-time fashion model who can't hold a job. She makes millions
more for retailers like Target and FAO Schwarz and for dealers who
sell her likeness online and off.
</P>
<P>
   Log onto eBay, the online auction house, search the keyword
``Barbie,'' and watch a listing of 7,000-plus items unfold before
you. A virtual Barbie mall. Christian Dior Barbie! Portrait in
Taffeta Barbie!! Mint! Barbie as Scarlett set (with Ken as Rhett)!
</P>
<P>
   Off-line, there are doll shows, Barbie-only auctions, clubs and
boutiques. Ferriby estimates her all-doll consignment shop is
one-quarter Barbies. She also sells on eBay from time to time and
via a doll Web page (www.dolls4u(at)flash.net). She didn't even
want to get into Barbie collecting at first. ``There's too much to
know.'' But Barbie and the business proved irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Life was simpler when Barbie was just a doll.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CAN BARBIE COME OUT TO PLAY? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' says Bobbie Willis, whose 2,700 Barbies put her in the
top circles of Houston collectors, ``everybody that buys a doll
thinks they are going into the business. Everybody wants to be a
dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Or an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rifts in Barbie Collector Land: In this corner, those
who would collect the pristine Barbie and her official ensembles,
dressing and housing her as the god Mattel intended.
</P>
<P>
   In that corner, those who see Barbie as a fantasy cipher, a
mannequin to be costumed, coiffed, manipulated in fanciful
dioramas.
</P>
<P>
   There's another rift, too, a small one.
</P>
<P>
   Since Collector Mania seized the Barbie world in the '70s, many
Barbies have never even seen the light of day. Purchased for the
sole purpose of escalating in value, they have been kept in their
boxes and stored away by tens of thousands of collectors. Now, says
Ferriby, some Barbie fans are saying she should be enjoyed,
touched, felt and played with.
</P>
<P>
   They're calling it the Unbox the Barbie movement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A BAD GIRL? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those who would like to see Barbie boxed
and buried. Or at least punished.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites especially give free rein to the anti-Barbies (at
least, until told to cease and desist by Mattel's vigilant legal
department). Distorted Barbie created alternative dolls (Kate Moss
Barbie, Fat and Ugly Barbie, Satanic Barbie).
</P>
<P>
   There's a Lesbian Barbie page (for 18 and over).
</P>
<P>
   Barbie jokes. Heard about the new Divorcee Barbie? She comes
with all of Ken's accessories.
</P>
<P>
   She's been the subject of college courses, protests, vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a group calling itself the Barbie Liberation Army
switched voice boxes on hundreds of talking Barbies and GI Joes.
``Eat lead, cobra!'' she roared.
</P>
<P>
   Though this probably wouldn't be what she'd have in mind (which,
by the way, if she had one, would be about the size of a squirrel's
brain), Barbie would be the first to admit a little criticism can
be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, it led, after all, to her finding employment
as more than a model, nurse or teacher. Later it would alter her
world view, and her skin tone, as the Ultimate Anglo morphed into a
doll line more reflective of the planet's human hues.
</P>
<P>
   Change, thinking out of the box, can be good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BARBIE LOOKS AHEAD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Middle age is no big deal these days. Gloria Steinem was talking
about her own milestone, not Barbie's, when she said ``THIS is what
40 looks like,'' but what the heck.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem wasn't present at the birthday bash thrown by Mattel
recently, but other celebrities were. Rosie O'Donnell was there,
kicking off a partnership between Mattel and Girls Incorporated, a
national girls' advocacy program. Or maybe she was there to cop
that very special limited edition 40th-anniversary Barbie made just
for the occasion and given only to guests at the gala.
</P>
<P>
   This should be quite a year for Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, Barbie's supposed to ring the bell (we wonder, with
her head?) at the New York Stock Exchange. Wall Street will be
renamed Barbie Street for the day.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the mail-order gardening giant Jackson &AMP; Perkins will
offer the `Barbie' rose, a pink miniature.
</P>
<P>
   Also this spring, the U.S. Postal Service plans to unveil a
Barbie stamp. Just like Elvis, another American icon, except
there's only one version of Barbie's stamp _ ever-young, svelte.
</P>
<P>
   Parties, roses, stamps. Pretty heady stuff, but Barbie's been
'round the block a time or two (in a bright pink Corvette, no
less). She'll take the congratulations in stride, maybe just like
Steinem did.
</P>
<P>
   This is what 40 looks like, America, she might say. Take it or
leave it.

DAYTIME TV VIEWERS EMBRACE THE MAGIC OF `DONNY &AMP; MARIE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The star of ``L.A. Doctors'' hunched over his patient,
determined to prove worthy of his medical license as he performed a
delicate operation.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Ken Olin worked his way in slowly, slowly, slowly, then _
careful ... careful _ he removed a man's arm bone. A medical
marvel, conducted with tweezers and without blood or pain.
</P>
<P>
   If you weren't watching ``Donny &AMP; Marie,'' you missed it. And if
you aren't watching ``Donny &AMP; Marie,'' you're missing one of the
best hours of entertainment available on daytime TV today.
</P>
<P>
   Some may consider that statement an indictment of daytime
television. Maybe it is. Having Olin play with the box game
Operation doesn't sound like the ingredient of a Top 30 show in
prime time.
</P>
<P>
   But in daytime, ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' is No. 2 among the national
crop of new talk shows (No. 1 is ``Roseanne'').
</P>
<P>
   This is what you're missing.
</P>
<P>
   One day it could be Olin sweating over some tweezers, the next
it could be an hour at the piano with Stevie Wonder. One day it
could be a behind-the-scenes visit on the set of ``Jeopardy,'' the
next it could be singer Mariah Carey talking about when she was
poor, or Donny rapping ``Puppy Love'' with Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a good reputation around town, which is 90
percent of this game you play, which is to make sure people have a
good time,'' says Marie Osmond. ``Our growth has been phenomenal.
It's because people are having a good time and guests are treated
well, and it's different. It's the kind of show where you can have
a Stevie Wonder and you can do the whole show around the piano. I
don't know other shows where you can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the ultimate guest to have on,'' says Donny Osmond of
Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Donny even wept as Wonder sang ``Overjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of my favorite songs of all times, and my idol was
sitting two feet from me, singing it,'' Donny says. ``It was a
great moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder may be the ultimate guest, ``but there's so many people
we'd like to have on and talk to,'' says Donny. ``The nicest thing
about the history of Marie and myself, we can relate to practically
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a little bit country, he a little bit rock 'n' roll back
in January 1976, when their sticky-sweet variety show stood
television on its ear, surviving 2 1/2 seasons (or two seasons
longer than cynics predicted).
</P>
<P>
   Before that, they were recording phenoms, as soloists and as
members of the singing Osmond Family. When ABC-TV canceled the
variety show, they each carved out solo singing careers. Marie also
dived into doll-making, series television (1995's ``Maybe This
Time,'' with Betty White) and a tour of ``The Sound of Music.''
Meanwhile, Donny raced cars and starred in 1,800 touring
performances of ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Today they've been working for 36 years. She's 39. He's 41.
She's pregnant with her seventh child; Marie and her husband,
record producer Brian Blosil, have three boys and three girls at
home. Donny and his wife Debbie have five sons, ages 1 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   The talk show was a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to understand is that Donny and Marie have been
asked to get together for 20 years, and this really was, to us, the
best way to do it,'' says Marie.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a way to provide some stability in the family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I'm living in New York or on the road touring, it is
very nice to sit down some place,'' says Marie. ``My kids are going
to the same school. I go to work every day. I have my weekends off.
When I work Broadway, I work six days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   She lives in Los Angeles, where their show is shot, but Donny
commutes weekends to his Salt Lake City home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' he says. ``I've got my videophone (Donny's a
computer buff) and I call my family and see them every day. And I'm
home on the weekends. ... From what I've been doing the last six
years, it is an improvement (over eight shows a week in far-flung
theaters).''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his boys are taller than 5-foot-9 Donny, and the
second-oldest, Jeremy, has put together a punk/ska band called
Sudden Urge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to see him play once,'' Donny says with a laugh, ``and
the bill included Strange Itch, Bend Over and Sudden Urge. I
thought, `What is my son getting into here?'''
</P>
<P>
   When the shoot takes a break in June, Donny will go to England
to do a film version of ``Joseph.'' He also has an autobiography,
``Life Is Just What You Make It,'' due out in May.
</P>
<P>
   Marie: ``I thought it was called `My First 2,000 Years.'''
</P>
<P>
   Donny: ``It's not a typical autobiography. It's more of a
feeling of what it was like to grow up in this business and have
the roller-coaster rider that I've had. It's not a book about
complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie: ``You know, I think everybody should write a book because
it's a lot cheaper than a shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   Donny: ``Well, it's been a cathartic experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Their playful jabs in this three-person conference call play out
just like you'd imagine it would, like you'd expect a brother and
sister to act. It's hugely appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting chemistry we have,'' admits Marie.
``First, I don't know anybody who's been in the business 36 years
and still going. And also the fact it's a male-female relationship,
and we have definite differences of opinion. And also that we're
siblings. I think 99 percent of talk is chemistry, and I think we
have a unique chemistry as siblings.''
</P>
<P>
   Not generally discussed _ though they will, if asked _ is the
role God plays in their lives. They are devout Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more a way of life and it's something you can't
inflict on other people, because it's such a personal thing,'' says
Donny. ``It does dictate the way we live, but we're certainly very
normal people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Donny said, we don't talk about it,'' adds Marie. ``We
don't sit there and promote it or whatever. But it is what made me
what I am. I believe you should be balanced like four legs on a
chair and I think your religious beliefs is one of those legs. And
if you don't stay balanced, you end up falling over.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like all legs are in place.

GIVE A GOOD TRIM TO PONYTAIL PLANT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ I have a 20-year-old ponytail plant. During the warm
months I keep the potted plant outside. But during the winter I
bring it indoors. The plant is now about 12 feet tall and is
touching the ceiling of my ``highest'' room. Should I cut the plant
off?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, you can prune the top off. Take the plant outdoors and
prune vigorously toward the large onionlike base so you won't have
to repeat the process too soon. Take more rather than less. The
result may be as many as three or four new sprouts, giving you a
more handsome plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beaucarnea recurvata,'' or ponytail plant, likes sun or
partial sun and a well-draining soil. The more it's pampered, the
faster it grows. Mature plants are much more cold-hardy than potted
young ones.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lythrum hybrids often are recommended for perennial gardens
in this area. I recently read both species and hybrids are
potentially invasive. Do you think it's safe to grow lythrum
(loose- strife) in our gardens?
</P>
<P>
   Are there any other annuals or perennials that should not be
grown here because of their invasive potential?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Lythrum salicaria,'' or purple loose- strife, is the
species that is so invasive, choking wetlands and nudging out other
vegetation. It becomes unmanageable with abundant moisture, and
some states outlaw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``L. virgatum,'' sometimes sold at special plant sales in this
area and found occasionally at some nurseries, has narrow foliage
and showy spikes of pink and purple flowers that appear summer into
early fall. ``Modern's Pink'' and ``Modern's Gleam'' have not been
threatening in any local garden that I know.
</P>
<P>
   I have been told the hybrids are sterile, but I have also read
that these could possibly interbreed with the bad cousin that grows
wild and therefore sets seed. So I would be cautious about growing
a hybrid if I lived near an area infested with ``L. salicaria.''
</P>
<P>
   What may be invasive in my garden may not be in another, but
plants that I've attempted to remove include an alstroemeria that
even thrives in the lawn. This plant hides anything below 2 or 3
feet in height. Commonly called parrot lily or Peruvian lily, ``A.
psittacina''(formerly ``A. pulchella'') has red flowers with green
tips. It is pretty, but I recommend you avoid this easy spreader or
you just may be digging tubers every weekend. Other species are
better behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Wedelia is a wonderful ground cover for large areas, but this
trailing perennial can quickly escape into off-limit areas. It's
pretty, too, with dark green glossy foliage and bright yellow,
daisylike blooms that appear nearly year-round. This is a good
seaside plant.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue ruellia is invasive, but I don't rate this
perennial as a pest. Both the tall and short ``Katie'' ruellias are
so carefree they belong on the ultimate low-maintenance plant list.
The tall types produce purple or pink blooms for months on end. The
``Katie'' begins to flower, in my garden, later in the year, but
then really puts on a show. Both spread, but they don't choke out
other plants, and I don't find removing unwanted ruellias that much
of a problem. Others may say I'm crazy.
</P>
<P>
   I put ``Physotegia virginiana,'' or obedient plant, in the above
category as well. This native perennial produces late summer
lavender blooms on plants up to 3 to 4 feet tall. A grouping of the
snapdragonlike blooms can be attractive. But the plants spread, and
in a few years you may have more than you want. However, I find
them easy to pull.
</P>
<P>
   I really have no serious qualms with annuals. Chocolate plant
(``Pseuderanthemum alatum'') is a big-time re-seeder, but because
this makes a nice ground cover in summer shade, I don't mind its
presence. The foliage is brown with silver splotches on top and
gray underneath. Tiny but deep purple blooms appear on slender,
tall stems in late summer and early fall. The plants are among the
first to succumb to frost. When there is no really cold weather,
the plants may return from the roots.
</P>
<P>

Mail garden questions to Kathy Huber, garden editor, Houston
Chronicle, P.O. Box 4260, Houston, Texas 77210. The bulk of mail
prevents individual replies to all unpublished letters.

tools only and refer bookings to agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance has taken the opposite approach.
</P>
<P>
   Brochures urge cruisers to ``book direct and save.'' ``Savvy
travelers'' are directed to the company's Web site for the lowest
prices. ``Available only by calling Renaissance Cruises direct'' is
a marketing mantra.
</P>
<P>
   You may have pulled their advertising from your mailbox
recently. Have an American Express card? You've been offered a
Mediterranean cruise with the ``exclusive'' chance to save $3,600
per cabin. Order from the Speigel catalog? You've been given the
opportunity to book a Tahitian cruise and get a $400 gift
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance is unapologetic about its marketing policy, which
looks to bypass the travel-agent community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the level of support we get from travel
agents,'' says Renaissance executive vice president Frank Del Rio.
``But we want to create demand at the consumer level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the travel-agent community came of age 40 years ago,
there were four airlines, three hotel chains and two rental car
companies. There were one or two cruise lines. Tour packages didn't
exist. Travel agents had a limited product line to represent and,
therefore, they did a very good job of representing those products.
Today, there are 50 airlines, dozens of motel chains, 30 cruise
lines. ... A travel agent can't be an expert on every product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide the customer with better information than the
typical travel agent because we are the experts on our product,''
Del Rio says. ``Our personal travel consultants are experts in only
one thing: Renaissance cruises. Their expertise empowers the
customer so that they can make the best possible decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal travel consultants are a hit with many passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Houstonian and veteran cruiser Loyce Hicks enjoys
planning her vacations with her counselor at Renaissance. Hicks and
her dentist husband, Paul, were aboard one of the first sailings of
the R2 in December. It was her fourth Renaissance Cruise, and the
couple already is booked on an October trip to Tahiti aboard the
new R3 ship.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hicks' first time to cruise on the line's new R-Class
fleet. The company began in 1989 with an eight-ship fleet. The
ships were intimate all-suite vessels that accommodated 114 guests.
Only two of these ships _ the Renaissance VII and Renaissance VIII
_ are still sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks gave the R2 a thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an absolutely beautiful ship. I really enjoyed
the 114-passenger ships. It seems like things moved more smoothly
(on the smaller ships). But we've been on ships with more than
2,000 passengers. This was a good size.''
</P>
<P>
   The R2 carries 684 passengers. It is the second of a planned
six-ship fleet in which all the vessels are identical. R1 and R2
began sailing in 1998 and both offer Mediterranean holidays. The R3
and R4 will debut in 1999, plying the waters of the South Pacific.
The R5 and R6 are expected to begin sailing in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a ship this size built with these
amenities,'' Del Rio says. ``The closest is maybe the Royal Viking
Sun, which was built in early '80s. And I understand her design was
mid-'70s. The trouble today is she doesn't have any balconies.''
</P>
<P>
   Balconies are becoming a must-have amenity for cruise ships. And
they were just one of the customer requests taken into account when
the R-Class fleet was designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out what customers want in a cruise line, instead of
what cruise lines want to build,'' Del Rio explains. ``Nobody ever
said they wanted to cruise on a ship with 2,000 strangers. People
don't want megaliners, but they go because it's the only thing to
go on.''
</P>
<P>
   And what are cruisers' priorities?
</P>
<P>
   Balconies, restaurant options, open seating and a smoke-free
environment, according to Renaissance research.
</P>
<P>
   Got it, got it, got it, got it, Del Rio notes.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to keep prices extremely low,'' Del Rio says.
``On our Internet site (www.renaissance cruises.com), we've created
the Dare to Compare page. It lists product attributes compared to
the newest ships of Royal Caribbean, Holland America and Princess
Cruises _ three cruise lines we compete with. If you look, we are
$2,000 to $7,000 less per cabin for a comparable itinerary. That's
an incredible value. We think we have a pretty good formula.''
</P>
<P>
   With its value-consciousness and casually elegant fleet,
Renaissance may possess a good formula, but what they don't have is
name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niche products are small by comparison to the big guy,'' says
Del Rio, referring to cruise line's exotic destination-oriented
itineraries that include the Greek islands, the South Pacific,
Scandinavia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our product is a little more complex. And the public may not
be as familiar with our destinations,'' Del Rio says.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance's alliances with companies such as American Express,
AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) and America On Line
may speed that process.
</P>
<P>
   These alliances ``put our product in front of savvy consumers,''
Del Rio says. ``It puts us face to face so we can directly speak
our message. These third-party endorsements are welcome and a
testament to our product.
</P>
<P>
   But another third-party endorsement, that of the travel-agent
community, may continue to elude Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the 10-year-old cruise line capped its commissions
paid to travel agents at $500 per cabin or $250 per person. That
meant war to many agents, who battled back by steering clients to
other cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, the cruise line shifted its policy again by
offering a 10 percent commission on its cruises. Some agents have
declared the policy change a victory, but it is too soon to tell
whether agents will forgive and forget and begin hawking
Renaissance cruises again.
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian Joe Galloway, president of the American Society of
Travel Agents and owner of Trans-Continental Travel, is one agent
who won't be sending customers to Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   His objections to the cruise line have nothing to do with its
direct marketing campaign, he says, but with some problems that
arose when his customers were displaced from Renaissance cruises
just weeks before sailing. The incidents happened several years
ago, but once bitten ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problems with the product,'' Galloway says, ``but
our business is one of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as the direct marketing is concerned?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are good marketers,'' Galloway says, ``but they aren't
necessarily the best buy.''

   Renaissance is the cruise forerunner in direct booking and
advertises that its best deals are reserved for those who bypass
travel agents and book direct via phone or online. Call
800-525-5350 or access the company's Internet site at
www.renaissancecruises.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site recently began touting a $200 per cabin discount
for booking online.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent also can book a Renaissance cruise. And online
travel sellers such as Expedia.com and America Online work with
Renaissance and frequently advertise special discounts and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance packages ``cruise tours'' that include air fare from
New York, cruise, pre-cruise and post-cruise hotel stays, as well
as ground transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The R2 package, offered year-round, encompasses 14 days and
includes hotel stays in Barcelona and Lisbon. Ports of call during
the 10-day cruise are Cadiz, Malaga, Almeria, Palma de Mallorca and
Mahon in Spain, Tangier and Casablanca in Morocco, and Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance's Web site is listing prices for May cruise tours as
starting at $3,799 per person (double occupancy) for a C category
stateroom with balcony. The 14-day trip with an inside stateroom in
May goes for $2,799 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Always inquire about any available discounts.
</P>
<P>
   A sister ship, R1, focuses on the Greek Islands, sailing between
Athens and Istanbul with stops in Israel, Cyprus, Crete and Rhodes.
Its 14-day cruise tours are priced similarly to the R2.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the R3 will debut and begin a year-round itinerary in
the South Pacific. Among stops on these 10-day cruises: Tahiti,
Moorea, Rangiroa, Huahine and Bora Bora. Renaissance is advertising
an early R3 booking rate of $2,999 per person (double occupancy)
for a cabin with balcony and air fare from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance expects that its R4 will begin sailing in the South
Pacific in December, in time for a millennium celebration.

CARRY-ON MEALS FLY WITH PASSENGERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Ordering food ``to go'' has never carried such
long-distance implications.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be when we requested ``takeout,'' the fish tacos were
intended for home or office. Now, chances are we're taking them to
St. Louis or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At 35,000 feet above normal seafood level.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, hungry airline passengers are striking back. If flight
attendants aren't permitted to serve us a meal, then we'll serve
ourselves, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Have you taken to the skies recently? Even before the Boeing 737
lifts off the runway, one traveler is munching on a bologna
sandwich, another on a fruit salad, still others on chicken,
cheeseburgers, pasta and egg rolls. All purchased prior to
boarding.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, corn on the cob?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAST AND FANCY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airport concessionaires can barely stock enough brown bags and
plastic utensils. Area hotels tempt guests with meals prepared for
consumption aloft. I figure fast-food chains, not wanting to risk
missing our business at terminal locations, will be opening outlets
in remote parking lots any day now. Anyone for a McSky Burger?
</P>
<P>
   Even the Petroleum Club of Houston has joined the crusade,
creating ClubAir, a menu of ``Club-quality'' cold meals specially
packaged for members in a briefcase-like container. And, no, I'm
assured that this is not some sort of, er, crude joke. Options
include a chicken breast stuffed with shrimp and crab meat and
served over couscous; smoked salmon with thinly sliced bagels; a
smoked tenderloin salad; and, for kids, a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich. Most meals are priced, a club announcement says, ``equal
or slightly more than the current price per barrel of oil,
something most members hope will reverse itself soon and
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder we're packing sack lunches. As a cost-cutting
measure, airlines have all but abandoned hot meal service on most
domestic flights. And for those just now adjusting to the packaged
snacks some carriers offer as we board the aircraft, take note that
Delta is removing the cold sandwiches from its SkyDeli bags on 140
flights, and replacing them with crackers and cheese or carrots and
dip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NO OBLIGATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can understand the airlines' position. For one thing, their
prime responsibility is to transport us safely and efficiently _
not feed us. Just because they used to provide us a free
three-course meal doesn't mean they are mandated to continue.
</P>
<P>
   For another, we've sent a clear signal that we don't mind
carrying food aboard. We continue to pack airplanes in record
numbers. Some of the highest passenger satisfaction ratings are
accorded to Southwest Airlines, which, Department of Transportation
figures show, spends 20 cents per passenger on food compared to an
overall average of $3.17 (down from almost $5 eight years ago) by
major U.S. airlines on domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
   You can wager a prime cut of Kansas beef that if we began
choosing one carrier over another primarily because of its dinner
fare _ not price fare _ we'd suddenly see frantic competition to
provide us the tastiest cuisine. Need evidence? Just look at
international flights, for which airlines are hiring innovative
chefs to enhance menus, not cut them back.
</P>
<P>
   What amazes me is that airlines don't seem to care what edibles
we take aboard their property. Airport management pays little or no
heed to foodstuffs we cart through terminals. I keep expecting the
security attendant at a screening station to say, ``Sorry, sir,
your computer and camera bag are fine, but that five-piece bucket
of chicken isn't allowed.'' But nobody blinks.
</P>
<P>
   I got to thinking the other day, as I tossed another lottery
card into the trash bin, that if someone really wanted to get rich
quick and studied this carry-on meal situation and came up with a
theme and a promotion ...
</P>
<P>
   And that's when it struck me: Next time concessionaire contracts
are up for consideration at Houston airports, I'm going to propose
the construction of food stands directly adjacent to gate check-in
counters.
</P>
<P>
   But not just any food stands. Destination stations, that's what
I'll call them. They'll require little room; I'll set up a kitchen
elsewhere. And I'll market (at a reasonable price) specialty items
that not only satisfy your taste buds, but also put you in the mood
for arrival hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Headed to Philadelphia? I'll sell you a cheese steak. San
Francisco? A loaf of sourdough bread or a bay shrimp cocktail. New
Orleans? Po-boys and beignets. Baltimore? Crab cakes. Chicago? A
slice of deep-dish pizza. Boston? Baked beans.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, scratch that last item. Those airline seats are jammed in
tight, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once the airlines learn of my idea, they'll adopt it
themselves and reap the profits. Isn't that the next logical step,
anyway? If hamburger chains and hotels and even the 53-year-old
Petroleum Club can make money selling us airline food, shouldn't
that grab the attention of airline bean counters? How much would we
be willing to dole out for an old-fashioned airline steak or
chicken dinner? (Ugh, remember those?) With an ice-cream sundae for
dessert? Enough that the airline could turn a profit?
</P>
<P>
   Don't scoff: While airlines are phasing out their food business,
they remain very much in the bar business. Even Southwest. Why?
Because it, unlike the free-food business, is a money-maker.
Remember when those miniature bottles cost $1.50? Now, we pay an
airline $4 if we're lucky.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to a serious closing thought. Incidents of air rage
by unruly passengers have increased 400 percent over the past five
years, according to industry reports cited by Business Traveler
magazine. Many analysts attribute the increase to the ready
availability of alcohol combined with the sparsity of food.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're determined to imbibe, don't do so on an empty
stomach. Stuff that brown bag with goodies. Join the Petroleum
Club. Ask for extra carrots and dip.
</P>
<P>
   At least until my destination stations are open.

PAMPERING PASSENGERS WITH R-CLASS SHIPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ The R2. Deck 8. Cabin No. 8058. Category B.
Ocean view with balcony.
</P>
<P>
   That's a cold description of the warm stateroom that was our
home for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The R2 made its debut recently as the second _ hence the 2 _ of
four new ships to be launched by Renaissance Cruises during a
14-month period. The R2's regular route covers the Mediterranean
and coastal Spain; its specialty is a 14-day Lisbon-to-Barcelona
tour that includes round-trip air fare from New York, a 10-day
cruise and hotel stays in Lisbon and Barcelona for prices starting
at about $3,000 per person (double occupancy).
</P>
<P>
   The R2 holiday is destination-intensive, offering nine ports of
call in 10 days. Shore excursions provide the opportunity to visit
a Gothic cathedral and taste ``tapas'' in Seville, Spain; to rock
the kasbah in Tangier, Morocco; to meet the famous rock apes of
Gibraltar; and to explore the legendary Alhambra, a 13th-century
Moorish castle in Grenada, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   While the ports and shore excursions provide enriching
experiences, the ship itself is delightful.
</P>
<P>
   When complete, the R-fleet will comprise four nearly identical,
684-passenger ships _ much smaller than the 2,000- to
3,000-passenger megaliners being churned out by Carnival and Royal
Caribbean, but larger than veteran Renaissance customers have come
to expect. Renaissance cruises have traditionally been on small
all-suite ships with a passenger count of about 100.
</P>
<P>
   The traditionally styled R-Class ships feature oversized
staterooms, 93 percent of which have ocean views. More than 60
percent include private balconies. And the entire fleet is
smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
   The cabins have all the features one would expect as well as
some nice details, such as superior storage space, 24-hour room
service and remote-controlled televisions with CNN, ESPN and
first-run movies.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers choose among four restaurants, and an open-seating
policy accommodates those who don't like to be told when and where
to dine. In keeping with the line's informal style, dining-room
names are succinct.
</P>
<P>
   The Panorama Buffet _ whose name refers to airy wrap-around digs
on Deck 9 _ is the spot for casual dining morning, noon and night.
The buffet, a favorite of the ship's officers, often surprised with
its gourmet offerings. We were delighted to find escargot-stuffed
tarts and delicate soups beside the ubiquitous carving station and
dessert bar.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance dubs the Club Restaurant its most sophisticated. I
found the room oversized and stuffy. Its Continental menu and
Muzac-inspired live entertainment are aimed at the over-50 crowd
that gravitates to the restaurant nightly. Formal breakfasts and
lunch also are served at the Club.
</P>
<P>
   Two small specialty dining rooms _ the Grill Room and the
Italian Restaurant _ are more appealing. The long skinny dining
rooms wrap around the aft of Deck 10 and share a kitchen, which
separates the restaurants with Wizard of Oz-like magic.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants are intimate, and the service is polished. A
thick tuna steak and Caesar salad at the Grill Room was the
culinary highlight of the week, followed closely by a
shrimp-and-pasta concoction at the Italian Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no additional charge for dining in the Grill Room
or Italian Restaurant, reservations are a must. Reservations also
are advised for the Club, particularly if you desire a romantic
table for two.
</P>
<P>
   But a wait for a table is never a problem on the R2. All
restaurants are accoutered with comfortable lounges. Particularly
nice is the Club's bar, whose faux antiques and genteel furnishings
remind one of an old English inn.
</P>
<P>
   Some cruise-goers may be disappointed by the lack of a midnight
buffet. Renaissance joins Disney and several other cruise lines in
opting out of these sporadically attended eat-fests. That would not
be a problem except that restaurants shut down at a distressingly
early 9 p.m., leaving night owls with stomach growls two options:
order off a limited room-service menu or hang out at the Casino or
the Sports Bar until late-night hors d'oeuvres are offered by
tray-toting crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Cruisers have several entertainment and leisure options:
</P>
<P>
   _ Library: R2's may be one of the best at sea. Besides having
hundreds of books, this room offers an inviting space in which to
linger. The focal point is a lovely faux fireplace and a gaily
painted ceiling that gives you the allusion of sitting in an
atrium. Its narrow, wrap-around design also provides several
private nooks for reading or daydreaming.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sports Bar: This huge space is dotted with large-screen
televisions that were tuned most days and nights to snooker
tournaments and downhill skiing. Its forward position on Deck 10
also makes it a wonderful observation lounge. Most days it was
quiet and free of sports fans. At night, a band entertained on a
small stage, and a tiny casino area with 10-cent slot machines was
well-used.
</P>
<P>
   _ Casino: Small but pleasant (when was the last time you visited
a smoke-free gambling room?), the ship's casino is a friendly
gathering spot in the evening. Its long bar has an elegant saloon
feel, and the British casino staff is unfailingly cheerful. The
casino offers roulette, blackjack, two poker tables and about a
dozen slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cabaret Lounge: Evening entertainment ranged from the plucky
Paramount Performers, who never met a show tune they couldn't
croon, to a fine classical pianist and an extremely bad comic,
whose idea of a joke was to poke fun at hearing aids, the
absent-minded and his audience. His mean-spirited jokes didn't play
well with the sophisticated and mature audience.
</P>
<P>
   On a brighter note, a flamenco show before the ship left port in
Cadiz, Spain, featured local performers who played to a packed,
appreciative house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spa: The British company Steiner provides programs and
services in the ship's spa, which includes a full-service salon and
fitness center. While prices are not exorbitant, guests might get
the hard sell on lotions and potions. The spa also offers slimming
and skin treatments and a private deck for sunning. The fitness
center is state of the art with a terrific ocean view.
</P>
<P>
   On R2 _ and other Renaissance vessels _ there are no formal
nights, no sequins, no regimentation. No poolside contests, no
bingo announcements.
</P>
<P>
   There are also no children.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the cruise line formalized its no-children
policy: All cruisers must be at least 13.

CRYSTAL EARNS ACCOLADES WITH FOCUS ON ENRICHMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, life on the high seas: breakfast in bed; tanning beside a
pool, mai tai in one hand and a paperback in the other; rolling the
dice on a game of chance; dancing and partying into the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   As on most ships, you could do all that aboard the Crystal
Symphony and Crystal Harmony. And in style.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could:
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen intently as novelists Judith Krantz or Mary Higgins
Clark, broadcast journalists Walter Cronkite or Linda Ellerbee, or
actors Eva Marie Saint or Michael York discuss their craft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Savor a cooking demonstration by Andr Soltner, Jacques Pepin,
Wolfgang Puck or Jeremiah Tower.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ponder personalized golf tips from two-time U.S. Open champion
Billy Casper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attend lectures on anthropology, geography, history, art or
politics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Partake in a wine tasting presided over by a master sommelier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take classes to learn about the Internet and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large majority of our guests aren't on board to
vegetate,'' says Crystal Cruises president Joseph Watters. ``They
want to be educated. They want their lives to be enriched.''
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy has previously been almost the exclusive domain
of cruise lines that specialize in yachtlike vessels (with
Silversea, Seabourn, Radisson Seven Seas and Cunard's Sea Goddess
fleet at the forefront) or whose emphasis is on long-distance
voyages (Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2).
</P>
<P>
   It would never work, critics scoffed, on ships that carry 940
passengers and operate itineraries that average less than two weeks
in length.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Carnival and Princess continue to achieve success
with their ``Fun Ship'' and ``Love Boat'' approaches, Crystal's two
vessels have carved out a singular niche while earning
unprecedented passenger satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   For four consecutive years, readers of Conde Nast Travelers
magazine have accorded Crystal honors as ``best large ship line.''
Similar accolades have come the past three years from Travel &AMP;
Leisure magazine, whose most recent reader poll gave the line the
highest ratings of any vacation opportunity worldwide. Almost every
major guidebook bestows its top ratings on the Symphony and
Harmony.
</P>
<P>
   A recent sailing through the Panama Canal aboard the 4-year-old
Symphony demonstrated why Crystal merits such acclaim: By stressing
cultural enrichment, diverse itineraries and alternative dining
options, the Los Angeles-based line is at the cutting edge of what
many see as cruising's future. And yet its understated luxury,
attention to detail and personalized service hark back to an era
before megaships created, in effect, bustling cities at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Symphony and Harmony (launched in 1990) are just
mainstream enough _ interspersing traditional Caribbean and Alaskan
itineraries with others dubbed ``Silk and Spice'' between Bombay
and Singapore and ``Black Sea Rendezvous'' from Athens to Rome _ to
appeal to first-time and established cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, their midrange size (50,000 tons) entices those put
off by seagoing behemoths but who appreciate amenities unavailable
on smaller vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing, too, covers a broad spectrum. Some passengers are
well-heeled enough to pay up to $10,000 per week for a penthouse
with private verandah and butler service. And yet advance-purchase
brochure rates for 11-day Panama Canal sailings start at under
$3,000 per person _ considerably less than most other
luxury-oriented lines charge _ and a good travel agent can usually
secure a discount.
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to Watters' suggested passenger preferences,
these ships are ideally suited to individuals who want to vegetate.
Indeed, splurge for a stateroom on the Penthouse Deck, and it's
tempting never to venture outside. Need your suit jacket pressed?
Shoes shined? Dinner served course-by-course on the verandah? Just
ask your personal butler. One passenger inquired if the bed could
be rolled onto the balcony; another wanted her teddy bear's clothes
changed daily. Requests granted.
</P>
<P>
   Even standard staterooms are huge by industry standards and
feature picture windows (except for 19 inside cabins on the
Harmony), twin beds that convert to queens or kings, showers and
tubs, television with VCRs and 24-hour room service.
</P>
<P>
   As for activities, Crystal Symphony hotel director Herbert
Yaeger says, ``The challenge is always to come up with something
special that nobody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Several enrichment lectures are conducted on each itinerary,
with one series devoted to the geographic region the cruise covers.
New this year is a partnership with the New Yorker magazine through
which staff artists, writers and editors are making presentations
during segments of the Symphony's current world cruise.
</P>
<P>
   A Computer University at Sea is among the most popular
attractions. Depending on the cruise length, beginner and advanced
courses are offered.
</P>
<P>
   Shore excursions range beyond the usual shopping sprees and city
tours. On the Symphony's world tour, 16 modes of
land-transportation options include elephants, rickshaws, dune
buggies and dugout canoes.
</P>
<P>
   The line's Wine and Food Festival, offered on select sailings
throughout the year, attracts premier chefs and wine experts from
all over the world. Typically, a chef offers two cooking
demonstrations, interacting with passengers, then prepares a
specialty dinner. Two wine tastings are conducted. Each ship's wine
list includes a minimum of 200 offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Participating chefs this year include Soltner, retired
proprietor of New York's Lutece; Michael Mina, executive chef at
San Francisco's Aqua; Alan Wong of his namesake Honolulu
restaurant; Horst Pfieffer, chef-owner of New Orleans' Bella Luna;
and television personalities Pepin and Norman Van Aiken.
</P>
<P>
   Everyday cuisine is superb, with lunch and dinner specialties on
the Symphony's Panama Canal sailing including roasted French duck
with caramelized orange sauce; potato-crusted halibut with tomato
and olive sauce; paella Valencia; medallions of Scandinavian
venison; California cioppino; Moorish pork kebabs; and smoked
salmon quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive are two alternative restaurants: Prego, an
Italian eatery; and Jade Garden, which features Asian delicacies.
(Japanese-themed Kyoto replaces Jade Garden on the Harmony.) These
are open nightly to all passengers by reservation and at no extra
charge. (A $5 per person gratuity is recommended.)
</P>
<P>
   An evening repast at Prego featured an appetizer tower of
grilled, marinated vegetables with slices of lobster, sauted prawns
and scallops in truffle vinaigrette; Caesar salad prepared
tableside; mushroom soup served in an oregano bread cup; a roasted
rack of herb-crusted baby lamb; and a lemon mousse with meringue.
</P>
<P>
   Themed buffets are as colorful as they are bountiful, and unlike
most lines Crystal shows the good judgment to present them at
midday _ when passengers are hungry _ rather than in late evening.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment on each cruise includes four full-scale musical
revues and several variety shows. Well-known singers, dancers and
comedians are often featured. Afternoon recitals showcase classical
music.
</P>
<P>
   A new shoreside golf program on nine specified itineraries
offers guaranteed tee times at 21 of the world's most challenging
golf courses. A teaching pro is aboard every cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Each ship offers two swimming pools, a spa and salon, two main
showrooms, movie theater, Caesars Palace at Sea casino, card room,
book and video library and several lounges.
</P>
<P>
   The Crystal Harmony will operate Panama Canal sailings from
March through May, then sail round-trip between San Francisco and
Alaska during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Symphony will spend the summer and early fall in Europe,
then move to Asia and the South Pacific.
</P>

 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>

   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who can I contact to find out if I have any GI Bill
educational benefits left?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Department of Veterans Affairs has a new toll-free
telephone number for veterans and dependents to obtain information
on VA education benefits: 1-888-442-4551. The number operates 24
hours a day, seven days a week, and provides detailed eligibility
criteria and general background on VA programs, said VA spokesman
Tom Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans, reservists and National Guard members receiving
education benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill also may obtain
detailed information on their personal benefits account through the
new automated system. Callers can get specific questions answered
by education case managers during regular business hours.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet users, information also is available at
http://www.va.gov/education . Or call 1-800-827-1000, which will
connect you to your nearest VA regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, I read that a white person has never been
sentenced or put to death in this country for the killing of a
black person. In view of the sentencing to death of John William
King in Texas for the killing of James Byrd Jr., can you confirm if
this is true?
</P>
<P>
   A: White people certainly have been executed for killing black
people in this country, but statistics have been disproportionate.
Since capital punishment resumed in the United States in 1977,
according to records compiled by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, 11
whites have been executed in the United States for killing blacks,
while 142 blacks have been executed for killing whites. Only one
white man has ever been executed in Texas for killing a black man,
and that was in 1854. The case involved a feud between two farmers,
which climaxed when one killed the other's favorite slave.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Dollar bills have the letters A through L in a circle to the
left of the image of George Washington, with the names of cities
below. Why does it end with L, and why are only certain cities
named?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are only 12 letters (A through L) because they
correspond to the nation's 12 Federal Reserve Banks, said Edward
Sheehan of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The banks also
have a number. They are: Boston (1, A), New York (2, B),
Philadelphia (3, C), Cleveland (4, D), Richmond (5, E), Atlanta (6,
F), Chicago (7, G), St. Louis (8, H), Minneapolis (9, I), Kansas
City (10, J), Dallas (11, K) and San Francisco (12, L).
</P>
<P>
   The bank that authorizes a note can be determined by looking at
the black Federal Reserve seal on the bill. The name is printed
within the seal's border. The district's letter is in the center
and also begins the two serial numbers in the upper right and lower
left. The district's number appears at four places: on each side,
placed above and below the center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do members of the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,
such as Alan Greenspan, have limited terms in office, like members
of Congress? Or are they appointed for life?
</P>
<P>
   A: They aren't appointed for life. All board members are
nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. A full term
is 14 years; a member who serves a full term may not be
reappointed. The chairman (currently Greenspan) and the vice
chairman (Alice M. Rivlin) are named by the president from among
the members and are confirmed by the Senate. They serve a term of
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan took office as chairman June 20, 1996, for a third
four-year term. He originally took office as chairman _ and to fill
an unexpired term as a member of the board _ on Aug. 11, 1987. He
was reappointed to the board to a full 14-year term, which began
Feb. 1, 1992. He has been designated chairman by Presidents Reagan,
Bush and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the Mediterranean diet? A
recent newspaper article indicated that it's supposed to help
prevent heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mediterranean diet calls for more bread, more vegetables,
more fish, less red meat (replacing meat with chicken), some fruit
daily, and the use of canola oil and olive oil as the sources of
fat. It also replaces butter and cream with a special margarine
made with canola oil. A study done in France compared such a diet,
common in Mediterranean countries, with that of Northern Europeans,
which uses more animal fat, and found a dramatic reduction in new
manifestations of heart disease in people recovering from a
previous heart attack. Evidence presented at the American Heart
Association's annual meeting in 1996 also showed that the
Mediterranean diet may lower blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the voice of Shirley Jones that we hear singing in
``The Music Man,'' or was someone else's voice dubbed in?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dubbing in another singer's voice for Shirley Jones, who had
the role of Marian Paroo, would be like dubbing Frank Sinatra's
singing in ``Guys and Dolls'' or Barbra Streisand's in ``Hello,
Dolly!'' Unthinkable, in other words. Jones had demonstrated her
movie star quality, both acting and singing, several years earlier
in the film versions of ``Oklahoma!'' and ``Carousel.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing voices in big-screen musicals isn't entirely unknown,
however. Every film fan knows that Marni Nixon provided the singing
voice of Eliza Doolittle in the movie version of ``My Fair Lady,''
a role portrayed by Audrey Hepburn. But some other dubbed movie
voices may surprise you: Nan Wynn, not Rita Hayworth, sang the
sultry lyrics to ``Put the Blame on Mame'' in ``Gilda''; India
Adams sang Cyd Charisse's numbers in ``The Band Wagon''; Nixon
dubbed all of Natalie Wood's songs in ``West Side Story.'' Louanne
Hogan dubbed so many screen songs for Jeanne Crain that she was
known as ``Jeanne Crain's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you update me on the status of the Chinese gymnast who
was paralyzed in an accident at the Goodwill Games? Where can
donations be sent?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sang Lan, 17, who broke her neck in a fall July 21 at the
Goodwill Games in New York, has been deemed fit to return to China
and is expected to make the trip in June. ``I'm very happy to go
back, but I will miss New York,'' she told a New York reporter
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sang, who came to the Goodwill Games as the 1997 Chinese
national vault champion, remains paralyzed and unable to move from
the neck down. Although she must use a wheelchair, Sang has
stabilized sufficiently for doctors to approve the trip. The New
York Daily News reported that the teen has been under pressure from
the Chinese Gymnastic Association to return home, where she's a
national hero. Winston Sie, with whom Sang and her mother have been
staying, said the teen would undergo acupuncture, massage and
herbal remedies when she is back in China.
</P>
<P>
   Donations can be made to the Sang Lan Fund and mailed c/o Dr.
Kristjan Ragnarsson, Mount Sinai Medical Center, One Gustave L.
Levy Place, New York, NY 10029.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you print the address for President Clinton's legal
defense fund, for those who want to send a contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: Checks can be sent to: Clinton Legal Expense Trust, Dept.
6007, Washington, DC 20042-6007. The maximum amount that can be
donated by an individual is $10,000 a year. Information:
202-347-0119.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some years back, quarterback Johnny Unitas completed an
amazing string of passes to lead the Baltimore Colts to victory
over the New York Giants in a championship game. Can you refresh my
memory about the details?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in 1958. With two minutes to play for the NFL
championship, the Giants were ahead 17-14. The Colts were on their
own 14-yard line. Unitas completed seven consecutive passes to set
up a game-tying field goal with seven seconds left, then engineered
a 79-yard drive in sudden-death overtime that won the game, 23-17.
</P>
<P>
   You used the word ``amazing.'' It really was, considering that
Unitas was wearing a 9-pound protective corset of foam rubber and
steel because of three broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I read that the heiress to the Levitz
furniture fortune was missing and her home was messed up. Was she
ever found?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The widow of furniture mogul Ralph Levitz was last seen
Nov. 18, 1995, and was reported missing two days later.
Investigators said they found a blood-soaked mattress and signs of
a struggle at her home overlooking the Mississippi River in
Vicksburg, Miss. She was 62 at the time of her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Covington, FBI case agent in Jackson, Miss., who is
handling the Levitz case, told Q&AMP;A that it's still an open
investigation. ``We are pursuing any and all leads that come to our
attention with the same aggression that we used when she was first
reported missing in 1995,'' he said.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Media mogul Ted Turner recently had to issue an apology to
the Polish people and government because of an ethnic Polish joke
he made about the pope. Turner also apologized recently for
remarking that adultery shouldn't be included among the Ten
Commandments. Does he claim any particular religious affiliation?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Or at least none that anyone is aware of, said Caroline
Harkleroad, spokeswoman for Turner Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that a rap performer was arrested
for wearing a bulletproof vest. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 30-year-old performer, who goes by ODB (real name:
Russell Jones), was taken into custody Feb. 16 by the Los Angeles
Police Department for what a LAPD spokesperson termed ``a minor
traffic violation.'' According to E! Online, the arrest report said
Jones, who wasn't able to produce a driver's license, was ordered
to get out of his car. After noticing he was wearing body armor,
officers ran a warrant check and discovered a prior felony
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem: It's a no-no for anyone convicted of a
violent felony to wear a bulletproof vest. The body armor charge
itself is a felony. This was the rapper's fifth arrest since July,
according to E! Online. OBD/Jones was released on $18,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports say Montana is implementing a daytime speed
limit, which it didn't have until now. How does Montana's accident
rate compare with that of other states?
</P>
<P>
   A: Such a comparison isn't possible, said Tim Hurd of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, because Montana is
a ``very rural state'' with many highways that are lightly
traveled. To make a comparison with anyplace else, even another
rural state, would be ``apples and oranges,'' he added, and
therefore not valid. Montana's new 55- to 75-mph limits are
expected to take effect May 28, ending its status as the only state
in the nation without a daytime speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Rutgers University ever a member of the Ivy League?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Rutgers InfoDEX spokeswoman said the New Jersey institution
has never been part of the Ivy League. Its members are Brown,
Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Princeton and
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has happened in the case of a man who said he won a
fighter jet in a contest?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still in the courts. The case involved John Leonard, who
in August 1996 tried to force PepsiCo Inc. to come up with a
Harrier jet that it appeared to be offering as a contest prize. In
a TV commercial, PepsiCo had depicted a computerized simulation of
a Harrier as a prize available to anyone accumulating 7 million
points in its Pepsi Stuff contest. To earn that many points, a
person would have to drink 16.8 million cans of Pepsi. But Leonard
said when he called the company, he was told he had the option of
buying ``Pepsi Points'' for 10 cents each. He then raised money
from several investors and presented Pepsi with 15 original points,
plus a check for $700,008.50.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi maintained that the commercial was a spoof, and when the
jet wasn't forthcoming, Leonard's Miami lawyers filed a lawsuit.
PepsiCo, too, filed suit, seeking to have Leonard's claims declared
frivolous, and seeking reimbursement for the company's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon has said the $33.8 million fighter jets
would have to be ``demilitarized'' before being offered to the
public, which meant rendering them unable to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and under what circumstances was the Pledge of
Allegiance introduced, and when was it changed to include the words
``under God?''
</P>
<P>
   A: The pledge to the flag was first published Sept. 8, 1892, in
the juvenile periodical The Youth's Companion, in this form: ``I
pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands;
one nation, indivisible, with liberty and Justice for all.'' Public
school children first recited the pledge as they saluted the flag
during the National School Celebration that same year, marking the
400th anniversary of the discovery of America.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``the flag of the United States of America'' were
substituted for ``my Flag'' in 1924, and the pledge was recognized
officially by the U.S. government in 1942. In 1954, at the urging
of President Dwight Eisenhower, the Congress legislated that
``under God'' be added. The move to do so was spearheaded by the
Knights of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Ted Turner's full quote on adultery being eliminated
from the Ten Commandments? Where did he make his remark?
</P>
<P>
   A: In remarks first reported by The Washington Times, then
repeated by other news organizations, Turner said the Ten
Commandments are ``a little out of date.'' He then went on to say,
``If you're only going to have 10 rules, I don't know if
(prohibiting) adultery should be one of them.'' The comments came
in remarks Turner made Feb. 16 to a meeting of the National Family
Planning and Reproductive Health Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad said there
was no audio or video recording of the speech, and Turner had no
script, so it's not possible to provide any more information about
the exact wording. After the remarks were reported, Turner's office
released this statement: ``Mr. Turner regrets any offense his
comments may have caused and extends his heartfelt apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some years ago, the popular rock duo Milli Vanilli created a
scandal when it was revealed that they didn't actually perform
their own songs, lip-synching instead to someone else's voices. Was
it ever revealed who their real singers were?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan identified the real vocalists
on their 1989 Grammy-winning album ``Girl You Know It's True'' as
Johnny Davis, Charles Shaw and Brad Howell. Pilatus and Morvan
later were stripped of the Grammy. In 1998, Pilatus was found dead
in a hotel room in Frankfurt, Germany. A combination of alcohol and
pills was suspected as the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed lately that Tiger Woods isn't using his usual
caddy, whose name, I believe, is Fluff. Do you know any details?
Also, what is Fluff's background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Woods used Bryon Bell, a friend of his since junior high
school, a few times recently, but Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan is still
Woods' caddy, according to IMG, Woods' management company.
</P>
<P>
   Working for some 40 players since his first job at the Greater
Hartford (Conn.) Open in 1976, Cowan is one of the sport's most
entertaining and enduring figures. An accomplished golfer himself,
Cowan was the No. 1 player on the 1969 golf team at William Penn
College in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He turned pro in 1971and took up
caddying for PGA players in 1976. He caddied for Peter Jacobsen for
19 years, one of the longest relationships between a caddie and a
professional golfer on record. In August 1996, Cowan signed on to
dispense golf clubs and counsel to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Cowan got then nickname from his resemblance to
former pro Steve ``Fluff'' Melnyk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard a lot about the Jerry Falwell-Teletubbies flap,
but I haven't seen any actual statement Falwell himself made on the
subject. What exactly did he say?
</P>
<P>
   A: The controversy deals with an article in the February issue
of National Liberty Journal, of which Falwell is publisher. The
article contained a ``Parents' Alert'' about children's television
programming, with one item headlined ``Tinky Winky Comes Out of the
Closet.'' It reported that the sexual orientation of the
Teletubbies character ``has been the subject of debate since the
series premiered in England in 1997,'' and pointed out that Tinky
Winky ``has become a favorite character among gay groups
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet site _ http://www.falwell.com _ the Falwell
organization says this: ``Dr. Falwell has never seen the
Teletubbies TV program. Dr. Falwell has never commented in any way
on the Teletubbies. He did not `out' Tinky Winky.'' The Internet
statement says J.M. Smith, senior editor of the National Liberty
Journal, wrote the Parents' Alert. It adds, ``Editor Smith . . .
did not attack the Teletubbies or call for a boycott of the
Teletubbies. He simply documented information that had already been
reported in Time, People, The Washington Post, CNN, E-Online and
other national media over the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell spokeswoman Laura Swickard confirmed to Q&AMP;A that Falwell
did not write the article in question. But she added that Falwell
was the author of a press statement on his Internet site. In it, he
writes: ``. . . while I'd like to laugh along with those who are
encouraging parents and critics to `lighten up' about children's
programming in general, and Teletubbies in particular, I find this
issue far too important to the future and well-being of our
children. . . . As a Christian, I believe that role-modeling the
gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children. I find
the flat denials of such a portrayal by Teletubbies producers to be
disingenuous and insufficient in answering the questions that have
been raised about the Tinky Winky character . . .''

   Q: Media mogul Ted Turner recently had to issue an apology to
the Polish people and government because of an ethnic Polish joke
he made about the pope. Turner also apologized recently for
remarking that adultery shouldn't be included among the Ten
Commandments. Does he claim any particular religious affiliation?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Or at least none that anyone is aware of, said Caroline
Harkleroad, spokeswoman for Turner Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that a rap performer was arrested
for wearing a bulletproof vest. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 30-year-old performer, who goes by ODB (real name:
Russell Jones), was taken into custody Feb. 16 by the Los Angeles
Police Department for what a LAPD spokesperson termed ``a minor
traffic violation.'' According to E! Online, the arrest report said
Jones, who wasn't able to produce a driver's license, was ordered
to get out of his car. After noticing he was wearing body armor,
officers ran a warrant check and discovered a prior felony
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem: It's a no-no for anyone convicted of a
violent felony to wear a bulletproof vest. The body armor charge
itself is a felony. This was the rapper's fifth arrest since July,
according to E! Online. OBD/Jones was released on $18,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports say Montana is implementing a daytime speed
limit, which it didn't have until now. How does Montana's accident
rate compare with that of other states?
</P>
<P>
   A: Such a comparison isn't possible, said Tim Hurd of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, because Montana is
a ``very rural state'' with many highways that are lightly
traveled. To make a comparison with anyplace else, even another
rural state, would be ``apples and oranges,'' he added, and
therefore not valid. Montana's new 55- to 75-mph limits are
expected to take effect May 28, ending its status as the only state
in the nation without a daytime speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Rutgers University ever a member of the Ivy League?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Rutgers InfoDEX spokeswoman said the New Jersey institution
has never been part of the Ivy League. Its members are Brown,
Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Princeton and
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has happened in the case of a man who said he won a
fighter jet in a contest?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still in the courts. The case involved John Leonard, who
in August 1996 tried to force PepsiCo Inc. to come up with a
Harrier jet that it appeared to be offering as a contest prize. In
a TV commercial, PepsiCo had depicted a computerized simulation of
a Harrier as a prize available to anyone accumulating 7 million
points in its Pepsi Stuff contest. To earn that many points, a
person would have to drink 16.8 million cans of Pepsi. But Leonard
said when he called the company, he was told he had the option of
buying ``Pepsi Points'' for 10 cents each. He then raised money
from several investors and presented Pepsi with 15 original points,
plus a check for $700,008.50.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi maintained that the commercial was a spoof, and when the
jet wasn't forthcoming, Leonard's Miami lawyers filed a lawsuit.
PepsiCo, too, filed suit, seeking to have Leonard's claims declared
frivolous, and seeking reimbursement for the company's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon has said the $33.8 million fighter jets
would have to be ``demilitarized'' before being offered to the
public, which meant rendering them unable to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and under what circumstances was the Pledge of
Allegiance introduced, and when was it changed to include the words
``under God?''
</P>
<P>
   A: The pledge to the flag was first published Sept. 8, 1892, in
the juvenile periodical The Youth's Companion, in this form: ``I
pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands;
one nation, indivisible, with liberty and Justice for all.'' Public
school children first recited the pledge as they saluted the flag
during the National School Celebration that same year, marking the
400th anniversary of the discovery of America.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``the flag of the United States of America'' were
substituted for ``my Flag'' in 1924, and the pledge was recognized
officially by the U.S. government in 1942. In 1954, at the urging
of President Dwight Eisenhower, the Congress legislated that
``under God'' be added. The move to do so was spearheaded by the
Knights of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Ted Turner's full quote on adultery being eliminated
from the Ten Commandments? Where did he make his remark?
</P>
<P>
   A: In remarks first reported by The Washington Times, then
repeated by other news organizations, Turner said the Ten
Commandments are ``a little out of date.'' He then went on to say,
``If you're only going to have 10 rules, I don't know if
(prohibiting) adultery should be one of them.'' The comments came
in remarks Turner made Feb. 16 to a meeting of the National Family
Planning and Reproductive Health Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad said there
was no audio or video recording of the speech, and Turner had no
script, so it's not possible to provide any more information about
the exact wording. After the remarks were reported, Turner's office
released this statement: ``Mr. Turner regrets any offense his
comments may have caused and extends his heartfelt apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some years ago, the popular rock duo Milli Vanilli created a
scandal when it was revealed that they didn't actually perform
their own songs, lip-synching instead to someone else's voices. Was
it ever revealed who their real singers were?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan identified the real vocalists
on their 1989 Grammy-winning album ``Girl You Know It's True'' as
Johnny Davis, Charles Shaw and Brad Howell. Pilatus and Morvan
later were stripped of the Grammy. In 1998, Pilatus was found dead
in a hotel room in Frankfurt, Germany. A combination of alcohol and
pills was suspected as the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed lately that Tiger Woods isn't using his usual
caddy, whose name, I believe, is Fluff. Do you know any details?
Also, what is Fluff's background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Woods used Bryon Bell, a friend of his since junior high
school, a few times recently, but Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan is still
Woods' caddy, according to IMG, Woods' management company.
</P>
<P>
   Working for some 40 players since his first job at the Greater
Hartford (Conn.) Open in 1976, Cowan is one of the sport's most
entertaining and enduring figures. An accomplished golfer himself,
Cowan was the No. 1 player on the 1969 golf team at William Penn
College in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He turned pro in 1971and took up
caddying for PGA players in 1976. He caddied for Peter Jacobsen for
19 years, one of the longest relationships between a caddie and a
professional golfer on record. In August 1996, Cowan signed on to
dispense golf clubs and counsel to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Cowan got then nickname from his resemblance to
former pro Steve ``Fluff'' Melnyk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard a lot about the Jerry Falwell-Teletubbies flap,
but I haven't seen any actual statement Falwell himself made on the
subject. What exactly did he say?
</P>
<P>
   A: The controversy deals with an article in the February issue
of National Liberty Journal, of which Falwell is publisher. The
article contained a ``Parents' Alert'' about children's television
programming, with one item headlined ``Tinky Winky Comes Out of the
Closet.'' It reported that the sexual orientation of the
Teletubbies character ``has been the subject of debate since the
series premiered in England in 1997,'' and pointed out that Tinky
Winky ``has become a favorite character among gay groups
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet site _ http://www.falwell.com _ the Falwell
organization says this: ``Dr. Falwell has never seen the
Teletubbies TV program. Dr. Falwell has never commented in any way
on the Teletubbies. He did not `out' Tinky Winky.'' The Internet
statement says J.M. Smith, senior editor of the National Liberty
Journal, wrote the Parents' Alert. It adds, ``Editor Smith . . .
did not attack the Teletubbies or call for a boycott of the
Teletubbies. He simply documented information that had already been
reported in Time, People, The Washington Post, CNN, E-Online and
other national media over the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell spokeswoman Laura Swickard confirmed to Q&AMP;A that Falwell
did not write the article in question. But she added that Falwell
was the author of a press statement on his Internet site. In it, he
writes: ``. . . while I'd like to laugh along with those who are
encouraging parents and critics to `lighten up' about children's
programming in general, and Teletubbies in particular, I find this
issue far too important to the future and well-being of our
children. . . . As a Christian, I believe that role-modeling the
gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children. I find
the flat denials of such a portrayal by Teletubbies producers to be
disingenuous and insufficient in answering the questions that have
been raised about the Tinky Winky character . . .''

STRONG FIRST AMENDMENT TRADITION RELIES UPON THOSE WILLING TO
FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our nation has the noblest and strongest free speech tradition
in the world. This tradition has been the very foundation of our
liberty. It would be good to remember that fact _ as communities
around America wrestle with what should or should not be available
on the Internet, whether concerts by rock groups should be banned
or not, why speech that demeans others should or should not be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment is a fabric that weaves through all our
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   The warp and weft of this fabric protects our right and ability
to govern ourselves. And those who would pull out a thread here or
cut one out there do not realize they risk unraveling the entire
cloth of our freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Open government and open records are necessary corollaries of a
strong First Amendment tradition. The right to know is imbedded in
freedom of speech. How does a nation govern itself if its people
are deprived of the right to know? What good is the right to
criticize the government if such speech can only be delivered in
prison while in solitary confinement?
</P>
<P>
   Our First Amendment tradition protects even speech that is
deliberately provocative or offensive. For good reason. In the U.S.
Supreme Court decision, Terminiello vs. Chicago (1949), Justice
William O. Douglas noted that civil rights leaders often used
speech that ``induces a condition of unrest, creates
dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people
to anger.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martin Luther King Jr., spoke in Montgomery, Ala., in
support of the boycott against segregated buses that had been begun
by Rosa Parks, he said: ``There comes a time that people get tired.
We are here this evening to say to those who have mistreated us so
long that we are tired _ tired of being segregated and humiliated;
tired of being kicked about by the brutal feet of oppression. ...
One of the great glories of democracy is the right to protest for
right ...'' King's speech was protected by the fabric of the First
Amendment. And later, the amendment would also protect civil rights
sit-ins and other peaceful but provocative marches.
</P>
<P>
   And so, too, union protests are protected by the First
Amendment. And the peaceful demonstrations of any downtrodden group
are protected by that great liberty. Eventually, the First
Amendment overturned loyalty oaths and threats to employment if one
belonged to a disfavored group. And it protected the Vietnam Nam
veterans who returned home and burned the American flag to protest
a dismal, unpopular war. Our nation protects dissent because it
understands that from dissident voices may come a public dialogue
that changes the minds of our leaders and the path our country
takes.
</P>
<P>
   Slip a thread from the fabric, and it may no longer be true.
</P>
<P>
   Few professional journalists or newspapers supported Hazelwood
East High School student Kathy Kuhlmeier when she challenged the
principal's right to censor two articles in the school newspaper
she edited. In January 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a broad
ruling against Kuhlmeier and her fellow-students and now school
administrators have nearly carte blanche authority to censor
student speech.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has even impacted community college and university
student publications. Many young journalists who seek work at
newspapers no longer understand the importance of a free press.
They haven't experienced it during their school or college years.
How willingly or effectively will they defend their First Amendment
rights or ours?
</P>
<P>
   This nation's free speech tradition did not arise accidentally.
It took civil liberties groups dedicated to protecting the speech
and press liberties spelled out in the First Amendment: ``Congress
shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press....'' As Samuel Walker has demonstrated so clearly in his
1994 book, ``Hate Speech: The History of an American Controversy,''
the American Civil LIberties Union must be given credit for its key
role in preserving the core meaning of freedom of speech. The ACLU
was founded in 1920 specifically to defend this right _ not only
for Communists and Socialists and liberals, but for everyone,
including the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Without the ACLU's perseverance earlier in this century, it is
likely we would not have such a magnificent free speech tradition.
In his book, Walker concludes that ``the protection of offensive
speech has been critical to the pursuit of racial equality, along
with defense of the rights of other powerless groups _ the
Jehovah's Witnesses, Vietnam War protestors, and others.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU was an advocate for unpopular minorities and those
without political clout. In recent years, other groups have added
their advocacy for freedom of speech, including the American
Library Association and People for the American Way and a number of
coalitions to ensure that speech on the Internet remains free.
</P>
<P>
   Pull a thread from the fabric, and some other powerless groups
will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1930s and '40s, the Jehovah's Witnesses, a small
persecuted religious group, attacked the Roman Catholic Church with
a viciousness that brought states to pass laws against their
inflammatory propaganda. The ACLU defended the free speech rights
of the Witnesses, and eventually all those state ``hate speech''
laws fell aside.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional scholar Henry J. Abraham points out that of the
50-plus cases involving religious freedom and free speech issues
the Witnesses took to the courts they lost very few. In winning,
they won for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, 1943, when America was still involved in World War
II, the U.S. Supreme Court issued one of the greatest rulings in
favor of individual conscience (West Virginia State Board of
Education vs. Barnette). Three years after it had decided that
Jehovah's Witnesses could be forced to salute the flag and say the
pledge of allegiance, the high court dramatically changed its
position. Witnesses believe that the flag is a ``graven image'' and
their religion forbids them to salute it.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnette ruling upheld their right of conscience and struck
down West Virginia's flag salute laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Barnette, Justice Robert Jackson wrote for a majority of the
court: ``The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw
certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to
place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to
establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.
One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free
press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental
rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of
no elections.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``If there is any fixed star in our constitutional
constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe
what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other
matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act
their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an
exception, they do not now occur to us.'' To underscore its
decision, the high court announced it on Flag Day.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling sweeps further than the flag salute. It resonates
deeply with all those who cherish liberty. We have Jehovah's
Witnesses to thank for this victory _ and many other persecuted or
despised minorities who have secured free speech liberties for us
by fighting for them. That's the real lesson.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Who can I contact to find out if I have any GI Bill
educational benefits left?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Department of Veterans Affairs has a new toll-free
telephone number for veterans and dependents to obtain information
on VA education benefits: 1-888-442-4551. The number operates 24
hours a day, seven days a week, and provides detailed eligibility
criteria and general background on VA programs, said VA spokesman
Tom Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans, reservists and National Guard members receiving
education benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill also may obtain
detailed information on their personal benefits account through the
new automated system. Callers can get specific questions answered
by education case managers during regular business hours.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet users, information also is available at
http://www.va.gov/education . Or call 1-800-827-1000, which will
connect you to your nearest VA regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, I read that a white person has never been
sentenced or put to death in this country for the killing of a
black person. In view of the sentencing to death of John William
King in Texas for the killing of James Byrd Jr., can you confirm if
this is true?
</P>
<P>
   A: White people certainly have been executed for killing black
people in this country, but statistics have been disproportionate.
Since capital punishment resumed in the United States in 1977,
according to records compiled by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, 11
whites have been executed in the United States for killing blacks,
while 142 blacks have been executed for killing whites. Only one
white man has ever been executed in Texas for killing a black man,
and that was in 1854. The case involved a feud between two farmers,
which climaxed when one killed the other's favorite slave.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Dollar bills have the letters A through L in a circle to the
left of the image of George Washington, with the names of cities
below. Why does it end with L, and why are only certain cities
named?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are only 12 letters (A through L) because they
correspond to the nation's 12 Federal Reserve Banks, said Edward
Sheehan of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The banks also
have a number. They are: Boston (1, A), New York (2, B),
Philadelphia (3, C), Cleveland (4, D), Richmond (5, E), Atlanta (6,
F), Chicago (7, G), St. Louis (8, H), Minneapolis (9, I), Kansas
City (10, J), Dallas (11, K) and San Francisco (12, L).
</P>
<P>
   The bank that authorizes a note can be determined by looking at
the black Federal Reserve seal on the bill. The name is printed
within the seal's border. The district's letter is in the center
and also begins the two serial numbers in the upper right and lower
left. The district's number appears at four places: on each side,
placed above and below the center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do members of the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,
such as Alan Greenspan, have limited terms in office, like members
of Congress? Or are they appointed for life?
</P>
<P>
   A: They aren't appointed for life. All board members are
nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. A full term
is 14 years; a member who serves a full term may not be
reappointed. The chairman (currently Greenspan) and the vice
chairman (Alice M. Rivlin) are named by the president from among
the members and are confirmed by the Senate. They serve a term of
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan took office as chairman June 20, 1996, for a third
four-year term. He originally took office as chairman _ and to fill
an unexpired term as a member of the board _ on Aug. 11, 1987. He
was reappointed to the board to a full 14-year term, which began
Feb. 1, 1992. He has been designated chairman by Presidents Reagan,
Bush and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the Mediterranean diet? A
recent newspaper article indicated that it's supposed to help
prevent heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mediterranean diet calls for more bread, more vegetables,
more fish, less red meat (replacing meat with chicken), some fruit
daily, and the use of canola oil and olive oil as the sources of
fat. It also replaces butter and cream with a special margarine
made with canola oil. A study done in France compared such a diet,
common in Mediterranean countries, with that of Northern Europeans,
which uses more animal fat, and found a dramatic reduction in new
manifestations of heart disease in people recovering from a
previous heart attack. Evidence presented at the American Heart
Association's annual meeting in 1996 also showed that the
Mediterranean diet may lower blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the voice of Shirley Jones that we hear singing in
``The Music Man,'' or was someone else's voice dubbed in?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dubbing in another singer's voice for Shirley Jones, who had
the role of Marian Paroo, would be like dubbing Frank Sinatra's
singing in ``Guys and Dolls'' or Barbra Streisand's in ``Hello,
Dolly!'' Unthinkable, in other words. Jones had demonstrated her
movie star quality, both acting and singing, several years earlier
in the film versions of ``Oklahoma!'' and ``Carousel.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing voices in big-screen musicals isn't entirely unknown,
however. Every film fan knows that Marni Nixon provided the singing
voice of Eliza Doolittle in the movie version of ``My Fair Lady,''
a role portrayed by Audrey Hepburn. But some other dubbed movie
voices may surprise you: Nan Wynn, not Rita Hayworth, sang the
sultry lyrics to ``Put the Blame on Mame'' in ``Gilda''; India
Adams sang Cyd Charisse's numbers in ``The Band Wagon''; Nixon
dubbed all of Natalie Wood's songs in ``West Side Story.'' Louanne
Hogan dubbed so many screen songs for Jeanne Crain that she was
known as ``Jeanne Crain's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you update me on the status of the Chinese gymnast who
was paralyzed in an accident at the Goodwill Games? Where can
donations be sent?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sang Lan, 17, who broke her neck in a fall July 21 at the
Goodwill Games in New York, has been deemed fit to return to China
and is expected to make the trip in June. ``I'm very happy to go
back, but I will miss New York,'' she told a New York reporter
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sang, who came to the Goodwill Games as the 1997 Chinese
national vault champion, remains paralyzed and unable to move from
the neck down. Although she must use a wheelchair, Sang has
stabilized sufficiently for doctors to approve the trip. The New
York Daily News reported that the teen has been under pressure from
the Chinese Gymnastic Association to return home, where she's a
national hero. Winston Sie, with whom Sang and her mother have been
staying, said the teen would undergo acupuncture, massage and
herbal remedies when she is back in China.
</P>
<P>
   Donations can be made to the Sang Lan Fund and mailed c/o Dr.
Kristjan Ragnarsson, Mount Sinai Medical Center, One Gustave L.
Levy Place, New York, NY 10029.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you print the address for President Clinton's legal
defense fund, for those who want to send a contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: Checks can be sent to: Clinton Legal Expense Trust, Dept.
6007, Washington, DC 20042-6007. The maximum amount that can be
donated by an individual is $10,000 a year. Information:
202-347-0119.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some years back, quarterback Johnny Unitas completed an
amazing string of passes to lead the Baltimore Colts to victory
over the New York Giants in a championship game. Can you refresh my
memory about the details?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in 1958. With two minutes to play for the NFL
championship, the Giants were ahead 17-14. The Colts were on their
own 14-yard line. Unitas completed seven consecutive passes to set
up a game-tying field goal with seven seconds left, then engineered
a 79-yard drive in sudden-death overtime that won the game, 23-17.
</P>
<P>
   You used the word ``amazing.'' It really was, considering that
Unitas was wearing a 9-pound protective corset of foam rubber and
steel because of three broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I read that the heiress to the Levitz
furniture fortune was missing and her home was messed up. Was she
ever found?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The widow of furniture mogul Ralph Levitz was last seen
Nov. 18, 1995, and was reported missing two days later.
Investigators said they found a blood-soaked mattress and signs of
a struggle at her home overlooking the Mississippi River in
Vicksburg, Miss. She was 62 at the time of her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Covington, FBI case agent in Jackson, Miss., who is
handling the Levitz case, told Q&AMP;A that it's still an open
investigation. ``We are pursuing any and all leads that come to our
attention with the same aggression that we used when she was first
reported missing in 1995,'' he said.

 &HT;    Thank you, Jasper, for giving hope
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As a child, I looked forward to going
uptown with Mama. Walking along the dusty road that led from our
neighborhood to the business center of our small, rural Florida
town, she would meet friends and engage in candid conversation
usually kept from children. Although I always tried to feign
disinterest, I listened intently as the adults talked.
</P>
<P>
   It was on such a trek uptown that I heard Mama and one of her
friends talking about the troubles of Mrs. Williams, who attended
our church. ``That poor woman's had such a hard life,'' Mama
commented.
</P>
<P>
   As the conversation between Mama and her friend continued, I
learned that a few years earlier, Mrs. Williams had lost her only
child when the young man was accused of insulting a young white
girl as she returned home after a trip. Allegedly, Mrs. Williams'
son, who was doing yard work nearby, called out, ``Miss Smith, the
sight of you will cure the sore eye.''
</P>
<P>
   For this breach of racial protocol, police accused him of making
a sexual pass, arrested him and hauled him to jail. During the
night, he was castrated in his cell and left to bleed to death.
Without explanation, the sheriff offered Mrs. Williams her son's
body. No one was charged in the killing. No newspaper reported it.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that every black person has a lynching story. The
story of Mrs. Williams' son was the first of many such acts of
racially motivated depravity I was to learn of as I grew up.
Ultimately, it was not the brutality of the crimes that was
indelibly etched into my memory. Rather, it was the premise that
whites who committed such atrocities could act with the confident
expectation that no legal action would be taken against them. So
black people, potential targets for callous cruelty, had to live
with the parallel expectation that we are perpetually vulnerable to
such abuse because of our skin color.
</P>
<P>
   That early lesson prepared me to expect the worst. Thus, the
most surprising aspect of James Byrd Jr.'s murder in Jasper, Texas,
last June was not that men chained him by the ankles and dragged
him almost 3 miles behind a pickup truck until, still alive and in
excruciating pain, he was decapitated by a culvert.
</P>
<P>
   For many like me, who can cite a litany of cases marked by
blatant disregard for blacks' humanity, an even greater shock than
the atrocious killing is the fact that law officials in a small,
rural town _ Jasper's population is 7,000 _ acted swiftly to gather
evidence and arrest suspects. No cloak of silence by people of
integrity condoned the unconscionable cruelty inflicted on Mr.
Byrd. The media thoroughly reported the gruesome details of this
racially motivated crime. Public officials did not shirk their
prosecutorial duties because the victim was black and his accused
slayers white.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a jury found John W. King guilty, he was
sentenced to death. The other two alleged accomplices face trial
this summer. Mr. King, a self-declared white supremacist said to be
proud of his action, surely will appeal, but for now he is the
452nd person on Texas' Death Row and the only white person
sentenced to die for killing a black person.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict accords Mr. Byrd the human dignity every citizen
deserves. The people of Jasper have publicly declared an end to the
tradition of making the murder of black men a permissible sport.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this new call to conscience does not bridge the chasm
that divides us nationwide. During the past decade, there has been
a dramatic increase in the number of hate groups across this
country. Even more disturbing, many white youths, emboldened by
anonymity, are using the Internet to connect with a network of
hatemongers, all convinced that their human worth depends on
establishing their racial superiority over others.
</P>
<P>
   Rooting out all racial tyranny, historically established in
practice and embedded in American traditions, may be impossible.
Still, the conviction of Mr. Byrd's killer lowers the expectation
that people of moral conscience will tolerate race-motivated
atrocities. For now, that's significant progress.

 &HT;    Hey, remember the alamo?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Servoice
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You'd think a business that has ``Alamo'' in its
name would do something to celebrate Texas Independence Day.
Something. Anything. Swap chili recipes. Serve nachos. Hurl insults
at somebody from New Jersey. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But after checking with these outfits, I found out I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 businesses listed in the Austin phonebook incorporate
Alamo in their titles. I called or visited several of them, and I
couldn't find one that was whooping it up Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Huber, owner of Alamo Sound Productions, celebrated Texas
Independence Day by _ dig this _ changing the oil in his 1977 Dodge
van in front of his house in South Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you live in South Austin, changing your oil is
sort of a spiritual thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much more glamorous than that; I'll be up to my
elbows in oil here in a few minutes,'' said Huber, who also planned
to wax his Mustang as part of his Texas Independence Day
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Huber uses Alamo in his business name because he had an Austin
band called Alamo Choir.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he used Alamo in the band name was that he'd had
several bands before, and he wanted Alamo Choir to be the last. And
he needed a name that would fit that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be my famous last stand, as far as a band
goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure. Many people in Austin celebrated Texas Independence
Day. On the Capitol grounds, hundreds of folks lined for barbecue
to take part in Ellis County Day.
</P>
<P>
   Around 12:35, they ran out of meat.
</P>
<P>
   Get a rope. Running out of meat at a Texas Independence Day
barbecue. That's like Pamplona running out of bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of barbecue, on Tuesday morning, Jim Bowie Jr. said he
would celebrate Texas Independence Day by barbecuing in his back
yard in East Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie, 66, a retired admininstrator for the Gary Job Corps in
San Marcos, has a good time being named Jim Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I'm black,'' he said. ``And I spin this yarn about being
there (at the Alamo) with the Gonzales's and the Valenzuelas and
the Garcias, and start laughing.'' Actually, there were some black
people at the Alamo, said George B. Ward, of the Texas State
Historical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie carries a small pocket knife he tells everybody is his
Bowie knife. He's one of four Jim Bowies listed in the Austin phone
directory
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I know anybody named Davy Crockett? Sure don't,'' Bowie
said. But being named Jim Bowie has caused him trouble at least
once.
</P>
<P>
   He says around 2 o'clock in the morning several years ago he got
an angry phone call from a guy who was mad because somebody named
Jim Bowie had been going out with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, 'Man, I haven't been any place tonight,' `` Jim
Bowie Jr. recalled. ``I couldn't make him understand it wasn't
me.'' He should have told the guy he was really Col. William B.
Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Alamo Glass, they weren't even sure why the place was
named Alamo Glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company has been in business over 30 years under that
name and I have no earthly idea how it got its name,'' said Karen
Ash, who runs the office.
</P>
<P>
   So the place has been around almost as long as the Alamo? ``It
feels like it sometimes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Alamo Hanger &AMP; Supply on North Lamar, they weren't
observing the day either. So why is it called Alamo Hanger &AMP;
Supply?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it sounded better than something like Jeff's Hangers
or whatever,'' said Dawn Proud, an employee.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Alamo Rent A Car at Robert Mueller Airport. ``I
haven't heard anything,'' said the lady who answered the phone when
I asked her if the company was celebrating Texas Independence Day.
``But you can call corporate.''
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? Corporate's in Fort Lauderdale.

 &HT;    Averting our eyes is worse than seeing
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``This is hard, but you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laqueta Flowers repeated the words of the district attorney to
herself, over and over. That's how the 41-year-old schoolteacher
steeled herself for her task as a juror: looking through page after
page of autopsy photos of James Byrd Jr.'s dismembered body, while
a pathologist described how he died. How he twisted and turned,
seeking relief from the excruciating pain of brush-burn abrasions,
as he was dragged along a bumpy road, a logging chain tied around
his ankles. How he was alive, during that three-mile stretch of
road, until his head was torn off by a concrete drainage duct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't turn this page,'' Flowers told herself as she opened
the black folder containing 14 crime-scene photographs. She turned
it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The jury listened conscientiously to the gruesome testimony and
took less than three hours to deliver a verdict. They convicted
John William King, a 24-year-old white supremacist, of murder.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened to Flowers speak on NPR's Morning Edition, I felt
ashamed of my own reluctance to look at this tragedy. I hadn't
wanted to think about it, to write about it. It was too horrible to
imagine what Byrd suffered, too painful to think how far we have to
go in eradicating racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton historian and retired teacher Margaret Peters thinks it's
important we don't avert our eyes. The murder warrants all the
national attention it has received, all the soul-searching. ``It
signals to people we haven't made the great strides we think we
have,'' said Peters, author of Dayton's African American Heritage .
``This country has never come to terms that this is a racist
country, anything that happens like that is an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters is reminded of a James Baldwin essay in which the
celebrated novelist compared America to a sick person who doesn't
know he's sick: ``If a country is sick and won't look at its past,
the country is not going to be all that it should be either. As a
nation we have never faced up to the fact we have always said one
thing and done another.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's horrifying murder didn't surprise Peters: ``Think of all
the people who have been lynched with no punishment. Think of the
photo of a lynched man who is being burned. There were all these
smiling faces plain to the camera. There were little kids there and
women and girls.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no justice for countless lynching victims. No justice
for Emmett Till, for Medgar Evers, for four little girls in a
Birmingham church. In many quarters, there was sympathy for the
killers, not the victims.
</P>
<P>
   This crime is as heinous as the rest, a measure of how far we
haven't come. But at least there is outrage. And there is justice:
King is the first white person in modern Texas history to be
sentenced to death in the murder of a black person.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Collins, 23, the only black on the jury, told NPR, ``Nobody
should be tortured that way. . . . This man knew what was happening
to him up until the point to where he was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the jury was making a statement: ``We're just
letting everybody know that we're not going to accept this at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict represents progress, but Peters warns against
complacency: ``Look a the growth of the Klan. There have been a lot
of legal changes, but all the laws on the books don't mean that
much if people don't change the way they think and feel.''
</P>
<P>
   We cannot avert our eyes; we cannot forget James Byrd. We must
honor his memory by examining our own hearts and actions, by
fighting racism wherever we find it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, but we must do it.

 &HT;    Don't forget to pick brain of older generation for future wisdom
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ With the days ticking down toward a new
millennium, it's easy to overlook how different our lives are today
compared to how Americans lived only 100 brief years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial and technological advances have accelerated Americans
through so many changes during the past 10 decades that today's
young people must find it difficult to understand that they are
breathing the same air as people who grew up without television,
microwave ovens, air-conditioning or shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans remember living in the rural areas where the food
was cooked on wood stoves, the water drawn from hand-dug wells and
the houses lighted with coal-oil lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 percent of America's rural residents had electricity by
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Some of today's elderly mall walkers can remember when their
parents had to hitch the family horse or mule to a wagon before
they bounced their way to town to do the week's shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Although I've just ordered a new 500 MHz Pentium III computer
with 128 MB SDRAM and a 17 GB hard drive, I also have a working
knowledge of outhouses, butter churns and lye soap. I've gone from
scrub boards to mother boards.
</P>
<P>
   I remember listening to an old Civil War veteran tell about a
young fellow soldier getting shot in the private parts, which he
considered humorous. I've heard people talk about moving west in
Conestoga covered wagons.
</P>
<P>
   John L. Walker of Waco can remember more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 89 years old and don't have much time left,'' Walker wrote
recently after reading a guest column by Mattie Trantham about life
in the 1940s and '50s in neighboring Mexia.
</P>
<P>
   Trantham compared Mexia's crumbling downtown with the years of
her youth when the town bustled with commerce and life.
</P>
<P>
   Walker remembers Mexia from an earlier time, until his family
moved from Mexia in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   There was that time when ``a desperado came to town,'' he
recalled. Because there were no phones, a concerned Mexia citizen
``had to grab a horse and ride over to Groesbeck, the county seat,
to get the sheriff.'' The sheriff rode the 12 miles into town and
cornered the desperado at a ``small eating place'' where the two
men ``had a shoot-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently the sheriff was a good shot and very confident. ``The
sheriff hit him (the desperado) six times but in no vital place.''
The desperado ran out the back door and ``down towards Ross
Avenue,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff, having shot six times, was out of bullets,''
Walker said. With his six-shooter empty and having not bothered to
bring extra ammunition, the sheriff interrupted his pursuit to stop
by the local hardware store for more ammunition. But the store was
sold out of that caliber. The sheriff rode back to Groesbeck,
reloaded and continued his pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the outcome was obvious, Walker didn't bother to
finish the story. He did, however, tell about how after Mr.
Humphrey discovered oil and ``some smart aleck in order to keep the
dust down'' poured oil on Mexia's dirt streets and caused a huge
mess.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is difficult to grasp that there are a lot of
people even older than Walker who have experienced an amazing
journey. Their memories sound like stories from time travelers.
</P>
<P>
   For their own sakes, young people today should seek out the
stories of elderly relatives and neighbors who, like Walker,
``don't have much time left.''
</P>
<P>
   As rapidly as technology continues to accelerate, future
generations will be spellbound with the retelling of these
firsthand stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean you actually met someone who remembers when there
were no computers? You really mean they lived in houses with no
electricity? What did they use, photovoltaic?''

 &HT;    The boxer and the fighter
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Greg Link was 6 years old, riding his bicycle one
day in Kettering in the summer of 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He fell over the handlebars and landed on his chin.
</P>
<P>
   How many thousand kids fall off their bikes every day in
America?
</P>
<P>
   How many get up, mom puts a bandage on the cut and it's
forgotten two days later?
</P>
<P>
   How many spend the rest of their lives bouncing between
piercing, all-day headaches; recurrent vomiting; seizures; painful
spinal taps, and never-ending shunt surgeries?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's sure if that was the cause,'' said Connie Link of her
son's 14-year battle for a normal life. ``But the headaches started
about three months after the fall, and that's the only thing we can
tie to it.''
</P>
<P>
   An infection? A virus? Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   It's called benign intercranial hypertension. Fluid builds up
between the brain and skull and begins to squeeze the brain. Normal
bodies drain and replace that fluid three times a day. Greg's body
refused to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was misdiagnosed as having migraine headaches and
treated with pills. Finally, after three years of no relief,
someone got it right.
</P>
<P>
   Thus started two years of spinal taps to remove the fluid.
Thirty spinal taps in all. Long needles shoved into his back.
Needles that too often missed and hit nerves instead, leaving Greg
unable to walk the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how painful spinal taps are?'' said Brian Link,
Greg's older brother. ``Then they started in with the shunt
surgeries, and the valves didn't work right or the tubes got
plugged, and they kept operating on him over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty surgeries,'' Connie Link said. ``Twice they cut into
his eyes and put slits in his optic nerves to help drain the
fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be sitting there in pain, looking forward to the next
surgery, with the attitude that this would be the one that
worked,'' Brian said. ``And I just said to myself, 'What a special
kid.' He blows my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Link is 20 now and still fighting the good fight. Brother
Brian is 23 and works in Cincinnati for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
It was Brian who set in motion the highlight of Greg's mostly
pain-ridden existence.
</P>
<P>
   Greg fell in love with boxing in 1993. ``I don't want to sound
too dramatic,'' he said, ``but it's two guys, one-on-one, with no
teammates to bail them out. I see a comparison between my fight
with this disease and what boxers do.''
</P>
<P>
   He adopted Pernell ``Sweet Pea'' Whitaker as his favorite after
watching highlights of Whitaker's controversial 1993 draw with
Julio Cesar Chavez. Greg, age 13, thought Whitaker clearly won the
fight, but was impressed even more by Sweet Pea's demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just accepted it,'' Greg said. ``He just calmly said, 'They
robbed me. I'll let the fans decide.' I liked that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw himself in Whitaker, cheated but unbowed; down but
unbroken.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, as Greg's shunt failed again and he was about
to go in for another operation, brother Brian got one of Greg's
boxing magazines, found the address for Main Event, the boxing
promotion organization, and wrote a letter to Shelly Finkel,
Whitaker's manager, asking for an autographed picture.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, it came. ``To Greg,'' it said. ``Stay strong.''
And it was signed, ``Sweet Pea.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg's spirits were lifted, but reality set back in just as
quickly. He enrolled at Wright State in the fall of 1997 after
earning a diploma from Alter High through home study with the help
of a dedicated tutor named Nan Becker. But a WSU math teacher told
Greg she had an ``attendance policy'' and if he missed more than
five classes, whatever the reason, his grade would be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Greg said he tried to explain his situation, but she wouldn't
listen. He withdrew from school and slid ``into a funk.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian wrote another letter to Finkel, and Finkel, a marvelous
man, quickly arranged a phone call from Whitaker to Greg. ``He told
me to hang in there and don't give up,'' Greg said. ``And then he
said the next time he fights, he was going to fly me in as his
personal guest.''
</P>
<P>
   One fight fell through, but when another fight was scheduled,
Finkel called and started the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Two Fridays ago, Brian and Greg flew to New York where the VIP
treatment awaited. They were met at the airport by a chauffeur
holding their names on a cardboard sign, and he drove them to a
hotel across the street from Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They did the New York scene _ ate, gawked, walked the streets,
counted cabs, rejected guys selling watches for next-to-nothing. On
fight night, they were in Row 8 at the Garden. ``My heart never
stopped pounding,'' Greg said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker lost to Felix Trinidad, but worse, had his jaw broken
in the process. Greg and Brian were supposed to meet Whitaker after
the fight, but Sweet Pea went to the hospital, and the meeting
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   A stretch limo took them to the airport the next morning and
they flew back to Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   A week-and-a-half later, Greg is still in awe.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in his family room Tuesday morning, Greg Link showed
no signs of the disease that flogs him every day. He is 6-foot-1, a
solid 195 pounds, and his spirit is larger than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up with a bad headache,'' he said, ``then I get up and
for the next two hours it slowly goes away as the shunt drains the
fluid. Then it comes back and just keeps getting worse the rest of
the day.''

   He goes to bed around midnight, but never goes to sleep. At 2 or
2:30 a.m., he slips one of his collection of 200 fight videotapes
into the VCR and watches. If he still can't sleep, he puts in
another one. He has seen them all 20-30 times. He knows the punch
sequences by heart. Doesn't matter. This is Greg Link's escape. At

 &HT;    COMMENT: Studies may be hazardous to your health
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Monday's headline, ``Working moms can
quit feeling guilty, study says,'' prompted me to launch my own
study on just how many studies are out there.
</P>
<P>
   My findings? 519 in the last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   My study also showed that if you don't like a study, just wait a
while. Another study will come along to say just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But the working mom study goes to show that you never can tell
about studies.
</P>
<P>
   Harken back to the early 1980s and you'll find a University of
Massachusetts study linking working moms and developmental problems
in their children. And yet when the same 6,000 children were
tracked to age 12, retesting showed early developmental differences
had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being employed is not going to harm the children,''
psychologist Elizabeth Harvey concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies then and now are flawed, of course, because they
neglect the role of guilt in child-rearing. The increased
guilt-load of the working mom meant they strove mightily to
compensate, closing the gap on the guilt-free stay-at-homes.
</P>
<P>
   Look for my brilliant analysis to trigger blizzards of studies
setting guilt-quotient (G.Q.) minimums for successful
child-rearing, followed by later studies to show the first studies
were full of beans.
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound. Oat bran? I need only quote The Washington Post
from April 1991: ``Oat bran's reputation as a cholesterol fighter,
exalted and then sullied by conflicting scientific studies, is on
the rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that? First oat bran was good. Then not so good. Now good
again. Forget the cholesterol issue, I just want somebody to tell
me how to stop having these disturbing dreams about a naked Wilford
Brimley trying to entice me into a hot tub full of Quaker Oats,
saying, ``Come on in. It's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of nightmares, I have read wildly contradictory studies
insisting that dreams are A.) profoundly meaningful or B.) mental
gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of gibberish, a study yet to be refuted showed that
jet lag could be cured by shining an ultra-violet light on the skin
behind the knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flabbergasted,'' admitted Dr. Michael Menaker, a
biologist at the University of Virginia. ``For three days we tried
to find flaws in the experiment and we couldn't.'' (Expect ``The
Jet Leg'' to be marketed before the opposing studies are released.)
</P>
<P>
   You're familiar with the self-esteem movement? Until quite
recently, you couldn't swing a cat without hitting some expert
linking all that is bad in children _ academic failure, drug use,
bullying _ to low self-esteem. Turns out there were never any
studies saying any such thing. The links were assumed to exist.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally occurred to researchers to test the connection
between self-esteem and academic achievement, all studies agreed
for once: There wasn't any.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists Harold Stevenson and James Stiegler tested the
academic skills of elementary students in the United States, China,
Japan and Taiwan, and found that the Asian students excelled, but
the Americans had higher self-esteem. Albert Bandura, a Stanford
psychology professor, published research showing that self-esteem
``effects neither personal goals nor performance.''
</P>
<P>
   As for bullies and their self-esteem, I turn to a New York Times
report from 1996: ``Contrary to popular belief, bullies are not
inwardly anxious, insecure children. Rather, when tested, bullies
tend to score high in self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another casualty of my research into what studies show before
they change their minds and show something else was my assumption
that there is such thing as a mid-life crisis. I had rather counted
on it _ had looked forward to it, in fact _ and now feel rather let
down to find that it, too, may be a myth.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day I read that far from being a time of failing
health and personal turmoil, ``middle age for many is the most
fulfilling time of life,'' according to a 10-year study sponsored
by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   According to social psychologist Orville Gilbert, professional
killjoy, nine out of 10 middle-aged men and women surveyed said
they never experienced a mid-life crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Even menopause was cited as no big deal by Alice Rossia, a
professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts. ``For
most middle-aged women,'' the study said, ``menopause is a benign
experience, a far cry from the view of many contemporary writers.''
</P>
<P>
   So as I read this, if female menopause is overstated, then male
menopause has got to be a scam by somebody at Chrysler with far too
many back lots full of red Sebring convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   Have we learned anything? Yes. And no. Studies show that we
aren't getting enough garlic, fish oil, sleep, leafy greens, tomato
sauce, soy products and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we are. We just have to wait for the next study.
</P>

 &HT;    Going back to my old school
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ As ultra-cool and cynical (not to mention
smart aleck) students of Baylor University in the 70s, my future
husband and I would often make fun of the rabid alumni who returned
to campus, decked out in green and gold from head to toe. Most
delightful were the dignified gentlemen in dark green slacks
sporting a gold stripe up the seams and a matching gold jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   Paul and I returned last week, more than a little hopeful that
our second child might choose to attend our alma mater. We
discovered with our first that you truly reap what you sow. Having
been reared by parents who judiciously followed a philosophy of
producing independent thinkers and doers, she choose a school seven
states away.
</P>
<P>
   The Legacy Weekend, as last week's recruiting visit was billed,
was aimed at children of alumni. If Kathryn Alana picks Baylor and
the largest Baptist university in the world picks her, she will be
the third generation in our family to attend classes there, and
upon graduation, one of about a dozen members of both of our
families who are BU alumni.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend offered an opportunity to see the campus and left me
amazed at how much things change and how much they really don't.
</P>
<P>
   We visited Penland Hall, a men's dorm that was inhabited by
freshman men when I attended. My freshman dorm was across the
street and had no dining hall, so we ate at Penland. The food was
bad and the lobby smelled like a gym. And there was always a group
of boys in that lobby checking out the chicks and trying to make
time. They were amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, we saw Penland's refurbished lobby and its cafeteria
that would rival many restaurants. The lobby looked better, but it
still smelled. And those same guys who hung out there 20 years ago
were still there, but this time they ignored me and focused on
Kathryn and her friend Lauren. I still thought they were amusing.
My husband had little comment. I think I heard him mutter,
``apes.''
</P>
<P>
   We explored much of the campus, admitting to only some of the
mischief we had created. We wandered to Cameron Park and told the
tale of Lovers' Leap. We ate at Cupp's Drive In, one of the few
remaining greasy spoons near campus, now a neighbor to such chain
outlets as Schlotzsky's and Burger King. I saw the duplex where I
lived my junior and senior years, now surrounded by new apartment
complexes and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   We visited beautiful campus mainstays such as Old Main and Pat
Neff Hall, and the ultra modern music and fine arts buildings. We
gawked at so much more that is being built, but discovered Baylor
is still a small place where you always see somebody you know. We
ran into Paul's fraternity brother, Faron Cain from Hallsville,
escorting some legacies of his own around campus.
</P>
<P>
   We lamented not returning more often and secretly hoped that our
child would give us an excuse to do so. How did she ever become so
independent?
</P>
<P>
   And we promised not to get the green outfits with the gold
stripes, but gave ourselves permission to be just a little
sentimental.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ ``This is hard, but you can do
it.'' Laqueta Flowers repeated the words of the district attorney
to herself, over and over. That's how the 41-year-old schoolteacher
steeled herself for her task as a juror: looking through page after
page of autopsy photos of James Byrd Jr.'s dismembered body, while
a pathologist described how he died. As I listened to Flowers speak
on NPR's Morning Edition, I felt ashamed of my own reluctance to
look at this tragedy. I hadn't wanted to think about it, to write
about it. It was too horrible to imagine what Byrd suffered, too
painful to think how far we have to go in eradicating racial
hatred. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ Last week, after a jury found John W. King
guilty, he was sentenced to death. The other two alleged
accomplices face trial this summer. Mr. King, a self-declared white
supremacist said to be proud of his action, surely will appeal, but
for now he is the 452nd person on Texas' Death Row and the only
white person sentenced to die for killing a black person. The
verdict accords Mr. Byrd the human dignity every citizen deserves.
The people of Jasper have publicly declared an end to the tradition
of making the murder of black men a permissible sport. Still, this
new call to conscience does not bridge the chasm that divides us
nationwide. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STUDIES-COMMENTARY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Monday's headline,
``Working moms can quit feeling guilty, study says,'' prompted me
to launch my own study on just how many studies are out there. My
findings? 519 in the last year alone. My study also showed that if
you don't like a study, just wait a while. Another study will come

</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ With the days ticking down
toward a new millennium, it's easy to overlook how different our
lives are today compared to how Americans lived only 100 brief
years ago. Some of today's elderly mall walkers can remember when
their parents had to hitch the family horse or mule to a wagon
before they bounced their way to town to do the week's shopping.
John L. Walker of Waco can remember more. (Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ You'd think a business that has
``Alamo'' in its name would do something to celebrate Texas
Independence Day. Something. Anything. Swap chili recipes. Serve
nachos. Hurl insults at somebody from New Jersey. Whatever. But
after checking with these outfits, I found out I was wrong. About
30 businesses listed in the Austin phonebook incorporate Alamo in
their titles. I called or visited several of them, and I couldn't
find one that was whooping it up Tuesday. (Kelso, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

 &HT;    HAIR FARE: Designers enhance their creations with shear
determination
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the runway, hair can be an extension of a
designer's look.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, sometimes it's just hair extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The last day of Fashion Week featured some heavy hitters _
Calvin Klein, Vera Wang, Han Feng and Donna Karan. Here is a peek
at what their hairstylists whipped up, and why:
</P>
<P>
   HAN FENG _ Guy Laurent ``I was thinking Princess Leia, but much
more simple. The key was to use as few accessories as possible.''
He divided each model's hair into a number of portions, depending
on the shape of the model's face, and used plastic bands to wrap
them into place. (Models had to cut them out of their hair.)
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG _ Rolando Beauchamp ``Her collection was in greens and
browns, kind of earthy. Sort of a calico cat. When I saw the
clothes, I thought calico.'' He glued in hair extensions in colors
slightly different from the model's own _ to fit the calico idea _
then used thinning shears on the ends. ``I don't think hair should
ever be blunt on the ends.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN _ Odile Gilbert ``It is what a woman would do at
work _ they have a pencil and make sort of a chignon. It's very
much Donna Karan when you see her.'' Instead of using a pencil, she
used lengths of glass piping from a laboratory in her native
France. Then she used anti-frizz spritz for a little shine.
</P>
<P>
   CALVIN KLEIN _ Peter Butler ``The clothing was so structured we
wanted something simple and easy, to look like the women did it
themselves. I wouldn't call it a chignon or anything as classic as
that.'' He used a little dry mousse for texture, then put the hair
in a ponytail, twisted a few times and pinned it.

   PEOPLE-BIRTHDAY _ People, the ``mother of all human interest
magazines,'' turns 25 years old Friday (March 5). It's the magazine
that most shrewdly anticipated and capitalized on our national
obsession with celebrity. People was a punchline in ``The Big
Chill,'' when it served as an emblem for empty fluff (''It's just
good investigative journalism'' deadpanned Jeff Goldblum, who
played a People reporter), but, in fact, has expertly gauged what
we want to read about. With 33 million readers and spinoffs such as
InStyle and Teen People going strong, and ongoing expansion into
television and cyberspace, the franchise looks durable. A look at

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ ``This is hard, but you can do
it.'' Laqueta Flowers repeated the words of the district attorney
to herself, over and over. That's how the 41-year-old schoolteacher
steeled herself for her task as a juror: looking through page after
page of autopsy photos of James Byrd Jr.'s dismembered body, while
a pathologist described how he died. As I listened to Flowers speak
on NPR's Morning Edition, I felt ashamed of my own reluctance to
look at this tragedy. I hadn't wanted to think about it, to write
about it. It was too horrible to imagine what Byrd suffered, too
painful to think how far we have to go in eradicating racial
hatred. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ Last week, after a jury found John W. King
guilty, he was sentenced to death. The other two alleged
accomplices face trial this summer. Mr. King, a self-declared white
supremacist said to be proud of his action, surely will appeal, but
for now he is the 452nd person on Texas' Death Row and the only
white person sentenced to die for killing a black person. The
verdict accords Mr. Byrd the human dignity every citizen deserves.
The people of Jasper have publicly declared an end to the tradition
of making the murder of black men a permissible sport. Still, this
new call to conscience does not bridge the chasm that divides us
nationwide. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STUDIES-COMMENTARY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Monday's headline,
``Working moms can quit feeling guilty, study says,'' prompted me
to launch my own study on just how many studies are out there. My
findings? 519 in the last year alone. My study also showed that if
you don't like a study, just wait a while. Another study will come
along to say just the opposite. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ With the days ticking down
toward a new millennium, it's easy to overlook how different our
lives are today compared to how Americans lived only 100 brief
years ago. Some of today's elderly mall walkers can remember when
their parents had to hitch the family horse or mule to a wagon
before they bounced their way to town to do the week's shopping.
John L. Walker of Waco can remember more. (Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ You'd think a business that has
``Alamo'' in its name would do something to celebrate Texas
Independence Day. Something. Anything. Swap chili recipes. Serve
nachos. Hurl insults at somebody from New Jersey. Whatever. But
after checking with these outfits, I found out I was wrong. About
30 businesses listed in the Austin phonebook incorporate Alamo in
their titles. I called or visited several of them, and I couldn't
find one that was whooping it up Tuesday. (Kelso, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   WALKER-COLUMN _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ As ultra-cool and cynical (not
to mention smart aleck) students of Baylor University in the 70s,
my future husband and I would often make fun of the rabid alumni
who returned to campus, decked out in green and gold from head to
toe. Most delightful were the dignified gentlemen in dark green
slacks sporting a gold stripe up the seams and a matching gold
jacket. Ahem. Paul and I returned last week, more than a little
hopeful that our second child might choose to attend our alma
mater. We discovered with our first that you truly reap what you
sow. (Walker, Longview News-Journal) MOVED.

   PEOPLE-BIRTHDAY _ People, the ``mother of all human interest
magazines,'' turns 25 years old Friday (March 5). It's the magazine
that most shrewdly anticipated and capitalized on our national
obsession with celebrity. People was a punchline in ``The Big
Chill,'' when it served as an emblem for empty fluff (''It's just
good investigative journalism'' deadpanned Jeff Goldblum, who
played a People reporter), but, in fact, has expertly gauged what
we want to read about. With 33 million readers and spinoffs such as
InStyle and Teen People going strong, and ongoing expansion into

JULIAN LENNON ``Did you intend to come back with another album?''
An emphatic ``No'' is the quick answer from Julian Lennon, the
once-shy son of Beatles icon John and his first wife, Cynthia. The
new album, ``Photograph Smile,'' is a triumph of grit and
perseverance for a Lennon who was considered finished in the eyes
of the industry. Julian is not afraid to lash out at the business,
nor to criticize Yoko Ono for what he perceives as diminishing his
role in the Lennon legacy. By Steve Morse. BPI. 1,100 words +
photo. 3. SCHOOL OF JACQUOT ``All stories are about the masks that
people wear to reveal or to conceal certain aspects of the rapport
between men and women,'' says French director Benoit Jacquot. He is
gaining bigger and bigger audiences at home and abroad for quirky
films that deal with the profound moments of personal
relationships, revealing what makes some work and others
dysfunction. By Dan Yakir. BPI. 800 words + photo. 4. ALANIS
MORISSETTE Alanis Morissette, who is far better known as the rock
singer who sold 28 million copies of her album ``Jagged Little
Pill,'' went to Calcutta and spent a day helping the sick and
infirm at a healing centre run by Mother Teresa's Missionaries of
Charity. She came back from India and wrote and recorded her single
``Thank U,'' which distills some of her spiritual learning. By
changing from the simpler girl/boy subject matter of the first
album to more complex spiritual issues, Morissette knows that she
has lost some of her listeners, especially the younger ones. By
Steve Morse. 1,200 words + photo. 5. MISS MOSS Fresh from a highly
publicized sabbatical - in a London psychiatric and rehab clinic -
celebrity super-model Kate Moss discusses her revamped views on
life, work and partying hard. By Bridget Foley. From W magazine.
1,000 words + photos. 6. A REAL-LIFE ROMANTIC COMEDY Myles
Berkowitz had an acting career that was going nowhere - until he
came up with the idea to film his dates and turn the experiences
into a feature film. The result is ``20 Dates,'' a surprising,
reality-based romantic comedy that has been a hit on the festival
circuit. The movie proves that Berkowitz has the one crucial
component for Hollywood success : a willingness to go to any
extreme to make it big. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo.

seen again for years. Pfeiffer admits that acting out every
mother's worst nightmare made her heart pound. ``After doing this
movie, I never let my kids out of my sight,'' she says. By Cindy

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. recently blinked in a confrontation
with privacy advocates protesting the company's plans to ship its
newest generation of microprocessors with an embedded serial number
that could be used to identify a computer _ and by extension, its
user.
</P>
<P>
   But those on both sides of the dispute acknowledge that it was
only an initial skirmish in a wider struggle. From computers to
cellular phones to digital video players, everyday devices and
software programs are increasingly embedding telltale identifying
numbers that enable them to interact.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such digital fingerprints constitute an imminent privacy
threat or are simply part of the foundation of advanced computer
systems and networks is the subject of a growing debate between the
computer industry and privacy groups. At the heart of the argument
is a fundamental disagreement over the role of electronic anonymity
in a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups argue fiercely that the merger of computers and
the Internet has brought the specter of a new surveillance society
in which it will be difficult to find any device whose use cannot
be traced to the user. But a growing alliance of computer industry
executives, engineers, law enforcement officials and scholars
contend that absolute anonymity is not only increasingly difficult
to obtain technically but is also a potential threat to democratic
order because of the possibility of electronic crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have zero privacy _ get over it,'' Scott McNealy,
chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems, said at a recent
news conference held to introduce the company's newest software,
known as Jini, which is intended to interconnect virtually all
types of electronic devices from computers to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates contend that software like Jini, which assigns
an identification number to each device each time it connects to a
network, could be misused as networks envelop almost everyone in
society in a dense web of devices that see, hear and monitor
behavior and location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once information becomes available for one purpose there is
always pressure from other organizations to use it for their
purposes,'' said Lauren Weinstein, editor of Privacy Forum, an
on-line journal.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a programmer in Massachusetts found that identifying
numbers can easily be found in word processing and spreadsheet
files created with Microsoft's popular Word and Excel programs and
the Windows 95 and 98 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, unlike the Intel serial number, which the computer
user can conceal, the numbers used by the Microsoft programs _
found in millions of personal computers _ cannot be controlled by
the user.
</P>
<P>
   The programmer, Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap
software, a developer of computer programming tools in Cambridge,
Mass., noticed a similar feature in the Windows operating system: a
unique registration number stored on each personal computer in a
small database known as the Windows registry.
</P>
<P>
   His curiosity aroused, Smith investigated further and discovered
that the unique number on his computer that allows connection to a
the network used in most office computing systems, known as the
Ethernet, was routinely copied to each Microsoft Word or Excel
document he created.
</P>
<P>
   The number is used to create a longer number, which is known as
a globally unique identifier. It is there, he said, to enable
computer users to create sophisticated documents comprising word
processing, spreadsheet, presentation and data base information.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those functions needs a separate identity, and computer
designers have found that the Ethernet number is a convenient and
widely available unique identifier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infrastructure relies a lot on serial numbers,'' Smith
said. ``We've let the genie out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ressler, a Microsoft product manager, said that if a
computer did not have an Ethernet adaptor, then another identifying
number was generated that was likely to be unique. ``We need a big
number, which is a unique identifier,'' he said. ``If we didn't
have it, it would be impossible to make our software programs work
together across networks.''
</P>
<P>
   An increasing range of technologies have provisions for
identifying their users for either technical reasons (like
connecting to a network) or commercial ones (like determining which
ads to show to Web surfers). But engineers and network designers
argue that identity information is a vital aspect of modern
security design because it is necessary to authenticate an
individual in a network, thereby preventing fraud or intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month at the introduction of Intel's powerful Pentium III
chip, the company's executives showed more than a dozen data
security uses for the serial number contained electronically in
each of the chips, ranging from limiting access to protecting
documents or software against piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chip maker, recently backed down
somewhat after it was challenged by privacy advocates over the
identity feature, agreeing to ship at least some of the processors
for the consumer market in a way that requires the user to activate
the feature.
</P>
<P>
   Far from scaling back its vision, however, Intel said it was
planning an even-wider range of features in its chips to help
companies protect copyrighted materials. It also pointed to
software applications that would use the embedded number to
identify participants in electronic chat rooms on the Internet and
thereby protect children against Internet stalkers.
</P>
<P>
   But in achieving those goals, it would also create a universal
identifier, which could be used by software applications to track
computer users wherever they surfed on the World Wide Web. And
that, despite the chip maker's assertions that it is working to
enhance security and privacy, has led some privacy advocates to
taunt the giant chip maker and accuse it of pursuing a ``Big
Brother Inside'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that by uniquely identifying each computer it will
make it possible for marketers or government and law enforcement
officials to track the activities of anyone connected to a computer
network more closely. They also say that such a permanent
identifier could be used in a similar fashion to the data known as
``cookies'' that are placed on a computer's hard drive by Web sites
to track the comings and goings of Internet surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's decision to forge ahead with identity features in its
chip technology may signal a turning point in the battle over
privacy in the electronic age. Until now, privacy concerns have
generally put industry executives on the defensive. Now questions
are being raised about whether there should be limits to privacy in
an Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Brandeis' definition of privacy was `the right to be
left alone,' not the right to operate in absolute secrecy,'' said
Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for the Future in Menlo
Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley engineers and executives have responded that
the Intel critics are being naive and have failed to understand
that all devices connected to computer networks require
identification features simply to function correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they note that identifying numbers have for more than
two decades been a requirement for any computer connected to an
Ethernet network. (Although still found most widely in office
settings, Ethernet connections are increasingly being used for
high-speed Internet service in the home via digital telephone lines
and cable modems.)
</P>
<P>
   For example, all of Apple Computer's popular iMac machines come
with an Ethernet network connection that has a unique permanent
number installed in the factory. The number is used to identify the
computer to the local network.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ethernet number is not broadcast over the Internet at
large, it could easily be discovered by any software application
like a Web browser and transmitted to a remote Web site tracking
the identities of its users, a number of computer engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they sau that other kinds of networks require identity
numbers to protect against fraud. Each cellular telephone currently
has two numbers. One is the telephone number, which can easily be
changed. But a second number, known an electronic serial number, is
permanently put in place at the factory to protect against theft or
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The serial number is accessible to the cellular telephone
network, and as cellular telephones add Internet browsing and
electronic mail capabilities, it will potentially have the same
identity capability as the Intel processor serial number.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include Divx DVD disks, which come with serial
numbers that permit tracking the use of each movie by a centralized
network recording system managed by the companies that sell the
disks.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say that as the line between communications
and computing becomes increasingly blurred, every electronic device
will require some kind of identification to attach to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Making those numbers available to networks that need to pass
information or to find a mobile user and at the same time denying
the information to those who wish to gather information into vast
databases may be an impossible task.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates argue that even if isolated numbers may look
harmless, they are actually harbingers of a trend toward
ever-more-invasive surveillance networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we can do to actually minimize the collection of
personal data is good,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of three groups that are
attempting to organize a boycott against Intel's chips.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are worried that in the future the government will
require ever more invasive hardware modifications to keep track of
individuals. Already they point to the 1994 Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires that telephone
companies modify their network switches to make it easier for
government wiretappers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also, the Federal Communications Commission is now developing
regulations that in the future will require every cellular
telephone to have the capability to report its precise location for
``911'' emergency calls. Privacy groups are worried that this
feature will be used as a tracking technology by law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate danger is that the government will mandate that
each chip have special logic added'' to track identities in
cyberspace, said Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist at San Diego
State University. ``We're on a slide in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinge is the author of ``True Names,'' a science fiction novel
in the early 1980's, that forecast a world in which anonymity in
computer networks is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives insist that their chip is being misused by
privacy groups that have distorted the value of the identifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start building security architecture into our
chips, and this is the first step,'' said Pat Gelsinger, Intel vice
president and general manager of desktop products. ``The
discouraging part of this is our objective is to accomplish
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That quandary _ that it is almost impossible to compartmentalize
information for one purpose so that it cannot be misused _ lies at
the heart of the argument. Moreover, providing security while at
the same time offering anonymity has long been a technical and a
political challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find ways to distinguish between security and
identity,'' said James X. Dempsey, a privacy expert at the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a Washington lobbying organization.
</P>
<P>
   So far the prospects are not encouraging. One technical solution
developed by the cryptographer David Chaum made it possible for
individuals to make electronic cash payments anonymously in a
network.
</P>
<P>
   In the system Chaum designed, a user employs a different number
with each different organization, thereby insuring that there is no
universal tracking capability.
</P>
<P>
   But while Chaum's solution has been considered ingenious, it has
failed in the marketplace. Last year, his company, Digicash Inc.,
based in Palo Alto, Calif. filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I hate it, privacy never seems to sell,'' said
Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer and a computer industry consultant.
``Those who are interested in privacy don't want to pay for it, and
those who can afford it don't care about privacy.''

BILL WOULD CURB Y2K LAWSUITS BY GRANTING 90-DAY GRACE PERIOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JUDY HOLLAND   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Orrin G. Hatch last week
introduced legislation to limit lawsuits stemming from the Y2K
computer problem, mainly by giving companies 90 days to fix any
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have warned of serious economic problems starting
Jan. 1, 2000, if computers crash or malfunction because they were
not programmed to recognize dates beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of litigation stemming from those potential glitches
could take the form of customers suing vendors for failing to
deliver a product or service.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, a potential defendant with a Y2K
problems would have 90 days to get it fixed. During that 90-day
``cooling off'' period, anyone intending to file a Y2K-related
lawsuit must first give the defendant written notice of the
problem. The defendant would then have 30 days to respond in
writing and an additional 60 days to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said the bill is intended
to prevent ``frivolous and baseless litigation, but would not
restrict an individual's right to sue to mitigate real damages.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the legislation is ``especially important to
California, where over 20 percent of the nation's hi-tech jobs are
located.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to protect people's employment in this industry, it
is necessary to have some rules,'' Feinstein said, adding that she
became involved in crafting the legislation because she was
approached by representatives of California's hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Utah and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said the bill is intended to encourage ``Y2K problem-solving rather
than a mad rush to the court house'' by imposing ``a brief
time-out,'' that would avoid litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said some experts have predicted that the world-wide cost
of Y2K-related litigation could amount to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the legislation is not intended to discourage
companies form solving Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any business that delays solving Y2K problems is putting its
entire company at risk,'' Hatch said. He said despite precautions
taken to solve Y2K glitches, ``there's still going to be myriad
problems that will arise and we want to make sure there is a legal
situation here that won't bankrupt the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Year 2000 Fairness and Responsibility Act would
require a 90-day ``cooling off period'' during which no Y2K lawsuit
could be filed. That is intended to give a company time to resolve
Y2K problems and avoid court battles.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would limit punitive damages to $250,000 or
three times the economic damages, whichever is greater.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLL0WS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill would require anyone filing a Y2K lawsuit to specify
the damages sought and exactly how they were calculated.
</P>
<P>
   It would also limit a company's liability to the proportion of
the company's fault in causing the harm, to prevent plaintiffs from
going after the wealthiest defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation was introduced Tuesday in the House by Reps.
Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., David Dreier, R-Calif., James P. Moran,
D-Va., Christopher Cox, R-Calif., Calvin Dooley, D-Calif., and
Robert ``Bud'' E. Cramer Jr., D-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The American Electronics Association, the nation's largest
hi-tech trade group representing more than 3,000 U.S.-based
technology companies, praised the legislation as ``a necessary
legal framework that employs balance and reason with a shared
responsibility to remedy any problems that may occur.''

MARKET PLACE: DRAGON SYSTEMS GETS READY FOR MARKET

 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dragon Systems, a developer of speech-recognition software in
Newton, Mass., that is scheduled to sell shares to the public
sometime in the next few weeks, is not your typical software
debutante. Its two fiftysomething founders can remember when
computers filled entire rooms, not just entire briefcases. It has
no debt, and real revenue. It even has profit.
</P>
<P>
   And it has very impressive products.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure: Early in 1997, I was hit
with a mild but stubborn case of carpal tunnel syndrome that
continues to make long typing sessions painful. As a result, this
column (and everything else I have written over the last year, from
personal letters to a nearly finished book) was written with the
help of the company's Dragon Naturally Speaking software, which
converts words spoken conversationally into a computer's microphone
into words typed on the computer's screen. In fact, I now find it
so much faster to dictate an article than to type it that I would
continue to use Dragon's product even if typing were once again a
pain-free option.
</P>
<P>
   But great products do not always add up to great investments.
Ask folks who still have a Sony Betamax in the closet. And one
cannot gauge the success of an initial public offering by the
testimonials of injured journalists.
</P>
<P>
   What Dragon Systems has besides balance-sheet strength and good
products, is a young and extremely fluid market niche that it
already shares with big scary competitors like IBM, Royal Philips
Electronics NV and Microsoft. Microsoft alone could change the
rules by simply knitting speech technology into future versions of
its ubiquitous Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has already said it is planning to include speech
capabilities in Windows 2000,'' said Peter Fleming, an industry
consultant in Watertown, Mass., although he notes that such product
bundling could invite the same kind of government scrutiny that the
giant software maker is already facing in its antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, too, is ideally situated to bundle its speech programs into
its hardware, said Jackie Fenn, a vice president at the Gartner
Group, a research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   And John Earle, president of Chant Inc., a speech-technology
software and services company in Marina del Rey, Calif., added,
``The risk, if that happens, is that no one will need a separate
application like Dragon's.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the founders of Dragon Systems had been reluctant
to face long odds, they might never have set out to turn an
ordinary personal computer into the modern equivalent of a 1950s
steno pool.
</P>
<P>
   Janet and James Baker, a married team of computer scientists,
started Dragon Systems in their living room in 1982, later telling
MIT's Technology Review magazine that they named it after the
pattern on their trousseau china. They met as graduate students at
Rockefeller University in New York in 1970 and have been working
together on speech technology ever since, including a stint at IBM
in the mid-70s.
</P>
<P>
   In Dragon's early years, Defense Department contracts and a
short-lived foray into personal computer applications kept the
company in the black, albeit on a shoestring. Then, in 1990, the
Bakers introduced Dragon Dictate, one of the first
large-vocabulary, general-purpose software products that could
convert spoken words into text on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the words had to be separated by maddening little
pauses. And with a $9,000 price tag, the product was far from a
mass-market star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hardly was any consumer market, in fact, beyond people
who were disabled and a few wealthy futurists, perhaps,'' Fleming,
the consultant, said.
</P>
<P>
   And at that point, Ms. Fenn explained, the early
voice-recognition programs from Dragon and a few competitors were
too awkward to be attractive to most corporate and institutional
customers, other than hospitals and law firms that valued the speed
of transcription enough to put up with the unnatural speech
required.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, IBM soon introduced its own program, Voice Type,
and other companies were not far behind. Suddenly, a new software
niche was up for grabs _ and it would belong, everyone knew, to the
first affordable software that could recognize natural,
conversational human speech, without the artificial pauses. That,
the scientists believed, would expand the market for speech
technology into all sorts of futuristic applications, like
telephones that dial themselves and videocassette recorders that
follow spoken instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts thought that dream was a decade away. But the
Bakers realized that the accelerating improvements in computer
speed and memory would put the prize within reach much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   While marketing new Dragon Dictate applications _ which by 1993
were generating annual revenue of $13.2 million and profit of $2.1
million _ the Bakers threw everything they had into the
continuous-speech sweepstakes. To help finance their effort, they
sold a stake of about 35 percent of the company to the computer
disk-drive maker Seagate Technology for $26.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The result, which Dragon introduced in April 1997, was Naturally
Speaking, a simple-to-use program that does indeed recognize
continuous human speech with remarkable speed and accuracy. The
product won numerous awards from trade publications including PC
World, Byte magazine and Popular Home Automation.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only then that the competition began in earnest. Even
as Naturally Speaking, with an initial retail price of $695, was
still taking its bows, IBM introduced its own lower-cost rival,
called Via Voice. Lernout &AMP; Hauspie followed with Voice Xpress. And
Philips aggressively continued to develop voice-driven corporate
applications, including the Swiss rail system's telephone
information line and Lufthansa's airline reservations system.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Dragon was forced to cut its price _ just when it was
struggling to gear up production and customer support services to
meet a tidal wave of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Some consultants in the field feared for the little company's
survival during the summer of 1997. But survive Dragon has,
improving its flagship program and introducing specialized
applications ranging from medical-transcription software _ tailored
to understand terms like ``nontransmural myocardial infarction'' _
to Naturally Speaking for Teens, which is tuned, for instance, to
know that ``Spice Girls'' should be capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The company's efforts have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1998, Dragon's revenue nearly
doubled, to $49.6 million from $26.8 million in all of 1997. And
the losses generated by the high cost of racing for the
continuous-speech prize began to shrink in 1997, to $4.9 million
from $5.3 million the year before. In the first nine months of
1998, the red ink evaporated, and Dragon saw a profit of $8.6
million, of which $4 million came from continuing operations.
</P>
<P>
   A corner of the retail software market that supported sales of
just 12,253 units as recently as 1996 had sales of 773,520 units
last year, according to the market research firm PC Data. And fully
37 percent of that 1998 market belonged to Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   But the field has ``had a lot of false springs,'' said Brian
Lewis, the editor of Speech Technology magazine in Wilton, Conn.
Moreover, the future of speech technology is unlikely to revolve
just around freestanding personal computer applications like Dragon
Systems' _ if only because such programs are too vulnerable to the
Microsoft threat.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, said Judith Markowitz, an industry consultant in
Chicago, speech technology will grow by embedding itself into
products that the laptop generation uses every day _ phones,
automated teller machines, videocassette recorders, home and office
security systems and the like.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: Lernout &AMP; Hauspie and Microsoft, an investor in
L&AMP; H, teamed up on the software that runs Clarion Corp.'s Auto PC,
a dashboard-mounted personal assistant that responds to spoken
commands.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's underwriter for its proposed stock sale is Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. With Baker now serving as chairman of
Dragon's technical advisory board, the management team is led by
Ms. Baker, as chief executive, and the president, John Shagoury.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary prospectus reports that the company is already
at work on the alliances necessary to embed Dragon's technology
into the postcomputer future. These include recently announced
pacts with Intel and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon also says it is poised to exploit the trend toward
smaller, lighter computerized devices. A laptop equipped with
voice-recognition software doesn't need a large, comfortable
keyboard. And if the speech technology is good enough, it doesn't
need a keyboard at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Bakers and Seagate Technology together will retain a
controlling interest in Dragon Systems. But the future minority
investors _ members of the public _ would be betting that this
little company's speech technology will be good enough, either on
its own or in partnership with one of the industry giants like Sun
Microsystems or Intel _ or maybe even Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, though, that the little Dragon is definitely
dancing with the elephants here. If it catches the rhythm, it could
be a star act. One misstep, and it will be a design on the carpet.

   What's the difference between reading a newspaper or magazine on
the Internet or in print? The articles tend to be the same in both
versions, and aside from saving a few dollars, the only real
difference is that one can be read on the subway and the other
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   But this is beginning to change. The number of articles written
exclusively for Web sites of newspapers and magazines is growing,
according to a study to be released Tuesday by Middleburg &AMP;
Associates, a public relations and marketing agency.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth annual Media in Cyberspace Study was based on a survey
sent to managing and business editors at 1,400 newspapers and 2,000
magazines last fall and completed by 192 newspaper editors and 170
magazine editors. The study focuses on two aspects of the
relationship between the print media and cyberspace: the elevation
of newspaper and magazine Web sites to the status of full partner
with their print counterparts and the willingness of journalists to
use the Internet to find sources and to use e-mail to get
information from them.
</P>
<P>
   The study reports that the growth in Web sites over the last
four years has been sharp. In the 1995 study, 25 percent of
respondents said that their publications had a Web site; in 1998,
that figure had more than doubled, to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And as the number of Web sites has proliferated, the amount of
original material on the sites has grown as well. Only 11 percent
of respondents who worked at magazines with Web sites said that the
sites had less than 5 percent original content, down from 27
percent in 1997. Newspaper respondents reported a drop to 22
percent from 39 percent in 1997.

<P>
   ``News organizations have clearly broken away from the trend to
use Web sites solely as a delivery tool,'' said Don Middleburg,
chairman and chief executive at Middleburg, who was co-author of
the study with Steven R. Ross, associate professor of professional
practice at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
``They've begun treating them as a new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the growing use of multimedia elements _ mainly audio
and video recordings _ on Web sites as the prime example of this;
nearly a third of the respondents said that their publications
integrate multimedia material into Web articles.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists working at these publications are also making a
greater use of the Internet. A majority said the most important
information they find on it is contact information. But once they
have that information, journalists are still relying on
old-fashioned methods for evaluating the trustworthiness of
sources; most of the respondents said they would rather see the
face or at least hear the voice of a new source before exchanging
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   After that initial meeting though, many preferred e-mail to a
phone call or lunch date.

   Praise From `60 Minutes'
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' attracted a
burst of attention with an interview in which Kathleen Willey, a
former White House volunteer, accused President Clinton of making
unwelcome sexual advances toward her in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, ``60 Minutes'' drew volleys of criticism for not
checking Ms. Willey's background thoroughly enough, as other news
organizations reported inconsistencies in her various accounts,
along with reports that she had been pursuing a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, NBC News had an exclusive interview in
which Juanita Broaddrick, a former Arkansas campaign volunteer,
accused Clinton of unwanted sexual advances _ indeed, of rape _ 21
years earlier. In this case, the TV network attracted criticism
from some quarters for ``suppressing'' the interview, as NBC brass
spent weeks double-checking Mrs. Broaddrick's account.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, ``Dateline NBC'' executives did not want a Kathleen
Willey-type boomerang flying back in their faces. Even after the
interview ran last Wednesday night, some critics said Mrs.
Broaddrick's uncorroborated, 21-year-old account and her motives
for disliking President Clinton were such that it should not have
been broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ``60
Minutes,'' who ordinarily criticizes the standards of ``Dateline''
at the drop of a hat, think this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Dateline' did a very creditable job,'' he said.
``They checked it out, and they put in the caveats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she telling truth?'' he added. ``I don't know. If I didn't
know his track record for wagging a finger at the American people
and lying to them on national television, I might have taken what
she said with a grain of salt. But as it is, I agree with Patricia
Ireland: If it's a `he says, she says' story, he ain't got a very
good track record on that subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ireland, the president of the National Organization of
Women, made a statement along those lines Thursday, when asked
about Mrs. Broaddrick's story.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Willey and Broaddrick cases, President Clinton
issued statements denying the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his praise for NBC's due diligence in checking its
story, did Hewitt have second thoughts about his own handling of
the Willey interview? He said he had ``no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All Kathleen Willey said to Ed Bradley was exactly what she
had told a grand jury under oath,'' he said.

NEW DATA PIPELINE HOLDS PROMISE OF A BETTER INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The promise of a super-fast, highly reliable
Internet moved a step closer to reality last week when three dozen
universities across the United States were linked to a new national
research network that moves data 1,600 times faster than the T-1
lines that universities and businesses use today.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of the new data pipeline, known as the Abilene
Network, were highlighted Wednesday night in a ceremony at
Washington's Union Station that included a demonstration of remote
surgery in which doctors collaborated over the network while
hundreds of miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to telemedicine, applications that require huge data
pipelines include interactive distance learning, digital libraries,
multimedia entertainment and even tornado forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between motion pictures and flipping
through the pages of a book,'' said Guy K. Cook, vice president of
Internet services for Qwest Communications of Denver, one of the
companies that helped develop the network.
</P>
<P>
   Spanning more than 10,000 miles, the $500 million Abilene
Network links 37 universities at 2.4 billion bits, or gigabits, per
second. One of a half dozen next-generation Internet networks
developed by the privately financed Internet 2 consortium and the
federal government in recent years, Abilene is faster than all but
a few highly experimental government networks. By the end of 1999,
it is expected to link more than 60 research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   For now, access to Abilene is limited to academics and other
professionals, but experts believe that consumers will begin
realizing its benefits in a few years. Professional and research
applications demonstrated Wednesday night will open the way for
technologies that will, for example, enable home computer users to
rent and view films online.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important long-term impact is the promise of a
thoroughly reliable Internet, said Douglas Van Houweling of the
University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development, which
oversees Internet 2 projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, since the Internet is a best-effort network, you
can't be sure when you log on and use it whether or not it's going
to work very well,'' he said. ``If the Internet is going to fulfill
its promises for the future, you have to be able to count on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Named after a seminal railroad founded in the 1860s, the Abilene
Network was developed with a total investment of $500 million in
equipment and services from Qwest, Cisco Systems Inc., Nortel
Networks and Indiana University.

EXPERT TO HELP DEVISE FORMAT FOR DELIVERING MUSIC ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recording industry, anxious for a way to move safely and
profitably into the era of Internet delivery of music, has taken a
major step by putting an influential digital architect in charge of
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   At a seven-hour, closed-door meeting of 200 top executives in
the music and technology industries, Leonardo Chiariglione was
named on Friday to head the Secure Digital Music Initiative. The
group is seeking to create a technical format for the copyrighted
sale and digital delivery of music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Chiariglione, an Italian researcher, was instrumental in
creating the industry-standard formats for converting and
compressing video and audio information into digital form, known as
MPEG.
</P>
<P>
   The Secure Digital Music Initiative, announced in December, is
an attempt by the recording industry associations of North America,
Japan and Europe to create a standardized way to distribute songs
and albums on the Internet. The technical challenge is to do so in
a way that protects copyright holders and foils the many audio
pirates who copy and distribute digital music illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, one of the MPEG formats that Chiariglione helped
create, MP3, has become the favorite way for Internet pirates to
copy and transmit music. So the music industry, in essence, has
recruited the man who opened the Pandora's box of Internet piracy
to ask him to close it.
</P>
<P>
   After his selection at Friday's meeting, Chiariglione startled
many in the audience by announcing an ambitious timetable, one that
may confound the many Internet skeptics who have derided the
secure-music initiative as coming too late to turn back the
free-music tide. He said he planned to have preliminary standards
on paper by June to ensure that an industry-backed format would be
approved in time to let recording companies start using it to sell
music online by Christmas and to enable electronics companies to
have compatible devices ready to play the newly formatted songs.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, it took an equivalent standards group five years
to develop a format for recording and playing back audio on the new
generation of DVD disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told that in six months they'd have a result, I
didn't think it was possible,'' said Marina Bosi, who attended
Friday's conference. She is president of the Audio Engineering
Society and one of the creators of AAC _ a higher-fidelity sequel
to MP3. ``But knowing the background that Chiariglione is bringing
to this process I think there's a chance this might happen,'' she
said, although she added a note of caution: ``It's a very tough
schedule, and we're talking about meetings every two weeks. Just
the travel alone is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conference attendee, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the enormity of the task ahead became apparent to
him the night before the meeting, after he drew up a list of 14
variables _ including problems posed by removable personal computer
hard drives, the new challenges of cable modems and the onslaught
of portable devices for playing the music. Each of the 14 issues
could require its own subcommittee, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   And even Chiariglione acknowledged that there was a considerable
amount of work to be done in a relatively short time. ``We have to
integrate a range of technologies that was probably never attempted
before by anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chiariglione is an executive at the corporate research center of
Telecom Italia, working there since 1971. Although known as an
eccentric leader, he is a relentless taskmaster and a stickler for
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he founded the industry's MPEG committee, which
standardized not only MPEG-1 and MP3 but also the newer MPEG-4,
which has a built-in copyright protection system. The committee is
now at work on MPEG-7, which will have built-in capabilities for
letting users search for specific audio or video information within
a file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for one of the handful of people in the world
who would be able to pull together an effort as ambitious as this
one that would enable the kinds of future business models we all
are interested in pursuing,'' said Cary Sherman, the general
counsel of the Recording Industry Association of America, who led
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Chiariglione's selection as head of the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, whose members are paying $10,000 a year to participate,
suddenly makes him an even more influential man: Companies with
technologies that end up being incorporated into the standard
format stand to make millions simply from patent royalties or
licensing fees.
</P>
<P>
   Internet anarchists, pirates and utopians have been predicting
that the delivery of music on the Internet would put record labels
out of business. Their vision seemed to be confirmed late last year
when the industry began a series of lawsuits motivated out of fear
_ blocking bands like the Beastie Boys from putting MP3 files of
their music online, for example, and unsuccessfully suing Diamond
Technologies, which put the first portable Walkman-like MP3 player
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But attendees at the meeting, who saw presentations about
Internet business models by the heads of technology at Universal
Music and BMG Music, said that the record labels now seemed to have
a focused notion of what must be done to help the industry migrate
successfully from the CD era to the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the music business, however, were less enthralled by
the meeting. These critics saw it as a step forward for the record
industry but a move backward for a long-nurtured Internet dream. In
that vision, artists have seen the Internet as a way for their
music to reach fans directly; as a way for fans to get music at
lower prices because there are no materials costs for transmitting
music online, and as a way for musicians to get a bigger share of
the profits from their work by avoiding the record-label middle
man.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Crowley, who runs the Massachusetts Music Industry
Coalition, a national artist's rights organization, noted the
absence of musicians and artists at Friday's meeting. ``It's
probably the only chance artists have had in 30 years to gain back
some ground,'' she said. ``But the RIAA is going to beat them to it
if they don't take some control.''
</P>
<P>
   And won't some pirates feel betrayed that the person who helped
open the Internet to music fans is now trying to restrain it for
big business? Maybe. But Chiariglione said he never set out to abet
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   When the initial standards were set for MPEG, home recording
devices for digital piracy did not exist. But now piracy is a
primary concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the technology to be put to good use,'' Chiariglione said,
``you have to create a boundary.''

TINY BE INC. CALLS MICROSOFT'S BLUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, the burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the tiny software company Be Inc. briefly came into
focus at the Microsoft antitrust trial, when a Microsoft executive
asserted that Be could soon become a major competitor to his
company. No matter that Microsoft controls some 90 percent of the
personal computer operating system market and Be has virtually no
market share.
</P>
<P>
   With publicity nine-10ths of the law, Be's flamboyant founder
and chairman, Jean-Louis Gassee, has come up with a novel way to
test Microsoft's hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   In a column posted on Be's Web site on Thursday, Gassee made a
proposal to any computer maker willing to confront Microsoft's
stringent licensing requirements: His company will license its Be
operating system free for one year to any computer maker willing to
install it on new machines and make it an option for buyers to
select the first time they switch on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Gassee said that he had had no takers, despite several
``nibbles,'' but that he was discussing the idea with at least one
major PC maker, which he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles to his challenge appear to be formidable. But that
may be the point.
</P>
<P>
   Gassee described in his column how one computer maker has loaded
the Be operating system on its computers. But he said that the
manufacturer, which he did not identify in the column, has noted
this fact only deep in the accompanying documentation because the
company interpreted Microsoft's licensing provisions to bar
non-Microsoft systems from being displayed during the start-up
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to expose something that has been right under my
nose for years,'' said Gassee, who ran Apple Computer's hardware
business before founding Be in 1990 in Menlo Park, Calif.
``Microsoft wants to smother the baby in the cradle.''

   Linux.com Doesn't Go to the Highest Bidder
</P>
<P>
   When Fred Van Kempen registered the linux.com Internet domain in
June 1994, nobody but a handful of programmers around the world had
heard of Linux _ the precocious software operating system, written
by a graduate student named Linus Torvalds and released free on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as the Linuxworld trade show opens in San Jose, Calif.,
the program has begun to pose real competition to the Unix and
Windows NT operating systems that dominate the market for business
computing. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that Van Kempen, who
now works as a network engineer for a consulting firm in the
Netherlands, says he has received 500 e-mail messages in the last
six months asking if the linux.com domain is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Van Kempen plans to announce that he is selling the
domain to VA Research, a start-up in Mountain View, Calif., that
sells and supports Linux systems for business enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Van Kempen said in an interview Sunday, was not the
highest bidder. But then, as seems to be the inexplicable norm
among many involved in Linux, money was not his main objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure no one could take it and make it into
some commercial playground,'' said Van Kempen, who wrote much of
the early networking code for Linux. ``I don't really need the
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Kempen declined to say how much VA Research is paying. He
said the company plans to make linux.com into a clearinghouse for
Linux information for the growing base of commercial users. He and
several other representatives from the Linux community will serve
on a board that will monitor the site.

   Cars, Sex and Stocks on One Web Site
</P>
<P>
   For some people, few things are as sexy as a new Internet stock.
At least that's the assumption of Joseph Preston, a 28-year-old
entrepreneur in Bethesda, Md. Preston plans to file documents with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday stating his
intention to raise $7.5 million in a stock offering for Efox.net.
</P>
<P>
   The business, he said in an interview, will be an
electronic-commerce Web site that focuses on ``the heterosexual
man's favorite pursuits: ladies, automobiles, sports, and stocks.''
He said the women who pose provocatively for his site _ the ``eye
candy,'' he calls them _ will each be paid with 500 shares of
Efox.net stock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in this realm, air-brushed surfaces can be deceiving.
The company is only a month old, and its Web site right now is
little more than a come-hither home page. To date, Preston has
raised only about $100,000 for the operation from private
investors. And he plans to dispense with the usual step of finding
an investment banker by underwriting the stock issue himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a market where companies raise millions and millions with
decidedly less sexy topics like books, Internet broadcasting and
online access, Preston's venture raises the question: Why hasn't
anyone yet married Internet sex and the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   Sex, as a business proposition, does not necessarily magnetize
the average investment banker, said Mark Hardie, senior analyst
with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who is skeptical about
Preston's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Adult-themed sites are among the few that actually make money on
the Internet. But they are risky business as far as the financial
community is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going public is about convincing a host of risk-averse
financial service firms who manage the assets of retirees to plunk
down tens of millions of dollars on a porn business,'' Hardie said.

TWO ALLIANCES AIM TO CREATE PC ALTERNATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two separate industry alliances to be announced Monday share a
similar target: creating alternatives to the personal computer _
and to Microsoft Corp.'s operating systems _ for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In one announcement, IBM, Motorola, Sun Microsystems, Lucent and
10 other companies have agreed to create a new set of standards
based on Sun's Java programming language to interconnect a next
generation of smart devices ranging from computers and cell phones
to washing machines and dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate deal, the regional telephone company U S West and
Network Computer Inc., a spinoff from the database software giant
Oracle Systems, plan to announce a schedule for trials of a new
service to be named AT-TV which will integrate the telephone, the
television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the new service will compete with both Microsoft's
WebTV and the At-Home cable modem service. Although the timing of
At-TV's availability has not been announced, U S West executives
said that trials would begin later this year and that commercial
service would begin in the 14 states the company serves before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the first U.S. success for NCI, which has made
progress in the interactive set-top box business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``NCI has been trying for a long time to find a domestic deal,''
said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm
based in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said that the U S West trials would be carefully
watched because the new service offered an interesting twist in the
long-held goal of merging the telephone and the television into a
single, interactive device.
</P>
<P>
   U S West executives said that the new system would employ Caller
ID technology to display the name of a caller on the television
screen and give the viewer the option of accepting the call on a
speaker-phone built in to the NCI set-top box. The set-top box
would also store an electronic phone book and would enable a
television viewer to make phone calls without picking up a
telephone handset.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to leave your couch, said Jeffrey Kagan, a
telecommunications industry analyst. ``This is the long-awaited
blending of different technologies, and it should be a natural fit
for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   U S West executives said they would release pricing information
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The new Java alliance is a technology partnership to be called
the Open Service Gateway Specification. In addition to IBM, Sun,
Motorola and Lucent, participants include Alcatel, Cable &AMP;
Wireless, Enron Communications, Ericsson, Network Computer Inc.,
Nortel Networks, Oracle Corp., Philips Electronics, Sybase Corp.
and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   The standard is in part an effort to pull together the
proliferating consumer electronics networking standards, which
currently consist of an alphabet soup of code names and acronyms
like Bluetooth, CAL, CEBus, HAVi, HomePNA, HomePnP, HomeRF, Jini
and VESA.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said standards like Open Service Gateway
Specification are needed because existing telephone and power
networks in the home are being transformed into data networks to
link increasingly intelligent appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a shift of focus toward a broader range of
intelligent devices, some of which we won't think of as computers
at all,'' said Mark Bregman, general manager of IBM's pervasive
computing division.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted a generation of home appliances like a washing
machine that would come with an LCD panel and a Web browser. Such
appliances would in the future be able to communicate with the
Internet and with other gadgets in the home, possibly over the
home's electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects consumers to surf the Web while they wash
their clothes, such systems would enable manufacturers to directly
diagnose and update appliances via the Internet, he said. However,
he also acknowledged that such powerful capabilities would also
raise new security challenges.

U.S. INQUIRY CAUSES EBAY STOCK TO FALL

<P>
   The online auction site Ebay, which has already gained the
attention of New York City consumer officials, now says it is under
federal investigation for ``possible illegal transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a terse release about the inquiry late
Friday, withholding details about the substance ``to protect the
investigations,'' but saying that it was ``fully cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   It said an unspecified branch of the federal government
requested company documents on Jan. 29.

down $11 from Friday.

   Two weeks ago, Ebay announced that it would ban the sale of
firearms on the site, effective this Friday. That move came in
response to a report that weapon sales, governed in the off-line
world by a complex set of rules that differ from state to state,
were impossible to monitor in the geographically boundless online
community.

   Officials at the company have also confirmed in recent weeks
that they are cooperating with the New York City Department of
Consumer Affairs, which is investigating accusations of fraudulent
activity on the part of a seller of sports memorabilia through
Ebay.

ADOBE'S NEW PAGE-LAYOUT PROGRAM CHALLENGES QUARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Adobe Systems Inc.'s shares hit a four-year
low last year, Quark Inc. floated an informal, and unwelcome, offer
to buy the company. On Tuesday, Adobe will return the favor with
the introduction of a new program long known by its code name, K2,
now called InDesign, but referred to by nearly everyone in the
publishing industry as the Quark-killer.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe executives do not use that term themselves, but they make
no bones about attacking Quark in its core market for high-end page
layout software. Rather than an update of Adobe's familiar
Pagemaker program, InDesign is an entirely new product, the
company's first in five years. Adobe contends that the program
offers greater flexibility than Pagemaker or Quark, while providing
tighter integration with Photoshop and Illustrator, its
market-leading programs for processing photos and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adobe's shares fell $2.8125 on Friday to close at
$40.25 amid a general selloff of technology shares, they remain
well above September's low of $23.625, as improved revenue and
earnings have lent credibility to the company's turnaround effort.
Monday, shares dropped another 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called InDesign an impressive product that should add
to Adobe's revenues later this year, but they said such programs
were often adopted slowly.
</P>
<P>
   InDesign is scheduled to ship in late spring, with versions for
the Macintosh, Windows NT and Windows 98, at an estimated retail
price of $699. Adobe is shipping an updated version of Pagemaker,
version 6.5 Plus, available March 15, at $499, or $99 for upgrades
from previous versions. Adobe is also rolling out new versions of
GoLive, the Web authoring tool it acquired earlier this year, and
Acrobat, its software for producing so-called portable documents,
which can be read on any system.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing world has long been split between integrated
systems, from companies like Atex and SII, which typically run on
minicomputers or mainframes, and desktop systems, like Quark and
Pagemaker, which run on Macintoshes, personal computers and
PC-based servers. Adobe is positioning InDesign as a kind of bridge
between these two worlds, designed to stand on its own in smaller
installations, or to be bundled with integrated systems for larger
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have been testing so-called alpha and beta versions of
InDesign for a year, and John Warnock, Adobe's chairman and chief
executive, said he had no doubt it was partly the product's
visibility that prompted last year's overture from Quark. ``They
see a freight train coming their way,'' he said. ``They saw our
stock price as low, so why not try to knock it out with a
pre-emptive offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Gill, Quark's founder and chairman, said it was the
combination of the stock price and existing products, not InDesign,
that attracted his attention. ``I had forgotten about K2 when we
did the offer, which doesn't mean plenty of people didn't remind me
about it,'' he said. ``There are a couple of features it has that
are really neat, and a lot of features that have been in Quark
Express for some time. I assume they're going to do a good job, but
I don't think we're going to lose market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Two characteristics distinguish InDesign from previous page
layout programs, one of which will be evident to any user, the
other more important to developers who want to add capabilities to
the program.
</P>
<P>
   First, InDesign can work with any images created in Photoshop or
Illustrator, which saves an intermediate step of exporting a
picture or a graphic to some generic format, and allows much
greater manipulation without exiting the program. InDesign's user
interface is identical to that of Photoshop and Illustrator, so it
will look and work in familiar ways.
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers, including Quark shops, already use Photoshop
and Illustrator, said Jay Vleeschhouwer, a computer industry
analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The target market for K2 is one
which Adobe has a lot of familiarity with, and which is already
using its other products,'' he said. ``Adobe will not be coming to
these high-end users as an unknown quantity by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, unlike Pagemaker and Quark, whose
architectures date to the 1980s, InDesign was written using modern
modular software design. The core program occupies just 1.6
megabytes, a fraction of the computer memory demanded by most
desktop applications these days, and all major functions are
performed by plug-ins, as on a Web browser. This means that Adobe
can add or upgrade portions of the program easily, but, more
importantly, that third parties can easily add value to InDesign by
creating custom plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can as a developer use the components of K2 and integrate it
very tightly into a true newspaper work flow system,'' said Don
Oldham, president of Digital Technology International, in
Springville, Utah, a leading system integrator for the newspaper
industry. ``The thing that Adobe has done that Quark doesn't is to
open their development environment to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the plug-in capability and the integration with Photoshop
and Illustrator appeal to Jeffrey Fulton, technology director for
Time Inc.'s Business Information Group, which has been testing
InDesign for a year. With Quark, you always had to ``plan your work
so that you had all your image work done before you went to page
layout,'' he said. ``People are just fed up with Quark Express, so
that they're ready for something really new,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Adobe needed developers like Digital
Technology if it was to meet Quark head on. ``Because Adobe doesn't
have all of the pieces yet, they need to get these other developers
to support them,'' said Mark Walters, editor of The Seybold Report
on Internet Publishing. ``The plug-in architecture is critical to
attracting the mass of developers that have been following Quark.
The product has a strong feature set, but by itself that isn't
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Good technology is not enough either, said Suzanne Snygg, an
analyst with Dataquest. ``The biggest issue for Adobe is the matter
of standards. Once you commit to a program like Quark Express,
companies and people are reluctant to change, just because of the
pain factor,'' she said. ``Just because a product is best doesn't
mean people will change.''

THE FUTURE IS NOW FOR Y2K TRADING TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street is going back to the future. On Saturday,
about 400 brokerage firms, banks, exchanges and other institutions
will push the clocks on their computers forward to Dec. 29 as the
first stage in a full-scale test of their readiness to trade
stocks, bonds and other securities in the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in July, when a core group of 28 Wall Street firms
performed a trial run, the meticulously scripted tests will cover
the first trades to settle in the new year, including options that
expire Jan. 22. Because the $270 billion securities industry has
been a pacesetter in dealing with potential Year 2000 computer
problems and the July experiment went well, any major disruptions
found in the tests would puncture recent optimism that banks,
utilities and other critical parts of the business infrastructure
can make the transition to next year without significant
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the longtime practice of
programming dates in computers with two digits for the year, like
99 for 1999. Some computers and software interpret 00 as 1900
instead of 2000 and others cannot interpret 00 at all, leading to
crashes or faulty data.
</P>
<P>
   Securities companies began dealing with such problems sooner
than most, partly because the need to handle long-term loans and
bonds had alerted them to the hazards of two-digit coding. Domestic
securities firms will end up spending $5 billion to correct the
problems, according to the Securities Industry Association, which
has been coordinating correction and testing efforts since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of tests will cost the association about $10
million and the participants as much as $100 million, according to
Donald Kittell, executive vice president of the association. About
5,000 people will be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dress rehearsal for the real event,'' Kittell said.
``We expect to come through with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to involving many more brokers and much higher
volumes than the trial run in July, the new tests will add about 30
large and small pension fund managers and other institutional
investors into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are representing thousands of buy-side institutions, and
we have worked hard to get a representative sample,'' said John
Panchery, the association's Year 2000 project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference with July _ and the reason the tests will run
only on Saturdays from March 6 through April 24 _ is that many
participants will be using the computers they rely on for daily
operations, not the separate systems set up especially for testing
that were used in the trial run.
</P>
<P>
   The tests will start with mock trades that would be made on Dec.
29, 1999, and settled on Jan. 3, the first business day in the year
2000. On March 13, the test scripts will switch to Dec. 30 and the
following Saturday to Dec. 31. The most crucial day in the test,
Jan. 3, 2000, will be tested on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The testing cycles will end on the following two Saturdays with
a simulation of Jan. 4, 2000, a date that mutual funds need to
completely exercise their processing systems, and a simulation of
Jan. 22, 2000, the first date in the new year when options will
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the industry could still run into problems even if
the tests go flawlessly. To start with, there are many other
potentially disruptive dates, especially Feb. 29, 2000, a leap day
that many programs do not recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing was to test an entire trading cycle
over several days,'' Panchery said. Collectively testing individual
days like Feb. 29 would be too expensive and complicated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the securities industry is setting a group testing
standard that most others cannot hope to duplicate. Electric
companies, for example, are planning a major test in April that
will simulate various disruptions so that companies can see how
well prepared they are to cope with them in a coordinated fashion,
but they will not touch the systems that are actually generating
power and controlling the grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to run a test of multiple utilities of any
size and still have enough backup facilities to serve customers if
something trips up,'' said Eugene F. Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the
National Energy Reliability Council.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the power industry is relying on tests by individual
utilities of their power plants and control systems and on small
joint tests, such as an effort later this month (March) involving
Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey; the organizations
that control distribution of power in New York and the mid-Atlantic
states, along with AT&AMP;T and Bell Atlantic, which are the key
suppliers of vital communications links to the utilities.

Let software do its job in helping you do yours 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last we talked, my computer was beset by the Happy99
virus/worm, which was being passed back and forth on one of my
mailing lists like a cold in a grade school class.
</P>
<P>
   If you just tuned in, and don't spend much time on the Internet,
Happy99 is a relatively benign virus in that it doesn't destroy
anything. It mainly wriggles into your Internet software and joins
every message you send as an attachment. You, however, are unware
of this until you begin getting angry messages from your e-mail
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Like any virus, it is an executable program, and isn't supposed
to work at all unless you execute it. To the best of my knowledge,
I never did that, but the thing suddenly turned into a kind of hand
grenade; every time it came wafting into my computer by way of
e-mail, as soon as it was downloaded, it caused the computer to
seize up.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I erase it by any normal means; only Norton AntiVirus
was able to get rid of it. And I had to use a painfully slow
Web-based mail program to get into my mailbox and throw it out.
Eventually, it dawned on me that Norton ought to be able to catch
the thing creeping into my system and stomp on it right there.
</P>
<P>
   So, going into the Norton configuration program, I changed a
couple of settings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of telling it to alert me when it found a virus, it was
ordered to delete the thing on sight. And instead of examining only
.EXE files, it was told to examine everything.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure which of these changes did the trick _ maybe both
were required _ but upon downloading a group of messages which I
knew contained the virus somewhere, everything went fine. No
lockup. Upon examining the messages, the Happy99.exe attachment
brought in by one of them was covered with a bright red X.
</P>
<P>
   I relate this mainly as a lesson in trying to make a program do
something you think it ought to be able to do. It doesn't always
work, but nowadays programs are so flexible and have so many
user-changeable parameters, it's always worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is my recent test drive of Explorer. It wasn't
presenting pictures and other images at Web sites I knew had
graphics. A quick check showed it was set to refuse graphics to
speed up operations. This, however archaic, was apparently the
default setting.
</P>
<P>
   If incidentally, you have executed the Happy99 virus, it's not
hard to get rid of. There are lots of places on the Web with
instructions, among them http://www.geocities.com
</P>
<P>
   /SiliconValley/Heights/3652
</P>
<P>
   /SKA.HTM.
</P>
<P>
   During all the unHappy furor, I installed the latest upgrade to
Eudora Pro, the outstanding e-mail program published by Qualcomm. I
had been using Version 3.0; the latest is 4.1. It's a very
worthwhile upgrade. The program hasn't changed drastically, but
lots of things work better. The main screen is divided into two
windows now. The top window shows a list of your mail, and merely
by bringing the cursor to any message, the text appears instantly
in the lower window. No more tiresome double-clicking, and the
presentation is much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Eudora now makes the mail available in batches. If
you have 200 messages waiting, it gives them to you 20 or so at a
time so you don't have to wait for the entire mailbox to download
so you can begin reading. I have yet to see a mail program I like
as well.

CompuServe2000 enters the present 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, there was an online service called CompuServe.
It was ugly, clunky and hard to use. Pricing varied across the
service, so a few hours on CompuServe could cost a fortune if you
ventured into certain areas or forums. To top it off, CompuServe
didn't give its users screen names _ it gave them numbers, numbers
randomly assigned and impossible to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Then came America Online, which was easier to use, offered
uniform pricing and allowed users to have names instead of numbers.
To make a long story short, AOL blew CompuServe out of the water
and eventually acquired the company in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   AOL immediately set to work giving CompuServe a makeover
designed to make it more appealing, more sophisticated _ and more
like AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Now called CompuServe2000, the revamped service launched this
week. It's sleek, it's cheap ($9.95 a month for 20 hours) and it's
jam-packed with news from brand-name partners like The New York
Times, CNet, Marketwatch and WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe2000 looks like AOL's bookish older brother. If you
can find your way around AOL, you'll have no trouble with
CompuServe. The familiar AOL menu bar retooled for CompuServe is in
cool green-and-blue tones with slick pull-down menu bars. News
pages are packed with links to national and international articles
from a variety of sources. Members get to select screen names
rather than receive a randomly assigned number.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is a mass market, family-oriented site. CompuServe is more
adult, more business-oriented,'' says CompuServe Chief Operating
Officer Audrey Weil, one of the executives brought over from AOL to
drag CompuServe into the 21st century. ``The CompuServe user
doesn't surf the Web,'' Weil says. ``They want to find information,
get on and get off.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is not the place to be if you just want to send
instant messages to your friends after school or talk about
Leonardo DiCaprio in a chat room. Instead, the talk is more
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place for colleagues to chat with each other,'' Weil
says. The service is aggressively pursuing users with specific
specialities such as physicians, pilots, lawyers, journalists and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Weil, CompuServe2000 will not compete with AOL but
will complement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key things for AOL Inc. is to have multiple brands
in cyberspace,'' she says. For all its great success _ the one
thing AOL has never been able to do well is attract business users
and the pocket-protector set who have been fans of CompuServe for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe is confident its new look will also attract new
users, who need and want information but don't want to bother with
search engines, URLs, portals, pornography, hackers and other
perceived hazards of the Web. Weil says of the 17 million new users
logging on every year, more than half are adults looking for an
online service that's customized, easy to use and offers high-speed
access.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe is an inexpensive alternative delivered in a format
many users are already familiar with and has content partners that
are already big-name Web players anyway. CompuServe is a kind of
``Web lite,'' offering novice users instant access to information
and community. However, the service does have Web access for users
who do want to venture onto the Web just as AOL does, and
CompuServe's portal, http://www.compuserve.com will also be the
start-up page for MCI WorldCom's new Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe2000 does offer a flat-rate pricing plan for unlimited
use, but Weil says most users _ 80 percent _ prefer to use the
``pay as you go'' plan and only 20 percent have the unlimited usage
plan. ``Twenty hours of use is one hour every business day,'' she
says. And with 2 million professional users as opposed to AOL's 16
million general users, discussions and forums are likely to be more
focused and free of the ``age/sex check'' messages that plague many
AOL discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Film critic) Roger Ebert loves the forums,'' says Weil of one
of CompuServe's celebrity members. ``He says he loves the level of
communication and discussion.''

A little lying is part of the online culture 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among its other pluses is an occasional minus: The Internet is a
haven for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can be full of lies, which is part of its appeal. In a
Web chat room, a short, lumpy unemployed person can become tall,
svelte and gainfully employed. And no one knows the difference.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good if you're just making small talk. But it's
hardly a way to start something real. Then again, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently some of us do. The March issue of Yahoo! Internet
Life takes a look at the tendency to lie online.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a wake of a year that was all about lying, it's easy to
pick up the habit. While the president was being pilloried for his
peccadilloes ... millions of people were practicing the art of
deception every day on the Internet,'' reads the cover story.
</P>
<P>
   But Web users seem to like the lie. The article cites Georgia
Tech's census of Web habits, considered by the magazine the ``most
prestigious general census of Web habits.'' According to the
article, privacy has replaced censorship as the issue most
important to Web users. More than 40 percent of Web users gave
false personal information occasionally, and 10 percent said they
lied at least half the time.
</P>
<P>
   The March issue also ranks America's top wired cities for 1999.
Atlanta placed ninth, behind San Francisco; Austin, Texas; Seattle;
Washington, D.C.; Boston; San Jose, Calif.: San Diego; and
Minneapolis. Atlanta was ahead of Dallas-Fort Worth, Raleigh-Durham
and Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta placed ninth in percentage of adults using the Web at
home and seventh in the number of sites per capita. Atlanta did not
crack the top 10 in two categories: percentage of adults using the
Net at work, which was led by Austin, and Web hosts per capita, led
by San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were compiled with help from Matrix Information
and Directory Services, an Austin firm that tracks Internet usage

<P>
   An organization focused on preserving the past has taken a firm
step into the future. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation
has launched a Web site, http://www
</P>
<P>
   .georgiatrust.org.
</P>
<P>
   On the site is a monthly calendar of events and information
about the various preservation funds, as well as conferences and
tours. The site also offers links to properties for sale and
photographs of the trust's house museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia trust, founded in 1973, is the largest statewide
nonprofit preservation group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation operates three
historic houses, sells endangered properties, offers design
assistance to 30 Main Street communities in Georgia, and lobbies
for money and laws to help preservation efforts.

Apple says new software titles are in the pipeline, but where? 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a recent trade conference in Tokyo, Apple announced more than
1,500 new software programs for the Mac have been released.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news, I guess, except where do you find all these
new titles?
</P>
<P>
   They aren't showing up yet in stores, online sites or mail-order
catalogs. In fact, I'm still seeing a decline in titles for the
Mac. That's especially true for business software. There's now only
an electronic dictionary, and I see only three personal information
managers _ Act!, Consultant and InTouch _ advertised in the
mail-order catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Some titles that have gone by the wayside in the last year or
two include WebArranger, Claris Organizer, Random House Electronic
Dictionary and Claris Emailer.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect, long the biggest challenger to Microsoft Office, is
debating whether to continue developing for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping this gap between new software releases and what I see
for sale merely reflects a crossroads. Software production for the
Mac had nearly shut down last year, and then came the iMac. Its
success is sparking new interest in the Mac platform.
</P>
<P>
   I know it sounds like a stretch, but there is some evidence to
support such an argument. For one, some big developers that had
been on the fence about releasing new Mac titles have now decided
in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   Maxis is developing a Mac version of its new ``SimCity 3000,''
and Blizzard is doing the same for its popular war strategy game
``Starcraft.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Japanese developer has released a Mac-only title,
``Yoot Tower,'' which is an updated version of ``SimTower.'' When
was the last time you heard a game developed first for the Mac
rather than the PC?
</P>
<P>
   The development of these games is not fun and games when it
comes to the Mac. It helps decide the Mac's future.
</P>
<P>
   With useful, entertaining and progressive software, the Mac will
thrive again. It won't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one
wants to write software for the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor,
all dressed up with nowhere to go.

Trojan horses may be running wild, tapping into your hard drive 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How would you like to be an Internet celebrity? People all over
the world would know what you think and who you think about. Your
private e-mail correspondence would be widely read and admired.
Your financial records could be examined and discussed. Even the
text of letters you send through the U.S. mail _ as long as they
were created on your PC _ could be circulated around the Net like
an old-fashioned chain letter.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is you wouldn't like that kind of fame at all.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you who are reading this column right now _ not very
many, but some of you _ are already Internet celebrities. I know
this sounds a little fantastic, but there's a virulent form of
hacking growing in popularity that allows almost anyone to invade
your computer and read files, delete them or add new files ... all
from a remote computer while you are on the Internet. They don't
have to be a genius hacker to do it. Instead, they can download a
program from one of the many hacker sites on the Net and follow the
directions _ as easy as reading a cookbook to bake a cake.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works, once the hacker has the spying program. You
receive an e-mail with an attachment. Maybe it's supposed to be a
funny little program, or an electronic greeting card, or even a
video or photograph designed to be read from a file called
funny.exe or maybe porno.exe. It could have almost any name.
</P>
<P>
   When you open the attachment, it may work just fine. But along
with the picture or the card, your computer receives a tiny hidden
virulent program called a Trojan horse. The reason for the name is
fairly obvious _ the bad program comes disguised inside an
innocuous program.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many of these programs _ called backdoor programs
by some _ to name them all. Once transferred to your computer, they
allow it to be operated by remote control while you are on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   New programs like this _ and increasingly better ones more
difficult to find and remove _ are created every day. But two of
the best known are called Back Orfice and Master of Paradise. These
programs turn your computer into the equivalent of an Internet
server accessible by any other computer on the Net. So the bad guy
who sends the trojan horse can sit somewhere miles and miles away
and do almost anything he wishes with your data.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you pull the plug on your Internet connection, let me
explain most of you don't need to worry about programs like this.
To enter your computer _ even if you have a Trojan horse hiding
inside it _ the bad guy needs to know your address on the Internet.
This address isn't readily apparent when you log on to check your
mail or browse the Web. The real risk from these hidden spy
programs comes when you are logged on to one of the Internet chat
groups such as IRC. A simple command, while you are on IRC, will
reveal your address. Then, while you are logged on and chatting
away, another IRC user can invade your computer.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you aren't a regular on the chat channels, or one of the
game sites where your opponent connects to your computer using the
IP address of your machine, you are perfectly safe. And, even then,
you're still safe if you've never accepted an attachment from
someone you don't know and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even if you spend more time chatting than my Aunt
Sally, you're probably still safe. Most of these backdoor programs
I know about rely on your computer having a setting called
``sharing.'' Unless you are using your home computer on a network
with other machines in your home, make sure that setting is turned
off. Just open the icon in your Control Panel called Network. Then
click on the button called File and Print Sharing. Make sure the
two checkboxes are blank. If they are checked, click on the
checkmarks to disable sharing.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I didn't want to interrupt your chat. You just needed to
know you may be talking louder _ and to more people _ than you
figured.

<P>
   XIAMEN, China _ King Michael of Dell is capturing territory in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the converted avionics plant where Dell Computer Corp.
builds computers for Chinese customers, optimism is bursting like
sunrise over the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how fast Dell grew in Europe in the early '90s? ``We
will do the same thing in China -- absolutely no doubt about it,''
says Irishman Buddy Griffin, who has moved on from Dell's European
operations to oversee the start-up of the newest Dell factory here.
</P>
<P>
   Across the big open workfloor from Griffin's office, the Dell
sales manager has erected a Chinese gong. Whenever a salesperson
clinches a major order -- say 20 or 30 computers -- the sales
manager bangs on it with a wooden rod.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the gong will be sounding more often, or so the
company is expecting. Dell China president David Chan predicts that
annual sales revenues in China will double in 1999, and then double
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in Austin (Texas), the guys know what we are doing
here,'' said Chan, a former IBM marketing executive. ``Michael
knows what we've been doing on a month-to-month basis, because he
sees the results. He's very happy with the progress we've made to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dell echoed Chan's sentiments saying that the China
operation's progress has been ``very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite impressive to see them kind of knocking down
milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and capacity,''
the Dell chairman added.
</P>
<P>
   Already China ranks as the world's fifth-largest market for
personal computers, with about 4 million computers sold last year,
compared to 8 million in Japan and 36 million in the United States.
With personal computer sales in China growing at 27 percent a year,
China is projected to surpass Japan and become the world's
third-biggest computer market by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a latecomer to China, Dell ranks only 11th in computer sales
on the Chinese mainland. It lags well behind the entrenched
American multinationals IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and even
further behind Legend, China's fast-growing, state-owned computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell's results for the last four months show signs of moving
up. For the first time, one percent of personal computers sold in
China were Dells, according to International Data Corp.'s
preliminary findings for the last three months of 1998. And in
January, Dell notched probably it's strongest month so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take on it is that Dell is going to grow relatively
quickly in China,'' said Dane Anderson, an analyst at
Connecticut-based IDC. ``They had a relatively strong performance
in the fourth quarter. I think they certainly will break into the
top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's workforce in China has jumped from 200 to 330 in the last
six months, and is projected to keep expanding past 500 by later
this year
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor of the five-story, blue-and-white Dell building
here, the phones are ringing. Since October, calls to Dell's
technical help lines have doubled as more customers break in their
new Dells.
</P>
<P>
   Already, new help-line technicians and order-processors are
showing up for work, and the top floor is running out of desk
space. The telephone sales crew is about to move to the vacant
fourth floor. And with no time to spare: the crew is expanding from
30 to 50 in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the second floor, the computer-manufacturing team grew
from 36 to 54, just recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dell is the first computer manufacturer in Xiamen, almost
none of the assemblers had seen the inside of a personal computer
before they were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Dell picked them on the strength of experience in assembling
electronic parts in other Chinese factories. Now, five days a week,
they are turning out and testing Dell-brand notebooks, desktops and
servers that the company says are virtually identical to those made
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After about a year of market surveys and other intelligence
gathering, Dell launched its assault on China early last year.
That's when a landing party of executives from Dell's Singapore
office navigated China's bureaucratic reefs and won permission to
start a 100-percent, Dell-owned computer factory here.
</P>
<P>
   As of February 1998, Dell was on the verge of locating in the
hurly-burly of China's biggest city, Shanghai. But then the mayor
of this quaint old port city, one-tenth the size of Shanghai,
approached Dell with an unbeatable, still nonpublicized package of
tax and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted with its reception in Xiamen, Dell announced a year
ago this month that it would open a sales, manufacturing and
service center here. But three weeks later, China's central
government threw the entire project into limbo by suddenly ordering
all companies to cease ``direct selling'' in order to prevent
``social chaos'' throughout China
</P>
<P>
   Although the order mainly targeted alleged ``pyramid sales''
schemes by Chinese and Taiwanese hucksters, the language was broad
enough to cripple the China operations of Avon Products Inc. and
several other blue-chip international companies engaged in direct
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Dell's ``direct selling'' strategy could be viewed by
the Chinese as akin to the legendary Avon Lady's tactics in selling
lipstick door-to-door, outside normal commercial venues. But after
a few days of worried consultations with Chinese authorities, the
Dell advance party concluded that its own direct selling strategy
was not jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   By last May, Dell resolved to push ahead. In what must be record
time, Griffin's team of five expatriates recruited and trained a
200-member Chinese crew -- everyone from computer assemblers to
salespeople to telephone help-line technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 20, Dell started the assembly line. The early
products were clustered at the most expensive, high-tech end of
Dell's computer line: Optiplex desktops, Latitude notebooks and
even Poweredge servers.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Dell's foreign legion could find almost no Chinese
customers ready to buy Dell computers. Michael Dell's vaunted
worldwide ``model'' of selling computers directly to the customer
didn't seem to catch on in China.
</P>
<P>
   Not at first, anyway. For the first month Dell was running the
factory, it had to rely almost entirely on sales to China-based
American multinationals that purchase Dell equipment for all their
worldwide offices through their ``global accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's market share in China actually sank lower than the
previous year during the first month the factory was operating,
according to IDC. In cold numbers, Dell had done better when it was
still exporting computers from abroad, and selling them through
Chinese vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, one of the sparkplugs of direct-selling in Dell's
Singapore headquarters, was named president of Dell China last
October and took on the responsibility as Dell's bilingual
salesman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   As if by magic, the tide began turning about the time Chan took
on the assignment. By the time Michael Dell arrived last November
to commemorate the opening of his Xiamen factory, Chan's
salespeople were clinching orders from provincial
telecommunications companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   One early customer was the state-owned Xinhua news agency, which
bought personal computers for its Beijing and Guangzhou offices.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 13, Dell locked up what was probably its biggest
China order so far -- 265 of the company's newest-model servers,
the entry-level Poweredge-1300. They were bought by one of
Beijing's increasingly technology-conscious government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sale that demonstrated Dell's strengths, and its
weaknesses, in China.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell's China sales have been heavily concentrated in
what the company calls ``the corporate space.'' To Chan, that means
big buyers with at least ``a few thousand employees, buying a few
hundred PCs a year.'' They could be foreign multinationals, Chinese
banks or manufacturing companies, or agencies of the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Dell an edge in ``corporate space,'' says Chan, is
that buyers are most often looking for the latest high-end models,
powered with 400 megahertz processors or faster. And they insist on
reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   In that price range, Dell's head-to-head competitors turn out to
be the same ones it has successfully challenged in Europe -- IBM,
Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese computer makers are not really playing in the
high-end PC market that we play in -- at least not yet,'' Chan
said. ``They (Legend and other Chinese makers) are playing in the
lower-power market, selling 266 megahertz and 300 megahertz
desktops like those we used to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our minimum desktop is 350 megahertz, and very soon
it will be 400 megahertz. Every few months we jump up a notch, so
(the Chinese and American computer makers) are not meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dell would also like to sell computers to vast
numbers of Chinese individuals and small businesses. But it has had
only scant success so far.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Dell has made a hard-boiled marketing judgment
that the overwhelming majority of China's 1.3 billion people are
not now potential Dell customers.
</P>
<P>
   It has meticulously pared down the theoretical mass market to
what it calls the ``addressable market size'' in China. That is
made up mainly of sophisticated urbanites and the big institutions
that employ them.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in deference to the market power of Legend and other
Chinese computer makers, Dell has avoided offering budget-priced
computers that might appeal to Chinese university students or other
first-time computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for Chinese looking for bargain home PCs, China-made Dells
aren't especially attractive. Dell's cheapest desktop sells here
for about $1,500, compared to about $800 for a desktop made by
Legend or other domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the Dell websites in China and the United States
produces other examples of why Dell isn't a consumer's bargain in
China:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell high-end Optiplex GX1p desktop sells for $3,010
in China, compared to a $2,672 pricetag on a virtually identical
GX1p model purchased through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell 266-megahertz Latitude notebook costs $3,601
when purchased through the Dell website in China, compared to a
price of $2,902 when the same model with the same features is
bought through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   How much of China does King Michael think he can capture in the
next 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders, perhaps the best gauge will be to watch what
happens in the next few years to a block of land five miles up the
highway from Dell's present Xiamen factory.
</P>
<P>
   At least four months before Dell opened its assembly line last
August, its executives had already reached a preliminary agreement
with Xiamen city authorities for a 99-year lease on the much larger
piece of land. Dell viewed its present leased plant as a starter
factory that would handle only the first few years' growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dell and its architects have laid detailed plans for
an efficient two-story factory on the larger block of land -- one
with at least twice as much workspace that would contain highly
automated assembly lines. It could theoretically manufacture
``huge'' numbers of computers, many more than the current Xiamen
factory, according to Dell's Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Xiamen city authorities are scheduled to start
preparing the land for construction of the second Dell factory.
Dell has just hired a Chinese civil engineer to seek necessary
environmental and other construction permits.
</P>
<P>
   The land for the second factory should be cleared and ready for
the start of construction as early as August. But Dell's top
management has yet to announce final approval. If sales flatten,
there could be an indefinite delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best estimate is that in two years, we'll be in there,''
says Griffin. ``It won't be less than 12 months, that's for sure.
But it could be a year and a half from now.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Learn about hacking to prevent being hacked 
By Bill Husted  
C. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There you are, a solid citizen of the Net, not particularly
interested in breaking into anything more sensitive than the
refrigerator ... maybe not fat, but happy. So why in the world do
you need to know anything about breaking into computers?
</P>
<P>
   Well, why should you know anything at all about locks? After
all, you don't have any plans to break into houses. Now that there
are real _ if sometimes overblown _ security risks on the Net, you
need to know a little about hacking in order to understand how to
protect yourself against it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start by saying that some old-line computer veterans hate
the notion of calling folks who break into computers hackers. The
term hacking was once more commonly used for a person who was good
at writing programs and computing in general. But nowadays, a
hacker is a person who enjoys learning about ways to break into
computer systems and networks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best primers on that type of hacking is comprised of
the information and links you'll find at the Mining Company's
Internet/Network Security site at http://netsecurity.miningco
</P>
<P>
   .com/. You'll find, for instance, the Modern Hacker's Desk
Reference, a fairly easy-to-understand tutorial on hacking. Once
you've read that, you'll understand the lingo. Then you can follow
one of the dozens of links on this page to sections that explain
some of the programs used to invade other computers and networks.
Some of the material is fairly advanced, but none of it should be
totally incomprehensible once you've learned the lingo. Pay special
attention to the links that take you to areas devoted to protecting
your computer against invasion.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the jargon you learn at that site because one of the
rules of hacking seems to be that any self-respecting hacker speaks
in technobabble. You'll sure find plenty of that at the next site,
but it is based on a print magazine that was one of the first
widely circulated periodicals for hackers: 2600.
</P>
<P>
   The site of that same name is located at http://www.2600.com
</P>
<P>
   /mindex.html. And there's no use mincing words, the viewpoint
here is definitely pro-hacking. You'll find a list here, for
instance, of Web sites that have recently been invaded and
conquered by hackers. There's a little bit of an attitude here,
too. But if your only exposure to hackers in the past has been ones
you've seen in movies or read about in books, it should be an
interesting visit.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there are good witches and bad witches in the old
storybooks, there are good and bad hackers, too. Some hackers _ at
least in their public philosophy _ avoid illegal break-ins and
study hacking as an art. A good hacker, for instance, feels obliged
to let a company know if he discovers flaws in a network, site or
program that make invasion easy. These hackers are best represented
by a group called Happy Hackers. If you go to http://
</P>
<P>
   netsecurity.miningco.com
</P>
<P>
   /library/weekly/aa052598
</P>
<P>
   .htm you can read an interview with Carolyn Meinel, the founder
of the group's Web site. (You can find a link on the same Web page
with the interview. The Happy Hacker site was working sporadically
last week.)
</P>
<P>
   One warning. Even though the group itself seems to be a good
one, some of the language in the interview is not. So parents
should preview the interview for suitability before suggesting it
to any young hackers in the family.

   If you'd like to keep up with what's new in hacking, you can
subscribe to a free publication from the Happy Hackers (just go the
Happy Hacker Web site) to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   None of these sites will turn you into a hacker. But that
probably isn't a career goal, anyway. You will learn enough to know
that (1) the threats from hackers are overblown, but (2) there are
some real dangers out there in cyberspace.

   XIAMEN, China _ One is a soft-spoken Singaporean, the other an
exuberant Irishman. Together they are the flint and steel of the
sales fire Dell Computer Corp. wants to sweep across the world's
biggest potential market.
</P>
<P>
   David Chan and Buddy Griffin are the uncommon pair the Austin,
Texas-based Dell teamed up to convey its new and very Western go-go
style into this ancient land that even today often moves to a
ponderous cadence of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six months we have gone out and met the media, met
with the key customer organizations, both international and Chinese
companies,'' said Chan, president of operations in China and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that sometimes they don't buy into our model, so this
means that people are not sure whether the direct-sell model will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chan, 43, is responsible overall for China, he is
essentially the outside man in charge of sales and strategic
planning. He is a clever choice, a marketing specialist trailing 15
years experience with IBM and contacts throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The sone of Chinese parents, Chan carries a sense of Asian
centeredness that keeps him calm when discussing the urgency of
business, and comfortable in a casual sweater when surrounded by
suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products are great. Product, quality, pricing, that's not
a problem,'' he said in an interview with the Cox News Service.
``People continue to be our biggest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   His job is convincing China's foremost bureaucrats, enterprise
directors and entrepreneurs that they can buy complicated,
expensive equipment in a new way. They can write their own specs,
hand them directly to Dell and get the product delivered fast,
without paying a middle-man to tell them what they need.
</P>
<P>
   In a society eternally hierarchical, from long before Confucius
to decades after Mao Tse-tung, that means convincing people they
can safely take on new responsibility. They won't need a middle-man
to blame when something goes wrong, because they can do it
themselves and do it right.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, a Dell believer recruited to the company's Malaysia
operation in 1996, also has to convince his own salespeople. They
work here, and in seven other urban sales and service offices
around China.
</P>
<P>
   To grow at the rate he wants to grow, Chan said, he must better
train the sales, service and technical staff in ``how to go after
the bigger market.'' Chan himself travels constantly to multiply
Dell China sales, averaging one-and-a-half days at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is the inside man, the nuts-and-bolts executive who gets
the machines made and delivered -- after building up the factory,
hiring the hands and starting the assembly line. His Dell team
accomplished that last August, four and a half months after Dell
announced the decision to locate its China Customer Center in
Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell Austin one day was as small as we are,'' said Griffin,
describing in his rolling Irish brogue an expectation of explosive
growth. ``We are the babies of the moment. China won't be the baby
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, 50, has seen that growth. He personally started up two
other major Dell centers. First, the Limerick supplier for European
operations in his native Ireland when he joined Dell in 1990; then,
five years later the plant in Penang, Malaysia. Now he is vice
president-manufacturing, at the China Customer Center for Dell,
Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline and organization are qualities central to his job.
And Griffin surely harbors them, describing a routine of sleeping
from midnight to 5 a.m., then rising from the Xiamen hotel suite
where he lives to jog every morning before donning a crisp white
shirt and tie.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't answering e-mail or kidding the elevator operator,
he seems to be massaging relations with city officials, who are key
to untangling China's skeins of red tape. Or he's chatting up
Xiamen's university and community figures, who are key to supplying
a steady workforce.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstrably friendly fellow, Griffin doesn't even print his
formal name -- John Francis -- on his business cards. It's just
Buddy, the name bestowed by his sister 40-odd years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his optimistic outlook, Griffin, too, must handle
up-close encounters at the cultural divide. It separates
adapt-to-the-moment capitalists from a Chinese people still
straining the strictures of a communist order that guaranteed a
minimum wage and prohibited maximum profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not our business oscillates. And we
oscillate. And we knee-jerk and we have to rush and hurry it,'' he
said. ``I'd say that we're a culture shock to many people. We're a
build-to-order company. Today, right now, my bet is that our
production guys won't know what they'll be doing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, on that Monday afternoon in early February, his
production guys weren't working. Needed parts hadn't arrived. But
they did eventually, and the assembly line ran from 6:30 p.m. to 9
p.m. Workers were at it again at 8 o'clock the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   That is not normal in China. White-collar workers usually take a
two-hour lunch break and often can't be found after 5 p.m.
Factories have set shifts with strictly regulated overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has adapted, too. It runs a dormitory next to the factory
for about 50 key Chinese workers who live too far to commute, and
runs a series of buses for employees with homes in Xiamen proper,
about 15 miles away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. Has big plans for Asia,
beginning with a major foothold in the People's Republic of China.
The hope is that Dell's formidable sales strategy of
``direct-selling'' to the computer customer will catch on with
China's large, fast-growing consumer market, mimicking the
company's success in Europe. Cox News Service correspondent Jerry
Mahoney spoke with Dell Chairman Michael Dell recently about the
China operation.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Are you happy with the progress of the China operation
to date?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: China's running nicely ahead of plans. And we've been
really thrilled with the reaction from customers so far to the
direct-sell business model. I have two trips already this year
planned to China, including a Fortune magazine global forum we're
sponsoring with a couple of other companies in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you quantify the start out of the gates in China,
compared to other new markets?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't really break it out at that level but it's off to a
very, very nice start. This is a market that several years ago was
not in the Top 20. Now, a lot of people would say it's the
third-largest market in the world. And it looks like it could be
the second-largest market in the world in a couple of years,
overtaking Japan. It's really quite remarkable what's going on over
there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that you want to be the world's No. 1 producer of
PCs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it would be good. I think part of it depends on what
our competitors do, what other mergers or acquisitions may occur in
the marketplace. We've been pretty clear in our statement about
saying we think we can grow faster than the market. You could kind
of plot out our current growth rate and that would suggest that in
a couple of years we start to become No. 1 in more and more
markets. But that's more of a mathematical equation than a
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But it still is the goal of Dell to be the No. 1 PC maker in
the world at some point?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. We wouldn't have a goal to be No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does Dell have to accomplish in China to reach that goal
eventually?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think we're a long way away from that in China today.
We're establishing a base and building our business. Actually, our
first goal in China is that we want to be the No. 1 American
computer company in China.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Compaq is that now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And then what? What's the share there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the share is moving around quite a bit for all the
companies because the market is growing. And if you look at the
size of the market three years from now, it's likely to be huge
compared to what it is this year. So it's advancing quickly, but we
have very small share there today.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will China be like in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the Chinese market is going to be the fastest-growing
large market, by far. There will be, I think, some challenges in
the economy there. It's not likely to go straight up forever, but
by and large this is going to be the fastest-growing market that we
and many companies have. As you get increased industrialization in
China, the computerization and the whole communications revolution,
I mean, the computer industry is in a great position there. If you
look at the growth of the telephone industry, you can kind of see a
precursor to what we think computing will look like in China. And
it has a lot of potential for our company. (Dell China President)
David (Chan) was a key exec in our Asia business, and now he's
totally dedicated just to China. We're spending a lot of time there
. . . because we think it's going to be a very key market for us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you assess the progress so far of your China
manufacturing and sales operations?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very positive. It's quite impressive to see them kind of
knocking down milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and
capacity. Customer visits are much faster than we've seen in any
other operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think could be improved in China? What success
here has surprised you?
</P>
<P>
   A: You still have a roll-out of communications going on across
the country that doesn't reach all of the population. The relevant
thing for us, of course, is that people who have telephones are our
primary target before the people who don't. So, the end of the
railroad track is way out there for us.

 &HT;    DELL MUSCLES INTO LATIN AMERICA DESPITE THE REGION'S ECONOMIC
TURMOIL
 &HT;    With DELL-SIDE-$ADV21.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Latin America, 1997 couldn't have been a better
year. Intel Corp. picked Costa Rica over Ireland as the site for a
new $300 million operation, while a growing middle class developed
a voracious appetite for personal computers, creating a boon for
U.S. computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Asian flu took hold and the Russian economy
collapsed, sending Latin America's economies into a tailspin as
economic turmoil pinched consumers' ability to buy electronics,
affecting the volume and profit margins of U.S. computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   So why -- against such a grim backdrop -- would Dell Computer
Corp. want to pump as much as $125 million into a Brazilian
operation over the next six years?
</P>
<P>
   Because, as Dell officials will attest, it's the long-term
outlook -- and not the current reality -- that really drives any
successful company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is an untapped market and so the new operation we have
planned there is a long-term strategic decision as part of our
global expansion,'' explained Dell spokeswoman Deborah Cromer.
``Certainly we're watching the financial situation in Brazil, but
it hasn't gotten to the point that we've made changes in our
long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas-based company has signed an agreement with the
industrially powerful Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul to
construct a sales and manufacturing center there, possibly by the
end of the year. Eventually, it will employ up to 260 people and
serve as a hub for sales throughout the Southern Common Market
known as Mercosur, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   To Dell officials, it makes perfect sense to establish a site in
Brazil, even if its $800 billion economy is headed toward severe
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as large as the United States, the South American giant
is home to 164 million potential consumers.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Brazil's personal computer market remains a
lucrative one that's valued at $2.7 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   And, certainly, Dell's no stranger to Latin America. Company
officials are quick to point out that Austin is closer to Mexico
City than it is to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Dell made its first foray into the region six years ago by
opening an office in Mexico. On its heels were offices in both
Chile and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   And Dell's investments in the region aren't expected to end
there.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the horizon for Dell could be a fifth office in
Argentina, Dell's third largest Latin American market behind Brazil
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina is showing big growth and it's become a very
important long-term market for us,'' said Daryl Robertson, vice
president for Dell Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Latin countries export heavily to Brazil, meaning
they're likely to be dragged down by Brazil's instability, and the
growth rate of PC sales in Latin America slowed by nearly half in
1998, Dell officials are anything but pessimistic. They insist the
demand for their products in Latin America has surpassed company
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   They are confident they can replicate the success they've
enjoyed in North America, where Dell has earned some 20 percent of
the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell has been seeing growth in Latin America that's several
times the market growth rate,'' Robertson said, declining to be
more specific.
</P>
<P>
   But even Dell officials admit that success in developing markets
is almost always built on risk, especially in the mercurial world
of high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to tightening credit and plunging currencies, Brazilians,
for example, haven't been able to afford a car payment in recent
months, let alone a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next decade, Brazil will be a very valuable market
for U.S. consumer products, but right now people are hesitant to
buy anything in the midst of so much economic and political
uncertainty,'' said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America
for the Economist Intelligence Unit in London.

VIACOM TAKES ANOTHER NEW-MEDIA ROUTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hard on the heels of Disney, NBC and USA Networks,
another big old-media company decided this week that it needed a
bigger bite of the new-media world.
</P>
<P>
   But Viacom and its flinty Yankee of a chairman, Sumner Redstone,
decided to take a very different tack from big competitors, who all
dropped hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars buying
portal sites such as Lycos, Excite and Snap.
</P>
<P>
   Portals have been the Net's business buzzword of the past
several months, and everyone's been buying them at hugely inflated
prices, thanks to the overheated tech stock market. Portals offer a
raft of services to entice users to start there and stay long
enough to let the portal sell more advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To old-media minds used to thinking in television terms, portals
look a lot like big TV networks, aggregating lots and lots of
eyeballs that can interest big advertisers. So, the best way for
old media to go new, the thinking has been, is to buy a portal.
</P>
<P>
   The portal play has paid off for some: Disney's relentlessly
cross-promoted Go Network _ flush with established properties like
the online sites for ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel and sporting some
interesting parental-controls software _ promptly shot up to No. 4
in Media Metrix's monthly Web traffic surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a guaranteed success, as USA Networks found out,
when both its stock and Lycos' took a pounding after their merger
was announced recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Sumner Redstone, you're not all that ecstatic about
having to pay billions of dollars for some portal and arguing that
that's going to create a viable Internet presence,'' said Mark
Hardie, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Besides, ``Anything you buy now is second or third tier. That's all
that's left on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   With prices high and selection grim, the penurious Redstone took
a much cheaper route, and one his company knows well.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Viacom made billions by dominating specific demographic
segments (kids and youth-oriented music) with its hugely successful
cable television channels Nickelodeon, MTV and VH-1, it now will do
the same thing on the Internet, driving its young and younger TV
viewers to the Web sites and back again with heavy cross-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the intriguing additions will be Imagine Radio, the
Brisbane, Calif.-based startup that has been providing highly
personalized Internet ``radio'' for a while now.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom bought Imagine for a reported pittance, and it is
planning to expand its offerings from about 30 to more than 100
genres of music.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners can create custom ``stations'' that play a mix of
music from whatever of those genres they like.
</P>
<P>
   The Imagine music player also will allow listeners to rate
individual songs, buy albums and merchandise, get concert and band
information, and access live chats and well-regarded independent
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The sites _ tentatively named Project Nozzle for children and
the Buggles Project for music _ also feature the digital TV
channels that Viacom already is offering to satellite-dish owners.
</P>
<P>
   Though it will be awhile before there are enough high-speed
Internet connections for most people to watch those digital
channels on their computer/TV/convergence device, this is indeed
where entertainment is going.
</P>
<P>
   And in the meantime, it's nice to see somebody in the old media
figuring out a slightly different way to go new. &QL; 
VETERANS WANTED: Veterans have long told their war stories, but now
they have a place to put them, in the California Military Museum in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned museum is looking for personal stories, photos
and other memorabilia from California veterans that it can include
on its Web site at (www.militarymuseum.org).
</P>
<P>
   If you have material you think may be appropriate, contact the
museum at webmastermilitarymuseum.org, or write to California
Military Museum, with attention to CSM Dan Sebby, Web site manager,
1119 Second St., Sacramento, Calif. 93814. You also can call the
museum at (916) 442-2883.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Web site already has an extensive amount of
information, including histories of California military
installations, units and ships. The Web site also includes an
events calendar, an online bookstore and lengthy listings of links
to other military history sites. &QL; 
SCREEN SAVERS: Screen savers have long outlived their direct
usefulness preserving your monitor from phosphor burn-in problems,
but that doesn't mean they still can't be fun.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, KaizenWorks Publishing of Santa Monica is selling
a series of quote-of-the-day screen savers that also include
changing photos, backing music, and the ability to print out the
thoughts as note cards and daily agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 14 Day-Savor titles are ones based on the ``Chicken
Soup for the Soul'' series and the game show ``Jeopardy!'' plus
motivational and educational quotes, ``angel messages'' and Bible
verses, golfing tips and daily astrology for all signs.
</P>
<P>
   The Day-Savors can be purchased on floppy disks or CD-ROM for
$16.95 in office supply or gift stores, or bought online-downloaded
at www.daysavor.com. &QL; 
HANKS AND THE WEB: And finally, words to live by, from actor Tom
Hanks, star of the recent online romance yarn ``You've Got Mail''
and the substantially (and justifiably) less well-remembered
``Bosom Buddies.'' ``Don't ever make the mistake of searching for
your own name on the Internet,'' said Hanks backstage at the recent
People's Choice Awards in Pasadena. ``I found out more about
``Bosom Buddies'' than I ever knew, and I was one of the Bosom
Buddies.'' &QL;

   XIAMEN, China _ King Michael of Dell is capturing territory in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the converted avionics plant where Dell Computer Corp.
builds computers for Chinese customers, optimism is bursting like
sunrise over the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how fast Dell grew in Europe in the early '90s? ``We
will do the same thing in China -- absolutely no doubt about it,''
says Irishman Buddy Griffin, who has moved on from Dell's European
operations to oversee the start-up of the newest Dell factory here.
</P>
<P>
   Across the big open workfloor from Griffin's office, the Dell
sales manager has erected a Chinese gong. Whenever a salesperson
clinches a major order -- say 20 or 30 computers -- the sales
manager bangs on it with a wooden rod.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the gong will be sounding more often, or so the
company is expecting. Dell China president David Chan predicts that
annual sales revenues in China will double in 1999, and then double
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in Austin (Texas), the guys know what we are doing
here,'' said Chan, a former IBM marketing executive. ``Michael
knows what we've been doing on a month-to-month basis, because he
sees the results. He's very happy with the progress we've made to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dell echoed Chan's sentiments saying that the China
operation's progress has been ``very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite impressive to see them kind of knocking down
milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and capacity,''
the Dell chairman added.
</P>
<P>
   Already China ranks as the world's fifth-largest market for
personal computers, with about 4 million computers sold last year,
compared to 8 million in Japan and 36 million in the United States.
With personal computer sales in China growing at 27 percent a year,
China is projected to surpass Japan and become the world's
third-biggest computer market by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a latecomer to China, Dell ranks only 11th in computer sales
on the Chinese mainland. It lags well behind the entrenched
American multinationals IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and even
further behind Legend, China's fast-growing, state-owned computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell's results for the last four months show signs of moving
up. For the first time, one percent of personal computers sold in
China were Dells, according to International Data Corp.'s
preliminary findings for the last three months of 1998. And in
January, Dell notched probably it's strongest month so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take on it is that Dell is going to grow relatively
quickly in China,'' said Dane Anderson, an analyst at
Connecticut-based IDC. ``They had a relatively strong performance
in the fourth quarter. I think they certainly will break into the
top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's workforce in China has jumped from 200 to 330 in the last
six months, and is projected to keep expanding past 500 by later
this year
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor of the five-story, blue-and-white Dell building
here, the phones are ringing. Since October, calls to Dell's
technical help lines have doubled as more customers break in their
new Dells.
</P>
<P>
   Already, new help-line technicians and order-processors are
showing up for work, and the top floor is running out of desk
space. The telephone sales crew is about to move to the vacant
fourth floor. And with no time to spare: the crew is expanding from
30 to 50 in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the second floor, the computer-manufacturing team grew
from 36 to 54, just recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dell is the first computer manufacturer in Xiamen, almost
none of the assemblers had seen the inside of a personal computer
before they were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Dell picked them on the strength of experience in assembling
electronic parts in other Chinese factories. Now, five days a week,
they are turning out and testing Dell-brand notebooks, desktops and
servers that the company says are virtually identical to those made
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After about a year of market surveys and other intelligence
gathering, Dell launched its assault on China early last year.
That's when a landing party of executives from Dell's Singapore
office navigated China's bureaucratic reefs and won permission to
start a 100-percent, Dell-owned computer factory here.
</P>
<P>
   As of February 1998, Dell was on the verge of locating in the
hurly-burly of China's biggest city, Shanghai. But then the mayor
of this quaint old port city, one-tenth the size of Shanghai,
approached Dell with an unbeatable, still nonpublicized package of
tax and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted with its reception in Xiamen, Dell announced a year
ago this month that it would open a sales, manufacturing and
service center here. But three weeks later, China's central
government threw the entire project into limbo by suddenly ordering
all companies to cease ``direct selling'' in order to prevent
``social chaos'' throughout China
</P>
<P>
   Although the order mainly targeted alleged ``pyramid sales''
schemes by Chinese and Taiwanese hucksters, the language was broad
enough to cripple the China operations of Avon Products Inc. and
several other blue-chip international companies engaged in direct
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Dell's ``direct selling'' strategy could be viewed by
the Chinese as akin to the legendary Avon Lady's tactics in selling
lipstick door-to-door, outside normal commercial venues. But after
a few days of worried consultations with Chinese authorities, the
Dell advance party concluded that its own direct selling strategy
was not jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   By last May, Dell resolved to push ahead. In what must be record
time, Griffin's team of five expatriates recruited and trained a
200-member Chinese crew -- everyone from computer assemblers to
salespeople to telephone help-line technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 20, Dell started the assembly line. The early
products were clustered at the most expensive, high-tech end of
Dell's computer line: Optiplex desktops, Latitude notebooks and
even Poweredge servers.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Dell's foreign legion could find almost no Chinese
customers ready to buy Dell computers. Michael Dell's vaunted
worldwide ``model'' of selling computers directly to the customer
didn't seem to catch on in China.
</P>
<P>
   Not at first, anyway. For the first month Dell was running the
factory, it had to rely almost entirely on sales to China-based
American multinationals that purchase Dell equipment for all their
worldwide offices through their ``global accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's market share in China actually sank lower than the
previous year during the first month the factory was operating,
according to IDC. In cold numbers, Dell had done better when it was
still exporting computers from abroad, and selling them through
Chinese vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, one of the sparkplugs of direct-selling in Dell's
Singapore headquarters, was named president of Dell China last
October and took on the responsibility as Dell's bilingual
salesman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   As if by magic, the tide began turning about the time Chan took
on the assignment. By the time Michael Dell arrived last November
to commemorate the opening of his Xiamen factory, Chan's
salespeople were clinching orders from provincial
telecommunications companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   One early customer was the state-owned Xinhua news agency, which
bought personal computers for its Beijing and Guangzhou offices.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 13, Dell locked up what was probably its biggest
China order so far -- 265 of the company's newest-model servers,
the entry-level Poweredge-1300. They were bought by one of
Beijing's increasingly technology-conscious government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sale that demonstrated Dell's strengths, and its
weaknesses, in China.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell's China sales have been heavily concentrated in
what the company calls ``the corporate space.'' To Chan, that means
big buyers with at least ``a few thousand employees, buying a few
hundred PCs a year.'' They could be foreign multinationals, Chinese
banks or manufacturing companies, or agencies of the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Dell an edge in ``corporate space,'' says Chan, is
that buyers are most often looking for the latest high-end models,
powered with 400 megahertz processors or faster. And they insist on
reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   In that price range, Dell's head-to-head competitors turn out to
be the same ones it has successfully challenged in Europe -- IBM,
Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese computer makers are not really playing in the
high-end PC market that we play in -- at least not yet,'' Chan
said. ``They (Legend and other Chinese makers) are playing in the
lower-power market, selling 266 megahertz and 300 megahertz
desktops like those we used to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our minimum desktop is 350 megahertz, and very soon
it will be 400 megahertz. Every few months we jump up a notch, so
(the Chinese and American computer makers) are not meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dell would also like to sell computers to vast
numbers of Chinese individuals and small businesses. But it has had
only scant success so far.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Dell has made a hard-boiled marketing judgment
that the overwhelming majority of China's 1.3 billion people are
not now potential Dell customers.
</P>
<P>
   It has meticulously pared down the theoretical mass market to
what it calls the ``addressable market size'' in China. That is
made up mainly of sophisticated urbanites and the big institutions
that employ them.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in deference to the market power of Legend and other
Chinese computer makers, Dell has avoided offering budget-priced
computers that might appeal to Chinese university students or other
first-time computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for Chinese looking for bargain home PCs, China-made Dells
aren't especially attractive. Dell's cheapest desktop sells here
for about $1,500, compared to about $800 for a desktop made by
Legend or other domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the Dell websites in China and the United States
produces other examples of why Dell isn't a consumer's bargain in
China:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell high-end Optiplex GX1p desktop sells for $3,010
in China, compared to a $2,672 pricetag on a virtually identical
GX1p model purchased through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell 266-megahertz Latitude notebook costs $3,601
when purchased through the Dell website in China, compared to a
price of $2,902 when the same model with the same features is
bought through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   How much of China does King Michael think he can capture in the
next 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders, perhaps the best gauge will be to watch what
happens in the next few years to a block of land five miles up the
highway from Dell's present Xiamen factory.
</P>
<P>
   At least four months before Dell opened its assembly line last
August, its executives had already reached a preliminary agreement
with Xiamen city authorities for a 99-year lease on the much larger
piece of land. Dell viewed its present leased plant as a starter
factory that would handle only the first few years' growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dell and its architects have laid detailed plans for
an efficient two-story factory on the larger block of land -- one
with at least twice as much workspace that would contain highly
automated assembly lines. It could theoretically manufacture
``huge'' numbers of computers, many more than the current Xiamen
factory, according to Dell's Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Xiamen city authorities are scheduled to start
preparing the land for construction of the second Dell factory.
Dell has just hired a Chinese civil engineer to seek necessary
environmental and other construction permits.
</P>
<P>
   The land for the second factory should be cleared and ready for
the start of construction as early as August. But Dell's top
management has yet to announce final approval. If sales flatten,
there could be an indefinite delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best estimate is that in two years, we'll be in there,''
says Griffin. ``It won't be less than 12 months, that's for sure.
But it could be a year and a half from now.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. Has big plans for Asia,
beginning with a major foothold in the People's Republic of China.
The hope is that Dell's formidable sales strategy of
``direct-selling'' to the computer customer will catch on with
China's large, fast-growing consumer market, mimicking the
company's success in Europe. Cox News Service correspondent Jerry
Mahoney spoke with Dell Chairman Michael Dell recently about the
China operation.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Are you happy with the progress of the China operation
to date?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: China's running nicely ahead of plans. And we've been
really thrilled with the reaction from customers so far to the
direct-sell business model. I have two trips already this year
planned to China, including a Fortune magazine global forum we're
sponsoring with a couple of other companies in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you quantify the start out of the gates in China,
compared to other new markets?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't really break it out at that level but it's off to a
very, very nice start. This is a market that several years ago was
not in the Top 20. Now, a lot of people would say it's the
third-largest market in the world. And it looks like it could be
the second-largest market in the world in a couple of years,
overtaking Japan. It's really quite remarkable what's going on over
there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that you want to be the world's No. 1 producer of
PCs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it would be good. I think part of it depends on what
our competitors do, what other mergers or acquisitions may occur in
the marketplace. We've been pretty clear in our statement about
saying we think we can grow faster than the market. You could kind
of plot out our current growth rate and that would suggest that in
a couple of years we start to become No. 1 in more and more
markets. But that's more of a mathematical equation than a
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But it still is the goal of Dell to be the No. 1 PC maker in
the world at some point?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. We wouldn't have a goal to be No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does Dell have to accomplish in China to reach that goal
eventually?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think we're a long way away from that in China today.
We're establishing a base and building our business. Actually, our
first goal in China is that we want to be the No. 1 American
computer company in China.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Compaq is that now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And then what? What's the share there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the share is moving around quite a bit for all the
companies because the market is growing. And if you look at the
size of the market three years from now, it's likely to be huge
compared to what it is this year. So it's advancing quickly, but we
have very small share there today.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will China be like in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the Chinese market is going to be the fastest-growing
large market, by far. There will be, I think, some challenges in
the economy there. It's not likely to go straight up forever, but
by and large this is going to be the fastest-growing market that we
and many companies have. As you get increased industrialization in
China, the computerization and the whole communications revolution,
I mean, the computer industry is in a great position there. If you
look at the growth of the telephone industry, you can kind of see a
precursor to what we think computing will look like in China. And
it has a lot of potential for our company. (Dell China President)
David (Chan) was a key exec in our Asia business, and now he's
totally dedicated just to China. We're spending a lot of time there
. . . because we think it's going to be a very key market for us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you assess the progress so far of your China
manufacturing and sales operations?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very positive. It's quite impressive to see them kind of
knocking down milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and
capacity. Customer visits are much faster than we've seen in any
other operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think could be improved in China? What success
here has surprised you?
</P>
<P>
   A: You still have a roll-out of communications going on across
the country that doesn't reach all of the population. The relevant
thing for us, of course, is that people who have telephones are our
primary target before the people who don't. So, the end of the
railroad track is way out there for us.

   XIAMEN, China _ One is a soft-spoken Singaporean, the other an
exuberant Irishman. Together they are the flint and steel of the
sales fire Dell Computer Corp. wants to sweep across the world's
biggest potential market.
</P>
<P>
   David Chan and Buddy Griffin are the uncommon pair the Austin,
Texas-based Dell teamed up to convey its new and very Western go-go
style into this ancient land that even today often moves to a
ponderous cadence of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six months we have gone out and met the media, met
with the key customer organizations, both international and Chinese
companies,'' said Chan, president of operations in China and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that sometimes they don't buy into our model, so this
means that people are not sure whether the direct-sell model will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chan, 43, is responsible overall for China, he is
essentially the outside man in charge of sales and strategic
planning. He is a clever choice, a marketing specialist trailing 15
years experience with IBM and contacts throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The sone of Chinese parents, Chan carries a sense of Asian
centeredness that keeps him calm when discussing the urgency of
business, and comfortable in a casual sweater when surrounded by
suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products are great. Product, quality, pricing, that's not
a problem,'' he said in an interview with the Cox News Service.
``People continue to be our biggest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   His job is convincing China's foremost bureaucrats, enterprise
directors and entrepreneurs that they can buy complicated,
expensive equipment in a new way. They can write their own specs,
hand them directly to Dell and get the product delivered fast,
without paying a middle-man to tell them what they need.
</P>
<P>
   In a society eternally hierarchical, from long before Confucius
to decades after Mao Tse-tung, that means convincing people they
can safely take on new responsibility. They won't need a middle-man
to blame when something goes wrong, because they can do it
themselves and do it right.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, a Dell believer recruited to the company's Malaysia
operation in 1996, also has to convince his own salespeople. They
work here, and in seven other urban sales and service offices
around China.
</P>
<P>
   To grow at the rate he wants to grow, Chan said, he must better
train the sales, service and technical staff in ``how to go after
the bigger market.'' Chan himself travels constantly to multiply
Dell China sales, averaging one-and-a-half days at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is the inside man, the nuts-and-bolts executive who gets
the machines made and delivered -- after building up the factory,
hiring the hands and starting the assembly line. His Dell team
accomplished that last August, four and a half months after Dell
announced the decision to locate its China Customer Center in
Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell Austin one day was as small as we are,'' said Griffin,
describing in his rolling Irish brogue an expectation of explosive
growth. ``We are the babies of the moment. China won't be the baby
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, 50, has seen that growth. He personally started up two
other major Dell centers. First, the Limerick supplier for European
operations in his native Ireland when he joined Dell in 1990; then,
five years later the plant in Penang, Malaysia. Now he is vice
president-manufacturing, at the China Customer Center for Dell,
Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline and organization are qualities central to his job.
And Griffin surely harbors them, describing a routine of sleeping
from midnight to 5 a.m., then rising from the Xiamen hotel suite
where he lives to jog every morning before donning a crisp white
shirt and tie.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't answering e-mail or kidding the elevator operator,
he seems to be massaging relations with city officials, who are key
to untangling China's skeins of red tape. Or he's chatting up
Xiamen's university and community figures, who are key to supplying
a steady workforce.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstrably friendly fellow, Griffin doesn't even print his
formal name -- John Francis -- on his business cards. It's just
Buddy, the name bestowed by his sister 40-odd years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his optimistic outlook, Griffin, too, must handle
up-close encounters at the cultural divide. It separates
adapt-to-the-moment capitalists from a Chinese people still
straining the strictures of a communist order that guaranteed a
minimum wage and prohibited maximum profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not our business oscillates. And we
oscillate. And we knee-jerk and we have to rush and hurry it,'' he
said. ``I'd say that we're a culture shock to many people. We're a
build-to-order company. Today, right now, my bet is that our
production guys won't know what they'll be doing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, on that Monday afternoon in early February, his
production guys weren't working. Needed parts hadn't arrived. But
they did eventually, and the assembly line ran from 6:30 p.m. to 9
p.m. Workers were at it again at 8 o'clock the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   That is not normal in China. White-collar workers usually take a
two-hour lunch break and often can't be found after 5 p.m.
Factories have set shifts with strictly regulated overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has adapted, too. It runs a dormitory next to the factory
for about 50 key Chinese workers who live too far to commute, and
runs a series of buses for employees with homes in Xiamen proper,
about 15 miles away.

<P>
   MIAMI _ For Latin America, 1997 couldn't have been a better
year. Intel Corp. picked Costa Rica over Ireland as the site for a
new $300 million operation, while a growing middle class developed
a voracious appetite for personal computers, creating a boon for
U.S. computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Asian flu took hold and the Russian economy
collapsed, sending Latin America's economies into a tailspin as
economic turmoil pinched consumers' ability to buy electronics,
affecting the volume and profit margins of U.S. computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   So why -- against such a grim backdrop -- would Dell Computer
Corp. want to pump as much as $125 million into a Brazilian
operation over the next six years?
</P>
<P>
   Because, as Dell officials will attest, it's the long-term
outlook -- and not the current reality -- that really drives any
successful company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is an untapped market and so the new operation we have
planned there is a long-term strategic decision as part of our
global expansion,'' explained Dell spokeswoman Deborah Cromer.
``Certainly we're watching the financial situation in Brazil, but
it hasn't gotten to the point that we've made changes in our
long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas-based company has signed an agreement with the
industrially powerful Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul to
construct a sales and manufacturing center there, possibly by the
end of the year. Eventually, it will employ up to 260 people and
serve as a hub for sales throughout the Southern Common Market
known as Mercosur, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   To Dell officials, it makes perfect sense to establish a site in
Brazil, even if its $800 billion economy is headed toward severe
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as large as the United States, the South American giant
is home to 164 million potential consumers.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Brazil's personal computer market remains a
lucrative one that's valued at $2.7 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   And, certainly, Dell's no stranger to Latin America. Company
officials are quick to point out that Austin is closer to Mexico
City than it is to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Dell made its first foray into the region six years ago by
opening an office in Mexico. On its heels were offices in both
Chile and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   And Dell's investments in the region aren't expected to end
there.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the horizon for Dell could be a fifth office in
Argentina, Dell's third largest Latin American market behind Brazil
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina is showing big growth and it's become a very
important long-term market for us,'' said Daryl Robertson, vice
president for Dell Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Latin countries export heavily to Brazil, meaning
they're likely to be dragged down by Brazil's instability, and the
growth rate of PC sales in Latin America slowed by nearly half in
1998, Dell officials are anything but pessimistic. They insist the
demand for their products in Latin America has surpassed company
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   They are confident they can replicate the success they've
enjoyed in North America, where Dell has earned some 20 percent of
the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell has been seeing growth in Latin America that's several
times the market growth rate,'' Robertson said, declining to be
more specific.
</P>
<P>
   But even Dell officials admit that success in developing markets
is almost always built on risk, especially in the mercurial world
of high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to tightening credit and plunging currencies, Brazilians,
for example, haven't been able to afford a car payment in recent
months, let alone a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next decade, Brazil will be a very valuable market
for U.S. consumer products, but right now people are hesitant to
buy anything in the midst of so much economic and political
uncertainty,'' said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America
for the Economist Intelligence Unit in London.

TOP STUDENT, NOW SUPREMACIST, DENIES HIS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By THOMAS FARRAGHER   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Mass. _ Before his dark transformation, he was Andrew
Britt Greenbaum, a crackerjack student who drove too fast, played a
mean game of chess, and spent long hours reading alone in his room.
</P>
<P>
   Like high school kids do everywhere, his classmates labeled him:
Greenbaum was a brainwave, or a nerd, or a radical. He played with
swords. He took Civil War history a little too seriously. He did
not hang out at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Only the few who knew him better than casually caught glimpses
of something more chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd talk about how other races were inferior and all that
crap,'' said Tarleton Hill, a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of graduation from Westwood High School in 1996,
Greenbaum drove down Route 109 to Dedham, walked into the busy
probate court there, and began the process that would legally
change his name to Davis Wolfgang Hawke. It was a more fitting
appellation, he believed, and it helped complete the transformation
of what he had become: a hatemonger, a pariah, a disciple of Adolf
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really despise Massachusetts,'' said Hawke, now a junior at
Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C. ``It's a very liberal state.
It's a very Jewish state. It's a very black state. There's nothing
in that state for me. And I'll never be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hawke is the leader of the Internet-launched Knights of
Freedom, a neo-Nazi organization he operates from a dorm-room
computer at a school that is horrified and embarrassed about a hate
group that is testing the limits of free speech and drawing close
attention from human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this kid had the potential to be a real leader,'' said
Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which
tracks hate groups nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white supremacist movement in this country in general is
very much seeking out the leadership cadres of tomorrow,'' he said.
``There is a real interest in looking for kids with charisma like
Davis Wolfgang Hawke.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights leaders say he is now under suspicion among
white supremacist groups because of the name he had hoped to bury
in the dense files of a Dedham courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Greenbaum-cum-Hawke's journey from this
well-groomed, affluent Boston suburb to a Deep South dormitory room
decorated with swastika flags and authentic-looking Nazi uniforms
is the tale of squandered promise, icy intolerance, and the irony
of an anti-Semite haunted by the Jewish name on his birth
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to engage in violence to cause pain and to
cause harm,'' said Leonard Zakim, executive director of the
Anti-Defamation League's New England office. ``The quicker you blow
him out of the water, the better. This is a guy who should be
exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum was born Oct. 21, 1978, in Newport, R.I., the son of
Hyman Andrew Greenbaum, a Georgia native, and the former Peggy
Amber Davis of New Mexico, according to a copy of his birth
certificate on file at the Dedham courthouse. The family moved to
Lakeville, Mass. when Andrew was still a toddler and he attended
grammar school in southeastern Massachusetts before the Greenbaums
resettled into a neat, modest home here.
</P>
<P>
   The tidy blue house with cream trim backs onto a cemetery and is
just a short walk from the local high school. School officials
would not be interviewed for this story, but his classmates
invariably mention two things about Greenbaum's high school days:
He was remarkably bright, and he was more than a little bit
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loner is a good word for it, but he had a little crowd,'' said
Arthur H. Ellis Jr., who graduated with Greenbaum. ``He was smart
but everyone knew he had a little weird thing going on _ kind of
like an intellectual radical.''
</P>
<P>
   What his classmates saw as loneliness, Greenbaum called
determined reflection. There was no single trigger, no defining
moment, no epiphany that propelled him toward hatred. It was, he
said, an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gradual evolution,'' he said, one that occurred in
the stacks of the local library and under the reading lamp in his
bedroom. He read and re-read Hitler's manifesto, ``Mein Kampf,''
and studied the tenets of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much kept to myself, but I'm not an introvert,''
Hawke said last week. ``I'm a leader and a leader can't be an
introvert. I'm interested in being a leader, not being someone's
friend. In any social relationship, I have to be the superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, who ran unsuccessfully for class president his junior
year, said if his Westwood classmates were uncomfortable with him,
the feeling was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Jewish town,'' he said. ``Not only was it Jewish, but
they felt the need to bus in a large number of Negroes from
inner-city Boston. Every teacher there was a radical left-wing
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   His high school yearbook said Greenbaum held the top spot on the
chess club: ``That came as no surprise since he's the best in the
state.'' Hawke said he found chess ``a good metaphor for war.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a skull-adorned T-shirt and a dark cowboy hat, Greenbaum
posed for a yearbook picture in his neighborhood's cemetery
standing over a gravestone etched with the name Sherman _ an
intended reference to the Civil War Union general's march through
the South, which still draws Confederate scorn. Beneath the photo,
where other students would have inscribed silly nicknames and tales
of sporting triumphs, Greenbaum wrote: ``The rock, the vulture, and
the chain; all that the proud can feel of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day Westwood handed diplomas to its class of 1996,
Greenbaum never showed up. Within days he was in the Dedham
courthouse, seeking to bury his past.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed to support his application for a change of
identity, Greenbaum was asked to state his reason for the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always responded to a different name and I wish to
formalize my name prior to attending college in the fall as to
avoid confusion,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is not that benign.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the court granted his request, Greenbaum had already
been detected by the Anti-Defamation League, which spotted him on a
Norwood street corner handing out Knights of Freedom fliers,
decrying rising immigration, US financial support for Israel, and
gays in President Clinton's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke acknowledged handing out hate literature in his high
school as well as in ``mainly blue-collar'' neighborhoods near
Westwood. And Hawke knew the credibility of his views, including
sterilization for Jews, was undermined by his surname. ``I didn't
want people to think I'm Jewish, when I'm not Jewish,'' said Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Hawke's parents were not successful. Telephone
calls, knocks at their door, and notes left at their address,
seeking comment, went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke said they oppose his activities. ``But what can they do
about it? It's my life, not theirs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke insists Hyman Greenbaum is his stepfather. He said he is
the ``illegitimate'' son of a man his mother did not marry and he
does not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no Jewish blood in me,'' he said. ``I can't help the
fact that my stepfather is a quarter Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of his lineage, when Davis Wolfgang Hawke
arrived in South Carolina for his freshman year at Wofford, an
expensive and mostly white college affiliated with the United
Methodist Church, he left Andrew Britt Greenbaum behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is very conservative, so I thought it would be
more receptive to my beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He kept largely to himself, accumulating a 3.8 grade-point
average studying German and history. College officials said he has
complied with authority and, until recently, presented no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say hello and he'd always returned the greeting,'' said
Dan Maultsby, Wofford's dean. ``But I never had a personal
conversation with him. That embarrasses me now. I wish I had. It's
an embarrassment to a small college that he's been here for 2 1/2
years and now we find out about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Knights of Freedom, a fledgling outfit with about 20 followers
until it blossomed via the Internet last summer, became a campus
flashpoint earlier this month when the Spartanburg Herald-Journal
newspaper ran a story about Hawke's dorm-room operation. Three
hundred students turned out for a recent candlelight vigil
condemning Hawke and his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a considerable amount of fear by people who
thought it might escalate into something violent,'' said Kris
Neely, a Wofford sophomore who organized the vigil. ``We're working
to answer questions about whether we need to be a more diverse
student body.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, however, is enjoying the attention. He's posted a press
release on his Web page that states: ``Remember that all coverage
is good coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   On that Web page, Hawke, a soft-spoken and articulate
20-year-old, uses florid prose to denounce ``Jewish tyranny'' and
federal taxes, and to espouse an Aryan homeland and the confinement
of minorities to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis puts everything on the line,'' said Matthew O`Connor,
who identified himself as a Knights of Freedom member from southern
New Jersey. ``Basically, he's our last chance. And I truly believe
that. I'll follow him right down to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   For $5 a month, Hawke's members _ estimated at about 200 despite
his claim of many more _ receive a newsletter, videotapes, copies
of hate speeches, a certificate of rank, an armband, a picture ID,
and a mail-order catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He talks grandly of an upcoming march on Washington, the
imminent influx of about $700,000 from an unnamed source, and the
planned purchase of a party ``compound'' in Wyoming or Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States of America, we have something called the
First Amendment, which gives me as much right to express my beliefs
as anyone else,'' said Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, say Wofford officials who are monitoring his
activities. They agree that Hawke is abiding by the letter of the
school's student code: He uses his personal computer linked to a
commercial Internet provider, and the address on the Web site is
listed as Walpole, Mass., a commercial postal box where he said
letters are collected and forwarded to him.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity Hawke so dearly covets will be his undoing,
hate-speech specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kid who thinks because he has fairly good SAT
scores, he's going to rule the universe like some character out of
a Batman comic book,'' said Potok, whose Montgomery, Ala.-based
organization reported last week that hate groups on the Internet
had grown by about 60 percent, from 163 in 1997 to 254 at the end
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wannabe fuhrer _ a boy who wants to be a big man,''
Potok said. ``But his darkest secret, that he is the son of Hyman
Greenbaum, is very likely to destroy him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tom Metzger, leader of the California-based White Aryan
Resistance, said Sunday, ``If he were, in fact, a product of Jewish
parents, and he was a Jew, he would not be eligible to lead any
struggle we're involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kaiman, southeast regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League, said it is chilling that Hawke has gone unnoticed for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want him hiding in his dorm room in an SS uniform,''
Kaiman said. ``We want to out him. We want to get him out of his
dorm room and then let him stand up and say what he believes. He's
a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   And an unfitting symbol for this town and a school known for
hockey heroics and stellar scholarship, residents here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously a kid with a lot of problems. Pretty messed
up,'' said Lindsay Rose, president of Westwood High's Class of '96.
``It's so unbelievable that he came out of such a nice town. You
just never know what's going on in some people's head.''

REBATES OFTEN TOUGH TO REALLY GET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JONATHAN SIDENER   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh. It sounds like a nice word, doesn't it? It conjures up
mental images of cash back in your pocket after making a purchase.
And cash in your pocket is always nice.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, these days the term ``rebate'' has become a dirty word,
especially among computer users who are inundated every day with
rebate offers on television, on radio, in magazines and in
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you've seen the offers. Many, for example, offer $30, $40
or more in rebates if you buy software or hardware at full price
and then mail in the rebate application with your proof of purchase
(and, sometimes, the bar code from the box).
</P>
<P>
   Some offers go so far as to promise consumers that their final
cost _ after they receive their rebate _ will be zero.
</P>
<P>
   Who can pass that up? Not many.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why law enforcement agencies, corporate
executives, consumer groups and media outlets across the country
are getting complaints from consumers angry over rebate offers gone
bad.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of most complaints: Somebody bought something, sent in
the required information but never received any rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers tell tales of waiting six to nine months with no
sign of a rebate. Some have documented countless telephone calls,
faxes, certified letters and other efforts to claim the money they
are owed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the tale of Barry, a Valley resident who bought three
items at a Tempe electronics store nine months ago. All three came
with rebate coupons. He applied for all three rebates, but has yet
to receive anything.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to resolve the situation by dealing directly with the
Tempe retailer, Barry says he has run into constant roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told (the store's representative) that I would be
filing this matter in small claims court, she took that information
to her superiors,'' Barry wrote in an e-mail to me last week.
``Their response was (and I'm quoting her), `So that's what he'll
have to do then.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barry said he's had trouble getting rebates before, but it was
nothing like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the ones that I have sent in, I have had to chase over 60
percent of them with repeated phone calls to get them to finally
deliver,'' he wrote. ``But I have never encountered a company that
has just outrightly snubbed their nose and said, in effect, `Go
pound sand.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest explanation for the trouble Barry and others have
encountered is that rebate offers are just too popular. Too many
people are asking for too many rebates, and the companies hired to
handle much of the job, called ``fulfillment houses,'' are
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question rebate programs work. That's why we see so
many of them, whether they're attached to the sales of computers,
dishwashers or travel packages. I found an online reference to one
offer that forced a company in the computer business to cough up
$75,000 in rebates in just one week.
</P>
<P>
   But, as you might guess, there's more to the story than just
overwhelmed fulfillment houses.
</P>
<P>
   First, many rebate programs run into trouble due to scam
artists. CNNFN reported that rebate fraud costs American businesses
upward of $500 million every year. A U.S. Postal Service fraud
investigation a few years ago found up to 75 percent of rebate
claims it reviewed during the investigation were fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to legitimate rebate requests, many end up in the
trash heap because the consumer failed to follow the rules, usually
by not filling out the rebate form properly or by missing a
deadline for rebate requests. The smallest error can be enough
reason to deny a request.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are rebate offers that nobody intended to honor.
I can't name names. Law enforcement authorities are tight-lipped
when it comes to discussing ongoing investigations. But some of the
rebate horror stories I've heard and read about leave no other
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of rebate problems fall into a huge gray area.
These involve rebate requests that disappear in the mail, never to
be heard from again. Sometimes, fulfillment houses claim they never
received the paperwork. Sometimes, consumers are told to be
patient, that rebates will arrive in another six or eight weeks. Of
course, they usually don't.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many consumers forget about the rebates or just give
up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who suggest that's exactly what some companies
want consumers to do _ give up. And that could be true. It's been
suggested by industry insiders that some companies purposely make
it difficult to redeem rebate coupons in order to save themselves
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation could be that the companies in question
simply turned over their rebate programs to the cheapest
fulfillment house they can find, and then fail to monitor whether
the fulfillment houses are doing their jobs properly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, you have to admit that applying for and
actually getting a rebate these days takes attention to detail, a
lot of patience and a bucket of luck.
</P>
<P>
   When rebate offers go bad, consumers across the country are
starting to seek legal help. The Arizona Attorney General's Office
reports that 212 people filed rebate-related complaints in the
state in 1998. And 27 more have been filed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the complaints end up? That's hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Attorney General's Office won't comment on
particulars of any case, and won't confirm whether it's
investigating anything. My guess is that the office is busy with
big-ticket crimes and isn't spending a whole lot of time on Mr.
Consumer's complaint that he's owed $25 in rebates.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a consumer to do? Here are some basics I've put
together after researching this topic online and talking with
experts in consumer issues and with the Arizona Attorney General's
Office:
</P>
<P>
   - Don't count on a rebate to make a purchase worth your while.
If you really need a new hard drive, look for one with a sticker
price you can afford. Then, if it comes with a rebate, and you
actually get the rebate, great.
</P>
<P>
   - If you buy something with a significant rebate attached, don't
leave the store until you've asked about the rebate process. Do
they handle it themselves? Do they farm it out to a fulfillment
house? Who do you call if there are rebate problems?
</P>
<P>
   - Read rebate instructions carefully before you buy. Make sure
the deadline has not yet passed. And watch out for other tricky
requirements. Some rebate offers are honored only if the product is
purchased from authorized resellers, and not every retail store is
authorized to resell everything.
</P>
<P>
   - Fill out the rebate form carefully. Print your name, address
and other information so it can be easily read.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't forget to include required documentation, such as sales
receipts and/or the bar code from the box.
</P>
<P>
   - Make copies of everything. If the rebate disappears, you'll
have nothing to go on if you mailed off the originals and didn't
make copies.
</P>
<P>
   - Does the rebate offer require the original receipt? If so,
make sure the retail store will accept a copy of your receipt as
proof of purchase should you have to return the product.
</P>
<P>
   - If the rebate never materializes, contact the retail store.
They might not even know that their customers are having problems
with the rebates. Another reason to call is the chance that the
store might step in and pay you your rebate if it doesn't come
after a reasonable period.
</P>
<P>
   - If you run into problems, keep good records of every effort
you make to resolve the issue. Note any phone calls, letters or
other steps you take.
</P>
<P>
   - If trying to resolve a rebate problem, make sure you are
calling the correct place or sending e-mail to the correct person.
Misdirected communication is often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't hesitate to contact authorities if you feel you have
been defrauded. &QL;

STOCK RISES ON HEWLETT-PACKARD'S DECISION TO SPLIT INTO 2
COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Responding to the ever-shifting fortunes of
high-technology industries, Hewlett-Packard Co., the cornerstone of
California's Silicon Valley, announced Tuesday that it would split
into two independent companies, one focusing on computers, printers
and scanners, the other on electronic test equipment and medical
technology products.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street greeted the move enthusiastically, sending
Hewlett-Packard shares up $2.75, to close at $68.625 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the split would allow Hewlett-Packard's computer
and imaging businesses to compete more effectively with more
focused companies that have lower cost structures, like the Dell
Computer Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Lexmark International
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hewlett-Packard's reputation was built on the quality
of its test and measurement equipment _ not to mention its
legendary founding in the iconic Palo Alto garage 60 years ago _
that business has been marked by higher overhead and slower growth
than the company had realized in computers, printers and scanners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has been in too many businesses,'' said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``H.P. has actually done
surprisingly well through the years with a diversified business,
but the time has come for this kind of step. I think it should be a
shareholder-enriching event.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has struggled to meet its own or analysts'
estimates of revenue growth, although it beat earnings estimates in
the most recent quarter through rigorous cost-cutting. Test and
measurement, which also includes medical products like ultrasound,
patient monitoring devices and heart defibrillators, had averaged
better than 10 percent revenue growth over the last decade, but in
the most recent fiscal year, growth dropped to 1 percent, because
of the Asian economic crisis and a slowdown in the semiconductor
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have quite a collection of businesses under one roof,
which have become increasingly divergent in terms of their business
models, the way they go to market, and the customers they serve,''
Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   After the split, the computer and imaging company will continue
to be known as the Hewlett-Packard Co., while a new name will be
chosen for the measurement company. Hewlett-Packard plans a public
offering of 15 percent of the measurement company's outstanding
shares by year-end, which would be the largest initial public
offering in Silicon Valley history. The measurement business,
including chemical-analysis and medical businesses, represented
$7.6 billion of Hewlett-Packard's total revenue of $47.1 billion in
fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus we get from being separate will help our outbound
message,'' said Platt. ``What can you say about a company like
H.P.?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he said, Sun Microsystems, a major competitor in
large network server computers, ``is out there with just one
message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity and confusion of having all these businesses
under one roof outweigh the synergy of having them all together,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, 58, said he would remain chief executive until
Hewlett-Packard's separation was completed. That is expected to
take 12 to 18 months. A search for a successor is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the printer business, where Hewlett-Packard has a
commanding market share, the company has struggled to own any
particular market segment the way Sun is identified with the
Internet, Dell with personal computers or IBM with large enterprise
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that while Hewlett-Packard has credible offerings
in all of those markets, it has lacked a coherent strategy to
address any one of them. What is not clear is whether spinning off
test and measurement will change that picture, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think test and measurement is the crown jewel,''
said James Moore, chief executive of Geopartners Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Test and measurement is where the technology
tends to be, where a lot of the talent tends to be. The problem is
on the PC side. It was a great mistake for them to plunge so
heavily into PC's. They and Compaq got into a price war, and what
neither company understood was that Dell was hitting them in a
blind spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell has grabbed market share from Compaq Computer and
Hewlett-Packard with a combination of a direct sales model, which
eliminates the overhead of dealers and distributors, and custom
configuration, which allows it to sell machines at higher average
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Platt said the companies' business models were actually
coming closer together. ``Dell's out now very aggressively
recruiting dealers and distributors to help them serve customers
who prefer to be served that way,'' he said. ``While we started out
with very different multitier strategies, we are converging.''
</P>
<P>
   At $10.2 billion, revenues in Hewlett-Packard's computer
business increased 3 percent over last year; in contrast Dell grew
sales by 38 percent in the same period. At the same time, revenue
from the measurement organization declined 11 percent, with test
and measurement down 14 percent, chemical-analysis up 8 percent,
and medical-products down 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Platt said one quarter's results did not drive the decision to
split the company, but he conceded that they might have been a
factor. ``If we'd had quite a wonderful year, maybe there would
have been less urgency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward W. Barnholt, Hewlett-Packard's executive vice president
and general manager of the measurement organization, has been named
chief executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work very hard to be an $8 billion start-up that will
compete very effectively with companies of all sizes,'' Barnholt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever name is eventually chosen for the new company, he said,
it will likely reflect the legacy of Hewlett-Packard. ``We
certainly want to build on the heritage of H.P.,'' he said. ``We
don't want to leave that equity behind.''

SENATE PANEL'S REPORT DETAILS Y2K THREAT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By GREG McDONALD  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No need for alarm yet, but the nation's lawmakers
are worried that on midnight Dec. 31 all hell could break loose if
the so-called Year 2000 computer bug is not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A special Senate committee charged with investigating the Y2K
problem released a report Tuesday detailing disturbances that could
occur nationwide and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although rating the possibility as ``low-to-medium,'' the panel
report raised the specter of everything from an accidental Russian
nuclear missile launch to civil unrest brought on by economic
collapse in some countries. All this as a result of tiny computer
chips in many systems failing to process information correctly
because they were not built to recognize the calendar year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel also warned that there could be minor to
significant disruptions in everything from utility services and
health care delivery systems to transportation and general business
operations. Disruptions in food distribution, energy and water
systems also could occur because governments and businesses have
failed to prepare for the possibility that many computer systems,
which use a two-digit dating method for data storage, may read the
year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Americans, especially in rural areas, could
experience limited, short-term problems in services considered
crucial to their modern-day lives, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K threat is real and heightened by the ubiquity of
microchips and our dependence on just-in-time delivery for
everything from groceries to medicine,'' said Sen. Bob Bennett,
R-Utah, who chairs the special Y2K committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said the problems would amount to only ``a bump
in the road'' as the world enters the new millennium. ``It will not
be crippling, and it will not last for an undue length of time,''
he said at a news conference held to release the panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   In a move aimed at helping some of America's smaller businesses
prepare for the year 2000, the Senate voted 99-0 Tuesday to provide
up to $500 million in loans through the end of this year to
companies that could be significantly affected or forced out of
business because of Y2K problems. The money will be used in most
cases to help companies fix their own computer systems and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee vice chairman, Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., cautioned Americans against panic, saying that they ought
to prepare for the Year 2000 as if they were readying for a
hurricane or winter storm, not the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, he said it would be a good idea for Americans
to put aside some canned goods and water, and perhaps a little cash
as well, to help them cross that bridge _ to quote President
Clinton _ into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for stockpiling,'' Dodd stressed, adding that
``a few days of water and food'' should be sufficient to get people
through in areas that might be affected more severely by power
outages or other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, however, said predicting what will happen is difficult.
``We are guessing here, as everyone is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd predicted that there would be no widespread power outages.
At worst, he said, there would be minimal failures for up to 72
hours or less in areas where smaller utility companies may not have
the resources to devote to Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the committee found that most of the nation's 3,200
independent utility companies are behind in their efforts to
address the problem. But the panel's report notes that the electric
utility industry ``as a whole is configured to handle
interruptions, blackouts and natural disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A prolonged, nationwide blackout is not likely to occur,'' the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers are not particularly concerned about power
problems, they are worried about the possibility of serious
interruptions in the nation's health care system, which was found
to be lagging in efforts to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dodd said that 90 percent of the nation's
hospitals, and especially those in rural and inner-city areas, have
not begun to address potential problems if computer systems fail or
the microchips used in life support and analysis systems
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The committee described the U.S. health care industry as ``the
worst prepared ... for the Y2K glitch'' and noted that the lag in
correcting the problems could interrupt the supply chain of
pharmaceuticals that hospitals, clinics and even drug stores rely
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the health care industry's lack of
preparedness will necessarily mean the loss of life, but it could
seriously impact care for millions of Americans dependent on
prescription drugs and regular medical treatments to stay
healthy,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   He also raised concerns about the government's Medicare program,
which he said had not carried out any testing to determine whether
its payment delivery system will continue to work. ``We can only
hope that Medicare's billion-dollars-a-day in payments to hospitals
and caregivers continue to find their way through the high-tech
maze,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report also emphasized what it described as the
``high probability'' of economic disruptions in Latin America, Asia
and Africa. It also singled out Venezuela and Saudi Arabia as key
world oil suppliers that are at least a year or more behind in
preparing for potential Y2K problems. In addition, Japan, Mexico,
China, Germany and Taiwan were cited as being behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett emphasized that the failure of other countries to
address potential problems could have a severe impact on the world
``because of the interconnectedness of our information systems in
every economic sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who sponsored the bill aimed at
helping small businesses fix Y2K bugs, told lawmakers that the
``outlook is not good'' for the nation's small-business owners as
the new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many small companies have not yet begun to realize how much of
a problem Y2K failures could be for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill must be approved by the House to become law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee also began consideration Monday
of another controversial measure that would limit the amount of
damages awarded in Y2K-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Various estimates of how much it will cost the U.S. government
and private sector to address the Y2K problem ranges from a low of
$50 billion to a high of $150 billion.

 New Rules Try To Bring Order to Tracking Web Ads  
 By Carol Emert   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a big step toward imposing order on the wild and woolly world
of Internet advertising, an industry group yesterday published
voluntary guidelines for tracking the viewership of Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Web sites, ad-serving networks like DoubleClick and
third-party tracking services such as Media Metrix employ vastly
different methods and technologies to measure the viewership of a
given Web ad. The varying results frustrate advertisers, who need a
reliable system for evaluating who is seeing their messages and how
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the top reasons advertisers aren't putting more
money into the Web,'' said Jim Spaeth, a member of the FAST (Future
of Advertising Stakeholders) Steering Committee, which developed
the guidelines (posted at www.fastinfo.org). ``There's really been
chaos in measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   The new protocol is designed to standardize audience tracking
across the Web and also bring it in line with conventional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is comparability,'' said Spaeth. ``When a media
planner sits down to do a plan for the brand, he looks at outdoor
and radio and magazines and matchbook covers and online. If the
data for all of them don't reflect the same comparative value, the
planner has no way of judging'' which media will meet his
viewership goals.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed standards catch on, Web ad measurements should
be accurate within 5 percent, according to FAST. A 45-day comment
period on the protocol began yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the initiative's key elements is its definition of the
impression, the basic unit of Web audience measurement.
</P>
<P>
   FAST defined an impression as an ``opportunity to see,'' which
means that the ad appeared on a page that was viewed by a Web
surfer, even if the visitor did not necessarily see the ad. For
example, if an ad appears at the bottom of a page and the visitor
never scrolls to the bottom, it is still counted as an impression.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chose this criterion, although inexact, because it
is used by other media. Television viewership, for example, is
based simply on whether the tube is turned on, not on whether
anyone is actually watching it.
</P>
<P>
   The FAST standards also address one of the biggest hurdles in
counting impressions, which is caused by a process called
``caching.''
</P>
<P>
   Caching happens when elements of a Web site are automatically
stored in a computer's memory to make downloading quicker on the
next visit. But most Web trackers can't measure the later visits.
This glitch causes a significant undercounting of ad and site
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of NETADS03 () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that visits using cache memory are counted, the FAST
group proposed that every Internet ad be embedded with a code to
alert the site where it appears that it has been viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Briggs, a vice president of Millward Brown Interactive, a
Web marketing research firm, said the guidelines are important
because they ``make the ground rules clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But bigger questions remain about the effectiveness of Web ads,
he said. ``What the senior marketing people are hung up on is
whether (the Web) is the most effective way to reach consumers and
how it can be used to build relationships with consumers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   FAST is supported by the Advertising Research Foundation, which
Spaeth chairs; the Internet Advertising Bureau; and major
advertiser and ad agency trade associations.

 &HT;    Sugar meltdown recipes
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's start with true confessions. When I tried to
make my first caramel sauce last year, it took three attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, I cooked the sugar and water too long and it
scorched. The second time, I was gun-shy and didn't cook the
mixture long enough. It was thin, runny and lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   The third time _ I discovered the candy thermometer. I brought
the mixture to about 340 degrees, and then pulled it off the fire.
</P>
<P>
   It was deliciously right on, and I've made it several times
since.
</P>
<P>
   This confession is intended to encourage you, not dissuade you.
It's also intended to wink you in on a few secrets so maybe your
first time with bronzing sugar will be a success.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a heavy-bottomed saucepan. This is essential to allow the
sugar to dissolve and cook to the high heat required without
burning.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recipes that call for adding a little water to the sugar are
usually easier, according to Rose Levy Beranbaum, author of ``The
Cake Bible'' (Morrow, $30) and ``The Pie and Pastry Bible''
(Scribner, $35). Both give detailed directions for caramelizing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Our recipe tester Margaret Ann Surber suggests that if you
remove the spoon from the mixture at any point, rinse it off or get
a new spoon before returning it to the pan to stir. Sugar can
crystallize on the spoon. Also, early in the process, you may want
to brush the sides of the pan down with a pastry brush to clear any
crystals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure sugar completely dissolves before you bring the
mixture to a boil. Stir constantly until boiling begins. At this
point, things will start moving fast, so you may want to turn the
heat down a little to finish it at a slower pace, occasionally
swirling the pan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use an accurate candy thermometer. Sugar caramelizes between
330 and 350 degrees. Beyond that, it will taste scorched and
bitter. Less than that and it will be pale and thin (though some
recipes may call for such a light syrup).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep a pan of cold water nearby that you can set the caramel
pan in once you remove it from the heat in order to stop the
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   To practice, we recommend the recipes for old-fashioned caramel
cake and the caramel pots de creme.
</P>
<P>
   Caramelizing vegetables and fruits is somewhat easier.
Generally, dry-heat cooking methods are used (which often involve
fats). Floataway Cafe chef Anne Quatrano likes to start with a high
heat to give a little sear to the veggies, but she reduces the heat
quickly, and then cooks slowly. Practice with Quatrano's recipe for
caramelized turnips. They go great with pork chops. We also offer a
recipe for pork tenderloin and caramelized apples that's a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Because meats and fish don't have significant natural sugars,
sugars have to be added in order to caramelize. Sweet marinades
work; so does coating in sugar, searing, and then deglazing the pan
with a liqueur/soy sauce mixture, as with the caramelized salmon
recipe. It's unforgettable.

   Caramel Pots de Creme
</P>
<P>
   Makes 7 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: about 1 hour Chilling time: several hours
</P>
<P>
   Here's our adaptation of Floataway Cafe's popular caramel pots
de creme. It's an excellent recipe to practice the caramelizing
technique _ its base is the caramel syrup. And how can you go wrong
with the addition of cream and eggs? Rich and rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   1cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   2cups heavy
</P>
<P>
   cream
</P>
<P>
   1cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup water
</P>
<P>
   6egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, combine half-and-half and cream and heat
almost to a simmer. Turn off heat. Meanwhile put sugar and water in
a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over lowest possible heat
until sugar has dissolved completely. The mixture must not come to
a boil before all the sugar crystals have dissolved. You may stir
gently during this process to make sure it melts evenly, but you
must rinse the spoon or use a clean spoon each time to prevent
reintroducing sugar crystals into the mixture. When sugar has
dissolved, increase heat to medium-high and boil until a deep
caramel color is reached, at about 340 degrees. Be patient; this
process may take up to 25 minutes. Cover your hand with a towel and
very slowly add the hot cream and half-and-half mixture into the
caramelized sugar. Slowly whisk a third of the hot caramel-cream
mixture into egg yolks to temper. Pour yolk-and-cream mixture back
into the remaining hot caramel cream. Strain and pour into seven
4-ounce ramekins or pots de creme pots. Put ramekins in a baking
pan and fill pan with water halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake 25
to 30 minutes or until set. Cool slightly, then refrigerate for
several hours.

</P>
<P>
   This very old-fashioned recipe comes from the recent rerelease
of the 1950 ``Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book'' (Macmillan,
$27.95). Where else could we get such an old-fashioned recipe _
always a blue ribbon winner at the county fairs? This calls for the
trickier dry method of burning sugar _ so be sure to use a very
heavy-bottomed pan (I've even used an iron skillet). Serve it
within a day.
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/3cups granulated sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup boiling water
</P>
<P>
   Additional cool tap water
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup soft vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   3eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2cups sifted cake flour or 2 1/3 cups sifted all-purpose
flour
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   For the caramel icing:
</P>
<P>
   Reserved caramelized sugar (from cake recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4to 4 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   For the cake: Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, then
line with rounds of wax paper. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Caramelize 1 cup sugar by placing it in a medium-size, heavy pan
over medium-low heat. Melt, stirring constantly, for about 10
minutes, until a straw-colored syrup forms. Remove pan from heat
immediately. Slowly add the 1/2 cup boiling water, stirring
constantly, being careful to avoid spatters and steam. Stir until
lumps dissolve. (If lumps remain, reheat for 10 to 15 minutes,
covered, on low heat.) Pour 1/4 cup of the caramelized sugar into a
measuring cup and add enough extra cool tap water to make one cup
liquid. Reserve remaining caramelized sugar for the icing.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and remaining 1 1/3
cups granulated sugar on high speed of electric mixer. Add eggs and
mix thoroughly. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking
powder and salt. On low speed, stir flour mixture into shortening
mixture alternately with caramel liquid. Mix until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Pour batter into prepared pans and bake 25-30 minutes or until
toothpick comes out clean. Cool on wire racks 10 minutes, then
remove from pans and cool completely, about 1 hour. Frost with
Caramel Icing.
</P>
<P>
   For caramel icing: Add enough cream to reserved caramel mixture
to equal 1/2 cup. Place in a small saucepan with butter and heat
until butter melts. Pour into large mixing bowl and gradually beat
in confectioners' sugar, salt and vanilla on medium sped of
electric mixer. Adjust for spreading consistency using cream to
thin or confectioners' sugar to thicken.

   On any given day at Floataway Cafe, the caramelized onion pizza

buttery onions, pungent cheese and salty pancetta. Here, we give
you an adaptation developed by food tester Linda Hogue. It allows
for the quickest possible way to caramelize onions, but the truth
is, if you turn the heat down low and let them cook for 20 minutes
to an hour, you'll get an even sweeter result.
</P>
<P>
   4medium onions, thinly sliced (about 5 cups)
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4ounces pancetta (Italian bacon) or Canadian bacon, cut in small
pieces
</P>
<P>
   6ounces crumbled blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh sage
</P>
<P>
   leaves
</P>
<P>
   For the pizza dough:
</P>
<P>
   2cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1package ( 1/4-ounce) quick-rise yeast
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup warm water (110-115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   Caramelize onions by cooking in a Dutch oven with butter over
medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or over lower heat for a longer
period. Stir occasionally; remove from heat when onions are soft
and brown, but not too dark. Reserve onions and prepared pancetta,
blue cheese and sage leaves while making dough.
</P>
<P>
   For the dough: In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt and
yeast. Stir in warm water and olive oil until blended and dough
comes away from side of bowl. Turn out on lightly floured board and
knead 5 minutes. Shape dough into 2 balls; cover and let rest 15
minutes. Roll or pat each dough ball into two 10-inch rounds and
place on pizza pans or cookie sheets sprinkled with cornmeal (to
prevent sticking). Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Spread onions
evenly over the dough, then top with pancetta, blue cheese and
sage. Cover and let rise 15 minutes. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes
until dough is cooked and cheese is soft and lightly browned.
Remove to cutting surface and slice to serve.

</P>
<P>
   Deborah Madison borrowed this recipe from famed chef Barbara
Tropp to include in ``Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone'' (Broadway
Books, $35), and we understand why. The beauty of tofu is the way
it soaks up flavors. Here the flavors are darkly sweet and slightly
salty. Serve over rice or as a side to a nice veggie stir-fry.
</P>
<P>
   11-pound package Chinese-style firm tofu, cut in slabs about 3/4
inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2tablespoons light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   Drain tofu, then blot with paper towels. Cut in 3/4-inch cubes.
Heat the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over fairly high heat.
Add the tofu and fry several minutes, turning occasionally until
golden, about 15 minutes. While they should color, don't let them
get dry and hard. Sprinkle lightly with salt.
</P>
<P>
   While tofu is cooking, mix the soy sauce and sugar in a small
bowl. Heat a wok or heavy skillet, add a tablespoon of the oil used
to fry the tofu or fresh peanut oil, and swirl it around the wok or
pan. When hot, add the soy sauce mixture, reduce heat to medium and
add the tofu. Toss well, then simmer for 2 minutes. Add water and
cook until the sauce coats the tofu with a syrupy glaze. Turn off
the heat. Let the tofu cool in the syrup for 10 minutes, then
transfer to a serving dish.

   I often travel to Southern California, and when I get the
chance, I love to eat at Walt's Wharf in Seal Beach. My favorite
there is chef Mark Tydell's caramelized salmon. I admit when I saw
the recipe, I was a little daunted. While there are several steps,
each is really simple. The cilantro/ginger rub and the balsamic soy
sauce can be prepared a day ahead. I'd recommend trying the recipe
completely at least once, and serve over garlic mashed potatoes.
But for a quick fix, you can skip the balsamic soy stripe and the
lemon grass buerre blanc.
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup finely chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   4skinless salmon fillets (6 to 8 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   For the balsamic soy stripe:
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup low-sodium soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   For the lemon grass beurre blanc:
</P>
<P>
   1cup white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   2medium shallots, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   2stalks lemon grass, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup unsalted butter, cut in tablespoon-size pieces (1 1/2
sticks)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and white pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the Grand Marnier glaze:
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup low-sodium soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup Grand Marnier
</P>
<P>
   For the caramelizing coating:
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   5turns cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Combine cilantro and ginger. Coat salmon fillets with mixture
and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   For the balsamic soy stripe: In a small saucepan, combine the
1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar over medium heat.
Reduce until thickened to about 3 tablespoons, about 15 minutes.
Refrigerate. (Can be made a day ahead of time.)
</P>
<P>
   Just before cooking the salmon, make lemon beurre blanc: Combine
the white wine vinegar, rice wine vinegar, wine, shallots and lemon
grass in a medium saucepan and reduce over medium-high heat until
liquid is almost gone, 15-20 minutes. Add the cream, return to
boil, then reduce heat to low and begin whisking in butter, a few
tablespoons at a time, until all is incorporated and sauce is
smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Reserve warm until ready to
use.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook the salmon, combine 1/4 soy sauce and Grand
Mariner in a cup and set aside. Heat oil in a skillet over
medium-high heat. Combine black pepper and sugar in a dish. Press
one side of the salmon fillets into the mixture. Saute, sugar side
down, to caramelize the sugar, about 2 to 3 minutes. Quickly,
before the sugar turns, pour the Grand Marnier glaze into the pan,
swirling and stirring well to dissolve the caramelized bits.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the salmon over. Lower the heat to medium. Cover the pan
and let the salmon finish cooking 5 to 8 minutes longer, until
medium. Place the finished fillets over a bed of garlic mashed
potatoes. Ladle lemon grass beurre blanc over and around the
salmon. Drizzle a decorative pattern of the balsamic soy stripe
over the sauce.

   Pork Tenderloin With Caramelized Apples and Apple-Brandy Cream
Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Prep time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is versatile _ you can substitute pears, pear brandy
and pear nectar. But we like the classic apple version. The
caramelized apples here pair so well with the pork; and the thyme
in the cream sauce is just the right accent.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4pounds pork tenderloin, trimmed, cut crosswise in
1-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   4apples, peeled, halved, cored, cut in 1/3-inch wedges
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4teaspoons dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup Calvados or Applejack
</P>
<P>
   1cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup apple cider
</P>
<P>
   Place pork slices between pieces of plastic wrap. Using meat
mallet, pound pork slices to 1/4-inch thickness. Set aside. Melt 2
tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add
apples and sugar; saute until apples are tender and deep golden,
about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 1 tablespoon butter in another large nonstick skillet over
high heat. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Working in batches,
add pork to skillet; saute just until cooked through, about 2
minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Cover. Return skillet to
medium heat. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Add shallots and
thyme; saute 2 minutes. Add Calvados; boil until reduced to glaze,
scraping any browned bits, about 2 minutes. Add cream and apple
cider; boil until thickened to sauce consistency, about 5 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper. Reheat apples if necessary. Spoon into
center of platter. Arrange pork around pears. Pour sauce over pork.

   Chef Anne Quatrano gave us a lesson on caramelizing in her
kitchen at Floataway Cafe. These turnips made a bed for a thick

variation, try this same recipe with two pounds of fennel, thickly
sliced.

 &HT;    Sugar meltdown
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You see the description on the menu _ caramelized _
and in an instant, you're a kid again on the midway at the county
fair. Your mom is trying to get you enthused about the pig races,
but you're too busy crunching into that caramel apple, smacking up
the sticky-sweet bronzed coating.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you recall that caramel square wrapped in cellophane
your grandfather slipped you with a wink. The sugar melts in your
mouth; your heart melts for Pops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so nostalgic and homey. Everybody loves the idea of
caramelizing,'' said Anne Quatrano, chef and owner of Floataway
Cafe and Bacchanalia along with partner Clifford Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the carrot at the bottom of the roast beef pan,'' she
explains. ``You know, that sweet taste followed by the slightly
burnt flavor _ that little taste of the fire at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   That little taste of the sweet tinged with fire is being touted
on more and more restaurant menus these days, so much so that Food
&AMP; Wine magazine spotted caramelizing as a top menu trend for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There it is on the Park 75 menu at the Four Seasons Hotel _ a
parfait with mango sorbet and caramelized bananas. Canoe is serving
a cake topped with a ring of caramelized fresh pineapple. At
Floataway, a tart with caramelized lemon slices and the classic
caramel pots de creme are favorites.
</P>
<P>
   But Floataway also demonstrates that caramelizing isn't just for
the dessert card. A big seller at lunch is a blue cheese and
caramelized onion pizza. At dinner, a hearty pork chop arrives on a
bed of caramelized turnips.
</P>
<P>
   While hot at the moment, caramelizing is hardly new. It's hard
to pinpoint who was the first to burn sugar, but the first mention
of caramel in English print comes in 1725, according to the
Dictionary of American Food and Drink.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, caramelizing is the melting or burning of sugar.
Sugar will liquefy and become a syrup in colors from golden to dark
brown when it reaches a range of temperatures of 320 degrees to 350
degrees. Beyond that it burns.
</P>
<P>
   This is the caramelizing we are most familiar with _ it's the
foundation of the candy coating on the apple, the blue-ribbon
``burnt sugar'' cake or the creme brulee with a mottled paper-thin
crust of sugar on the top.
</P>
<P>
   But for foods with natural sugars, like many fruits and
vegetables, the process of browning slowly in a dry heat or with
fat is caramelizing. The sugars are unlocked to reveal a sweet
taste and a bronze sheen. Meats and fish can be caramelized, too,
with the addition of sugars to the marinating and browning
processes.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Royal, chef of the Angus Barn in Raleigh, recently shared
his grandmother's secret for a caramelized pot roast _ 7-Up.
``She'd dust the roast in flour and brown it on all sides, then put
it in a Dutch oven with vegetables, add a can of 7-Up and roast.
The sugars of the 7-Up would caramelize, and it was so delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, if only caramelizing could be so easy all the time. The fact
is, many home cooks avoid it because it is tricky and takes time
and practice.
</P>
<P>
   Turning table sugar into a caramel syrup can be most difficult.
A pan with a heavy bottom is essential _ that allows the sugar to
melt without burning. So is a watchful eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``One split second can make a difference. You have to go far
enough without going too far,'' Quatrano said. ``People get nervous
and the most common mistake is stopping too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   That will yield a syrup too thin for many recipes; going too far
will yield a completely scorched and bitter syrup. Practice _ and
an accurate candy thermometer _ will make perfect. And the effort
will be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing natural sugars out of vegetables and fruits is easier.
Root vegetables such as turnips and carrots and fruits like apples
and pears lend themselves gracefully to the method. The key here is
cooking slowly at a low heat without the moisture of water or
steam. Onions are one of the best foods to caramelize _ they add a
special touch to everyday pizzas, burgers and omelets. But for
many, the thought of cooking onions for an hour seems too
troublesome. Quatrano believes the taste will change the attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to shy away from caramelizing because it takes
time,'' Quatrano said. ``But it's time well rewarded.''

 &HT;    Quick and easy-does-it dishes
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something a little melancholy about that TV commercial
that shows the little boy and his mom coming into a rather gloomy
kitchen, obviously after a long day at work for her and day care or
preschool for him. While he is sitting at the table looking
wistfully at his mom, she reaches into the freezer for what looks
like a frozen pizza. She then looks down at his cute little face,
has a guilt attack, says something like, ``I'm going to make you a
real meal tonight'' and reaches for a can of soup. Cut to the next
scene, where mom and kid are talking over a feebly steaming bowl of
tomato soup and she says something like, ``What did you learn in
school today?'' and he says, ``How to share. . . . '' The end.
</P>
<P>
   It almost breaks your heart. Not that there is a thing wrong
with tomato soup. But just how much wattage can a can of soup
generate in a house that has been empty all day and badly needs an
infusion of warmth?
</P>
<P>
   Taking only a few minutes' more time than it took mom to zap
that soup, there easily could have been another scenario _ one
filled with the sounds of food being prepared, with a child eagerly
helping, savoring aromas coming from sizzling and bubbling pots and
pans.
</P>
<P>
   Then the anticipation of good things to come is followed by the
security and feeling of well-being that come from a full tummy and
a mom or dad who's there to fill it. All in all it's a far better
stage to engage in some real quality time and genuine sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of time, energy or extended family to pitch in no longer is
a valid rationalization for not putting together a family meal at
least a couple of times a week _ not with the Internet standing
ready to provide help for time-starved cooks.
</P>
<P>
   The first (and maybe only) place you need to visit is the Mining
Company, which provides hundreds of experts they call ``guides''
that mine the Web, gleaning and organizing the best sites you are
interested in and saving you time. Lynn Nelson is the guide for
busy cooks at http://busycooks.miningco
</P>
<P>
   .com/ and she practically takes you by the hand spelling out how
many minutes in the day and week are necessary to plan for and make
a family meal.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wonderful free weekly e-mail newsletter that
features information on quantity cooking for the freezer and how
you can spend one weekend a month in the kitchen and take the rest
of the month off.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the table of contents for a jolt of inspiration and
confidence that no matter how busy you are, you need not give short
shrift to this vital family function. There is help, and it's here.
</P>
<P>
   Another great site is ``Fast Frugal and Fabulous'' at
http://www.fabulousfoods.com/recipes/fast/fast.html, which gives
menus and step-by-step instructions for dinners that you can whip
up for less than $15 and in under 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At http://www.ivillage.com/content/0,1625,2099(tilde)188,00.html
you will find 15-minute meals and a useful menu maker that creates
a full dinner menu in a click and includes a shopping list,
suggestions on how kids can help and how to use leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget about that soup. Go to
http://www.campbellkitchen.com/recipesearch.asp. and click for
recipes taking 30 minutes and you will be faced with a whopping 562

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ As we ambled around a mountain village in
south Lebanon recently, our Lebanese translator attempted a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to an Israeli encampment on a hill nearby, he suggested
that the two journalists in our little group take the lead.
Otherwise, he quipped, the Israelis might spot our Hezbollah guide
and open fire.
</P>
<P>
   But, our guide hardly looked like a target in a guerrilla war.
Clean-cut in his slacks and sweater, he was the best-dressed of our
bunch. And, he was working his cellular telephone -- one with a
microphone that dangles from the ear -- like any good PR man does.
</P>
<P>
   He works in the Hezbollah press office and is trying to spruce
up the Party of God's image in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Hezbollah killed seven Israelis, including a
brigadier general, their press machine was in high gear. They
displayed captured Israeli equipment, held press conferences and
released battlefield video.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of my recent trip to Lebanon, where I saw a
Hezbollah that has gone from kidnapping journalists to simply
``spinning'' them.

   Hezbollah was born in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon and took
over the nine-mile strip of that neighboring country's southern
border that it still occupies today. Iranian financing has kept it
going strong and constantly updating its warfare.

<P>
   It's a group on the hinge of world opinion. The Israelis and the

In Lebanon, they are considered heroes.

   Tin Hezbollah collection boxes, painted like the Dome of the

Beirut, the capital city. In Baalbek, a tourist town where
Hezbollah dominates, shops sell desktop Hezbollah flags. Several
party members serve in Lebanon's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   My trip to the south was confirmed sitting in a dingy office in
south Beirut with a Hezbollah sheikh, who was sporting a burgundy
blazer and tasseled loafers. He copied our passports and asked us
about the circulation of our newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave us glossy propaganda pamphlets. One showed e-mail
messages to Hezbollah's Internet home-page.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, our guide met us at a specified cafe and
took us to an unmarked office above a perfume shop in the port city
of Tyre. It's one of the safe houses Hezbollah maintains for
meeting outsiders.

<P>
   ``We hope the Americans will stop hating us,'' said Sheikh Nabil
Kaouk, Hezbollah's leader for southern Lebanon. ``We are dying from
American weapons (used by Israelis) and they don't feel guilty
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaouk, a tall 35-year-old, cuts an elegant figure in the brown
cape and turban-like headgear of Shiite Moslem clerics. He spoke
politely while aides served us strawberry juice.
</P>
<P>
   We covered politics and Hezbollah history. When questioned about
his family, Kaouk talked about a son who was getting married. But
then he got edgy and said we should not be discussing his family.
An occasional target of Israeli assassination attempts, he clearly
wondered about our intentions.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him why Hezbollah now meets with journalists rather
than kidnaps them, Kaouk denied that Hezbollah staged the
kidnappings. Those denials are widely refuted by experts.
</P>
<P>
   But, Kaouk said that just shows how Israel's supporters have
tarnished Hezbollah's reputation around the world. He asked us to

here.''

 &HT;    Dogwood welcomes spring with full-bodied bock beer
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brewing and religion have a long history, beginning
with monks who brewed for king and court and sometimes for God.
Less well-known is the place of Martin Luther, a pivotal figure in
the 16th-century Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor who nailed heretical edicts to the church door in
Wittenberg, challenging the authority of the pope, could enjoy a
stein of good German beer. In fact, Luther's portrait once adorned
the label of Einbeck beer. Michael Jackson tells us that Luther
``was twice fortified by gifts of Einbeck beer. One gift was for
his wedding; the second occasion was when he confronted (Emperor
Charles) at the Diet of Worms. Einbeck could hardly have conceived
a more effective advertising endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   These were bock beers, stronger brews served as the hard winter
of Northern Europe was yielding reluctantly to spring. But no one
thinks of Martin Luther when bock beer is poured. Instead,
Americans imagine something scraped from the bottom of the barrel.
Generations of beer drinkers have asked if bock wasn't the remnants
dredged up in anticipation of a new batch for spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two months I'll bet I've answered that question
once a week,'' Dogwood founder Crawford Moran says. ``So we have to
go over the story again.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how bock beer came to be imagined in that
way, and Germans aren't much more certain themselves. The best
guess, Jackson surmises, is that bock beer came to be identified
with the town of Einbeck in Lower Saxony, and that in time
``Einbeck beer'' was abbreviated to ``beck beer'' (having no
reference to Beck's Beer from Bremen). Among Bavarians, this guess
continues, ``beck beer'' came to sound like ``bock beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the name's origins, it's a beer for hearty appetites,
malty and full-bodied but not as rich or dark as the even stronger
Double Bocks. Lagers tend to have wider affinities with food than
ales, and bock is a natural complement to everything from smoked
sausages and sauerkraut to rack of lamb.
</P>
<P>
   When Moran and head brewer Matt Speece began thinking about a
spring beer, they wanted something to round out their lineup of
seasonals _ a Belgian White in summer, an Oktoberfest in fall and,
new last December, a winter ale brewed from barley, oats and rye.
Like the Oktoberfest, the bock would be available in draft only.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three seasonals knocked out,'' Moran says, ``and we
wanted to do something different. There aren't that many bocks on
the market, so we thought, `Why don't we try one?'''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the archaic state law that limits beer to 6 percent
alcohol by volume, Dogwood's isn't as strong as what you'd find in
Germany. Even so, it's a remarkably smooth lager that begins soft
on the palate and finishes with a toasty malt accent.
</P>
<P>
   In a spring brewing season that's barely under way, it's one of
the highlights. There might not be many. The beers of winter come
easily to mind, whether they be rich stouts and porters or a
supreme German Doppelbock such as Ayinger Celebrator. Summer beers
are no mystery either _ tart Belgian Whites, clovey hefeweizens,
crisp lagers in the Munich or Berlin style.
</P>
<P>
   But spring in the South suggests no style in particular _ which
is why the first of the spring beers on local shelves have no
common denominator. From Redhook comes a top-notch Nut Brown Ale;
from Bert Grant's, a zesty dry-hopped SpringFest Ale, brewed
exclusively with Yakima Valley Willamette hops; and from Samuel
Adams, a Kolsch-style beer simply called Spring Ale.
</P>
<P>
   None of these compares easily with the others, and even less do
they compare with a bock. A specifications sheet calls the Bert
Grant's a brown ale, but it's one only in the looser, Pacific
Northwest sense. It's delightfully hoppy for the style, and one of
the better beers this pioneering craft brewer has made.
</P>
<P>
   The Redhook, like all Redhook beers, is exquisitely polished,
with no rough edges. This is a brown ale in the English style, and
far superior to a marquee name such as Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
   If the Samuel Adams Spring Ale impresses least, it's only
because a Kolsch, the pride of Cologne, is among the most delicate
of all styles, light on the palate and yet not Lite in any sensual
way. Few American brewers have brought off a true Kolsch beer, but
Samuel Adams comes closer than most.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was how well a small Atlanta brewery
specializing in ales rather than lagers, handicapped by a state law
that knows nothing of brewing styles, could turn out so finished a
bock. Martin Luther was, by all accounts, a man of unbending
convictions, but he'd have blessed the brewers at Dogwood's.

 &HT;    Audio mini reviews
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton, Steve Dollar and Miriam Longino

   &QR;  POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Photograph Smile''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Lennon. 4tune/Pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   14 tracks. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe it's been almost 15 years since John Lennon's
first-born son released his debut album ``Valotte'' and amazed the
world with an uncanny vocal impression of his father. It's even
harder to believe that Julian, now 35, is still mimicking Dad, long
after the world has ceased to be amazed. ``Photograph Smile,'' the
younger Lennon's fifth album and his first following a seven-year
sojourn from the music business, takes its every idea from Papa
John's oeuvre _ both with the Beatles and solo. ``Cold,'' with its
vocal effects and grandiose strings, recalls ``Strawberry Fields
Forever'' and other Fab Four forays into psychedelic pop, and the
jangly tune ``I Don't Wanna Know'' sounds like an outtake from
``Help!'' But, as ever, Julian lacks fire; if his work
</P>
<P>
   was half as passionate as his father's, he might be on to
something.

<P>
   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hot Rock'' Sleater-Kinney. Kill Rock Stars. 13 tracks.
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the head-spinning buzz generated by its last two
albums _ ``Call the Doctor'' and ``Dig Me Out'' _ Washington state
trio Sleater-Kinney is of a cooler mind for its latest effort. The
upside of that is this punk-influenced act's powerfully tight
musicianship, which has become a stronger factor since the addition
of drummer Janet Weiss (Quaso, Elliot Smith). Guitarists/vocalists
Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker bob and weave around forceful
beats, or lock into repeated-note patterns that transmit like
personal semaphore codes. The focused intensity is heightened by
Tucker's oscillating wail of a voice, which miraculously seems to
conflate Ella Fitzgerald and Johnny Rotten. The downside is that
``The Hot Rock'' suffers from its single-minded theme (sample
titles: ``Banned From the End of the World,'' ``The End of You,''
``Living in Exile''). When a voice whispers, ``We're gonna party
like it's 1999,'' you really wish it wasn't ironic.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive Me Wild'' Sawyer Brown. Curb. 11 tracks. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Looking for breezy, Pablo Cruise-style pop? This new CD from
country's most energetic band is a low-stress excursion through
what used to be the stuff of Top 40 hits _ hummable tunes and
I'm-in-love lyrics that would be perfect about 20 minutes into
``Dawson's Creek.'' Nothing is offensive here, or particularly
memorable. Many tunes sound like clones of others. ``Break My Heart
Again'' is Don Henley's ``Last Worthless Evening,'' while Steve
Earle's ``I Ain't Never Been Satisfied'' is reworked into a track
called ``We're Everything to Me.'' Nothing pops out like the ``I
ain't first class/but I ain't white trash'' cheekiness of the
group's past hits. But like a bag of Cheetos, this is a fun
indulgence while it lasts.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ As we ambled around a mountain village in
south Lebanon recently, our Lebanese translator attempted a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to an Israeli encampment on a hill nearby, he suggested
that the two journalists in our little group take the lead.
Otherwise, he quipped, the Israelis might spot our Hezbollah guide
and open fire.
</P>
<P>
   But, our guide hardly looked like a target in a guerrilla war.
Clean-cut in his slacks and sweater, he was the best-dressed of our
bunch. And, he was working his cellular telephone -- one with a
microphone that dangles from the ear -- like any good PR man does.
</P>
<P>
   He works in the Hezbollah press office and is trying to spruce
up the Party of God's image in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Hezbollah killed seven Israelis, including a
brigadier general, their press machine was in high gear. They
displayed captured Israeli equipment, held press conferences and
released battlefield video.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of my recent trip to Lebanon, where I saw a
Hezbollah that has gone from kidnapping journalists to simply
``spinning'' them.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah was born in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon and took
over the nine-mile strip of that neighboring country's southern
border that it still occupies today. Iranian financing has kept it
going strong and constantly updating its warfare.

 &HT;    Inventive twist on tale of Cinderella
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ever After'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   In this swell revamp of the Cinderella story, Drew Barrymore
plays the lead, renamed Danielle. She's a 16th-century French lass
whose wealthy dad dies, leaving her at the mercy of evil stepmom
Anjelica Huston and a couple of snooty stepsisses. Yeah, you know
the drill.
</P>
<P>
   But this time out, there's no fairy godmother with a wand
helping Danielle play dress-up at the ball. Instead, her own
intelligence and bravery _ plus a little help from inventor
Leonardo da Vinci _ are what capture the prince's eye (played
nicely by Dougray Scott).
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a swoon-fest for the young, but also a savvy
revisionist twist on the tale that even grown-ups can dig. Grade:

   &QR;  ``Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist''
(unrated) _ This late performance artist was best known for nailing
his genitals to a plank. And you'll see him do it here. That tells
you whether you can stomach this graphic documentary, the bizarre

as an art form, and a way to master his own fate. Rigorously
nonjudgmental, ``Sick'' has the power to shake up some of your most

 &HT;    Infectious Eminem's offensive edge
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many in hip-hop's core following have privately hoped that white
rappers would remain forever frozen in Vanilla Ice.
</P>
<P>
   Just the notion that this street music would, like blues and
R&AMP;B, be taken and reconfigured for mainstream consumption by some
Backstreet Boy is really disturbing to some.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem is disturbing for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan native, born Marshall Mathers, makes his debut on
the arm of Dr. Dre, the producer who introduced skillful lyricist
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the 1992 hip-hop classic ``The Chronic.''
</P>
<P>
   Check one: Street credibility accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Now give the combo another check for coming up with the
well-produced ``Slim Shady LP'' that, with a dose of well-hidden
humor, manages to be both infectious and incredibly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about slipping a 15-year-old drugs to have sex with her
(``Guilty Conscience''), taking a toddler to the river to dump
Mommy's body (`` '97 Bonnie &AMP; Clyde'') and the tonsillectomy of the
first lady without the benefit of anesthesia (``Role Model'') _
it's all here. And clearly, skillfully delivered by the nasal
Eminem over some of the most lithe tracks the usually
keyboard-laden Dr. Dre has done in years.
</P>
<P>
   Guess you can consider this hip-hop's big payback to the
millions in the mainstream who supported rapper-turned-rocker
Vanilla Ice in 1990.

 &HT;    The latest melodious pop from XTC
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding don't appear to bother much
with calendars. It's been seven years since XTC's last studio
album, ``Nonsuch,'' but the band's world is much the same. Now down
to a duo, XTC still concocts pastoral pop that never fails to call
to mind the two musical B's of the '60s: the Beatles and Beach
Boys. ``Harvest Festival'' and ``River of Orchids'' make it clear
that the bucolic concerns of the past remain, as does a prodigious
talent for melody. The one concession to the '90s is in the
spotless production. The band's pop confections have always been
immaculately framed, and the fussiness that could smother the music
of others only makes these songs shine brighter.

CLINTON'S LIES COST HIM A DEFENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is with a heavy heart and not a little nausea
that I resign from the Bill Clinton defense team.
</P>
<P>
   I have run fresh out of the benefit of the doubt and can no
longer bend way over backward.
</P>
<P>
   Saddest of all, the cost of keeping a staunch defender of
reproductive rights sitting in the White House just climbed out of
my price range.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Americans, I got to choose whether I believe Bill
Clinton or a 56-year-old Arkansas nursing home operator named
Juanita Broaddrick.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the legions who came before her, Broaddrick did not
allege that sometime during the last two decades she had a
consensual sexual affair with Clinton. She didn't say that he made
a pass (crude or benign), which she rebuffed and he never tried
again. Broaddrick said Clinton raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Not a jump-from-the-hedges stranger rape. A ``date'' rape. The
kind that rarely results in an arrest, let alone a conviction,
because it almost always comes down to the man's word against the
woman's.
</P>
<P>
   Since Broaddrick told her story to the Wall Street Journal, the
Washington Post and _ in five hours of tapes _ to Lisa Myers of
NBC's ``Dateline,'' many people have busied themselves casting
doubt on her word.
</P>
<P>
   Why did she stay silent about the alleged assault for 21 years?
(She says she figured nobody would believe her or they'd say she
``asked for it''; she wanted to purge the ghastly event from her
life.)
</P>
<P>
   Why did she file a false affidavit about it when Paula Jones'
ubiquitous lawyers gave her the chance to sing? (She knew her
privacy would be shattered and she says she didn't have the guts to
face that.)
</P>
<P>
   Why could she remember only that the incident happened in the
spring and not the exact date or at least the month? (It wasn't
exactly a day she wanted to commemorate each year; she never forgot
the important part.)
</P>
<P>
   Why now? (She read one-too-many ``true'' stories filled with
lies about her and her husband; the guilty burden of her own
21-year silence broke her resistance.)
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Broaddrick had absolutely nothing to gain by speaking
up now and everything to lose, especially her privacy and good
name. The impeachment trial is over, the statute of limitations on
the alleged crime has long run out.
</P>
<P>
   As NBC's exacting research revealed, no right-wing foundation
seems to be bankrolling Broaddrick. No book agent has promised a
contract. Her upper middle-class lifestyle, 18-year marriage,
non-existent police record and apparent lack of any psychosis
indicate a solid, believable person.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is the word of the man she has accused.
</P>
<P>
   It is good for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   After the past 13 months, Bill Clinton is almost uniformly
mistrusted by the people of his country, his party, his closest
associates, his friends and even his family. Whatever virtues
people still see in him, veracity is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   So when Clinton's personal lawyer says Broaddrick's accusation
is ``absolutely false,'' it is as if a vapor has landed on his side
of the scale.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton always says the accusations are false. The needle
doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   All the times before, those of us on the defense team went
through the same drill: Even if he's lying (and usually he was),
it's a lie about messing around, about cheating on his wife, about
making dumbass, fraternity-boy passes. Even if the accusation is
true, it's about unseemly but not illegal sexual behavior, like
harassment or assault.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't easy to defend, but he was defendable.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the drill breaks down. If he is lying, it's about
crossing a legal and moral line that no feminist (and few women in
general) would think of defending. Because proof or disproof is
impossible, each of us can only weigh the facts and bestow the
benefit of the doubt on the most credible person, either the
president or his accuser.
</P>
<P>
   The latter choice opens one up to the truly disgusting prospect
of being lumped in with the likes of Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr; Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and his fellow House
prosecutors; Bay Buchanan; the Heritage Foundation; and every other
``family values'' fascist who wants to cram a narrowly prescribed
morality down the throats of 250 million Americans. (Thus the
aforementioned nausea.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a risk I will have to take. Maybe the president really is
telling the truth. This time. But someone else will have to make
that argument in his defense. I have no choice but to choose
Juanita.
</P>

AMERICANS HAVEN'T BEEN CONVINCED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the television babblemeisters posed the question: Is
there anything Bill Clinton could be accused of that would damage
his standing in the polls?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the president of the United States has been accused
of perjury and obstruction of justice. Unofficially, he has been
accused of everything from chronic moral turpitude to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the public-opinion polls have pegged his job
approval rating at somewhere between 60 and 70 percent, depending
on the severity of the pending allegation. The rating goes and up
down in direct proportion to the charge: The worse the crime, the
higher the job approval.
</P>
<P>
   So now comes the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll showing the
president's job approval at 66 percent in the wake of an Arkansas
woman's claim that Clinton raped her in a Little Rock hotel room 21
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors of polling would say that this proves once again that
the national polls are defective or rigged _ or both. Detractors of
the American people would say that the poll proves once again that
Clinton's constituents have reached a new low in their relentless
descent into moral depravity.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be? Is it possible that most Americans don't care if
their president is a rapist?
</P>
<P>
   No. It is not possible. Just as it wasn't possible that most
Americans didn't care if their president cheated on his wife, lied
under oath and tampered with witnesses in a legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they care. If the president had committed such
offenses under different circumstances _ different from those of
the Great Sex Scandal of 1998, that is _ they might have cared
enough to demand his removal from office, or even his
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   But the American people just plain didn't believe that Clinton's
misdeeds in the context of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky _
and his efforts to keep that relationship secret _ added up to the
sort of high crimes alleged by his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   As for Juanita Broaddrick's claim that Clinton assaulted her in
1978, the majority of respondents in the USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll
said they doubted Broaddrick's story. It's not that Americans don't
care if the president raped Broaddrick; it's that they don't
believe that he did it.
</P>
<P>
   Their skepticism is justified. Any objective observer who
watched Broaddrick's interview on NBC's ``Dateline'' would have to
say that her story had some holes in it. Some might say _ as an
editor friend of mine used to say about the occasional defective
news story _ that Broaddrick's version of events had holes big
enough to drive a truck through.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are obvious. If Broaddrick was raped, why didn't
she call the cops? If she was raped, why did she say she wasn't
when asked about it under oath many years later? If she knew
Clinton to be a violent criminal when he was attorney general of
Arkansas, why did she stand idly by and allow him to climb the
political ladder all the way to the White House?
</P>
<P>
   She told ``Dateline'' that she was afraid Clinton would destroy
her if she revealed what he had done to her.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at the time that he allegedly did whatever he did to
Broaddrick, Clinton was a political novice who was far from
accumulating the power and influence that would allow him to savage
someone's reputation with a snap of his fingers. It was far more
likely that Broaddrick could have destroyed Clinton if she'd gone
public with her accusation way back in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton has not offered an alternative version of the
alleged incident, of course, we have no way of knowing how his side
of the story might stack up against Broaddrick's. On the other
hand, why should Clinton even be expected to tell his side of
something that happened all those years ago _ or maybe didn't
happen at all?
</P>
<P>
   The American people are smart enough to understand all this.
Their lack of outrage about this unprovable accusation against the
president is not a sign of depravity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign that common sense is alive and well in America.

   Microbiologist Rita Colwell was at first excoriated by the
scientific world for her ideas about the behavior of the bacterium
that causes cholera. But research has borne out her notion that the
bacterium can lie dormant in the environment and then erupt.
Previously, scientists thought that a human host was necessary. Now
Colwell is focusing on helping to prevent major outbreaks of
cholera in poor communities with contaminated drinking water by
using a filter fashioned of sari cloth. Catherine Dold is a
free-lance writer who lives in Boulder, Colo.

   Dr. Robert Norman, a dermatologist, was called in by a medical
colleague to help solve a medical mystery. The top layer of skin of
the 28-year-old patient was peeling off her entire body. Her body
was a blanket of red. She looked as if she had been badly burned in
a fire. Norman had seen the rare affliction twice before, though
never such a severe case. It was toxic epidermal necrolysis, or
TEN, an extreme allergic reaction to a drug that is fatal in 30
percent of cases. In this fascinating feature, Norman explains how
he treated the case.

   Microbiologist Rita Colwell was at first excoriated by the
scientific world for her ideas about the behavior of the bacterium
that causes cholera. But research has borne out her notion that the
bacterium can lie dormant in the environment and then erupt.
Previously, scientists thought that a human host was necessary. Now
Colwell is focusing on helping to prevent major outbreaks of
cholera in poor communities with contaminated drinking water by
using a filter fashioned of sari cloth. Catherine Dold is a
free-lance writer who lives in Boulder, Colo.

   Dr. Robert Norman, a dermatologist, was called in by a medical
colleague to help solve a medical mystery. The top layer of skin of
the 28-year-old patient was peeling off her entire body. Her body
was a blanket of red. She looked as if she had been badly burned in
a fire. Norman had seen the rare affliction twice before, though
never such a severe case. It was toxic epidermal necrolysis, or
TEN, an extreme allergic reaction to a drug that is fatal in 30
percent of cases. In this fascinating feature, Norman explains how
he treated the case.

the 28-year-old patient was peeling off her entire body. Her body
was a blanket of red. She looked as if she had been badly burned in
a fire. Norman had seen the rare affliction twice before, though
never such a severe case. It was toxic epidermal necrolysis, or
TEN, an extreme allergic reaction to a drug that is fatal in 30
percent of cases. In this fascinating feature, Norman explains how
he treated the case.

<P>
   Last year microbiologist Rita Colwell was visiting a rural
village in Bangladesh with a crew from a Maryland public television
station. The crew asked Colwell to show them a new method she had
devised for filtering plankton and bacteria from drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras focused on a woman standing at the edge of the local
``tank'' _ a large pond that in one corner is used as a latrine and
in the other as a source of drinking water. In traditional fashion,
the woman bent down and dipped her clay bottle into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she collected the water, we poured it into a clear
beaker and held it up to the sunlight,'' recalls Colwell. ``You
could see the brown discoloration, things swimming in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Colwell asked the woman to collect water again, this time
while holding a few layers of sari cloth over the mouth of the
clear beaker.
</P>
<P>
   When the sample was held up to the light, the water was
practically clear. Minutes later the film crew, wanting some
background footage, asked the woman to walk to the tank again,
collect some more water, walk back to her home and take a drink.
</P>
<P>
   She did as they asked, but stopped short of drinking the water.
She explained through a translator that, having just seen the
results of the simple experiment, she no longer wished to drink
unfiltered water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple demonstration, but a pivotal moment for Colwell.
After years of studying Vibrio cholerae, a notorious bacterium that
can contaminate unchlorinated water supplies and cause massive
epidemics of sickness and death, she could see that one of her
ideas to help prevent the disease just might work.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades Colwell has labored in the field and
in the laboratory to tease out the ecology of this tiny microbe.
Her discoveries have overturned some long-held notions about how V.
cholerae travels the world, how it is transmitted to humans and
where it lurks in the years between outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to use these ecological lessons to prevent future
outbreaks, or at least to blunt their impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Colwell became the director of the National Science
Foundation, in Arlington, Va., after spending 25 years at the
University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute _ the last 10 as its
president. She had spent most of those years convincing the
scientific world that V. cholerae might not behave as everyone had
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s she and her colleagues isolated the cholera
bacterium from the Chesapeake Bay. At the time, the claim was
outrageous. Nobody believed that V. cholerae could persist in the
environment without a human host, and no cholera outbreaks were
occurring anywhere near the Chesapeake. Indeed, there had been no
cholera epidemics anywhere in the United States since 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excoriated,'' she sighs. ```Nonsense,' they said.
`It's only transmitted from person to person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred papers later, her ideas have finally gained
acceptance. One peer now calls her work a paradigm shift in
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned much about how cholera is transmitted by
feces, food and water. But an enigma remained: Where did the
bacteria go between epidemics?
</P>
<P>
   Rita Colwell suspected that V. cholerae persisted in an
environmental reservoir _ living somewhere far from its human hosts
_ and that the reservoir was the ocean. Maybe, she thought, the
problem was simply that no one could see them. Perhaps for some
reason the bacteria weren't always detectable by traditional
culture methods _ that is, they couldn't be grown in a petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Doggone it, I wonder if it goes into a dormant
state,''' says Colwell.
</P>
<P>
   Her next clue came from Louisiana. In the late 1970s a small
cholera outbreak popped up near New Orleans among a few people who
had eaten crab from a local bayou.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and took water samples,'' says Colwell. But this
time, rather than attempting to grow a conventional culture,
Colwell tried a new detection method. The test used an antibody
that would latch onto a key component of the bacterium's cell
membrane. Linked to that antibody was a molecule that would light
up under ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a little tribal dance around the microscope,'' she
says, recalling the excitement of her research team. ``You could
see the little devils because they fluoresce bright green. I'll
never forget the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colwell's detractors dismissed her findings as ``Colwell's
ghosts.'' But later tests confirmed her suspicion that V. cholerae
could exist naturally in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes are the right conditions _ whether in a human gut
or in the environment _ for V. cholerae to come out of dormancy,
multiply and spread its misery. No one knows exactly what
conditions awaken the bacteria from their metabolic slumber.
</P>
<P>
   The critical factor could be anything from the temperature of
the water to the amount of salt. Colwell has already stumbled
across one correlation that she says gave her chills. A graph of
the seasonal peaks in sea-surface temperatures in the Bay of
Bengal, gleaned from satellite data, almost exactly matches a graph
of the seasonal peaks in admissions for cholera in nearby
hospitals. Some four to six weeks after the sea temperature goes
up, so do cholera admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Colwell and HUQ are now trying to determine the exact
relationships between sea temperatures, phytoplankton blooms,
cholera cases and everything in between. If the connections become
clear, says Colwell, the models might be used to create a global
cholera warning system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Colwell's work could have a local impact. Her
sari-cloth filter, which so impressed the young woman in
Bangladesh, is now being tested by 4,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't remove all the cholera bacteria,'' says Colwell.
``But the numbers go way down. Therefore we expect to be able to
curb the massive epidemics.''

 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.
``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his
office the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun
to peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and
mouth felt irritated.
</P>
<P>
   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good
idea of what was wrong with Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the
TV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off
her face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet
wallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of
normal-looking skin.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of
this severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look
at the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was
groggy from her pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a
medicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but
when it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're
going to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you
taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.

taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.

<P>
   Last year microbiologist Rita Colwell was visiting a rural
village in Bangladesh with a crew from a Maryland public television
station. The crew asked Colwell to show them a new method she had
devised for filtering plankton and bacteria from drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras focused on a woman standing at the edge of the local
``tank'' _ a large pond that in one corner is used as a latrine and
in the other as a source of drinking water. In traditional fashion,
the woman bent down and dipped her clay bottle into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she collected the water, we poured it into a clear
beaker and held it up to the sunlight,'' recalls Colwell. ``You
could see the brown discoloration, things swimming in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Colwell asked the woman to collect water again, this time
while holding a few layers of sari cloth over the mouth of the
clear beaker.
</P>
<P>
   When the sample was held up to the light, the water was
practically clear. Minutes later the film crew, wanting some
background footage, asked the woman to walk to the tank again,
collect some more water, walk back to her home and take a drink.
</P>
<P>
   She did as they asked, but stopped short of drinking the water.
She explained through a translator that, having just seen the
results of the simple experiment, she no longer wished to drink
unfiltered water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple demonstration, but a pivotal moment for Colwell.
After years of studying Vibrio cholerae, a notorious bacterium that
can contaminate unchlorinated water supplies and cause massive
epidemics of sickness and death, she could see that one of her
ideas to help prevent the disease just might work.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades Colwell has labored in the field and
in the laboratory to tease out the ecology of this tiny microbe.
Her discoveries have overturned some long-held notions about how V.
cholerae travels the world, how it is transmitted to humans and
where it lurks in the years between outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to use these ecological lessons to prevent future
outbreaks, or at least to blunt their impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Colwell became the director of the National Science
Foundation, in Arlington, Va., after spending 25 years at the
University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute _ the last 10 as its
president. She had spent most of those years convincing the
scientific world that V. cholerae might not behave as everyone had
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s she and her colleagues isolated the cholera
bacterium from the Chesapeake Bay. At the time, the claim was
outrageous. Nobody believed that V. cholerae could persist in the
environment without a human host, and no cholera outbreaks were
occurring anywhere near the Chesapeake. Indeed, there had been no
cholera epidemics anywhere in the United States since 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excoriated,'' she sighs. ```Nonsense,' they said.
`It's only transmitted from person to person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred papers later, her ideas have finally gained
acceptance. One peer now calls her work a paradigm shift in
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned much about how cholera is transmitted by
feces, food and water. But an enigma remained: Where did the
bacteria go between epidemics?
</P>
<P>
   Rita Colwell suspected that V. cholerae persisted in an
environmental reservoir _ living somewhere far from its human hosts
_ and that the reservoir was the ocean. Maybe, she thought, the
problem was simply that no one could see them. Perhaps for some
reason the bacteria weren't always detectable by traditional
culture methods _ that is, they couldn't be grown in a petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Doggone it, I wonder if it goes into a dormant
state,''' says Colwell.
</P>
<P>
   Her next clue came from Louisiana. In the late 1970s a small
cholera outbreak popped up near New Orleans among a few people who
had eaten crab from a local bayou.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and took water samples,'' says Colwell. But this
time, rather than attempting to grow a conventional culture,
Colwell tried a new detection method. The test used an antibody
that would latch onto a key component of the bacterium's cell
membrane. Linked to that antibody was a molecule that would light
up under ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a little tribal dance around the microscope,'' she
says, recalling the excitement of her research team. ``You could
see the little devils because they fluoresce bright green. I'll
never forget the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colwell's detractors dismissed her findings as ``Colwell's
ghosts.'' But later tests confirmed her suspicion that V. cholerae
could exist naturally in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes are the right conditions _ whether in a human gut
or in the environment _ for V. cholerae to come out of dormancy,
multiply and spread its misery. No one knows exactly what
conditions awaken the bacteria from their metabolic slumber.
</P>
<P>
   The critical factor could be anything from the temperature of
the water to the amount of salt. Colwell has already stumbled
across one correlation that she says gave her chills. A graph of
the seasonal peaks in sea-surface temperatures in the Bay of
Bengal, gleaned from satellite data, almost exactly matches a graph
of the seasonal peaks in admissions for cholera in nearby
hospitals. Some four to six weeks after the sea temperature goes
up, so do cholera admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Colwell and HUQ are now trying to determine the exact
relationships between sea temperatures, phytoplankton blooms,
cholera cases and everything in between. If the connections become
clear, says Colwell, the models might be used to create a global
cholera warning system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Colwell's work could have a local impact. Her
sari-cloth filter, which so impressed the young woman in
Bangladesh, is now being tested by 4,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't remove all the cholera bacteria,'' says Colwell.
``But the numbers go way down. Therefore we expect to be able to
curb the massive epidemics.''

 By ROBERT A. NORMAN  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.
``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his
office the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun
to peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and
mouth felt irritated.
</P>
<P>
   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good
idea of what was wrong with Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the
TV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off
her face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet
wallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of
normal-looking skin.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of
this severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look
at the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was
groggy from her pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a
medicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but
when it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're
going to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you
taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.

<P>
   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.
``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his
office the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun
to peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and
mouth felt irritated.
</P>
<P>
   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good
idea of what was wrong with Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the
TV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off
her face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet
wallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of
normal-looking skin.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of
this severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look
at the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was
groggy from her pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a
medicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but
when it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're
going to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you
taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.
</P>

AS GOP FIELD FILLS, RACE FOR DONORS HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patrick J. Buchanan and Texas Governor George W.
Bush Tuesday moved into a Republican presidential field that
already is one of the most crowded in memory, and that probably
cannot be sustained by the limited number of GOP contributors,
according to political observers.
</P>
<P>
   With Buchanan declaring his candidacy and Bush forming an
exploratory committee, the pressure mounted for Elizabeth Dole to
declare whether she is running. Some of her supporters expressed
concern that her delay is costing her crucial time for
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The ``money primary,'' as the current campaign phase is known,
has taken off at a furious pace because at least 10 nationally
known GOP prospects are chasing a donor base that might be able to
support three full-fledged campaigns. That does not include the
partly self-financed bid of publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by Bush and Buchanan highlight opposite ends of the
Republican Party's financial spectrum. Bush is probably the
best-positioned candidate, with much of the political and financial
hierarchy of the party behind him. Buchanan, who in 1992 derided
President George Bush as ``King George,'' is counting on
grass-roots support outside the normal party channels for his third
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about money now,'' said Ron Kaufman, the former
political director for President Bush. ``Anybody who can raise $15
million to $20 million between now and the first of the year is in.
If they can't cross that threshold, they can't be in the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Dole supporters, meanwhile, are concerned that she failed
to create a campaign organization after her well-received
appearance in New Hampshire last month. A number of political
activists familiar with the Dole effort questioned whether she will
run, noting Bush's strength and the difficulty of competing with so
many candidates for the necessary funds.
</P>
<P>
   While there is always a chase for presidential campaign money,
this year's effort has grown bigger than ever. Bill Clinton had
collected only $3.3 million by Jan. 1, 1992. This time around, a
number of candidates hope to raise between $15 million and $35
million by Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So much has to be raised so quickly because the primary schedule
has been dramatically compressed, and some analysts think the
nomination race will be over a few weeks after the New Hampshire
vote. Thus, unlike in some prior years when a New Hampshire victory
by a lesser-known candidate could become a financial springboard,
the schedule is so tight that most of the campaign funds have to be
raised this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, candidates are in a Catch 22 situation: They can't
raise money unless they are shown to be credible, and many can't
prove they are credible unless they raise a lot of money. That is
partly why Senator John F. Kerry bowed out of a Democratic
presidential bid, even though he would have faced only two
announced opponents. The Republican field is far more crowded and
presents a far more difficult campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush already has lined up many endorsements and is
leading in the national polls, his announcement demonstrated he
doesn't want to wait any longer to start collecting money. Dole,
meanwhile, was counting on tapping many supporters who had backed
her husband, Bob Dole, but political sources said she was
disconcerted that some are either unwilling to commit themselves or
are backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Pappas, chairman of a New Hampshire movement to draft Dole,
said it is essential for Dole to declare her candidacy soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the workers that would be working on her campaign
have been snapped up by other candidates, and it is a tight labor
market,'' Pappas said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Republican Party Chairman Stephen Duprey said he
has seen ``no sign'' that Dole is creating a campaign organization.
David Carney, who was a senior adviser to Bob Dole's 1996 campaign,
said, ``There have been no phone calls, no one signed up to run her
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole spokeswoman Joyce Campbell disputed such comments and said
Dole is ``greatly encouraged'' by the public reaction to her
possible candidacy. ``She is on track with her possible exploratory
committee plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Alec Koromilas, who helped organize the Elizabeth Dole speech to
the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce that drew a sold-out
crowd and recently spoke with her, said he had no indication Dole
was thinking of staying out of the race. But, he added, ``time is
clearly of the essence. To raise $20 million to $30 million is a
Herculean effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said they don't see how so many Republicans
can collect enough money to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates such as Senator John McCain of Arizona,
Representative John Kasich of Ohio, former Reagan aide Gary Bauer
and Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire are running against
proven fund-raisers such as former Education Secretary Lamar
Alexander and former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who plans to spend much of this month at fund-raisers,
plans to transfer $2 million in leftover money from his Senate
campaign to his presidential exploratory committee. But even
Alexander and Quayle, with their experience on the national stage,
may have a tough time. Alexander, for example, has collected only
$1 million so far this year, although aides said he will hold a big
fund-raiser soon.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, has no such worries because he has declared
he will use a combination of contributions and his own money if he
runs for president. As a result, Forbes would not have to adhere to
federal spending limits and would not be eligible for
taxpayer-supplied matching funds. That has prompted Bush to
consider busting the spending cap as well, a position that he may
try to justify by saying it is necessary to compete with Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Several undeclared candidates are using a variety of means to
get around elections laws and run quasi-campaigns. Forbes, for
example, has collected $13 million for his non-profit company,
Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, which pays such
expenses as radio and television ads that promote Forbes' views.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, Quayle and Bauer have all taken advantage of state
laws that allow them to collect unlimited contributions for various
political action committees. For example, while presidential
candidates cannot accept more than $1,000 per person each campaign
cycle, non-candidates can collect unlimited amounts of money if
they set up a political action committee in a state such as
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has collected $1.5 million with just 86 contributions
for one of his PACs, We the People, including a number of $100,000
donations. The PAC, based in Virginia, has paid for television ads
that feature Alexander and look and sound like campaign spots.
</P>
<P>
   While the collection of early money is crucial, it is not always
decisive. Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican, in 1996 put a
premium on raising money early and collected $32 million. But his
candidacy bombed in the Iowa caucus, and he pulled out of the race
before the New Hampshire primary.

PUSH GROWS FOR DRUG COVERAGE BY MEDICARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Miriam Laserson has a costly drug problem. Her pharmacy bill
adds up to $646.78 a month. There are the brown pills for high
blood pressure, the diamond-shaped pills for her heart, the oval
tablets for cholesterol, and the pink capsules for allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 72-year-old grandmother is covered by Medicare, the
program has never paid a dime for her drugs, or anyone else's,
since Medicare began in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the prospect of Medicare covering prescription
drugs would have drawn guffaws in budget-minded Washington. But
today, Democrats and Republicans of all stripes are declaring
allegiance to better drug coverage for the nation's 39 million
elderly and disabled. While the discussion may amount to nothing
more than Washington bluster, observers of health care policy are
noting a significant shift in the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer as far-fetched as it was last year,'' said Gail
Wilensky, who ran Medicare in the early 1990s and is now chairwoman
of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress
about Medicare. ``The pie has come down from the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   What's changed? Federal coffers are now flush with surplus, an
avalanche of costly blockbuster drugs has triggered fierce public
debate about how to pay for medication, and a generation of baby
boomers is heading toward Medicare eligibility. Add a blue-ribbon
panel charged with reforming Medicare, and prescription drugs
becomes an irresistible subject.
</P>
<P>
   When Medicare was created, people suffering from arthritis had
two places to turn for relief: aspirin and Tylenol. Today, the
arsenal is considerably more extensive, but also more costly.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent addition is Pfizer Inc.'s Celebrex. The drug has
few side effects compared with other anti-inflammatories, including
aspirin and ibuprofen, both of which can cause stomach bleeding.
But the price is high. A month's supply of Celebrex can cost more
than $100, whereas a bottle of 100 aspirin tablets is only $1.59 at
CVS Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex is just one example of the dilemma. Drugs today advance
quality of life as never before, vanquishing everything from
depression and migraine headaches to impotence and ulcers. Heart
medications allow people to live longer, but like many drugs, they
must be taken every day, helping to drive up the nation's drug
bill.
</P>
<P>
   US spending on drugs nearly doubled between 1993 and 1998, to
$104.8 billion from $54.3 billion, according to IMS Health Inc., an
industry research firm. That spending is expected to surge further
as baby boomers hit old age and the biotechnology revolution spawns
blockbuster therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers and demographers have long predicted the crisis and
urged lawmakers to add drugs to Medicare's core package of
benefits, to no avail. At least until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become very politically profitable,'' to advocate drug
coverage, said Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of health economics at
Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the issue exploded last year when health
maintenance organizations announced they would no longer offer
unlimited prescription coverage for seniors, despite a state law
mandating such benefits for the elderly. HMOs challenged the law in
federal court and won, leaving thousands of seniors vulnerable to
large expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The furor caught the attention of many politicians, including
Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Representatives James McGovern and
Barney Frank. Kennedy is set to introduce a bill this month that
will propose a $1,500 annual drug benefit for every senior and
disabled person on Medicare with a 20 percent copayment and a $100
annual deductible. McGovern and Frank, Massachusetts Democrats,
this week introduced similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who has tried to obtain drug coverage for seniors since
1970, said the current mood in Washington represents one of the
best opportunities ever to gain the coverage. ``Now is really the
time to address this issue,'' said the Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget surplus has opened the door for additional
spending in the $210-billion-a-year Medicare program. The addition
of drug coverage, which could exceed $20 billion a year according
to some estimates, would have been unthinkable prior to the
surplus. Indeed, President Clinton advocated Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs _ funded by the budget surplus _ in his State of
the Union address in January.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for much of the discussion in Washington has been a
blue-ribbon commission charged with recommending to Congress
sweeping reforms of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescription drugs are one of the most, if not the most,
important component of quality care in our senior population,''
said Senator Bill Frist, a Republican from Tennessee and a
commission member. ``The armamentarium of health care for seniors
must include drugs. That's just so fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument on the panel isn't over whether Medicare should
include drug coverage, but how. Democrats on the commission say
drugs should be added to Medicare's core benefits so that every
senior would have access to drug coverage. Republicans say that
would be too expensive for a program already in deep financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They also point out that 65 percent of Medicare beneficiaries
already have some sort of drug coverage, from former employers,
HMOs, so-called ``medigap'' supplemental insurance policies
purchased by seniors, or Medicaid, the government health care
program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we can't afford to take care of everybody, I want to
make sure that we take care of the 35 percent of the population
that don't already have coverage,'' Frist said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives on the commission, including the co-chairmen,
Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Representative Bill
Thomas, Republican of California, are backing a plan to force all
medigap plans to cover drugs and to increase eligibility for
Medicaid, which does pay for drugs, from 100 percent of the federal
poverty guideline to 135 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal has been rejected by two commission members who
represent swing votes in the panel's efforts to issue a consensus
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said from day one what an adequate drug plan looks
like, and this is not it,'' said Stuart Altman, one of the swing
voters and a professor of health policy at Brandeis University.
``Drugs have to be available to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman and others argue that many employers are scaling back
health benefits to retired workers. In addition, much of the
coverage seniors currently receive is expensive and inadequate.
Even Medicaid, considered generous, has gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Jackson, a 76-year-old great-grandmother in Lynn, Mass.,
gets Medicaid, which helps pay for part of her $4,200 annual
pharmacy bill. In 1997, Jackson paid $1,800 of the bill herself
because she earned slightly more than the income ceiling for
Medicaid. Last year, she paid $1,000 toward her drug bill before
Medicaid began picking up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the topic has become so hot in Washington that even
the drug industry has ceded ground. In a major policy shift, the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in Washington
last month said it supports prescription drug coverage under
Medicare but only for seniors enrolled in private health plans,
such as Medicare HMOs. The industry continues to fiercely oppose
coverage under the government-controlled portion of Medicare
because it fears federal price controls.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Washington may take no action this year, or even
next year. But some Washington skeptics are beginning to say drug
coverage under Medicare is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large gap between talk and action in Washington,''
said Wilensky. ``I don't think anything is going to happen in the
short run. Not now. But sometime.''

CLASS ISSUES CLOUD CUSTODY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith and Nanci Bohne believe their town is the perfect place to
raise their 5-year-old granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   An apple orchard rises behind their house. Down a winding road,
the scent of dried flowers, apples, and fresh earth fills the
country store the Bohnes run on their 50-acre family farm.
</P>
<P>
   But Westford, Mass. shares another quality with many bucolic
bedroom communities: It is almost all white _ and the Bohnes'
granddaughter, Alexandria, is half black.
</P>
<P>
   That issue is the crux of the custody battle between the Bohnes
and Alexandria's other grandparents, Mary and George Goullaud, who
live in a two-family house in Malden, a hardscrabble city near
Boston that is also mostly white but with a far larger minority
population.
</P>
<P>
   The custody case has become a battle between two concepts of
community _ an upscale, largely insular suburb and a diverse but
economically struggling city.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of grandparents are white, but have raised children of
color. Both are devoted to raising their granddaughter. But the
Goullauds argue that they _ and their city _ are more comfortable
with racial differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case represents two solid families petitioning the court
for custody of a beautiful little girl,'' the Goullauds' lawyer,
Wayne Murphy, said. ``It presents the unique situation of deciding
what is in the best interest of a biracial child.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandria Lee Goullaud is the daughter of Jennifer Goullaud, a
white Malden woman, and Jeffrey Bohne, a black man who was adopted
as a child by the Bohnes and brought up in affluent Westford.
</P>
<P>
   Both alcoholics and heroin users, the two young people never
married; in fact, they never had much more than a brief dalliance,
according to court records. The Bohnes did not even know about
Jennifer Goullaud or the baby until a month after Alexandria's
birth on Jan. 12, 1994. A friend of their son informed them.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandria was raised by her mother mostly in the Goullaud
household, with virtually no contact with the father, court records
show. But almost from birth, Alexandria spent time with her
Westford grandparents, and began overnight visits with them when
she neared her first birthday, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, while Mary Goullaud cared for two other grandchildren,
Jennifer allowed Nanci Bohne, 55, and her husband, Keith, 54,
temporary custody of Alexandria for seven months, while Jennifer
lived in a drug-rehabilitation facility in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, three weeks before Alexandria's 4th birthday, police
found 25-year-old Jennifer Goullaud dead of a heroin overdose on
the bathroom floor of a Salem, N.H., fast-food restaurant.
Alexandria was on an overnight visit with the Bohnes when the young
mother died.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Bohne, 30, a homeless addict in Lowell, Mass., is in
touch with his parents, and sees Alexandria under strict
supervision when she is at his parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   The bright-eyed youngster, who loves wearing purple dresses and
eating salad, spends three days a week in Westford and four days in
Malden, according to a court agreement. Both families have said in
affidavits that it is time for her to have a permanent home,
particularly because she will begin kindergarten next fall.
</P>
<P>
   A court-appointed investigator, Stoneham clinical psychologist
Robert Stier, concluded in January that Alexandria should live with
the Bohnes. In his report, he said that the Bohnes seemed more open
to involving the Goullaud family than the Goullauds were about
involving the Bohnes. He also wrote that the child's bedroom in
Westford had more toys and books than the one in Malden. Finally,
he noted that Alexandria told him she wanted to live in Westford.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this has nothing to do with money and toys _ it is not
just about goodies in Westford,'' said adoption specialist Joyce
Maguire Pavao, director of the Center for Family Connections in
Cambridge, Mass., bristling at the description of toys and
bedrooms. ``It could be that Malden may actually remind her more of
her sadness. That is her mother's family, and there is not as much
emotion attached to her father.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goullauds, meanwhile, say life in Westford would be
alienating for a biracial child. Their house in Malden, by
contrast, is the center for an active extended family of aunts,
uncles, cousins, and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Goullaud, 55, is a public school teacher with a master's
degree in counseling; George, 64, is a retired United Parcel
Service worker.
</P>
<P>
   The Bohnes and their attorney, Carol Weinstein Boileau, declined
comment for this story, citing Alexandria's right to privacy and
the pending court case which begins March 3 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the Bohnes and the Goullauds, like all
custody cases, will ultimately hinge on the court's interpretation
of the ``best interests of the child'' _ who not only has to juggle
the death of her mother and absence of her father, but also the
social obstacles she will face as a woman of mixed race.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists have differing opinions on which criteria should
be given the greatest weight, especially regarding the issue of
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family that best understands the needs of a child of color
is best suited'' to raise the child, declared Joe Kroll, director
of the North American Council of Adoptable Children based in
Minnesota. ``The key thing is understanding the impact of race on a
child in this country. Families that can prepare a child for that
are the better families.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroll stressed the importance of ``living where the child can
experience his own culture and see same-race adults regularly,
understanding the reality of racism, and helping the child learn to
accept his own cultural or racial ancestry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, a family
law and civil rights specialist who is against using race in
deciding guardianships and adoptions, said the ``race card'' in a
custody battle like the one swirling around Alexandria should be
considered irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case like this, you won't have the most problematic form
of considering race, which is the bias (in favor) of placing
children with the parent who looks like them racially,'' Bartholet
said, because the competing grandparents are white. ``When you
eliminate that, it looks to me like this is a tough case where the
court will have to look at a whole range of factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartholet argued that using race can overwhelm other matters
that could prove important in deciding on a permanent home for any
child _ for example, which community has better schools.
</P>
<P>
   The race factor, said Bartholet, ``limits black children's
opportunities to have a range of adoption opportunities. The
presumption is that it is best to be surrounded by same-race
bodies, when the world is more comlex than that. Middle-class black
families certainly think there is more to it than (race).''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Goullaud argues that she and her husband are best suited to
raise Alexandria because in addition to living in a racially
diverse city, Goullaud has helped raise the biracial child of her
28-year-old daughter, Christine. As a teacher in Boston suburbs
Chelsea and Somerville, Goullaud said, she has long worked with
children of many backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest public school data, Westford schools are
95.5 percent white, 3.4 percent Asian, and only 1.1 percent black.
Malden schools are 63 percent white, 13.4 percent black, 17 percent
Asian, and 6.6 percent Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as Mary Goullaud suggests, the court should consider
which family is most adept at crossing color lines, then the Bohnes
could have claims of their own.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, the Bohnes adopted Alexandria's
father, Jeffrey, who was born in Connecticut with fetal alcohol
syndrome. The court records do not discuss his home life prior to
his adoption by the Bohnes at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey suffered from emotional and behavioral problems, as well
as learning disabilities, as a child, for which the Bohnes sought
help for him, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   The records say that he is unprepared and uninterested in being
a parent, and does not object to his parents' quest for
guardianship. Jeffrey Bohne could not be located for comment at or
near the Middlesex Shelter in Lowell, where sources say he often
resides. He did not return a message left for him at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Stier, the court-appointed investigator who interviewed both
couples, wrote in his Jan. 27 report that the Bohnes said they are
aware of the ``complexities of raising a biracial child in their
community. They see in Westford a community more ethnically diverse
than previously . . . and they see in Alexandria a different child,
with far fewer problems and more potential than Jeffrey.''

WILLIAMS HAS MORE MANAGERIAL MOVES THAN YOU THINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ C'mon, admit it. You think Jimy Williams is
an utter goober.
</P>
<P>
   You've had that impression since his introductory Boston press
conference, otherwise known as the ``bump-your-booty'' media
session. His folksy ways make him prime fodder for ridicule in
oft-snobby New England.
</P>
<P>
   You can't even believe he's from California, because when most
people in our part of the world think of our most populous state
they think of Southern California or the Bay Area, and not the vast
interior. They think of traffic jams, not fruits and vegetables.
The San Joaquin Valley might as well be on Jupiter as in Central
California.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``other'' California is the Steinbeck California, and
it's also Jimy's California. ``It's an agricultural state,'' he
points out. ``There are a lot of remote areas. A lot of cows
chewing a lot of cuds.'' He comes from people who get their hands
dirty, and he is proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   But a goober? Forget it. He is a college graduate (Fresno State)
and he is a very good reader of people. He's got the Boston media
scene figured out, and don't you think he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in competition, both with yourselves and with the other
papers in our division, just like we are,'' he says. ``I understand
that. You've got to express yourselves in an individual manner, and
I know I'm not always going to like it. But, I'll tell ya, your job
isn't easy. First, you've got to get the news, and then you've got
to convey it. To me, that's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world of La Russas and Valentines and Johnsons, Jimy
Williams is a very soft sell. He would never, ever, think of using
the word ``genius'' in connection with managing a baseball team.
``I don't know of any geniuses in this business,'' he says, ``and,
if there are, it's the players who made 'em that way.''
</P>
<P>
   If the word ``genius'' is not in his vocabulary, neither is the
word ``arrogant.'' Years ago Charlie Dressen used to tell his
Dodgers to ``keep it close and I'll think of something.'' You won't
be hearing that from Jimy Williams. ``Personally,'' he confides,
``I don't think a manager can ever win a game, but he can certainly
lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   People on the outside seemed to appreciate what he did last year
more than people inside 495. The Red Sox won 93 games and got into
the postseason with a team needing massive amounts of TLC. If Joe
Torre's gang had won 100 games, rather than 114, Jimy Williams
might very well have been the American League Manager of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a team that cried out for lineup manipulation, and that
happens to be a Jimy Williams specialty. It takes a fair amount of
probing to get this modest man to analyze himself, but he will
admit to one managerial strength. ``What I try to do is identify
the strengths and weaknesses of each player and then place them
only in situations where they can have the best chance of
success,'' he says. A corollary would be, ``And I try to keep
everyone on the 25-man roster as sharp as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes a man is on his team for a reason. ``If a man
is on a major league roster, then he is supposed to be a major
league player,'' he says. ``So I'll play him. I believe regulars
need days off. I don't think it's necessary to play 162 games. Many
of them don't understand that the day off is as much or more a
benefit mentally than it is physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching these guys all the time, looking for signs. Maybe
a guy isn't adhering to his usual routine. Sometimes you can tell
something is wrong just by the way they walk into the clubhouse. So
I'll try to get to them before they hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the quintessential company man, and he never will
understand why a cynical city like ours regards that as a bad
thing. We live in the strangest of all baseball cultures, and it's
really bizarre now because while the fans and even the media
relentlessly personalize the Red Sox experience, the current
manager does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lose Mo Vaughn from my team,'' he says. ``That's
because it isn't my team, it's our team. We are all in it together
here, and I'm not going to cry about Mo Vaughn because I like the
players we have. As long as these kids put out the effort and play
with honest intensity, I can't complain. I like this team because I
saw what it did last year, and it was more than Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``How good can we be without that power? I don't know. Nobody
does. But instead of a home run, can you win with a clutch two-out
single? Can you win with a key sacrifice bunt? Sure. Can you win
with pitching and defense, both of which I think we have? Sure.
We'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   While accepting the reality that within the group of 25 there
has to be at least one player who has harbored a grievance against
the skipper, I think it can safely be said that he is just about
universally popular in the clubhouse. Players appreciate the
honesty. Players appreciate the fairness. Players appreciate the
essential decency. And, guess what? Players appreciate the
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made Duquette look awfully good last year,'' says one
veteran. ``And he'll do it again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not a genius. He's not a blowhard. He's just an
unpretentious guy from the heart of California who understands how
to run a baseball team.

six-month lockout, and reiterated frequently through the start of
play February 5 _ was that franchise executives, coaches and, most
of all , players should participate in a grand marketing strategy.
The goal, as articulated in one e-mail message: ``Re-establishing
the standing and reputation of the NBA and its teams with fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are inviting NBA fans back to our game,'' another e-mail
advised the franchises. ``Demonstrate that we recognize NBA fans
(itals)do not owe us(unitals) renewed support, and show that we are
committed to earning back their support...Ground communications in
substantive policies and actions that demonstrate the NBA and its
teams accept full responsibility for any damage done to the bond
between the league and its players and NBA fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In a performance that amounts to a marketing slam dunk, the NBA
has roared back this month with fan support equal to or exceeding
pre-lockout levels. The league has defied the conventional wisdom
that its long labor dispute would harm the NBA and create a long,
difficult recovery.
</P>
<P>
   By developing grassroots, guerilla, marketing tactics even
before the lockout ended , the NBA has marshalled the support of
its players, its network television partners and its corporate
sponsors in a massive campaign to make amends with the fans. Long
accepted as the best at marketing among the four major professional
sports leagues, the NBA used the tactics to quickly build on the
successes of the past 20 years, when it established enduring
relationships between the game's biggest stars and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been able to handle what easily could have been a
real near-death experience, and turn it into what now looks like a
blip on the screen,'' said Glenn Rifkin, the Acton, Mass. author of
``Radical Marketing,'' which includes a chapter on the winning
strategies and tactics of the NBA. ``The NBA has responded
brilliantly to this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Network television ratings are up almost 20 percent _ from an
average of 4.6 on NBC last year to 5.5 through Thursday night's
games, and from an average of 1.7 on TNN last year to 2.0.
Television executives and league officials say that some local
cable television broadcasts in areas directly surrounding the
franchises are performing even better.
</P>
<P>
   Home-game attendance since the lockout has either increased or
remained the same as last season among 14 of the NBA's 29 teams,
according to a survey conducted by Street &AMP; Smith's SPORTSBUSINESS
Journal. Another 11 teams are showing declines of less than 10
percent. And only four are showing anything like the sharp declines
experienced by baseball franchises throughout 1996 and much of
1997, during that league's strike.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's marketing effort was devised after much preparation.
``It was really a strategy that evolved along a few lines all
through the lockout, back as early as October,'' said Rick Welts,
chief of marketing for the NBA. ``At one point, we actually had one
group we called the Re-entry Group working in one room on what
issues we would face if some games were cancelled, but we returned
to play this year. And, in another room, we had a different group
working on the issues that would arise if we lost a full season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the end, when the lockout was over, everyone knew what
we were going to do and what their role would be,'' Welts said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, observers say, is that the NBA has accomplished in
about three weeks what it took Major League Baseball almost three
seasons to do: repair the breach between the fans and the game. And
baseball needed the riveting home run record race between Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa _ to get the job done after its disastrous
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been amazing, the speed with which fans have come
back,'' to the NBA, said Richard Lapchick, director of the Center
for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. ``And
we're talking about fan support at a surprising level for a game
that sometimes isn't even being played that well, yet, given that
some of the players are still a little out of shape.''
</P>
<P>
   In late December, before it was clear any games would be played
this year, the NBA invited officials from across the spectrum of
league interests to a major meeting in Manhattan. Representatives
of the television networks, key sponsors, general managers,
coaches, former players and marketing officials and consultants all
attended.
</P>
<P>
   Respected figures like Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens and
Miami Heat coach Pat Riley held forth on what they thought the NBA
needed for the re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the meeting broke up, it became pretty clear what
the real issues would be,'' Welts said. ``And it all revolved
around how to bring fans back to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout finally ended, everything was in place. The NBA
office in New York told all 29 franchises that three things were
mandatory: hold a practice that would be free to the public, play a
pre-season game that would be admission-free at least to
season-ticket holders, and provide at least 500 tickets for every
game of the shortened schedule for $10 or less.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials distributed ``Communication Goals and Supporting
Objectives'' to each of the teams. And in a long series of
memoranda called ``Re-Launch Issues,'' it continually kept all of
the franchises abreast of how individual teams were accomplishing
the goals.
</P>
<P>
   The league also sent camera crews and representatives to all the
free practices to provide footage for what has become a series of
public service announcements broadcast by both NBC and TNN during
NBA games. The announcements show players practicing with fans in
team drills, throwing souvenir t-shirts into the crowd, high-fiving
school children and autographing Valentine's Day cards that were
mailed to every season-ticket holder in the league.
</P>
<P>
   There were even some cameo shots of players like the Celtics'
Kenny Anderson manning one of the ticket booths at the Fleet Center
on the first day of sales, collecting money, and handing out the
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports in the early days after the lockout followed
exactly along the NBA's marketing lines.
</P>
<P>
   Starved for any pro basketball action, especially as the NFL
season wound down to the Super Bowl, at least four Boston
television stations led their sportscasts on the night of the
Celtics' open practice with reports that were at least a few
minutes long _ about as long as it gets on local sportscasts. All
the reports were glowing appraisals of the team's attempt to
reconnect with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle cry when this lockout ended was `reach out and
touch the fans,''' WCVB-TV's Ed Harding gushed on one of the
broadcasts. ``And, boy is it working!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole effort of apologizing to the fans and restoring
their confidence in the game ended up providing for the sort of
coverage that we could not have paid for,'' said Stuart Layne,
executive vicepresident of marketing and sales for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Even the announcement, a week after the tentative settlement, by
the game's star nonpareil Michael Jordan that he was retiring,
seemed to rebound right into the league's marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he cuts across so many lines, Michael's announcement
had the unintended effect of focusing the attention of the casual
fan, and even many non-fans, on the fact that the NBA was back,''
said James Farr, operations manager for the Black Sports Agents
Association a California-based group. ``It's almost scary to think
of what political and world events his retirement pushed off the
front pages, and it was a great reminder for key target
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The close cooperation of the players, and their willingness to
work with the league and the franchises, has been one of the
brightest aspects of the NBA's effort. Officials familiar with the
bargaining that occured as the lockout wound down say that NBA
Commissioner David Stern and National Basketball Players'
Assocation President Hunter talked about the need for close
cooperation to maintain the business health of the game _ and all
of the faxes and e-mail messages reinforced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have definitely heard David say that once they had a sense
that they had the makings of a deal, one of the things both
parties, the players and the league, said was, `We have to make it
clear that we owe something to make it up to the fans,' '' said
Kevin O'Malley, senior vicepresident for programming at Turner
Broadcasting. ``They knew before they agreed to be back that, once
they were back, they were in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that beyond the tactics of dealing with the
emergency, the NBA made a series of smart strategy decisions about
the lockout itself that provided a powerful thrust for launching
the post-lockout marketing.
</P>
<P>
   By canceling the first 32 games of the season, and in effect
starting a whole new season late, the NBA helped assure that the
break in the action was not cataclysmic, observers say. By
contrast, Major League Baseball stopped action in midseason and
never played the World Series, alienating its fans. NBA and team
officials privately confirm that scheduling the lockout at the
beginning of the season, rather than during it, was all part of the
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be assured that one of the things we did learn is that
you are going to lose enormous support if you start a season and
then stop it, especially if you lose the championship games,'' a
high-ranking league official said.
</P>
<P>
   And the NBA returned just at the time when the nation
collectively turned its sports gaze from the National Football
League to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is any coincidence that some of the deadlines
the league was setting toward the end of negotiations was timed
around the Super Bowl,'' Rifkin said. ``David Stern envisions the
NBA as a living brand, and he can't just assume that everything be
in the proper place all of the time. He is a master at working at
it.''

LOS ANGELES, THE CITY WE LOVE TO HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one visits Los Angeles, it seems, without a
theory in hand. Once planted under the palm trees, soaking up the
sun, Easterners and Europeans can't resist the temptation to
``explain'' this most self-explanatory of American cities. Lovely
climate; add jobs, bring water, build highways. Voila! Megalopolis.
</P>
<P>
   But simple explanations never suffice for the self-appointed
guardians of Western (European) culture. Under the pens of the 20th
century's greatest writers, Los Angeles emerges as dark, menacing,
and catastrophe-prone, an ``Apocalypse theme park,'' in the words
of the LA theoretician du jour, Mike Davis. The only similar bolus
of silliness in the English language is men writing about the
mysteries of women. (And now, women writing about men.)
</P>
<P>
   A few examples suffice. Once in LA, Thornton Wilder, the bard of
Peterborough, N. H., declared: ``God never meant man to live
here.'' William Faulkner called LA ``the plastic ---hole of the
world.'' In his essay, ``Death in Hollywood,'' Evelyn Waugh (it
could just as well have been Aldous Huxley, another whiny Brit
lining his palm at the Hollywood trough) predicted that Southern
California would collapse and revert to desert.
</P>
<P>
   In her just-published memoir, ``Angels &AMP; Aliens,'' Sarah
Lawrence College writing teacher Mary Morris describes her brief,
forced exile in Orange County. Waking up on her first California
morning, Morris sees her neighbor ``dressed in a string bikini,
zinc oxide on her nose, wear(ing) a cordless Walkman that projects
two antennae from her head, and I know that I have come to Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Like the army of hacks preceding her, the otherwise
talented Morris has loaded up on cliches for her swoop through
Southern California. Car washing, she reports, is an ``odd
ritual.'' And a visit to the La Brea tar pits provokes the
Easterner's inevitable epiphanic meditation on LA's heart of
violence (saber-toothed tigers!) and destruction. ``In this city,''
Morris writes, ``catastrophe lurks everywhere.'' Then she returns
to New York. . .
</P>
<P>
   What's really going on here? In his 1994 book, ``Translating
LA,'' Boston-born Peter Theroux notes that ``very few LA books seem
to have been unpremeditated. . .It is a place that no one wants to
see through native eyes.'' He's right, and his own book is a
partial corrective to the trashing-LA trend. Theroux is an
Arabic-English translator and also a volunteer English tutor.
Having lived in Beirut, he understands the dynamics of a
multiracial mega-city, and he appreciates the difference between a
city people are fleeing from and a city people are fleeing to.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the reasons underlying Easterners' dread of
Los Angeles:
</P>
<P>
   --Hispanophobia. The men who created the first 200 years of
American history hailed from Europe north of the Alps. The Spanish
settled California, so its social as well as physical climate was
Mediterranean. Boston's own Richard Henry Dana nearly died from
culture shock in 1834 Monterey, presaging the Eastern elite's
discomfort with the languid lifestyle in La-La land.
</P>
<P>
   --Hollywood. Nothing galls the Eastern intelligentsia more than
the success of Hollywood, the most powerful cultural force in the
world. It turns out that people would rather watch a Sylvester
Stallone movie than read a David Foster Wallace novel. Who would
have thunk it?
</P>
<P>
   --Snobbery. Easterners sneer at the purveyors of LA's ``new''
wealth (the families Chandler, Ahmanson, Hammer, and Getty) as if
the tribes Rockefeller and Morgan had been endowing world culture
since before the Flood.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern Californians' greatest sin of all is happiness.
Their climate is inviting, the scenery gorgeous, and their attitude
disturbingly upbeat. This must be threatening; otherwise, why would
we relentlessly mock their smog, trumpet their natural disasters,
and deride their quest for spiritual self-satisfaction? Because, as
H. L. Mencken noted, nothing bothers the Puritan more than the
haunting fear that someone, somewhere is having a good time.

MERLONI FORGING AN IDENTITY WITH RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Mike Stanley walked by Lou Merloni, mock
disgust on his face.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Big League Lou,' that's his new name,'' said Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Kid shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, he's mad at me,'' said Merloni with a grin, ``because
Nomar and I were at the same restaurant he was the other night with
a friend, and we didn't stop by his table to say hello.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Stanley probably would have had no idea what to call
Merloni, unless he glanced at the name above the locker. ``Minor
League Lifer'' would have been a more plausible handle than ``Big
League Lou'' for Merloni, whose name never even appeared in the
fine print when the Sox' top prospects were being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni's only connection to the Red Sox' future, it seemed, was
his close friendship with Nomar Garciaparra, his former minor
league infield partner who achieved stardom while Merloni was still
muddling through Double A.
</P>
<P>
   But that all changed last year, through a chain of events that
began with Merloni making a favorable impression on manager Jimy
Williams during spring training. Merloni didn't make the club out
of camp, but he went down to Pawtucket and tore up the
International League, batting .386 with eight home runs in just 27
games.
</P>
<P>
   Then his pal, Garciaparra, did his part, sustaining a separated
shoulder while diving for a ground ball in Kansas City, with the
Red Sox ahead by 11 runs. Two days later, Merloni was making his
big league debut against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke around about that,'' Merloni said. ``Nomar tells me he
faked it. `What a friend,' he says. `I faked the injury for you.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, dressing at the adjoining locker, sticks by his
story. ``It's true,'' he says solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   But it was during Merloni's debut in Fenway Park five days later
that truth took a header, and fantasy prevailed. The kid who grew
up in Framingham, went to Providence College, and imagined such
moments only in his backyard, hit a home run into the left-field
screen off Royals pitcher Jose Rosado in his first at-bat on Yawkey
Way.
</P>
<P>
   For a comparable moment, you'd have to go back to the
19-year-old from Swampscott, Tony Conigliaro, back in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I did it,'' Merloni says now. ``The biggest
thing about that at-bat is that it went five, six, seven pitches. I
went deep into the count, 3-and-2, hit a couple of foul balls, and
because of that I was more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chance to talk to Tony's brother, Richie Conigliaro,
at the writers' dinner. He was in the stands when Tony C did it.
It's one of those things that you know, 50 years from now, will
still be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the amazing thing for me was just getting up there.
Even if I had struck out, I'd say the same. But the way it worked
out was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Garciaparra returned, Merloni remained a valuable
part of the Sox mix, starting 11 games at second base after Mark
Lemke went down and even making three starts at third. Twice he had
three hits in a game, and he showed a knack for hitting with
runners in scoring position (12 for 28, .429).
</P>
<P>
   But late in May, shortly after Garciaparra's return, Merloni ran
into the rolled-up tarp in Yankee Stadium while pursuing a foul fly
down the right-field line. His left knee ached, and though he
played through the pain for a month, he eventually was forced onto
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   What was originally diagnosed as inflammation in the knee, then
a deep bone bruise, was eventually determined to be a stress
fracture. Merloni was activated in September, but by then he'd
missed so much time that the Red Sox couldn't use him down the
stretch or in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the injury had been correctly diagnosed from the outset,
he said, he doubts the outcome would have been any different. The
anxiety might have been less, but the time needed to heal would
have been about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a bad break,'' he said. ``Physically, I was healthy when
I came back, but I wasn't close to being baseball-ready. As a rule,
I don't get nervous because I'm prepared out there. But if I'm on
the field and I'm not prepared, the tendency is to go `Geez.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Merloni was only a spectator when the Red Sox lost in the
playoffs to the Indians, but when asked if last summer's injury was
the worst setback of his career, he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even consider that as tough to deal with as some of
the things that happened in the minors,'' he said. ``I know when I
was up here, I did what I had to do to play well and help the team
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting hurt, yeah, that was frustrating, because you know you
can do so much more. But even though I was hurt, I showed them I
could play up here. The minors, that's a dogfight, just to prove
you can do it. When you have a setback there, that's much tougher
to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Benjamin left this winter as a free agent to sign a
two-year deal with the Pirates, Merloni was the logical candidate
to become the team's utilityman. Because he doesn't turn 28 till
April 6, Merloni hasn't abandoned the notion that he can play
second base on a regular basis in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even after last season, my name didn't even come up when
people talked about second base,'' he said. ``That's OK. It's been
that way my whole career, and I just use that as a way to motivate
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the importance lies in being in the big
leagues, not so much where you play once you're there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't like I've solidified myself as a part of this team,''
he said. ``But I think I've answered some questions about whether I
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly feel that way in Framingham. Last winter, 1,500
people showed up at a dinner to honor the pro ballplayers from the
town. They retired Merloni's number, and renamed a field at the
high school after him. The dinner also raised $11,000 for kids'
baseball programs in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself not to think about what was going on last season
until it was over,'' he said. ``But since then? Sure, I've sat back
and enjoyed it. I've watched a few films over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)The windup, and the 3-2 pitch from Rosado. There's a long
drive, deep to left field . . .(unitals)

FORMER SKEPTIC NOW TELLS OTHERS TO FIND THEIR ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandra Adler thought she was going crazy. For years she had kept
hearing voices. Her husband told her she needed help. So she
started seeing a psychiatrist. But the voices wouldn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Until one day, at the suggestion of someone in her therapy
group, Adler went to a lecture on angels. ``I was at a point in my
life where I was depressed and I was grasping for straws,'' she
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   That lecture more than 30 years ago was a turning point in her
life. Adler became convinced that the voices in her head were her
guardian angels trying to communicate with her.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Adler travels the country and the world spreading her
message that we all have guardian angels who are trying to reach
us.
</P>
<P>
   From the crowds she draws, it is clear that many people believe,
or want to believe, in angels. Adler, who holds a master's degree
in counseling from the University of Michigan, is one of many
speakers who has successfully tapped into the spiritual
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Adler says the challenge is recognizing an angel's call. Goose
pimples or a sudden case of the chills, Adler says, are actually
signs from angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angels come close to us to let us know that they are there to
protect us or to let us know know that we are doing the right
thing, '' said Adler, who is vice president of Inner Peace
Movement, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C. that offers
workshops on angels. ``Most people have had the experience of
following a hunch or an intuition and having it work out. Well,
that's one way that angels are helping us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inner Peace Movement says it has trained more than 100,000
people in the United States to communicate with their guardian
angels.
</P>
<P>
   Adler readily admits that many people find her ideas difficult
to grasp. That's part of the reason she spends so much time on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she says, she had her own doubts. ``I was the biggest
skeptic in the world,'' says Adler, who lives in Las Vegas. ``I was
a school teacher and we did not teach about this in school.''
</P>
<P>
   She became a believer after she started becoming involved with
Inner Peace Movement, which was founded in 1964. ``The Inner Peace
Movement doesn't do anything for you, but it will show you how to
do it for yourself,'' said Adler, speaking by telephone from
Jackson, Miss., where she was lecturing last week.
</P>
<P>
   These days angels are a hot commodity on film and in print.
``Touched by an Angel,'' in which angels come to the aid of
troubled souls, is a hit show for CBS. Dozens of volumes on angels
fill the new age and spirituality sections of bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Angels are central to Roman Catholicism and Judaism, cited in
the Bible as divine messengers. Some theologians argue that logic
cannot prove the existence of angels. Other scholars argue that
reason cannot disprove their existence either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prove anything, but if you experience it for
yourself then you know it's true,'' Adler says.
</P>
<P>
   There are four ways guardian angels try to get in touch with us,
Adler says. One is through intuition _ hearing a voice within.
Another is through vision _ noticing a shadow out of the corner of
your eye.
</P>
<P>
   A third way angels communicate is through prophecy, having
dreams come true or knowing who is calling before we pick up the
phone. And finally, Adler said there is ``gut feeling.'' Some
people describe the sensation of ``feeling someone tap them on
their shoulder and when they turn around no one is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler recounts a story told by a woman who attended one of the
lectures in Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was in the hospital waiting for surgery to begin to
remove a cancerous tumor from her breast. As she was lying waiting
for an X-ray she said she felt a hand touch the back of her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they looked at the X-ray the cancer was gone,'' Adler
said. ``She asked the doctors who had touched her neck and they
told her that no one had. At that moment she knew it was her
angel.''

   --In a strongly worded pastoral letter, the Most Rev. Sean
O'Malley, bishop of the Diocese of Fall River, Mass., Sunday
denounced capital punishment as a violation of Jesus's teachings
and a failed deterrent to violent crime.
</P>

MARKETING SAVVY HELPS NBA BOUNCE BACK WITH FANS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Within minutes of the National Basketball Association officially
returning to business at 2 p.m. on January 22, e-mail and faxes
from the league offices in Manhattan began arriving in the 29 team
offices around the country and in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinated message _ devised over the course of the
six-month lockout, and reiterated frequently through the start of
play February 5 _ was that franchise executives, coaches and, most
of all , players should participate in a grand marketing strategy.
The goal, as articulated in one e-mail message: ``Re-establishing
the standing and reputation of the NBA and its teams with fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are inviting NBA fans back to our game,'' another e-mail
advised the franchises. ``Demonstrate that we recognize NBA fans
(itals)do not owe us(unitals) renewed support, and show that we are
committed to earning back their support...Ground communications in
substantive policies and actions that demonstrate the NBA and its
teams accept full responsibility for any damage done to the bond
between the league and its players and NBA fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In a performance that amounts to a marketing slam dunk, the NBA
has roared back this month with fan support equal to or exceeding
pre-lockout levels. The league has defied the conventional wisdom
that its long labor dispute would harm the NBA and create a long,
difficult recovery.
</P>
<P>
   By developing grassroots, guerilla, marketing tactics even
before the lockout ended , the NBA has marshalled the support of
its players, its network television partners and its corporate
sponsors in a massive campaign to make amends with the fans. Long
accepted as the best at marketing among the four major professional
sports leagues, the NBA used the tactics to quickly build on the
successes of the past 20 years, when it established enduring
relationships between the game's biggest stars and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been able to handle what easily could have been a
real near-death experience, and turn it into what now looks like a
blip on the screen,'' said Glenn Rifkin, the Acton, Mass. author of
``Radical Marketing,'' which includes a chapter on the winning
strategies and tactics of the NBA. ``The NBA has responded
brilliantly to this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Network television ratings are up almost 20 percent _ from an
average of 4.6 on NBC last year to 5.5 through Thursday night's
games, and from an average of 1.7 on TNN last year to 2.0.
Television executives and league officials say that some local
cable television broadcasts in areas directly surrounding the
franchises are performing even better.
</P>
<P>
   Home-game attendance since the lockout has either increased or
remained the same as last season among 14 of the NBA's 29 teams,
according to a survey conducted by Street &AMP; Smith's SPORTSBUSINESS
Journal. Another 11 teams are showing declines of less than 10
percent. And only four are showing anything like the sharp declines
experienced by baseball franchises throughout 1996 and much of
1997, during that league's strike.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's marketing effort was devised after much preparation.
``It was really a strategy that evolved along a few lines all
through the lockout, back as early as October,'' said Rick Welts,
chief of marketing for the NBA. ``At one point, we actually had one
group we called the Re-entry Group working in one room on what
issues we would face if some games were cancelled, but we returned
to play this year. And, in another room, we had a different group
working on the issues that would arise if we lost a full season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the end, when the lockout was over, everyone knew what
we were going to do and what their role would be,'' Welts said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, observers say, is that the NBA has accomplished in
about three weeks what it took Major League Baseball almost three
seasons to do: repair the breach between the fans and the game. And
baseball needed the riveting home run record race between Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa _ to get the job done after its disastrous
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been amazing, the speed with which fans have come
back,'' to the NBA, said Richard Lapchick, director of the Center
for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. ``And
we're talking about fan support at a surprising level for a game
that sometimes isn't even being played that well, yet, given that
some of the players are still a little out of shape.''
</P>
<P>
   In late December, before it was clear any games would be played
this year, the NBA invited officials from across the spectrum of
league interests to a major meeting in Manhattan. Representatives
of the television networks, key sponsors, general managers,
coaches, former players and marketing officials and consultants all
attended.
</P>
<P>
   Respected figures like Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens and
Miami Heat coach Pat Riley held forth on what they thought the NBA
needed for the re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the meeting broke up, it became pretty clear what
the real issues would be,'' Welts said. ``And it all revolved
around how to bring fans back to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout finally ended, everything was in place. The NBA
office in New York told all 29 franchises that three things were
mandatory: hold a practice that would be free to the public, play a
pre-season game that would be admission-free at least to
season-ticket holders, and provide at least 500 tickets for every
game of the shortened schedule for $10 or less.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials distributed ``Communication Goals and Supporting
Objectives'' to each of the teams. And in a long series of
memoranda called ``Re-Launch Issues,'' it continually kept all of
the franchises abreast of how individual teams were accomplishing
the goals.
</P>
<P>
   The league also sent camera crews and representatives to all the
free practices to provide footage for what has become a series of
public service announcements broadcast by both NBC and TNN during
NBA games. The announcements show players practicing with fans in
team drills, throwing souvenir t-shirts into the crowd, high-fiving
school children and autographing Valentine's Day cards that were
mailed to every season-ticket holder in the league.
</P>
<P>
   There were even some cameo shots of players like the Celtics'
Kenny Anderson manning one of the ticket booths at the Fleet Center
on the first day of sales, collecting money, and handing out the
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports in the early days after the lockout followed
exactly along the NBA's marketing lines.
</P>
<P>
   Starved for any pro basketball action, especially as the NFL
season wound down to the Super Bowl, at least four Boston
television stations led their sportscasts on the night of the
Celtics' open practice with reports that were at least a few
minutes long _ about as long as it gets on local sportscasts. All
the reports were glowing appraisals of the team's attempt to
reconnect with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle cry when this lockout ended was `reach out and
touch the fans,''' WCVB-TV's Ed Harding gushed on one of the
broadcasts. ``And, boy is it working!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole effort of apologizing to the fans and restoring
their confidence in the game ended up providing for the sort of
coverage that we could not have paid for,'' said Stuart Layne,
executive vicepresident of marketing and sales for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Even the announcement, a week after the tentative settlement, by
the game's star nonpareil Michael Jordan that he was retiring,
seemed to rebound right into the league's marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he cuts across so many lines, Michael's announcement
had the unintended effect of focusing the attention of the casual
fan, and even many non-fans, on the fact that the NBA was back,''
said James Farr, operations manager for the Black Sports Agents
Association a California-based group. ``It's almost scary to think
of what political and world events his retirement pushed off the
front pages, and it was a great reminder for key target
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The close cooperation of the players, and their willingness to
work with the league and the franchises, has been one of the
brightest aspects of the NBA's effort. Officials familiar with the
bargaining that occured as the lockout wound down say that NBA
Commissioner David Stern and National Basketball Players'
Assocation President Hunter talked about the need for close
cooperation to maintain the business health of the game _ and all
of the faxes and e-mail messages reinforced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have definitely heard David say that once they had a sense
that they had the makings of a deal, one of the things both
parties, the players and the league, said was, `We have to make it
clear that we owe something to make it up to the fans,' '' said
Kevin O'Malley, senior vicepresident for programming at Turner
Broadcasting. ``They knew before they agreed to be back that, once
they were back, they were in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that beyond the tactics of dealing with the
emergency, the NBA made a series of smart strategy decisions about
the lockout itself that provided a powerful thrust for launching
the post-lockout marketing.
</P>
<P>
   By canceling the first 32 games of the season, and in effect
starting a whole new season late, the NBA helped assure that the
break in the action was not cataclysmic, observers say. By
contrast, Major League Baseball stopped action in midseason and
never played the World Series, alienating its fans. NBA and team
officials privately confirm that scheduling the lockout at the
beginning of the season, rather than during it, was all part of the
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be assured that one of the things we did learn is that
you are going to lose enormous support if you start a season and
then stop it, especially if you lose the championship games,'' a
high-ranking league official said.
</P>
<P>
   And the NBA returned just at the time when the nation
collectively turned its sports gaze from the National Football
League to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is any coincidence that some of the deadlines
the league was setting toward the end of negotiations was timed
around the Super Bowl,'' Rifkin said. ``David Stern envisions the
NBA as a living brand, and he can't just assume that everything be
in the proper place all of the time. He is a master at working at
it.''

US SHOULD LOOK IN THE MIRROR BEFORE RAPPING CHINA ON ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how long the White House can
recite China's abuses when its own moral threads are unraveling to
the point that it has become the schoolmarm scolding the world in
exposed lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the State Department issued a stinging report on
human rights abuses in China. The report said, ``Abuses included
instances of extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of
prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention,
lengthy incommunicado detention and denial of due process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prison conditions at most facilities remained harsh. In many
cases, particularly sensitive political cases, the judicial system
denies criminal defendants basic legal safeguards and due process
because authorities attach higher priority to maintaining public
order and suppressing political opposition than to enforcing legal
norms.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point, President Clinton said last weekend in
California, ``I believe, sooner or later, China will have to come
to understand'' that it ``cannot purchase stability at the expense
of freedom.'' He said this as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
was off to China, where she lectured Chinese officials on human
rights. Albright said, ``it is very important for China to be on
the right side of history.''
</P>
<P>
   It is increasingly difficult for America to demand that China be
on the right side of history when you could take many parts of the
State Department report about China, change only the location and
you could have the same report about America.
</P>
<P>
   The United States knocks China's courts, but the United States
has the world's highest level of incarceration in the developed
world. The report complains that China does not openly recognize
racism against ethnic minorities, yet nearly every serious study of
the American criminal justice system has found that it profoundly
discriminates against African Americans and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of this was Sunday's New York Times, which
laid out (finally) the facts that allow one to conclude that the
war on crack has been every bit as oppressive for black and brown
people as the tanks rolling down Tiananmen Square. Filled with
hysteria and absent of medical reasoning, Congress enacted laws in
the 1980s that sent holders of 40 grams of crack cocaine to jail
for 10 years while someone nailed with 400 grams of powdered
cocaine could serve a year or less in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Though federal statistics show that up to 62 percent of crack
users are actually white, 90 percent of the people jailed under
federal laws for crack are African American. Though white Americans
are 76 percent of the population, consume 75 percent of the illegal
drugs in the US, African Americans and Latinos make up 79 percent
of drug convictions in state courts from 1990-96 and 71 percent of
the drug convictions in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   This has not reduced drug use. Only 5 percent of federal crack
arrests were for high-level dealers. Instead, the harsh laws
ensnared the chumps of the trade and unwitting friends and family
of dealers, sometimes resulting in 5 to 10 years for first-time
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic that Clinton chose California to urge the Chinese
government to open up its political system and not to ``limit the
aspirations of its people.'' California is one of the nation's best
examples of how the drug war has sucked aspiration out of the reach
of the state's youth.
</P>
<P>
   There are now five times more African Americans in California
jails and prisons than in the state's universities. Spending on
prisons in California has grown over twice as fast as spending for
the state's public schools, and has skyrocketed while college
spending has been cut. The cuts are so parallel with prison
spending that there is little doubt of a direct shift in spending,
even though it costs $22,000 a year to incarcerate someone in the
state while it costs $4,000 a year for college. Prison guards now
make more than university professors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton knows this. He knew that the crack laws were unjust from
the start. He knows that vast numbers of the people being jailed
for drugs are nonviolent offenders whom studies would say would
more effectively reclaim their lives and the livelihoods of their
families with education and other second chances.
</P>
<P>
   But he and his cowering administration has been unwilling for
six years to challenge the gulag mentality of the Republicans.
Clinton has waited so long that he has handed the Chinese
government the spoon to feed him his own medicine. When the State
Department released its report last week, Chinese officials wasted
no time in firing back, in effect, ``Yes, and what about your
prisons, your black people dying at the hands of the police, your
widening gap between rich and poor and 41 million people going
without health insurance?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has waited so long that each complaint about China only
begs a harder look at home. He criticizes China for lack of due
process. He cannot say anything until he moves to end the undue
process of the crack laws and the undue procession of black men
from hope into jail.

TOBACCO WINDFALL CREATES A PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, R.I. _ More than $16 billion is about to flow into New
England from the nation's tobacco companies, and the mayor of this
debt-ridden, blue-collar community is hoping for a few dollars to
shore up roads, build a new elementary school, and fix the sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor William R. Macera is just one of the many hundreds _ city
leaders, citizens, champions of all kinds of pet projects _ who now
look to their state capitols with great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For legislators already riding high on the booming economy, it
would seem a bonanza: millions of new dollars to dispense without a
dime of new taxes. But as lawmakers begin to compose their annual
budgets, the newfound money has sparked a contentious debate over
where the money will have the most impact, whether the money should
be returned to taxpayers, and who should decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the largest single windfall this region has seen in
recent memory,'' said Darrell West, chairman of the political
science department at Brown University. ``It's real money.''
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from the November settlement of a lawsuit
between the states and the tobacco industry, and will begin flowing
once 80 percent of the states representing 80 percent of the
settlement dollars receive their state courts' approval of the
deal. The states argued that they had spent billions of dollars
caring for sick smokers. The tobacco companies agreed to pay 46
participating states, including all of New England, a total of $206
billion over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are virtually no strings attached to the money. One
unresolved issue remains, however: whether the federal government
will try to recover some of the settlement money to cover its
Medcaid expenses, and whether it will try to impose conditions on
the state spending.
</P>
<P>
   With so much cash on the horizon, lawmakers must decide whether
to take their millions and create new health programs, provide tax
cuts, or launch antismoking campaigns, among other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that kind of money coming in and have 150
legislators and a governor, you're going to get 151 proposals,''
said Paul S. Kelly, Rhode Island's Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a different problem from the one lawmakers grappled
with a decade ago. Then, New England was gripped by recession. In
just four years, the region lost 766,000 jobs. Unemployment
averaged about 8 percent, tax revenues were low, and states
struggled to provide basic services.
</P>
<P>
   Today the region is economically healthy, and all six states are
running surpluses, not deficits. Unemployment has hit a stunning
3.2 percent, well below the national average of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful feeling, fighting over where money's going to
go, rather than how to generate it,'' said Representative Alfred A.
Russo Jr., who hopes to send Rhode Island's portion to the cities
and towns, including Johnston, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In this suburb of Providence, dominated by modest, low-slung
homes, strip malls, and the state dump, the mayor knows what he
would do with some of the tobacco money. The rescue squad vehicle
is expected to fail its upcoming inspection, and a replacement will
cost $110,000. The battalion chief's car has been grounded, too.
The school-age population has exploded and the town needs another
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't take into account the aging sewers, the
pothole-ridden roads, and this year's $18 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're desperate here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Macera would like just a little bit of the $63.9 million
expected to arrive in time for Rhode Island's budget in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need new fire stations, we need new schools. The sewers are
overflowing. Any money that comes into the state and that comes to
the town will be well spent,'' he said. ``I can justify in five
seconds what we need the money for.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, there are people just like Macera, all hoping
and even lobbying for some of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Mayor Thomas M. Menino has already been squabbling
with Governor Paul Cellucci, pushing for money for Massachusetts'
cities. Cellucci has rejected Menino's advances, telling him that
the cities are running surpluses and don't need the extra dollars.
While they bicker, $96.9 million awaits the Commonwealth in an
escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the antismoking activists who look with
dismay at Macera, Menino, and others for wanting to use the money
for anything other than health care and tobacco control. Even
though the states are legally free to spend the money as they wish,
the American Cancer Society, the Heart Association, and the
American Lung Association argue it should be used to help smokers
quit and to prevent teenagers from taking up the habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This didn't just come out of the sky,'' said Margaret Kane,
executive director of the American Lung Association of Rhode
Island, referring to the settlement. ``It's a direct result of
tobacco-related illness.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a familiar argument to Donna Sytek, the Republican
speaker of the New Hampshire House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health groups look at it and say, `At last we'll be able to
expand smoking-prevention programs,' or those of us trying to
balance the budget say, `Good, $43 million would be very helpful,'
'' Sytek said. ``Any time there's free money forever, there's no
limit to the imaginations of legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the money is not forever. The payments stop after 25 years.
There are ways to make it last longer, however. Both Cellucci and
Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Charles J. Fogarty have proposed
putting the money in trust funds and using the interest earned for
programs.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, bolstering health care is a popular
proposal. Cellucci and Fogarty both would dedicate their trust
funds for health care. In Vermont, Governor Howard Dean said there
is a consensus to use the money for prescriptions for seniors and
health care for children.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers want to use the money for tax cuts or to solve
fiscal problems. In Maine, Governor Angus King, an Independent,
would return the money to the voters in the form of tax cuts. In
Rhode Island, Republican Governor Lincoln Almond would put the
money in the general fund, giving him leeway to fund existing
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Sytek wants the money to help pay for a
solution to the state's education-funding crisis. A court-ordered
deadline is looming, forcing legislators to devise a way to pay for
public schools without relying on local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect of riches to come, Fogarty sighs as he
works to put together a coalition to funnel the money directly to
health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's better to manage in difficult situations _ you
don't like what you have to do, but you know what you have to do,''
he said.

A WHIFF OF PRAGMATISM AT A GOP GATHERING IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. &UR;  &LR; -- While the junior varsity scrimmaged here,
the stars stayed aloof. George Walker Bush was in Texas. Elizabeth
Hanford Dole was wherever top-tier candidates go to avoid wretches
mired in single-digit misery.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Dole prosper in the polls because of name
identification and also because they shun depressing events like a
weekend hoedown of California Republicans. The party that delivered
11 nominees to the national ticket in this century once savored
good times, but the Golden State electorate's rebuke to the GOP was
thorough, extinguishing its high spirits.
</P>
<P>
   They argued about abortion, which they always do. In the first
contested election in 28 years for state chairman, a conservative
candidate lost to a very conservative candidate. The same thing
happened in the race for vice chairman. But the vote was closer
than many expected and the rhetoric lacked the barbecue flavor that
usually accompanies such fratricidal rites. In this party, the
zealots have become zombies and pragmatism, not Prozac, is becoming
the drug of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Many delegates ignored live candidates to focus on the absentee
from Texas. Bush's candidacy is moving from a dangerous Mario Cuomo
stage to an equally risky Edmund Muskie phase. In 1987, Cuomo was
``Hamlet on the Hudson,'' undecided about whether running for
president was more important than staying in Albany to wrestle the
Legislature. Bush places a high priority on Austin, but is nudging
closer toward a candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   His entourage is swelling with strangers eager to fall in love
before the first blind date. In 1971, Democrats also swooned over
Muskie, the Maine senator whom they hoped would evict Richard Nixon
from the White House. When Muskie faltered, his admirers were
trapped inside the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   A clutch of California Republican legislators here tossed a
draft-Bush pizza party during the convention. The pizza was free,
important symbolism since the event competed with a luncheon
address by Steve Forbes, the New Jersey magazine heir who spent his
own millions in 1996, much of it to bash fellow candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may pass on federal matching funds, so he can compete with
Forbes. Bush's fellow Texan, the late John B. Connally, tried
self-financing in 1971 to no avail. But Bush's fans do not compare
his candidacy to that of Connally, Cuomo, or Muskie. They hearken
back to another native of Texas, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the last
Republican president elected on his first try as a candidate. That
was in 1952, as Lamar Alexander points out, hoping that his party
will prefer a familiar face like his. Republicans are hierarchical
and often favor experienced candidates and familiar faces, but
maybe a familiar name will do, especially in desperate times. How
desperate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Republican Party chairman in Fresno County at 27 years
old in the year after Watergate,'' recalled Bill Jones, the
secretary of state, one of the few Republicans to survive a
statewide sweep by Democrats. ``I've seen the bottom. This isn't
the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom seemed close to the dispirited delegates. Even at the
vendors' bazaar, anti-Clinton T-shirts and buttons lacked the power
to shock. Such material no longer amuses while it grosses out the
faithful. Reports on Clinton's behavior have robbed his foes of
their righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   Fringe groups are still sex-obsessed. The Young Americans for
Freedom offered a loathsome leaflet that shows how effortlessly
they can move from red-baiting to gay-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   But even paladins of morality can change. Bush has said he would
answer ``None of your business'' to questions about his past
personal life. I asked the Rev. Louis Sheldon of the Traditional
Values Coalition about that response and he replied, ``As long as
he doesn't lie.'' Sheldon, leaning toward Forbes, plans to visit
Texas soon. As the preacher said, ``I'm tired of losing.''

BC NEEDS LUCK AS 13TH SEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You want to talk about long shots in the Big East
men's tournament? Look no further than the Boston College Eagles.
After finishing last in the conference with a 3-15 record (6-20
overall), the Eagles have the dreaded 13th seed _ as almost all the
league coaches had predicted in a preseason poll _ and face the
unenviable task of hobbling into a first-round game against
fourth-seeded Syracuse, a team that has posed the biggest matchup
problems for them this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have that seed,'' said BC coach Al Skinner, whose team
wrapped up the regular season with a 78-59 loss at Notre Dame
Sunday, ``but we're a much different team than everyone had
predicted. People were talking about how we weren't going to win a
game and that we were going to be the worst team in the Big East
ever, and obviously that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's most disappointing to me is that we're not
healthy at this point in time. We're already shorthanded and we're
already undermanned, and for us not to be healthy we really cannot
put forth our best foot. But you've got to play the cards that
you're dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Wednesday's Syracuse-BC game will advance to the
quarterfinals Thursday to face the winner of the matchup between
No. 5 seed Villanova and No. 12 seed West Virginia. Top-seeded
Connecticut, which earned a first-round bye along with No. 2 seed
Miami and No. 3 seed St. John's, will face the winner of the
matchup between eighth-seeded Notre Dame and No. 9 Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, No. 7 Providence squares off against No. 10
Georgetown for the right to face the Hurricanes, and No. 6 Rutgers
will face No. 11 Pittsburgh for a berth against the Red Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to play only three games is a competitive advantage,''
said UConn coach Jim Calhoun. ``And it is even more of an advantage
big picture-wise for the next week (in the NCAA Tournament).''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles have more pressing concerns, namely injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Michael Cotton is still ailing with a right foot
sprain he suffered Feb. 17 at Georgetown. Although he was not
expected to play against Notre Dame, Cotton suited up and started.
</P>
<P>
   ``His foot is still pretty sore and he really shouldn't have
been out there,'' Skinner said. ``But he's making a tremendous
sacrifice for the team just to get out there, because he really
should not be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton is probable for the game against the Orangemen, and BC
will desperately need his court presence to help freshman forward
Brian Ross battle 6-foot-8-inch junior Etan Thomas, who led the
Orangemen with 25 points and 9 rebounds in a 73-56 rout at BC Feb.
24.
</P>
<P>
   That completed a sweep for Syracuse, which pinned a humiliating
39-point loss on BC, 90-51, at the Carrier Dome Jan. 21. That was
the second most-lopsided game in Big East history and BC's worst
conference loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that when you watch film on them, you see
BC play well,'' said Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, whose team has a
4-2 tourney record vs. the Eagles. ``I've seen 'em play well
against a lot of teams. I saw them play well and beat Seton Hall. I
saw them play well and beat West Virginia. I saw them play well
against UConn. So we know they're capable of playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to guard against the fact we've had two very good
games against them. We have to be concerned about that and that's
been uppermost in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ross, ``They're definitely a bunch of arrogant kids, so
they're probably going to come in thinking they can walk all over
us again. But we're just going to have to play hard just like we
have all year. But I know that, just like a lot of the freshmen,
I'm really excited to get the chance to play at Madison Square
Garden for the first time.''

REINING IN THE NEW `MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From out of nowhere, it seems, day traders have emerged as a
modern-day menace. Congress is worried about them. So is Richard
Syron, head of the American Stock Exchange, Frank Zarb, chairman of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, and securities
regulators in many states, including Massachusetts. Just Tuesday
William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth, took action against
a day-trading firm, the fourth such crackdown in the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the day is: How worried should the rest of us be
about day trading and what exactly should we do about it?
</P>
<P>
   In case you've missed it, day traders are mini ``masters of the
universe.'' Using powerful computers, they buy and sell stocks at
an incredible clip, hoping to make money on small movements in
price. Estimates put the number of active day traders in the
country at between 10,000 and 15,000. Anecdotal evidence suggests
the vast majority of people who try it lose money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a grave concern that people are being roped into this
without understanding the risks,'' says Philip Feigin, president of
the trade association for state securities regulators. For Feigin
and others, the number one issue in day trading is disclosure.
Simply put, do investors know what they are getting into?
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy of day trading is very different from normal
investing,'' says Galvin. ``In many cases I don't believe that
difference has been explained to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin's office filed a complaint Tuesday against TCI Corp. for
deceptive marketing. In its advertising, the state charges, the
firm told prospective customers they were likely to achieve profits
and that they could earn ``six- to seven-figure incomes per year.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a second fear about day trading: that it could have
harmful effects on the stock market in general. Robert Glauber, a
former undersecretary of the US Treasury, now at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government, worries what might
happen if prices of the hot stocks favored by day traders suddenly
take a dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone tried to get out the door at the same time, would
they all be able to fit through?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are paid to worry about such questions. They are also
paid to make sure that investors are getting good information and
that crooks are put out of business. Beyond that, however, it is
not clear regulators can or should do anything about day trading.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, day trading is a logical, if extreme, step along a
path we have been traveling for some time. Joseph Nocera called it
the ``democratization of finance.'' In a 1994 book called ``A Piece
of the Action,'' Nocera traced the history of financial innovations
like the credit card, the mutual fund, and the discount brokerage
and concluded they all had something in common: They gave ordinary
people access to the financial system. With the credit card, people
got short-term loans; with the mutual fund, they got a chance to
invest in stocks, once the exclusive province of the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   The ``money revolution'' that Nocera described has been a mixed
blessing. On the plus side, middle-class people have been able to
salt away money in 401(k) plans, a big boost to their retirement
savings. On the other side, those same people can wind up with
nothing if they make poor investment choices. People with checkered
credit histories now have the convenience of using a credit card.
They also have a chance to go bankrupt if they don't meet their
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   With day trading, the average guy can do what was once possible
only for professional traders. How much more democratic can you
get? That same average guy can also lose his shirt. When Galvin's
office took action last year against a day-trading firm called
Block Trading, they found that 67 of the 68 customers at the Boston
office lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the word out about those miserable results _ full
disclosure _ may do more to put a lid on day trading than all of
the enforcement actions put together. How many people, after all,
would flock to an investment that all but guaranteed they would
come out losers? As John Kenneth Galbraith put it in his book,
``The Great Crash'': ``Speculation on a large scale requires a
pervasive sense of confidence and optimism and a conviction that
ordinary people were meant to be rich.''
</P>
<P>
   As more ordinary people discover that getting rich isn't that
easy, they may lose their enthusiasm for day trading. And if, after
hearing an explanation of the risks, they still want to play, who
are we to stop them?

FOES AND ALLIES SAY MICROSOFT HAS STUMBLED IN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. is one of the most profitable
companies in any industry. Its earnings stun Wall Street. Its sales
confound competitors. Its chairman is the wealthiest man on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   And yet despite its legendary competence, the world's dominant
software company appears to have bungled the basics in a crucial
task: defending itself against federal antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   With the landmark Microsoft trial on a six-week recess before
hearing from a few final witnesses, a striking range of people now
say the company is in danger of losing the case. That's due in
large part, critics say, to Microsoft's own courtroom missteps that
have ranged from botched video demonstrations to a fundamental
miscalculation in legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of federal District Court in
Washington rules against Microsoft, he could order new constraints
on the Redmond, Wash., company's business practices and open
Microsoft to a rush of private antitrust suits. (A ruling is
thought to be at least three months off.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's presentation is stunning in its ineptitude,''
said Rich Gray, a Silicon Valley antitrust attorney who has
followed the trial closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be used for years in law schools to teach students
how not to try a case,'' said Dan Small, a Boston trial lawyer who
wrote the American Bar Association manual on preparing witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Thierer, a Microsoft sympathizer at the conservative
Heritage Foundation, said the company has all but lost. ``It
appears that the government has successfully taken down
Microsoft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cautions not to judge its case only on the courtroom
action. Much of its defense lies in the hundreds of pages of
written testimony and economic analysis that are part of the trial
record, but which have not received much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think courtroom theatrics are important, then the
government is doing a good job,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman who attends the trial each day and then wages a public
relations campaign on the courthouse steps. ``If you think creating
a trial record is important, then the government's case is pretty
threadbare.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government faces high legal hurdles in proving
that Microsoft misused monopoly power to crush its rivals.
Microsoft may have failed to use its court time to best advantage,
but that does not lighten the legal burden for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states charge that Microsoft has
illegally used a monopoly with its Windows operating system to hurt
rivals, such as Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun Microsystems
Inc. Both companies make products that could shatter the dominance
of Windows, software that controls the basic functions of 90
percent of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not illegal for Microsoft to operate a monopoly, the
law bars it from using monopoly powers to eliminate competitors or
to push into new lines of business.
</P>
<P>
   With money to buy the best defense around, Microsoft hired the
well-heeled firm of Sullivan and Cromwell. The firm is working in
tandem with Microsoft's in-house counsel, William Neukom.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that Microsoft has made two types of errors.
</P>
<P>
   First, they say, Microsoft failed to highlight its best argument
_ that consumers have only benefitted from its aggressive behavior
_ because it has been too busy countering every government claim of
a bullying tactic. Microsoft could have acknowledged that it plays
rough, but argued that this helped produce a healthy, competitive
software industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are alive and well and vigorous in the software market,
and prices are low,'' said Thierer of the Heritage Foundation.
``But Microsoft got too bogged down in fighting over legalities and
never got to say this.''
</P>
<P>
   The second criticism is that the Microsoft team was
ill-prepared, a crucial error given its courtroom adversary. The
government's lead lawyer, David Boies, was hired for his deftness
in handling complex litigation, including IBM Corp.'s defense on
antitrust charges, which the federal government abandoned after 13
years. Boies has had little trouble capitalizing on every Microsoft
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been several mistakes, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Take the deposition of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, which the
government played for the court on videotape. In it, Gates appeared
forgetful and argumentative, wrestling with prosecutors over the
meaning of words like ``compete'' and ``concerned.'' When Gates
claimed that he was not focused on attacking rivals like Netscape,
or that he had little role in key business decisions, the
government was able to produce e-mail messages written by him that
suggested a different story.
</P>
<P>
   The company appeared to ignore the public relations aspect of
the tape. Microsoft lawyers should have known that Gates's body
language and linguistic parsing would hurt him in court, said
antitrust specialist William Kovacic, a visiting professor at
George Washington University Law School. ``You have to make the
video a chance to tell your story,'' he said. Instead, Microsoft
allowed the government ``to tell the judge that this company is
untrustworthy, ruthless, perhaps deceitful, and you should not
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more shocking to some lawyers was Microsoft's handling of a
second video.
</P>
<P>
   This one was meant to bolster Microsoft's argument that its
browser and its Windows software are a single product.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that they should be sold separately and that
Microsoft merged them only to hurt Netscape. If consumers receive
Microsoft's browser for free when they buy Windows, they have no
incentive to buy Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's video was meant to show that Windows runs poorly
when its browser is removed. But under questioning by Boies, a
Microsoft executive was forced to admit that what had been
characterized as a demonstration on one computer was actually a
compilation of work on several computers, with the tape spliced
together.

   ``That was just a head-shaker _ you can't believe it's
happening,'' said Gray, the California lawyer. ``It's incredible
that lawyers at any level of competence would allow you to bring in
evidence that wasn't what they said it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, witness after witness for Microsoft has been flummoxed
by Boies, who is expert at using a witness's own writings to
contradict his courtroom testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executive Dan Rosen, for example, took the stand last
week to testify about a crucial June 1995 meeting with Netscape.
The government claims that during the meeting Microsoft illegally
offered to divide the market for Internet browsers so that each
company would keep its own niche and would not compete against each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen testified that he had not even seen Netscape's browser
until July, suggesting he could not have been worrying about it at
the June meeting. But Boies produced an e-mail by Rosen showing he
had the browser in April, forcing Rosen to recant.
</P>
<P>
   It's an open question whether Microsoft's credibility is truly
damaged and how much it will matter once Jackson retires to his
office to study the full record, including testimony not aired in
court and plenty of economic data.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the stuff that makes a splash while people are in the
courtroom does not really matter,'' said Ronald Cass, dean of the
Boston University School of Law, a Microsoft ally who has appeared
at company news conferences. The judge, he said, will focus less on
theatrics than ``on the actual evidence and how it stacks up.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is how some outside observers score the case so far:
</P>
<P>
   --Is Microsoft a monopoly?
</P>
<P>
   If the government cannot prove Windows is a monopoly, then it
can't claim Microsoft is illegally using monopoly powers to hurt
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Monopolies hold power because customers have little or no choice
of alternative products. But Microsoft has argued that if it failed
to innovate, it would soon lose its leadership role in the dynamic
software market. And its economics expert said that if Microsoft
truly controlled the market, it would charge as much as $2,000 for
Windows instead of $50.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kovacic and many other observers bet that Jackson will
view Windows' 90 percent market share as evidence of monopoly.
Moreover, Compaq Computer Corp. executive John Rose, testifying for
Microsoft, acknowledged that there was no real alternative to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bet you the price of a double mocha latte that Mr.
Rose's comment will be quoted in Judge Jackson's opinion,'' Kovacic
said.
</P>
<P>
   --Did Microsoft illegally use its monopoly power to attack
rivals, such as Netscape?
</P>
<P>
   The government said that Microsoft threatened to strip Compaq
and Gateway 2000, a major computer seller, of the right to sell
Windows if they did not back away from Netscape and adopt the
Microsoft browser. Officials from other companies, such as America
Online, said they chose the Microsoft browser only because
Microsoft promised them favorable placement in the Windows package.
</P>
<P>
   If true, Microsoft may have illegally used its Windows monopoly
to hurt Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has sought to show that these deals were partnerships
designed to help customers. Moreover, the company said, the
government has not refuted a key Microsoft argument: that Microsoft
has not blocked Netscape from getting its product to customers.
``They will distribute about 150 million copies this year,'' said
spokesman Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said he suspected the judge would not find this argument
convincing. ``This is an area in which the law tends to be
government-friendly,'' he said. ``The government probably has an
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gray said the government has probably not made its case,
because it has not shown that Microsoft has anything approaching
control of the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   --Did Microsoft illegally try to divide the browser market with
Netscape so that the two companies would not compete?
</P>
<P>
   Despite testimony to the contrary from Gates and other Microsoft
executives, the government has produced internal Microsoft e-mail
messages showing that the company was worried about the threat from
Netscape at the time of the 1995 meeting. The result, said Gray, is
``a fairly compelling case'' from the government.
</P>
<P>
   But showing that Microsoft feared Netscape does not mean that
the government has proved Microsoft actually made an illegal offer.
According to Kovacic, case law requires that an offer to divide a
market be unambiguous. He believes that Microsoft may have created
enough doubt to escape the charge.
</P>
<P>
   --Did Microsoft illegally tie its Internet browser to Windows?
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft's video demonstration turned into a fiasco,
many observers say the company could win on this point. That is
because a federal Appeals Court last year opened the door for
Microsoft to combine the products if it could show any consumer
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from 24 witnesses over 62 days since October, the
trial recessed Friday for six weeks or more as Jackson hears a
criminal case. The government and Microsoft will then present
rebuttal witnesses, who have not yet been named.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not yet proposed what remedy it will seek if
it wins. The judge could force Microsoft to abandon certain
business practices, such as contracts that discourage partners from
working with Netscape. He could force the company to remove its
browser from Windows. The most extreme penalty _ breaking Microsoft
into a Windows and non-Windows company _ is considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, there is as much mystery in how Microsoft
allowed itself to stumble as there is in how Jackson will rule.
Gates is known as a hands-on manager. Did he micromanage the
defense? Did the lawyers work well with the technology people?
</P>
<P>
   Said Kovacic: ``We won't know until there is that insider's
account of who did what.''

HBO SHOW A LESSON IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think there's nothing more to learn about the history of women
in sports? A new HBO special is out to prove you wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dare to Compete: The Struggle of Women in Sports,'' which
debuts Monday at 10 p.m., traces American society from the
Victorian Age through the passive 1950s to Title IX and the
present, and by the time Sheryl Swoopes talks about the joy of
seeing little girls wearing her basketball jersey you will
understand the debt she owes to Suzanne Lenglen and Babe
Didrickson, to Billie Jean King and Wilma Rudolph, to Pat Summitt
and Ed Temple and Sen. Birch Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that sports is a birthright,'' says Anita DeFrantz,
a 1980 Olympic rower who is now an International Olympic Committee
vice president, in the film. For women, claiming _ even recognizing
_ that birthright has seldom been easy, as narrator Lauren Hutton
explains. After all, in the 1800s, even the increase in mobility
granted by the invention of the baby carriage was seen as a social
threat.
</P>
<P>
   In that light, the emergence in the early 1900s of Lenglen as
one of the first female athletes to become superstars can be better
grasped. In winning five straight Wimbledon titles beginning in
1919, Lenglen employed a dance-like style that looked more like
ballet than what we think of today as tennis. Such grace and style
could hardly be threatening, and perhaps helped mitigate her
prickly temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the more refreshing aspects of ``Dare to
Compete'' is its willingness to acknowledge that women who are
athletes are also human, and that men are not always villians. The
segment on Didrickson, considered by many the greatest athlete male
or female of this century, is particularly enlightening, with
priceless footage and astute narration; while a look at Rudolph's
Tennessee State women's track team of the early 1960s, the Tiger
Belles, reveals a surprising secret behind their success that still
reverberates today.

   As the film winds down with glimpses of contemporary athletes
celebrating their successes _ soccer icon Mia Hamm sliding
gleefully on her stomach across a soccer field, ice hockey gold
medalist Angela Ruggiero flinging back her head and shouting to the
heavens _ viewers can't help but wonder if ``Dare to Compete, Part
II'' will someday bring us footage of feats we can't begin to dream
of today.

   ``This documentary will be an educational resource, as well as
entertaining television,'' said Kendall Reid, senior producer of
the project. Let's hope so. It should be required viewing in every

   Larissa Kleinmann has been burning up the track at Boston
University. Only a freshman, Kleinmann recently won the 1,000
meters, 3,000 meters and mile, as well as anchoring the winning
4x800 relay, at the America East women's meet _ all within a span
of four hours. Needless to say, she was named the Outstanding
Performer, and BU won the women's title for the second time in
three years. Kleinmann, who came to the Terriers from her native
Germany, will run the 5,000 at the NCAA Indoor Championships. And
she goes in as one of the favorites: her 16:08.29 is the fastest
collegiate time in the country this year. If all goes well, she'll
also run the 3,000 on Saturday . . . Patricia I. Brown, who retired
in 1992 as a Suffolk University law librarian, recently received a
certificate from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown
for her contributions to women's baseball as a member of the
All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, in honor of the
10th anniversary of her induction into the hall. Brown was a
righthanded pitcher for the Kenosha Comets, Chicago Colleens and
Battle Creek Belles around 1950.

SMOKING LAURIE'S GONE, BUT MEMORY STILL GLOWS

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I learned how to smoke in 1981 in a desert field
across from Shadow Mountain High School, the same place I graduated
from.
</P>
<P>
   I took my first drag with my two best friends _ who were also
learning how to smoke _ and, as we felt our heads float off our
bodies while a light ringing sensation zoomed through our veins, we
decided that it was a good idea to lie down in the dirt before we
fell down. It was a magic I'd never felt before, not even with Pop
Rocks and Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later and six weeks ago, I'm pretty sure I kissed
my last butt goodbye. As a result, at night I can breathe and it
doesn't sound like wind chimes. Last week, I (begin ital) ran (end
ital) to the phone. I coughed yesterday and nothing shot out of my
mouth. Without the smoke smell, I can now wear clothes over and
over again before washing them.
</P>
<P>
   Since I felt healthier, I thought I probably looked cuter, too,
and bought myself a pair of overalls. My sense of smell has also
improved, and as a result, I can smell things _ like my husband _
more distinctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you just have a cigarette?'' I asked him as he was
climbing into bed one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 3 o'clock this afternoon,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now that I've quit smoking, my nose is just bionic,'' I
said. ``It's like getting a transplant. I'll bet in a couple of
weeks, I'll be able to locate missing children!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow. How talented of you,'' my husband responded. ``I would
think that with your $6 million nose and the pungent odor in the
kitchen sink, you'd know that the dishes urgently need washing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please take a shower before you get next to me and pollute
these fresh sheets with that dirty smell,'' I mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss Smoking Laurie,'' my husband said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy! What did (begin ital) you (end ital) have for lunch, Mr.
Turd Tongue? An ashtray sandwich? Pew-eee! You smell like you've
been rolling around on the floor of a racetrack! It's just flooding
out of your pores!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what,'' my husband began. ``I know you think you look
cute in those overalls because you've been wearing them for 16 days
now, but you really look like a Walton. Smoking Laurie would never
have worn those.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the NEW and IMPROVED Laurie,'' I stressed. ``All of my
senses are now heightened! With the nose of a wolf and the lungs of
a newborn!! I'm going to live much longer now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a treat,'' my husband replied wearily, turning out the
light.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I decided that I should reward myself with the
money I used to spend on smokes, so I put on my overalls and got a
ticket for ``200 Cigarettes,'' a new movie I heard was pretty
funny. As soon as the lights went down, the characters in the movie
started smoking and they never stopped. Taking place in 1981 _ the
same year I started smoking _ the movie doesn't have one scene when
a cigarette isn't being lit, puffed on or waved around. One smoke
gets fired up as another one is ground out.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie progressed, nearly a carton (which is 200
cigarettes) was being smoked before my eyes. I honestly began to
wonder why I had quit. My mouth watered, my stomach almost growled
with desire. My mind began to ask mean little questions. Hadn't
smoking been an integral part of me? Hadn't it been a give/give
relationship? Hadn't I gotten something back every time I lit up?
Wasn't quitting smoking like killing the jolly, hacking part of
myself, saying goodbye to a split personality that was more fun
than I was or getting a merry, cheerful demon ripped out of me by a
well-meaning priest?
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything has changed for me. Watching TV has become
just sitting on the couch, staring. Talking on the phone is a
nuisance, simply making my chin sweat now that all of the flair is
gone. When I'm around the same friends I took my first puff with in
the desert, I'm the odd man out. I'm the one who says, ``Oh, go on
ahead without me, you guys,'' as I'm looking down at the ground,
kicking at the dirt. ``I'm not allowed to in my religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in my car in the parking garage after the movie was
over, I turned the key in the ignition and realized that, like my
husband and my friends, I missed Smoking Laurie, too. Secretly, I
had been mourning her death. I had been trying to fool myself,
thinking, ``She's just on vacation with the Marlboro Team'';
``Look, there she is in the sky, exhaling a horizon full of nimbus
clouds''; or, ``She went to live on a farm in the country where she
could smoke all day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth was that Smoking Laurie was dead, and I had to
accept that. I have my pictures and I have my memories, but she
wasn't coming back. And while I understood I had gone to see that
movie to test myself, I owed something to her memory. She may have
been gone, but she wasn't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   On the way home, I pulled the car into Coco's down the street
from my house. I walked proud and I walked tall to the hostess
station, and when she saw me, she smiled and said, ``Smoking or
non-smoking?''
</P>
<P>
   ``GUESS,'' I asserted.
</P>
<P>
   She stared at me for a moment. ``Well . . .'' she started with a
wince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me step into the light,'' I said, giving her a better
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' she said suddenly. ``Follow me, please. Right this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   I smiled as she sat me in a booth with an ashtray as the crown
jewel of the table, sparkling flawlessly like a white diamond.
Somewhere up there, I knew, Smoking Laurie was looking down on me,
because I heard her laugh fondly as she took a drag and then
coughed hard enough that she saw stars.
</P>
<P>
   She'll be with me always, even if I never pick up another
cigarette as long as I live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you almost had me there,'' the hostess said, handing
me a menu. ``The overalls really threw me off. None of the Waltons
smoked, did they?'' &QL;

YOUNG COMPANIES SEEKING EXECUTIVES HAVE ROOM AT THE TOP

 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She began her working life as a junior high school teacher, ran
a health management organization, was president and chief executive
for 10 years at a big suburban hospital, and then turned
entrepreneur, opening a chain of women's health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The clinics didn't live up to financial expectations, and now
Rina K. Spence has shifted gears again, joining Consensus
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a start-up biotechnology company in Medford,
Mass., as interim chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Spence, at 50-something, has strong administrative experience,
but cheerfully admits she knows little about biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   So, two evenings a week, she heads to Harvard University's
Extension School, sitting in on classes in biomedical sciences and
molecular biology. ``I love it,'' she said. ``I'm absolutely
fascinated by the sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just a personal odyssey, Spence's transition is
emblematic of major changes occurring in how key jobs are being
filled at many of the promising young companies that get their
initial bankroll from venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a longstanding problem in hiring technical help to
translate good ideas into salable products and services, venture
capitalists are finding a shortage of executive talent with the
broad experience they believe necessary to launch new companies.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, venture capital funds that put billions of
dollars into these enterprises and oversee their growth are
abandoning hope of finding such people fast enough _ particularly
for Internet-related companies, at which stiff competition can
force a development schedule of as quickly as three months.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said Jonathan Flint of Polaris Venture Partners in
Waltham, Mass., ``a lot of people are staffing their CEO positions
with people with a lot less experience, or are restructuring the
managerial hierarchy to take this into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this trouble is of the venture funds' own making.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a buoyant economy and rapid technological change, as
well as smart picks, portfolios of companies backed by venture
capitalists have produced enviable, 30-percent annualized returns
for investors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging theirs is a high-risk game, the funds also
have touted this record to raise nearly $38 billion over the past
two years to pump into more young companies. According to the
National Venture Capital Association, 5,153 companies received
venture help in 1997 and 1998, five times as many as between 1994
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, inventors with good ideas seldom boast equal skill in
management, which is why they go to venture capital managers to get
started. These managers, along with their commitment to bankroll
the project, agree to find a chief executive _ ideally, someone who
understands the product or service, has a strong marketing
background, and, most desirably, was successful in running other
start-ups, preferably to the point of an initial public stock
offering or a sale or merger.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, with such explosive growth, the number of
people who can fill that bill hasn't kept pace. And according to
professional executive recruiters, candidates who might be induced
to jump from existing jobs into new ones are also few, because
they're generally satisfied with their present status.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people tend to be excited about where they are,'' said
Bentley H. Beaver, managing director at Onstott Group, a Wellesley
Mass., executive-search company. ``There's nothing causing them the
slightest discomfort, at least not enough to move, and the road
ahead for them is all green lights. Why should they?''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a typical chief executive search takes at least
four months, Beaver said. And where nine out of 10 searches could
be wrapped up within that time five years ago, he said, only 60
percent meet that target these days.
</P>
<P>
   Confounding the situation is the almost exponential growth of
the Internet sector. The most recent PricewaterhouseCoopers venture
capital survey found that more than 40 percent of all New England
companies getting venture funding during the fourth quarter of 1998
identified themselves as Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is a sector plainly still in diapers. The Internet's
business potential blossomed into public view less than six years
ago and its most experienced people tend to be under 30 and are
unseasoned in the ways of board rooms and banking houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most experience you are going to find in anyone (in the
Internet sector) is three years,'' said Michael Frank, a partner at
Advanced Technology Ventures of Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One compromise, Frank said, is to find someone who knows the
field to which an Internet proposal is tied _ an experienced toy
merchandiser for a Web site selling educational aids, for example _
backed up by a younger chief technology officer who, conceivably,
could be mentored in chief executive skills while in this job.
</P>
<P>
   But, Frank said, with a great sense of urgency in the
venture-capital world to push Internet-related companies to market
as quickly as possible, ``some of these people are being asked to
assume key positions perhaps sooner than they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint, at Polaris, said another frequent technique is to elevate
a top-flight marketing expert to a chief executive. The reasoning
is that in the current frenetic marketplace for Internet stocks, a
new company's prospects for success rest heavily on getting its
product to market as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But that, in turn, has brought a shortage of skilled marketing
people to fill the positions these people vacate. Flint's answer is
to break the traditional marketing job in two: one person working
on strategy and the other on execution.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology is a problem area, too, for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The field, while now 20 years old, is seen still full of promise
for eventually discovering important drugs. But it has yet to yield
many successes. Many companies have failed outright or have run out
of money as the development of these therapies has taken far more
time and money than expected. Others are still plugging away at
their original missions _ their executives of 10 years ago still on
the job, deeply committed intellectually, and in potential
stock-option profits, to finishing the job.
</P>
<P>
   Linda D. Sonntag of Axiom Venture Partners of San Francisco,
said such thin pickings in a highly specialized field means a
typical search for a biotech chief executive takes six months to a
year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sonntag who was responsible for hiring Spence, former
chief executive at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. and founder
of the ultimately unsuccessful Spence Health Centers chain of
women's medical clinics, to run Consensus Pharmaceutical.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus plans to do drug screening for other pharmaceutical
companies using a peptide-based technology discovered at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Axiom and InterWest
Partners of Menlo Park, Calif., put up $4 million in venture
capital funding last summer to back Consensus's growth. CareGroup
Inc., parent of BI-Deaconess, also has an equity stake under a
licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to get the company going, and at a location close to
BI-Deaconess, Sonntag and her counterpart at InterWest, Arnold L.
Oronsky, faced traveling to Boston almost weekly to perform chief
executive tasks themselves until a permanent choice could be made.
</P>
<P>
   But, Sonntag said, the company's business plan also held the
seeds for reconfiguring the corporate structure. Lewis Cantley, the
BI-Deaconess doctor who discovered the technology, already was
slated to become a company director. And a colleague of Cantley,
Dr. Lee Josephson, had been named chief scientific officer to
oversee product development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't necessarily need someone deep into the science'' to
be chief executive, said Sonntag. ``We needed someone good at
striking deals and negotiating contracts with big drug companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonntag said Spence, who spent much of her time at Emerson in
negotiations with insurers and other third-party providers, had
those qualities. The two had met in 1995 at a conference held
annually in Arizona by the Women's Health Alliance, a group of 20
women prominent in health care across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the alliance met again last fall, Spence had just sold her
health center chain, which, while generating $5 million in revenues
during their best year, failed to generate the amount of business
she and her investors had expected. Spence told Sonntag she was
interested in taking on something new.
</P>
<P>
   Sonntag described Consensus. The proposed structure ``would be a
very unusual alignment,'' she said, ``in that (Spence) knew nothing
about biotechnology.'' But, she added, ``It made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Consensus now has six employees in a building fitted out for
biotechnology research in Medford: Spence, an administrative
assistant, and four scientists. A part-time chief financial officer
minds the books until Consensus is big enough to need someone full
time.
</P>
<P>
   That could be soon, Spence said. She and chief scientific
officer Josephson plan to hire nine more people by May. Sonntag
said the search for a permanent chief executive is ongoing. Spence,
asked if she was a candidate, answered: ``That's a good question. I
don't know.''

 NEW YORK: ... in 1951.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Doubleday opened an office in Paris, Jones returned to the
publisher, working as an assistant. ``I was a glorified
secretary,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the English translation of ``The Dairy of Anne Frank''
came into the office and her editor handed it to her with
instructions to reject it. She didn't agree, and conveyed her
excitement about the book to win her point. ``It took a little
persuasion,'' she says. Then softly, ``It had that picture of Anne
Frank on the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones arrived at Alfred A. Knopf publishers in 1957, she says,
when ``it was just Alfred and Blanche,'' a husband-and-wife
publishing firm. ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' was sent
to Knopf in 1960 by Avis DeVoto, wife of the historian Bernard
DeVoto. She lived in Cambridge and scouted for manuscripts for
Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishing was a gentleman's profession,'' Jones says. ``It
was civilized; it wasn't crass like advertising. Knopf had an
emphasis on quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Knopf held its sales conferences at the New York Harvard Club.
Jones was the only woman editor. ``Blanche Knopf and I had to be
escorted to the ladies' room. It was really the men's room. Someone
stood guard outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Child's book went to Jones because she worked on French
translations and everyone knew she loved French food. It came from
a more senior editor, Angus Cameron. Child was acting as the agent
for her coauthors, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle. ``Angus
helped me persuade the Knopfs,'' Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   Just as she has done for all cookbook manuscripts since, Jones
began cooking from the pages of Child's book. ``It was the answer
to a prayer. A real teaching book. There was nowhere to go to learn
how to make boeuf bourguignon.'' She discovered that it was
``important to dry the meat, to saute a few pieces at a time.''
Cookbook editing opened up a new world.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston publisher Houghton Mifflin had already refused the
book, she says. Their comment was: ``Who wants to know that much
about French cooking?''
</P>
<P>
   I did, replied Jones.
</P>
<P>
   One day, while talking to former New York Times food critic
Craig Claiborne, he told her that he wanted to write about how she
and Evan roasted lamb on a spit in their penthouse apartment. ``If
you let me write a piece on you and Evan,'' said Claiborne, ``I'll
look at `Mastering' seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne wrote the glowing review that launched the book. James
Beard, at Jones's insistence, organized the book party and Dionne
Lucas hosted it at her restaurant, the Egg Basket. The entire New
York food community _ some 25 people at the time _ was in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Though Child became Jones's most celebrated author, all of her
subsequent authors wrote for the home cook and all became famous in
their field. James Beard wrote his bread book for her and Madhur
Jaffrey worked on Indian recipes. Marcella Hazan did most of her
Italian books with Jones until the relationship dissolved a few
years ago. Edna Lewis, a descendant of slaves, wrote about her
Southern heritage, Joan Nathan about Jewish cookery. Egyptian-born
Claudia Roden delved into Middle Eastern cuisine, Anna Thomas
researched vegetarian cooking. The late Irene Kuo deconstructed
Chinese cooking, as did Ken Hom.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had lunch a half-dozen times with Vogue food critic
Jeffrey Steingarten before she decided to take on his popular ``The
Man Who Ate Everything.'' When she finally did ask, he said, ``I
thought you'd never pop the question.'' He makes her laugh.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Jones lives in Manhattan during the winter and moves
to East Hardwick for the summer. She was widowed three years ago
and lives alone now, but she likes the peacefulness of Vermont and
often hosts her authors. She and Evan used to spend a month in
Vermont every summer, but that isn't enough now, so she moves her
office north. ``You feel, after so many years, you've earned a
little privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing is different these days, too. She's the only staff
member left from the days of Alfred and Blanche Knopf. Today, she
says, quality isn't everything. ``So much rides on promotion.'' A
public personality, someone cooking on television, for instance,
will sell thousands of books. ``That has been more of a factor than
whether the book makes a genuine contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's editing a book for two big personalities: ``Julia
Child and Jacques Pepin Cooking at Home'' is due to appear in the
fall as a companion to a television show of the same name. In spite
of these celebrities, Jones remains fiercely devoted to the home
cook. ``I would hope that I've done some books to encourage people
to cook _ not as drudgery but to get satisfaction, to bring
families back together.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs again when she's asked how long she will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once asked John Kenneth Galbraith, `Are you still
doing this?' Does it mean, he wondered, `Are you still alive?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they'd probably do perfectly well with someone else,''
Jones says modestly, ``but this way there's continuity.''

EDWARD ABBEY REMEMBERED

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's been 10 years since Edward Abbey departed this
life.
</P>
<P>
   Buried somewhere in Arizona's Cabeza Prieta desert are the
remains of the author and environmentalist, who died March 14,
1989.
</P>
<P>
   To know Ed Abbey was to have an opinion about the man who wrote
``Desert Solitaire'' and ``The Monkey Wrench Gang,'' about a group
plotting to blow up Glen Canyon Dam.
</P>
<P>
   People either agreed with him or dismissed his words as drivel
from an extremist's mind. We contacted a few people who knew the
man behind the words and asked them to share their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson author Chuck Bowden met Abbey while on an assignment to
interview Earth First! founder Dave Foreman, who was staying at
Abbey's home. After answering the door, Abbey rushed to find a copy
of a book Bowden had written so he could autograph it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just was quite taken,'' Bowden said. ``It's classic Abbey,
as far as knowing him as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship was based mostly on their mutual love of the
written word. Rarely did they discuss environmental politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we agreed, and it would be pretty damn boring,''
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Abbey's life and legacy is one that few writers will ever
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became a legend. I don't know how the hell you do that,''
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Community College English professor Dick Kirkpatrick
</P>
<P>
   encountered Abbey when he spoke at Scottsdale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brazenly suggested that I was selling his books to my
students and the least he could do was talk to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not a word was heard until the day he was scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly there was this large shadow in the door, and the guy
said, `Who the hell is Kirkpatrick?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Abbey came back on other occa sions to speak to students. Some
loved him, others despised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of his severest critics were students of mine. He
loved it. He enjoyed that kind of confrontation,'' Kirkpatrick
said. ``There were people who deified him at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Kirkpatrick drove cross-country with his friend to
visit Abbey's parents in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed was dying the whole time,'' he said. ``He led me to believe
that things were OK at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Sanders owns a rare-book store in Salt Lake City. He
befriended Abbey in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of got me involved with the Earth First! movement at
the time,'' Sanders said. Sanders was in on Earth First! actions
such as unfurling a plastic ``crack'' down Glen Canyon Dam.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever questioned whether Abbey approved of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always knew exactly where you stood with Ed Abbey. He was
just real straightforward with everybody,'' Sanders said. ``He had
a wonderful sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Communicating by phone with Abbey could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless it was something urgent, I never, ever called Abbey. He
would say what he had to say and hang up,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gungle took an advanced non-fiction writing class from
Abbey in the late '80s at the University of Arizona. He wrote his
thoughts via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Abbey had a reputation among UA English Department graduate
students as a terrible teacher. . . . Ed's poor reputation was not
because he didn't care. Rather, it was that this man whose literary
reputation was larger than life was unsure of himself in the
classroom. If he thought an essay was pretty good but a few class
members were critical, he'd scratch out the original grade right
there in front of us and replace it with something lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the funny thing is that Abbey had this reputation
as a crusty, cantankerous son of a bitch, when as a teacher he was
one of the nicest damn guys I've ever met. He didn't have the ego,
the big-fish-in-a-small-pond mentality that you get all too often
on campuses across the country. The year after I had him in class,
I saw him on campus a couple of times, and each time he'd go out of
his way to come over and find out how I was doing. There's a whole
Edward Abbey mythology, replete with his legendary exploits and
larger-than-life persona. But at its center was just a pretty
regular guy with a sharp pen.'' &QL;

FOLLOWING THEIR OWN BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After bagging groceries at a Boston supermarket for two years,
Rajib Momen's career goals became crystal clear: He wanted freedom
and flexibility first, then financial secu rity.
</P>
<P>
   So Momen quit his minimum wage job and launched a computer
service and Internet firm from his parents' home, charging clients
$50 per hour to upgrade and repair their computers or help them
access the Net.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Momen expects his flegling company, The World's
Greatest Bulletin Board Service, to gross $50,000 _ not bad for a
17-year-old Boston Latin School senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be my own boss, and make my own hours,''
Momen said. ``This is a lot more profitable, and much more fun than
working a regular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rajib Momen might be young, but he's not too young to earn a
place among a new generation of entrepreneurial upstarts whose
members are more likely to point to a business plan than a resume
when discussing career goals.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by such role models as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and
Dell Computer founder Michael Dell, many are savvy beneficiaries of
the high-tech revolution who are using their technical skills to
create Web-based products or computer services that cater to an
expanding market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation really doesn't want to do the whole corporate
America thing,'' said Martha Winberg, a spokeswoman for the
National Federation of Independent Business in Washington, D.C.,
which represents 600,000 small business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have seen the layoffs; they've seen what has happened to
their parents, and they have decided, `This is not the lifestyle I
want,' '' Winberg continued. ``They would rather make no money and
be their own boss, than make money and have people telling them to
go and do gerbil work.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are no statistics documenting this trend, the Young
Entrepreneurs Organization in Alexandria, Va., says its membership
has grown to 2,300 since its inception nearly a dozen years ago.
The average member? A 33-year-old chief executive of a company with
$7 million in annual revenues. The youngest member is 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a greater sense of individualism among young people
today, and this means people under 35, including teens,'' commented
Gerald Hills, the Coleman chair of entrepreneurship at the
University of Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While Hills doesn't know how many young people are becoming
their own bosses, he points to the growth of his own program as an
indication that times have changed. Unlike their parents, he said,
young people are more apt to see work at a company as a stepping
stone to business ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1982, the year I came to the University of Illinois, we had
25 student in the program. Today? We have at least 350, and we're
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hills has developed a national collegiate entrepreneurs
organization, widely known as CEO, that expects to have 20,000
members in 400 campuses by 2003. The organization's first
conference last fall attracted 400 students.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old David Koretz of Rochester, N.Y., acquired his
entrepreneurial know-how early _ from his grandfather, who
manufactured socks, and his parents, both entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Koretz, who is now on leave from Babson College in Wellesley,
Mass., began selling seashells when he was 7. At 14, he started
Compucepts, a computer repair company that became the nucleus for
an electronics distribution company with international clients.
</P>
<P>
   Koretz's latest venture, Network Marketing International LLC,
uses the Internet to collect sales and marketing information for
corporate clients. The fee? $25,000 to $50,000 per year for major
searches, and about $200 for smaller ones. ``Even the smallest
business can buy information through the Net now,'' noted Koretz.
``So, we've opened up an aspect of marketing to a lot of people who
had no access before.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which received an undisclosed amount of venture
capital from Thomas Golisano, founder of Rochester-based Paychex
Inc., the corporate payroll management firm, expects to handle $15
million in sales by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts attribute the push to incorporate to several factors,
ranging from corporate downsizing to an array of high school and
college entrepreneurial programs that have encouraged students to
weigh the pros and cons of business ownership.
</P>
<P>
   One such program is the National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship (NFTE) in New York City, which helps high school
youth turn their talents into profits. Among NFTE's graduates:
Rajib Momen, who attended a summer NFTE training camp at Babson
College when he was 14.
</P>
<P>
   NFTE graduate Malik Armstead, 27, is a New York financial
analyst turned soul food restaurant owner. Armstead was 24 when he
quit his job and used $20,000 in savings to launch a Brooklyn soul
food takeout eatery called The Five Spot in a brownstone he had
leased. He expects the eatery to net close to $300,000 this year.
Armstead recently purchased the building that houses his restaurant
and two adjacent buildings, and says he plans to add a bar, a full
sitdown restaurant, and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that a bank would consider his company a high risk,
Armstead initiated a direct transaction with his landlord for three
brownstones valued at $500,000, including the building that houses
his takeout restaurant. ``Essentially, with the direct transaction,
I went to my landlord and worked out the terms of a mortgage, which
is 20 years at 9 percent interest,'' he said. ``I gave him a
$100,000 downpayment for the brownstones and he wrote up a mortgage
note for the remaining balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Armstead started his business career early (he bought
snacks with his allowance and resold them at higher prices in
elementary school), he credits a summer at an NFTE business camp in
Pennsylvania with giving him business know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always been good in math and science and was considering
a career in those fields, but that summer opened my eyes to
business,'' he said. ``I finished my senior year in high school,
and then went to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study finance.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Armstead, Momen credits the NFTE training camp with helping
to increase his business acumen. ``NFTE showed me the ropes,'' said
Momen, whose mother has a jewelry business. ``NFTE showed me the
legality involved in running a business. It taught me how to
register my business, and the teachers in the program encouraged
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Momen began thinking about starting his own computer repair
company when he was 12, but ``it was never like this. It was just
this idea about helping people with computers.''

 BOSTON: ... one break.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is achieving breakthroughs. At one point,
an emigrant from India gets up and tries to talk about how people
discriminate against him because of his skin color and accent.
Handel lights into him. ``You haven't owned up to your racket,
which is that people discriminate against you,'' she says. ``You're
not taking responsibility for it. You keep pointing your finger at
others. You need to own up to your racket.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, a health professional who asked not to be identified,
persists, saying that a lot of his problems with people at work and
elsewhere had to do with racism. ``You are one of the most
uncoachable people in the Forum,'' Handel replies calmly. ``It's
been two full days and you haven't looked at yourself yet. All you
see is people stepping on you.''
</P>
<P>
   After a short break (during which the man finds himself
surrounded by sympathetic participants telling him to hang in
there), Handel unloads what some would later say is the biggest
bombshell of the weekend: ``Consider that life is empty and
meaningless,'' she says. ``There is no meaning; life just is.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, people's faces crumple with bewilderment. Paula
Houghton, the gift-shop owner from Maine, is one of the first to
get the point. ``If life is empty and meaningless, you can create
anything you want,'' she says triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Reilly follows her to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so powerful,'' Reilly says. ``I don't need to be a
victim anymore. This is better than church; it's almost better than
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Ray Barrieau, the general contractor from
Rockland, raises his leonine head. Barrieau has been slumped in the
back row of the room, eyes half-closed, shoulders bowed. But on the
afternoon of the third day, he strides to the mike.
</P>
<P>
   In a choking voice, Barrieau reads a letter he had written to
his son, who died 18 months ago in a car accident at age 16.
Barrieau says he now realizes that even though his son is dead, he
can still have a relationship with him. ``You were an extraordinary
person, and I miss you terribly,'' Barrieau reads to an audience as
silent as stone. ``But what I realize now is that although my
relationship with you is different, I can continue to give you 100
percent of my love.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finishes, Handel asks, ``Is there anything else you need
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive myself?'' Barrieau replies softly. ``I think I just
did.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the Forum, Tuesday evening, Barrieau walks
into the room smiling. His back is straight, his blue eyes wide and
peaceful. Other participants also pour in with big smiles on their
faces, hugging people they met only five days before and talking
about the changes in their behavior in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be sad, but I won't be as empty,'' Barrieau
says. ``I can actually see progress now. I had no idea I was so
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached a month later, Barrieau and other participants say their
lives and attitudes remain altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my line of work, I deal with people who don't always have a
handle on reality, and I notice that I deal with it differently
now,'' says Barrieau, who is working on restoring a huge farmhouse
in Massachusetts. ``For instance, if something goes wrong, one crew
is always ready to point the finger at another crew, and in the
past I might have gotten involved in that. Now I just say, jeez,
this is their racket, and I'm not going there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Barrieau or others don't have lapses; it's an
imperfect world out there. Marisa Reilly, who shares custody of her
daughter with her ex-husband, says she still finds herself drawn
into arguments with him over past ``insults.'' But instead of
getting angry and marching off in resentment as she used to, Reilly
says that she was able to defuse their latest squabble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a deep breath, went outside, came back in, and made a
request. I said, `You don't have to respect or like me, but I just
want you to respect me as Gwendolyn's mother,' '' she recalls.
``And that was the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly adds, ``Experiences like that weekend could be like a
bubble _ you get it for the moment and then poof it's gone. But
this has had a lasting effect on me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FORUM THRIVES UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Werner Erhard, the iconoclastic founder of
est and the Forum, vanished from public view after some withering
media coverage, the Forum has thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Landmark Education Co., which runs the Forum and other
self-help programs, last year achieved gross revenues of an
estimated $54 million, most of which was plowed back into the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, about 68,000 people attended Forum seminars in 96
locations in 1998. That does not include the workshops that
Landmark has provided to employees of the 75 US companies it has
worked with since 1991, Forum officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Before he disappeared in 1991, Erhard had successfully defended
himself against the toughest of the media reports: His daughter
recanted allegations of incest, and the Internal Revenue Service
acknowledged that reports of tax fraud were false; Erhard won
$200,000 in that case.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its success, financial and otherwise, the Forum has
been dogged by claims that it comes close to being a cult. And the
primary root of such allegations is the large number of people who
work for Landmark unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark has only 400 paid employees. But it has 7,500 unpaid
volunteers, graduates of Landmark seminars, who help market the
program and staff each workshop, assisting the Forum leader at
every step of the way (even to the point of opening and closing
doors for people who have to go to the bathroom so that no one is
distracted by noise).
</P>
<P>
   Social scientists familiar with the Forum agree that the program
itself is not a cult. But whether the training gets people so
hooked on the experience as to make them dependent on the Landmark
company and thus engage in cultlike behavior is an open question
for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``If volunteers who put in all this time are getting a valuable
sense of their own experience, that's OK,'' says Tom Greening, a
clinical professor of psychology at the University of California at
Los Angeles. ``But if they are being used because of their
dependence, that's another thing. The question is how free are they
every day to choose to be volunteers or to leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers say they are free to leave whenever they choose. They
say they like to staff Forum workshops to help others and because
of the good that they continue to get out of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Goodman, a lawyer who works as general counsel for a large
company in Philadelphia, was one of perhaps 20 volunteers at a
recent Forum workshop. He flew to Boston to act as media liaison,
and except for his expenses (airfare and hotel), he says he wasn't
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this about four times a year, and I do it because I'm
someone who wants to make a difference in life,'' says Goodman, a
quiet, unassuming man who's 42. ``When you see the results people
get from the Forum, it makes you want to assist others achieve the
same thing.''

A LOOK AT LIEBERMAN; THE NOT-MUCH-WEAKER SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here in the Hub of the Universe, it's easy to see all the petty
little fractures that define New England life, but from afar, we
all start to look alike. A case in point is in the new George,
which refers to US Senator Joseph Lieberman as a ``Yankee
moralizer,'' even while focusing on his practice of Orthodox
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Cottle's profile of the Connecticut Democrat is not
unlike George's take two months ago on Arizonan John McCain: Highly
principled, admired on both sides of the aisle, touted as timber
for national office. In Lieberman's case, though, the office in
question is the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He cemented his claim to ethical purity during the Year of
Monica when he became the first Democrat in the Senate to denounce
President Clinton's morals. But particularly on campaign rectitude,
a McCain cornerstone, Lieberman seems vulnerable to charges of
hypocrisy. He first won public office by using attack ads in a
bruising primary, and although they're good friends now, it took
his opponent years to get over the sting. And, Lieberman reached
the US Senate by portraying the somewhat pompous Lowell Weicker as
a hibernating cartoon bear in a campaign that drew national
attention for its viciousness. Weicker had pledged not to go dirty,
and by the time he finally responded, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman purports to see no contradiction. ``My ads were tough,
but they were factually based,'' Cottle quotes him as saying. ``We
didn't go over the line. It's all slash-and-burn now.'' Factually
based? Does that mean Lowell Weicker really is a bear?
</P>
<P>
   As for his potential for national office, Cottle says a primary
question is ``the Jewish thing,'' but suggests that his ``religious
credentials would prove an enormous plus.'' To bolster her point,
she turns to Norman Ornstein, whom she describes by philosophy
(libertarian) but chooses not to describe by religion (Jewish).
Does anyone else think there might be a better source for
predicting how a Jewish candidate would fare with conservative
Christian voters than a Jewish analyst?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious division of the species is between men and
women, although that distinction is knocked down a few pegs this
week in Time's cover story, written by Barbara Ehrenreich. It turns
out, according to new research, that women are just as tough, just
as strong, and just as horny as men are.
</P>
<P>
   Time says this isn't just research, it is dogma. It says the
term ``feminist'' has long been dismissed as too dainty, and offers
up ``femaleist'' in its place, summarized as ``Yes, we are
different _ wanna make something of it?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the findings in Time's report:
</P>
<P>
   --PMS isn't just another way to say ``cranky woman.'' Pulitzer
Prize-winner Natalie Angier, in her vanguard treatise ``Women: An
Intimate Geography,'' suggests that many women experience it as a
state of ``heightened activity, intellectual clarity, (and)
feelings of well-being.'' Menopause is being recast: ``Hot
flashes'' are now ``power surges.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Biology is a sexist `ideology,' not a science, and Darwin
(is) just another dead white male with an ax to grind.''
</P>
<P>
   --Men are bigger, but they're not necessarily meaner. Laboratory
data show women can proudly claim they are just as willing to
deliver an electric shock as men are. And archaeologists have found
evidence of women warriors 2,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   --``If women are the innately more monogamous sex, why the
widespread and fanatic efforts to get them to keep their legs
crossed? In fact, there may have been an evolutionary advantage to
sluttiness.''
</P>
<P>
   To one of the inhabitants of Mars, these points seem
well-founded, and certainly, the truth will set us free. But it's
still hard to understand _ completely anyway _ why it's a victory
to finally establish that women are just as vicious and sleazy as
men are.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't all have to be about comparison and competition, of
course. Buried on page 100 of the March issue of Health is a
wrenching tale of loving sorority told by Dorothy Foltz-Gray, who
was born a twin but has been left alone by the horrid slaying of
her sister by a deranged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Foltz-Gray captures their closeness with this anecdote: The
sister, Deane, once arrived late at Logan Airport to pick up
Foltz-Gray for a visit, and greeted her by saying, ``Oh damn. I
didn't want to miss a single minute.'' Foltz-Gray effectively,
affectingly, tells of the ``line down the center of my life'' that
the slaying drew, and of how she has persevered.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't expect such depth amid all the advice about herbal
massage, staying thin, and looking and feeling fantastic, but there
it is.

JUDITH JONES: COOK OF THE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judith Jones's office on the 21st floor of Alfred A.
Knopf publishers is piled with manuscripts and books, which spill
onto a couch, a coffee table, and against a window overlooking the
East River. A computer sits beside the desk, but Jones hardly uses
it except for e-mail. She edits her manuscripts the old-fashioned
way: by hand, line by line, with notes in the margin. Her writers
will tell you she reads every word.
</P>
<P>
   They're not just anyone's words. The pages that have been under
her scrutiny belong to such French philosophers as Jean-Paul Sartre
and Albert Camus, whose translations Jones edited early in her
career. There are novels by Anne Tyler and John Updike, a
collection by New Yorker writer Philip Hamburger, and a host of
cookbooks from the likes of Marion Cunningham, James Beard, M. F.
K. Fisher, Madhur Jaffrey, Edna Lewis, Claudia Roden, Jacques
Pepin, Marcella Hazan (until recently, ``when we happily parted
ways''), and Julia Child. From the volumes, you can pretty much
figure out how American culinary culture, and other aspects of
ordinary life, changed in the last four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Child was Jones's first cookbook author, an unseasoned writer in
the hands of a young, enthusiastic editor. It wasn't entirely an
accident that the cumbersome manuscript of ``Mastering the Art of
French Cooking'' landed on Jones's desk 40 years ago _ she was
known as an unabashed Francophile. And having landed there, it's no
mystery that Child's first book changed the course of cooking in
America. ``I knew it was a gem,'' says Jones, who took the
manuscript into her kitchen and then pushed hard to see it
published.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who celebrates her 75th birthday next week, calls Child
``the best writer around. She has good, visceral language.'' As
Jones says, ``Julia doesn't say `place' '' but uses words like
``plop,'' which the editor prefers. Child describes Jones as ``very
thorough, lovely to work with, always supportive, but never
domineering.''
</P>
<P>
   Other authors say she can hone anything, pull out the voice,
make the reader feel as though there's company on those pages. They
say that she's gifted with language, that working with her is a
privilege, that she never insinuates herself into someone else's
manuscript, but she's a tough editor, relentless about details,
with deep sensibilities for the reader. Sometimes her authors admit
they don't ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good editors, Jones stays in the background, modest to
a fault. ``Whenever I meet someone who knows Judith,'' one of her
authors says, ``they tell me another story about her, things she
will never ever tell you about herself.'' One day, talking to an
author, Jones mentioned Sylvia Plath, the troubled young poet who
took her own life. Jones had edited Plath's first book of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Salem cookbook author Nina Simonds has only superlatives to
describe Jones after they traveled together to Asia last year for
research on ``A Spoonful of Ginger,'' due out in April. Simonds,
who was working with Jones for the first time, says: ``She is
intimidating at first and very formal. But then her genuineness and
her kindness come through. She's so open to everything, and the
fact that we survived traveling together through six countries is a
supreme testament to her warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Cunningham agrees. When she first met Jones in 1974 to
work on the revision of ``The Fannie Farmer Cookbook,'' Cunningham
worried that ``I wasn't going to measure up.'' Cunningham flew from
her home in Walnut Creek, Calif., before Easter weekend to stay
with her editor and to go over the galleys. Jones invited
Cunningham to go to church with her on Easter Sunday. As Cunningham
recalls: ``She said she belonged to the Episcopalian Church. It was
a beautiful place, she said. She was the deacon. Did I want to take
communion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can,'' Cunningham told Jones. ``I was raised
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Yes, you can,' she said.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham disagreed. But she didn't say anything.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to church, she took communion. ``I finally decided
that I was more afraid of Judith than of God,'' says Cunningham.
``Much, much later I told her about it. She laughed. She has a very
good sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Judith Jones sits primly, bolt upright, and has perfect, old
school manners. She is a practical woman. She wears a well-made
suit and black pumps that still have some life in them. Her
cultured voice sounds vaguely British.
</P>
<P>
   She's a Yankee, not on both sides but on the side she prefers.
She was born to an English mother and a father who came from
Vermont. They lived what she describes as ``a typical middle class
life'' in Manhattan. The young Judith Bailey attended Brearley
School, which was private and academically rigorous. At home, a
maid did all the cooking (her mother wasn't interested). They spent
summers with her father's family in East Hardwick, Vt., near the
Canadian border. Jones adds: ``I remember stamping my feet as a
child, saying, `I'm a Vermonter.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Brearley, she went to Bennington College in Bennington,
Vt. (class of 1945), a school so progressive that her choice
surprised her high school classmates. ``Brearley was very academic
and Bennington had a reputation for being experimental,'' Jones
says.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham taught at Bennington, as did
the poet Theodore Roethke and the critic Kenneth Burke. ``I was
there during the war. We had a victory garden and we had to do the
work. One professor felt we should get our feet dirty. We were free
spirits. The teaching was so good.''
</P>
<P>
   When she graduated, she returned to New York to work for
Doubleday. For her vacation she went to Paris, and ``I could not
bear to leave.'' She asked for a month's extension, which stretched
into 3 1/2 years. There, she met Evan Jones, who was editor and
publisher of the picture magazine Weekend. Together they learned
about cooking and it became a lifelong passion. They went to the
markets and listened to the butcher's instructions for coq au vin.
They married in 1951.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They have come from all over New England, from as far
away as Vermont's Canadian border to nearby South Boston. But these
130 souls huddling on chairs in a windowless conference room don't
look particularly lost. They are physicians, engineers, software
consultants, house painters, store owners, lawyers, students,
single mothers, and an Episcopal priest, and they belong to a group
sociologists might call ``the worried well.''
</P>
<P>
   They have come to the Forum because they sense something is
amiss in their lives, and they've heard that the program's
three-and-a-half days of intense self-examination might help them
smooth out the cracks in their relationships with families, friends
and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Paula Houghton, 50, who runs a gift shop on
the coast of Maine and says she ``hasn't touched'' her husband in
years, even though they run the business together.
</P>
<P>
   Or Marisa Reilly, 39, who owns a body spa and is struggling to
raise a 4-year-old daughter amid the turmoil of a difficult
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Or Ray Barrieau, 42, a general contractor who lost the will to
love when his teenage son died in a car accident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this mostly white and middle-class group had heard about
the Forum from someone in their lives who had already taken the
program. (In Houghton's case, it was her daughter; in Barrieau's,
his girlfriend.)
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few had also heard about the controversial roots of
the Forum, which reached about 68,000 people worldwide in 1998.
Indeed, the very first question asked by a plaid-shirted woman in
the audience is: ``Is this a cult?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not a cult,'' replies the Forum leader, a
39-year-old former New Yorker named Beth Handel, who addresses the
concern head-on. Handel says upfront that the Forum is the
reincarnation of est, the self-help movement started in 1971 by a
former car salesman from Philadelphia who left his family and
changed his name from John Paul Rosenberg to Werner Erhard. In
1985, Handel says, Erhard ``retired'' est and retooled it as the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the United States for parts unknown, he sold the
``technology'' of the Forum in 1991 to his employees, who formed a
new company known as the Landmark Education Co. in San Francisco,
with Erhard's younger brother, Harry Rosenberg, as its president.
</P>
<P>
   What Handel leaves out is that est was widely criticized in its
heyday for fostering an authoritarian atmosphere, with reports of
est leaders humiliating participants and refusing to let them go to
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum, one participant later jokes, seems to be a kinder,
gentler est. Anyone can leave at any time, and if people leave
before midafternoon on the first day of the workshop (which takes
place over three 14-hour days and one evening), they get their $325
entrance fee back.
</P>
<P>
   Two people actually take advantage of that offer. The rest stay
planted in their chairs, waiting impatiently for the
``transformation'' that Handel says she has ``produced . . . in
thousands of thousands of people's lives.'' (Among the attendees is
a Globe reporter whom Forum officials and participants know is
there).
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until late in the afternoon, after seemingly endless
plugs for other Landmark courses and a rambling lecture on
linguistics, that Handel gets down to the guts of the session. She
says that all human beings listen through a prism of judgment,
deciding whether what they hear is right or wrong, to be agreed
with or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way of listening will never disappear, but I notice it
now when I do it,'' says Handel, a pixieish, dark-haired woman
whose hands and face are in constant motion.
</P>
<P>
   Another fundamental aspect of human nature, she adds, is that we
all want to look good in front of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do is to look good,'' she says, with the
comedic timing of Joan Rivers. ``That's what it will say on your
tombstone: looked real good.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience laughs, but a woman in the back row, with coifed
gray hair, looks thunderstruck. A few minutes later, she makes her
way to one of the three microphones set up around the room. (At
regular intervals during the 43-hour-long ride on
self-transformation lane, Handel encourages people to come up and
share their thoughts, revelations, and questions with her and the
group.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 26-year-old son who is a drug addict and an
alcoholic,'' the gray-haired woman says haltingly. ``And we have no
relationship, because I'm too busy looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   At each break, participants are encouraged to find someone they
don't know and share something they have just learned about
themselves. And late that evening, before Handel dismisses the
weary group for the day, she gives everyone a homework assignment:
Go and write a letter to someone in your life whom you have ``run a
racket on.'' A racket, she already explained, is a mind-set that
compels people to respond negatively to others. After you write the
letter, she says, call the person and ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, calling the ghosts in one's life _ people you
have unfinished business with, whether a present or former spouse,
a parent, sibling, or child _ is a key ingredient in the Forum's
dynamic. By the next day, the phones in the Forum office are jammed
with participants dialing loved ones and asking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Judie, a flight attendant in her 50s, did her homework the first
night. She called her ex-husband to apologize for blaming him for
everything that had gone wrong in their marriage. ``Our divorce was
so bitter that my kids got caught in the crossfire,'' Judie tells
the group the next day, tears on her cheeks. ``What I've realized
is that I had a part in it. My biggest racket was being a victim,
and what I lost was not just my marriage, my house and my husband,
but I lost my girls.''
</P>
<P>
   When she called Friday night, Judie says, her ex wasn't home,
and the person who answered the phone was her youngest daughter,
who is 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew then that she was the person I needed to talk to. I
told her that I knew the divorce had caused her a lot of pain and
that I avoided responsibility by acting like it was all dad's
fault. And I asked for her forgiveness.'' Judie pauses and the
silence is deafening. ``My daughter said, `I've waited two years to
hear this. I forgive you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A sigh like a balloon releasing air can be heard around the
room.
</P>
<P>
   By evening of the second day, many participants are sharing
tissues and crying openly as the painful, most intimate details of
people's live crash up against them like waves, each more powerful
than the next. And the stories, the awakenings, the tears, flow all
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen such good theater in a long time,'' marvels
Linda Kellay, 40, during one break.

ROSE WINES ARE MAKING A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's a proliferation of pink.
</P>
<P>
   In wine stores, in wine journals and even at the recent Albany
American Wine Festival, rose wines are getting more attention than
they have seen since you drank Mateus. And even if the public's
interest in roses has grown only slightly in recent years,
winemakers are betting on pink making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because even though the growth of rose sales has
been slow, 13 percent between 1991 and 1997, white wine sales only
grew 12 percent during the same time. By contrast, sales of red
wines jumped 151 percent during that six-year period, according the
Wine Institute, an industry council.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry specialists contribute the enormous jump in red
wine consumption to the revelation that moderate drinking of red
wines can be beneficial to your health. By combining the healthful
attributes of a red wine varietal with the style of a white
zinfandel, wineries may be launching the next big trend in
California wine.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Home, which pioneered the popular white zinfandel in the
1970s, has introduced a merlot rose, a dark pink wine the company
touts as having ``merlot taste ... white zinfandel refreshment.''
</P>
<P>
   White zinfandel, a sugary pink which remains the second largest
selling varietal in America, according to the Wine Institute, lost
favor with wine drinkers who thought they had more sophisticated
palates. The varietal, which is still made in mass quantities by
nearly all larger California wineries, became unfashionable when it
was snubbed by ``serious'' wine drinkers who called it ``candy'' or
``soda pop wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, other pink wines, most not nearly as sweet and
some actually dry, became unfashionable, too, and people shied away
from them as well.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed people would blush if they were seen drinking blush.
And though some white zinfandel drinkers graduated to more accepted
varietals such as chardonnay and merlot, others left wine
completely and went to the graduate school of chocolate martinis.
</P>
<P>
   But most white zin drinkers stuck with it (accounting for its
remaining popularity).
</P>
<P>
   ``They drink light wines because they like them,'' Stan Hock,
spokesman for Sutter Home, says in the September issue of Wine
Business Monthly. Like white wines, roses vary in dryness but none
of them are so dry that they will rip the enamel off your teeth.
And, generally, roses are not aged in oak, so they lack the tannins
associated with red wines and the characteristics of the fruit are
predominant.
</P>
<P>
   Though still on the sweet side (or ``semi-dry'' as wineries call
it) Sutter Home's Merlot Rose is not nearly as syrupy as its
zinfandel predecessor. Neither are other California pinks created
from varietals more commonly known for red wines such as Simi
Vineyard's Rose of Cabernet Sauvignon (1997) and Etude's Pinot Noir
Rose (1997). These wines are relatively fruity and go particularly
well with Mediterranean food and the spicy flavors of Cajun or
Caribbean cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Other roses, most notably the Tavels from France's Southern
Rhone region, such as Domaines Ott (1995) Cotes de Provence, are
drier and more herbal on the palate. These pair well with salmon,
chicken or other light meats.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Wine Collector's Handbook,'' by Linda Johnson
(Lyons Press, 1997), most simple roses are best served chilled,
between 43 and 46 degrees. Place the bottle in a bucket of ice
water for about 20 minutes prior to serving. Refrigeration, which
should be set below 40 degrees for food safety reasons, is too cold
for storing wine. And remember, you shouldn't be embarrassed to
drink pink.

PINK WITH ENVY

   (With PINK-WINES)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some wine terms, followed by selected wins:
</P>
<P>
   Rose (roh-ZAY, French for pink) refers to wines of a pink or
rose-colored hue. Rose wines are usually made from red grapes, but
the skins are removed early in the winemaking process to prevent
them from turning the wine deep red. In France, the only rose wines
that may be made by blending white-grape wines with red-grape wines
are rose champagnes.
</P>
<P>
   Blush _ The American generic name for rose wines. Usually made
in the classic French style by removing the skins of red grapes
early in the winemaking process but, in the United States, may also
be made by combining white wines with red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado _ Spanish for rose.
</P>
<P>
   Rosato _ Italian for rose.
</P>
<P>
   Tavel (ta-VEHL) _ A region in France's southern Rhone region
where what some consider the best rose wines are made. Tavel wines
are generally dry and made primarily from grenache grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Dry _ A wine that lacks sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Semi-dry _ A sweet but not sugary wine.

 `ALLY McBEAL' CHARACTER STRIKES IT RICH WITH ASIAN-AMERICANS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Wow, cool, an Asian girl with attitude!''
</P>
<P>
   That was Fam Saechao's initial assessment of Ling, the newest
and nastiest character on the hit prime-time television show ``Ally
McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now she's become really ugly,'' said Saechao, 17, a high
school senior in San Francisco. ``She's a total bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other coast, New York University sophomore Jin Moon, 20,
begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ling blows you away _ she doesn't take anything from
anybody,'' Moon said. ``She stands up to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans and others are abuzz about Ling Woo and the
scene-stealing Chinese-American actress, Lucy Liu, who plays her on
the Fox television show.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the cast in September, Liu's glowering portrayal
of Ling has drawn raves from fans who relish her shockingly loutish
one-liners and, more recently, on-screen sexual dabblings with her
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled at the way that character has taken off,''
said Fox Broadcasting Co. spokesman Jonathan Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Ling blends right into the multitude of quirky characters who
populate creator David E. Kelley's tapestry of subversive gender
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian-Americans _ who see all too few nonstereotypical
images of Asian-Americans in popular media _ face a conflict over
Liu's character, even as they appreciate the context of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Some see the in-your-face Ling vanquishing stereotypes of Asian
women as meek and submissive.
</P>
<P>
   Others view her as perpetuating equally harmful stereotypes of
Asian woman as exotic Dragon Ladies, especially with her recent
on-screen sexual forays.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, she's a stereotype breaker,'' said Jeff Yang,
founding publisher of A. Magazine, a New York-based publication on
Asian-American culture. ``She's a strong Asian woman who's clearly
potent, clearly has control. She's not a victim, not somebody who
lets anyone come even close to victimizing her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three episodes, Ling, a lawyer, snapped at a judge
to ``Hurry up!'' as he read the verdict, encouraged a little boy
with cancer to sue God and blamed handicapped people for taking up
``all the parking spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   When displeased, which is often, she narrows her eyes, and a
growl is heard on the sound track. Or she appears and the ``Wizard
of Oz'' tune ``Wicked Witch of the West'' plays.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes her fans yearn for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so happy to finally see a Chinese chick on TV!'' said
one electronic mail message on the Ally McBeal message board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time!'' noted another. ``And she is beautiful!''
</P>
<P>
   But Asian-Americans also have an ``equal and opposite reaction''
to Ling, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (also) veers very close to another stereotype of the
Asian-American as a bitch queen with a forked tongue and flashing
eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a villain can't be attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my students are Asian, and they like her
wholeheartedly,'' said Darrell Hamamoto, a professor of
Asian-American studies at the University of California at Davis and
visiting lecturer at New York University. ``They like her because
she's so assertive.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeal is universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from talking to people who aren't Asian-American that
they enjoy that character because she's unapologetically
abrasive,'' said Peter X. Feng, assistant professor of English and
women's studies at the University of Delaware. ``People find it
fun. They wish they could be like that. That's the appeal of the
character, regardless of race.''

FIRST IMPRESSIONS CAN MAKE OR BREAK BUSINESSES, EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even when he was busy writing bestselling
motivational books and making speeches around the country, Harvey
Mackay made sure he hired two key people at his Mackay Envelope
Corp. in Minneapolis: the company president and the telephone
receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   It makes a lot of sense. One job is first in the employee
organizational chart, the other is first in making an impression on
customers _ and potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get a second chance to make a first impression,''
the dandruff shampoo commercial says. That's basic advice, but it
gets ignored by companies and workers _ and we aren't just talking
about a few flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some first impressions that often get overlooked:
</P>
<P>
   _ Check, please.
</P>
<P>
   I went to a new restaurant a while back. Prices were reasonable
and the food was excellent, better than a lot of places the
restaurant critics rave about.
</P>
<P>
   The place went out of business in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Am I surprised? No. The kitchen was painfully slow and our
waitress had all the charisma of a mutual fund prospectus. They
left a bad aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant failed for the same reason a lot of restaurants
fail: It flunked the first-impression test. People who open
restaurants usually do it because they love food and cooking, but
they need either managerial expertise or tremendous luck to make it
work.
</P>
<P>
   If the restaurant had done a better job with employees _ like
guaranteeing that waiters would make good money, even if business
was slow, and having a bigger kitchen staff than necessary at first
_ it would have lost a lot more money at the start, but would have
done much better at making that crucial first impression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trying new things.
</P>
<P>
   When established companies merge or launch products, they're
making a first impression all over again. When you walk into your
branch of Friendly Neighborhood Bank and find it's been taken over
by Money-Sucking Conglomerate, you're likely to be more sensitive
about things like customer service until the merged bank proves
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the workplace, the same sorts of things can happen when
workers get promoted or companies improve technology.
</P>
<P>
   If you get promoted, treat it like you're with a new company.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone took for granted that you could do your old job, but
now bosses and colleagues will be watching more closely to make
sure you're not in over your head.
</P>
<P>
   When companies improve technology, a typical worker's first fear
might be that it's going to wipe out jobs. So if it won't, say so
right away.
</P>
<P>
   The other mistake companies make with technology is not having
enough technical support people available when a product gets
added. If something new causes a couple of hours of frustration,
workers can roll with that. But if it causes a couple of weeks of
frustration with no obvious benefits, you've got a serious threat
to morale.
</P>
<P>
   _ When things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There's a great Danish proverb: ``Life is not holding a good
hand; life is playing a poor hand well.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good your company is or how good you are at your
job, mistakes happen. It's how you handle them that makes the
difference between success and failure.
</P>
<P>
   Look at how smart companies handle mistakes. If a product is
screwed up, they do voluntary recalls. If somebody with a dinner
reservation has to wait 20 minutes, they give them a glass of wine
or free dessert. When people need customer service, they talk with
somebody who can help them, not a person with a single-digit IQ who
has to ask a supervisor for everything.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an employee and you make a mistake, a lot of times the
hardest thing to say is, ``I screwed up.'' But if you did screw up,
say so _ then do whatever you can to make it right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starting a job.
</P>
<P>
   People often overlook the details when they start a job. Don't
make your boss or co-workers have to tell you twice how to do
something; if you can't memorize it, take notes. And quickly make
your boss realize that if you're assigned to do a task, it will get
done _ and done right.

THE PITFALLS OF BEING AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even if you build a better mousetrap, your
business still might fail and your employees still might be
miserable if you have a mousy chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of horror stories about overbearing bosses
and indecisive managers, but management consultant Patrick Lencioni
said the problems at the top have more in common than you might
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to oversimplify and say there's one thing a good CEO
needs, it's self-esteem,'' said Lencioni, president of The Table
Group in Emeryville, Calif., and author of ``The Five Temptations
of a CEO,'' a fable he uses to illustrate the main weaknesses
leaders have to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Lencioni said the five temptations are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Choosing invulnerability over trust.
</P>
<P>
   Managers with poor self-esteem are reluctant to let employees
challenge their ideas, Lencioni said. People in this category often
are overly concerned with having a powerful image rather than
letting workers understand their thoughts, weaknesses and emotions.
They are afraid of appearing vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers don't usually take advantage of that,'' Lencioni said.
``There's power in being open.''
</P>
<P>
   These managers also are liable to hire inferior workers because
they don't want to bring in anyone who might eventually pose a
challenge for their job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discouraging conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If the chief executive doesn't like to be challenged, that can
discourage managers from challenging other managers' ideas.
Lencioni added that even some chief executives who are open to
criticism will discourage conflict at meetings because it makes
them uncomfortable, so they will create artificial harmony instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get buy-in without conflict,'' Lencioni said.
``Trying to avoid conflict at meetings is a great way to put people
to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   He said managers frequently complain about attending so many
meetings, but often it's because either the meeting is unnecessary
or because it started in a boring fashion, without any issues to
draw attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the meeting's fault; it's the manager of a bad
meeting,'' he said. ``The same thing that makes a screenplay
interesting makes a meeting interesting. There needs to be good,
role-playing characters, there needs to be a plot and, essentially
in every story, there needs to be conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Lencioni said that managers who discourage conflict also will
find it hard to hire top people, those who want to challenge the
status quo in order to achieve something more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Being too afraid of having to change a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision is almost always better than no decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lencioni said chief executives sometimes are unclear about the
company's direction because they keep waiting for more information
to come in. While making a well-informed decision is important, he
said executives often wait so long that the company drifts without
any substantial improvement for months or even years.
</P>
<P>
   They are usually better off deciding on a course based on the
information they have, then changing it later if developments make
it impractical, Lencioni said. But, he added, those with weak self-
esteem may be unwilling to do that because they are too afraid of
what people will think if they make a ``wrong'' decision.
</P>
<P>
   People with bosses like that should push for clear direction,
Lencioni said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Being more concerned about popularity than accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one is particularly painful. Am I going to tell the
person the truth about their performance or am I going to dodge the
issue?'' Lencioni said this is different than creating artificial
harmony. Just as parents are often hesitant to discipline their
children, some executives are reluctant to come down on weak middle
managers because they don't want to jeopardize their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about firing them. Firing them is the ultimate
cop-out.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the temptation he has the most trouble with, he said,
and is the one executives want to talk about the most. Firing
people is easier because those people instantly disappear from your
sight, but criticizing people and telling them how to improve is
difficult because you still see them every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let them off the hook and as a result they don't
perform, they won't respect you,'' Lencioni said. ``If you've never
come down on someone, your reward doesn't seem as valuable. And if
you've never rewarded someone, coming down on them doesn't seem as
important.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Being more interested in protecting their status than
achieving results.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the top spot is a dream for many workers, and
Lencioni said some executives are more concerned with enhancing
their own reputation instead of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hire people who are `yes' people because they won't hold
you accountable for your results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lencioni said politicians like President Clinton often run into
problems with this temptation; their goal is keeping their job.
``Anyone who wants to be president since they were 16 years old
probably is too drawn to the status of the job.''

<P>
   OLY-USOC-REACT _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Olympic Committee wants
the White House to place the scandal-ridden IOC under federal laws
that will force leaders of the games to live up to the ``noble
ideals they profess.'' Saying strong action was needed to avoid
``the loss of the Olympic Games,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said
today he would ask President Clinton that the IOC be identified as
a public international organization under the Federal Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. He said he expected other nations ``to
support this initiative as an important way to truly level the
playing field'' for all cities seeking to stage the Olympics. Hybl
said the USOC's executive committee had approved all the
recommendations made by the ethics panel led by former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell. (Foskett, Atlanta

by a bid to set aside 77 percent of projected federal budget
surpluses for Social Security and Medicare. Rep. John Lewis will be
there. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    Despite physical ailments, Collins is a success at Ga. Tech
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When North Carolina State hosted Georgia Tech on Jan. 2,
Wolfpack athletics director Les Robinson joked that Yellow Jacket
forward Jason Collier was the story of the '99 basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Robinson said, ``that he leaves Bobby Knight's
program to go to Bobby Cremins' program and then gets an ulcer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ulcer was just one in a series of physical problems that
caused Collier to lose 18 pounds from his original 250. In
mid-December, six days before Collier was to make his Georgia Tech
debut a year after transferring away from Knight and Indiana
University, he got the flu.
</P>
<P>
   After being hospitalized and taking fluids intravenously,
Collier returned to practice and sprained his right ankle. Then
after his second game, he vomited blood for an hour and was
diagnosed with the ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the 7-footer has been one of Tech's few success
stories in a 15-14 season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jackets open Friday against North Carolina in the ACC
tournament, they will have one last chance at redemption. ``It's
like a second season, and we need to win three games,'' Collier
said. ``There are teams that have done that. N.C. State, a couple
of years ago, made it to the finals. Who's to say we can't do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   If the seeds hold, Maryland and then Duke would follow North
Carolina. If Tech goes to any postseason tournament, it probably
would be the National Invitational Tournament .
</P>
<P>
   If Tech does get an NIT call, Collier wants to go. ``I don't
have much time,'' he said, ``and it's a chance to play more games.
It would kill me not to be in some kind of postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier no longer will address his problems with Knight, but one
of the main ones was the coach's insistence that Collier limit his
game to the inside.
</P>
<P>
   At Tech, he has gone inside and out _ and thrived. He also has
returned to the Catholic church, which he stopped attending at
Indiana. When Collier decided to transfer to Tech, Cremins promised
Collier's mother that he would get her son's religious life back in
order. Under Cremins, a coach with a gentler approach than
Knight's, Collier is one-tenth of one point away from leading the
ACC in scoring, at 17.6 points a game, and is 7th in rebounds at
7.1. Collier wears No. 52, the same worn by his father, Jeff, who
played for both Whack Hyder and Dwayne Morris at Tech, 1973-76.
``He's had a real good year, especially considering the time he had
to take off,'' the father said. ``He's frustrated from the
standpoint that the team's not doing that well. He wanted it to be
a good year for coach Cremins.'' During the recruiting process,
Jeff Collier said, ``We met the who's who in college basketball,
and we all thought that coach Cremins was, if not the class act of
the group, very high in the group. Coach (Mike) Krzyzewski (of
Duke), (North Carolina's) Dean Smith and coach (John) McLeod (of
Notre Dame) are also class acts. Coach Cremins is a very genuine
individual, and Tech's very lucky to have him. I've seen both sides
of the fence there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with another 7-footer, Alvin Jones, in the lineup, Tech has
struggled on offense, with a freshman, Tony Akins, at point guard
and Jon Babul, Jason Floyd and T.J. Vines playing out of position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get people the ball,'' Collier says tactfully.
``You have to know when to throw it in and who to throw it to.
You're not going to be able to throw Alvin a bullet pass. I have
trouble with bullet passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Collier said, ``If Jason and Alvin work together this
summer, they could be very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Collier has played well, he concedes that he has
spent many an unhappy night this season. ``I hate to lose more than
anything,'' he said. ``When we lose, I get in this wild mood. I go
back to the room and sit for three or four hours thinking about it,
blaming myself, when I know I shouldn't. It's very frustrating. . .
. We're fighting to be above mediocre. We've lost 14 games this
season, and I only lost 11 games my entire high-school career. It's
humbling and frustrating.''

   PET-ALLERGY (New York) _ When I adopted a big labrador mutt I
never dreamed I'd be allergic to her. But every time she flopped
down on the floor, little clouds of hair drifting into the air, I
sneezed. My eyes itched. I developed what felt like a chronic cold.
If she slept in the same room with me, I'd wake up with that
``tight'' feeling in my chest so familiar from an asthmatic
childhood. ``Get rid of the dog,'' my doctor said; control the
problem at its source. ``Open the windows,'' said Dr. David
Valacer, director of the Children's Allergy, Immunology and
Respiratory Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital. ``The dander
will be diluted by the air brought into the house.'' By Ann Raver.

   DIEGO-RIVERA (Undated) _ Now that the cactus fence around his
house near Mexico City has been replanted, its vivid colors
restored, and offending additions removed, Diego Rivera can easily
be imagined on the third-floor bridge leading from his red studio
to Frida Kahlo's blue studio, pounding at her glass door and asking
his wife's forgiveness. The life of Rivera, a Rabelaisian omnivore,
was a legend wrapped in scandal surrounded by myth that played
against the backdrop of Technicolor buildings, as if he was a
figure walking through one of his own heroic canvases. By Joseph

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Asian Peanut Sauces Take Critics' Shelling  
   
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ If grocery store aisles are any indication, Asian
foods continue to gain popularity. But just as popular are
shortcuts to getting dinner on the table. We recently found nine
brands of Asian peanut sauces at Bay Area markets _ a product that
fits both bills.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted the sauces on their own and with baked
unseasoned chicken as a dipper. Overall, the panel was
disappointed, complaining that many of the products lacked peanut
flavor and others were out of balance with too many competing
elements.
</P>
<P>
   First place went to  &UR; House of &LR;   &UR; Tsang  &LR; (111/2 ounces,
$3.79-$3.99 at many supermarkets). One panelist thought it was a
bit simple, but it had nice flavor. Two others commented on the
prevalent lemongrass flavor. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thai Kitchen  &LR; (12 ounces, $3.99 at Andronico's) came in second.
Two panelists lamented the poor oily appearance; one wrote:
``tastes a heck of a lot better than it looks.'' Two others thought
it was too sweet but liked it overall. One panelist noted it would
be particularly good on noodles. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to the least expensive brand,  &UR; Dynasty &LR;  (seven
ounces, $2.49 at Safeway). Three panelists complained about its
vinegary-hot flavors; one joked that it would be good mixed with
Thai Kitchen's sauce. One would buy it, two might buy it, and one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped significantly to No.4, which went to  &UR; Satay &LR; 
(eight ounces, $5.49 at Whole Foods). All the panelists disliked
the overly strong flavor of coconut milk, but one thought it had
decent peanut flavor as well. Two panelists labeled it
``one-dimensional.'' Two would buy it, one might buy it, and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ebara &LR;  (111/2 ounces, $3.89 at Safeway) nabbed fifth place. Two
panelists did not like all the competing flavors, and two panelists
thought it was heavy on soy sauce. One might buy it; four would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Four products scored too low to rate: Annie Chum's, Pacific Rim
Noodle House, Woh Hup and San J.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna
Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe for All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland
Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 EDITORS NOTE: Here is a recipe to make on the weekend, with  enough
leftovers to use throughout the week in two other recipes 
 plus suggested ideas for other dishes. Recipes follow, plus 
 suggestions in optional trim.   THE WEEKEND COOK: Chuck, the Kindest Cut of All for Pot Roast  
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ Many cuts of beef can be braised or cooked as a
pot roast, but some of them yield stringy, dry meat. The chuck is
different. It's the ideal cut for moist heat because a decent
amount of marbling throughout the muscle bastes the meat as it
cooks and keeps it tender. I learned this ever so deliciously one
night at the dinner table of my friend Suzanne.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suzanne rolls her eyes when I tell her she is one of those
marvelous cooks who can turn cardboard into foie gras. But it's
true. Even so, I believe her when she says that in the case of
braising and pot roasting beef, the cook's success depends on the
cut of meat. She swears by a boneless chuck roast.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think Suzanne's culinary wizardry ends at the meat
counter, let me tell you how good she is at combining herbs and
spices in unexpected but sensible ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the Master Recipe, there is something unusual in the heady
perfume of cloves and basil that gives the all-American pot roast
an exotic twist. Somehow, Suzanne knew that the menthol-like
flavors of both clove and basil would give the long-simmered,
wine-based sauce an unexpected freshness.
</P>
<P>
   The Master Recipe is the dish I had for dinner at her house. She
served garlic-scented chard bruschetta as an appetizer, a heap of
roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes with the meat, and
pear-gingerbread upside-down cake for dessert. It was a cold night,
there was plenty of wine and six of us around a beautifully set,
candle-lit table were lucky enough to be warmed and sated in style.
Typically Suzanne.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
MASTER RECIPE: CHUCK ROAST BRAISED IN WINE WITH CLOVE &AMP; BASIL
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is written for 2 pots to accommodate the 3 roasts,
but if you have one pot large enough to hold the roasts in a single
layer, use it, and saute the onions for a few minutes longer. The
sauce is thin and very flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 bottles dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   12 large garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   15 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   21/4 teaspoons salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 boneless chuck roasts, each 2 to 21/2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, diced
</P>
<P>
   3 large onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 celery stalks, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup minced basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the wine, garlic, cloves, salt and pepper in a large
bowl; stir until the salt dissolves. Add the chuck roasts, turning
them a few times in the liquid. Cover and refrigerate, turning the
meat occasionally, for at least 6 and up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the meat from the marinade; blot it dry with paper
towels.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the olive oil between 2 large, heavy pots and place over
high heat. When the oil ripples, add the meat and brown on all
sides, turning as necessary. Remove the meat; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Discard all but 1 tablespoon fat from each pot. Return the pots
to medium-high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the pancetta between the pots; saute, stirring, for 3
minutes. Divide the onions, carrots and celery between the pots.
Saute, stirring frequently, until the onions are golden, about 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add 1 cup water to each pot; bring to a boil over high heat and
simmer for a minute. Divide all the marinade ingredients between
the pots. Add 2 roasts to 1 pot, the third roast to the second pot.
Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to
medium-low, cover, and gently simmer until the meat is very tender
but not dry, 13/4 to 2 hours. Add the basil during the last half
hour of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the meat from the sauce. Degrease the sauce. Slice 11/4
roasts into about 3/8-inch-thick slices. Arrange on a platter or
individual plates. Ladle 31/2 cups sauce with vegetables over the
meat. Serve with 5 cups Cheddar-Parmesan Mashed Potatoes (see
recipe).
</P>
<P>
   Cool, cover and refrigerate the remaining 9 cups sauce with
vegetables for use throughout the week. Degrease the chilled sauce,
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6, with leftovers.

<P>
   Return the potatoes to the pot and mash until they are slightly
lumpy. Fold in most of the milk. Add the cheeses and pepper,
folding until thoroughly incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   Add as much of the remaining salt as desired, then add the
remaining milk if the potatoes need thinning. Mix thoroughly but
don't over-mix or the potatoes will become gluey.
</P>

Cool, cover and refrigerate the remaining potatoes for use later in
the week.

More Ideas for Leftovers &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chuck roast, mashed potatoes and braising sauce made on the weekend
yield even more quick fixes during the week:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hashed Mashed with Broccoli. &LR;  Dice the stems from a head of
broccoli. Cut the florets into small pieces. Boil the stems in
salted water for 2 minutes. Add the florets; boil for 3 minutes.
Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a little olive oil in the pot. Add 2 cloves of thinly
sliced garlic; saute until golden. Add 3/4 cup water; boil until
reduced to 1/2 cup. Add the broccoli and simmer until it is very
soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Season generously with pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a nonstick pan. Add leftover
mashed potatoes and saute, folding them over periodically, until a
thin crust forms. Divide among serving plates; top with the
broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hot Borscht. &LR;  Dice and boil a potato and 1/2 green pepper in 2
cups water. When the potato is almost tender, add a little shredded
cabbage, a thinly sliced carrot, 3 cups of leftover braising sauce
and some diced braised chuck, plus chopped dill and caraway seeds
to taste. Simmer for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add canned julienned beets and their liquid. Simmer for 2
minutes. Season with salt, pepper and vinegar. Serve hot, topped
with sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quick Black Bean Chili. &LR;  Saute a diced green pepper in oil
until limp. Add 3 cups leftover braising sauce with onions and 2
cups diced braised chuck. Season with ground cumin, chili powder,
salt and pepper. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add drained and rinsed
canned black beans. Simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the juice of a
lime.
</P>
<P>
   Top with sour cream; accompany with cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pot Roast Pot Pie. &LR;  Thicken a few cups of the leftover braising
sauce with onions with a roux. Stir in some leftover diced braised
chuck, sliced mushrooms, frozen defrosted peas and a very thinly
sliced carrot. Transfer the mixture to an ovenproof casserole. Top
with a thick crust rolled from frozen puff pastry or other frozen
pastry. Make a slit in the crust. Bake at 375 until the crust is
golden and the filling bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Filler Up. &LR;  Use leftover diced chuck and as much of the
braising sauce as desired for taco fillings, Sloppy Joes, pasties,
enchilada fillings and stuffings for vegetables such as zucchini
and peppers.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Maytag Put Suds Back in Anchor Brewery  
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  When Abe Lincoln was president and San Francisco
basked in the prosperity that came with the cry of ``Gold!'' small
breweries were as prevalent as Starbucks coffee shops are now.
<P>
   Today, only one brewery with ties to that era remains in San
Francisco _ Anchor Brewing Co., which had survived multiple owners
and a bankruptcy death threat before it was rescued in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The man who stepped in was Fritz Maytag, who was moved to
preserve this San Francisco landmark and propel it to international
prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag, an Iowan and Stanford University graduate, is from the
family whose enterprises include The Maytag (appliance) Co. and
Maytag Blue Cheese. When he bought the brewery, he had a
fascination with science but no skill in brewing. ``I had mold
experience but no yeast experience,'' he jokes. ``I dropped out of
grad school and dropped into the brewery.''
</P>
<P>
   Love made him do it. In 1965, Anchor was at its nadir, going
bankrupt. ``They were selling the old wooden beer kegs on the
sidewalk for 50 cents, just for the toll across the Golden Gate
Bridge,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kuh, who owned the Old Spaghetti Factory in San Francisco's
North Beach neighborhood and had a soft spot for the local brewery,
told Maytag about Anchor's apparently imminent demise. Go see it,
Kuh encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did. I fell in love. With then owner Laurence Steese, with
Anchor's San Francisco heritage, with fermentation, with the idea
of making beer, the whole thing,'' Maytag says.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag was just what Anchor needed _ he had resources, vision, a
love of science and his father as inspiration. When Frederick Louis
Maytag II was head of a nationally known company synonymous with
washing machines, he started an artisan cheese company as a labor
of love.
</P>
<P>
   Before Maytag came into its life, Anchor brewed just one beer _
Anchor Steam. It was available only on tap, was often poorly made,
Maytag says, and was sold to a handful of local bar and restaurant
owners _ ``true believers,'' Maytag calls them, who loved it for
being local and didn't mind its quirkiness. Customers even had to
come to the brewery, originally on Pacific Avenue between Larkin
and Hyde streets, to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   Although the brewing facility that became Anchor dates from the
mid-1860s, Anchor acquired its name in 1896. ``We don't know why
the owners chose the name,'' Maytag says, ``although the image of
an anchor as a tool is ancient, magical, powerful and associated
with ports.''
</P>
<P>
   After Prohibition, an employee named Joe Allen bought Anchor and
ran it until 1958. Laurence Steese, the next owner, moved it to
Eighth Street between Bryant and Brannan streets. Maytag bought
into the company in 1965, bought out Steese in 1969 and moved the
brewery to Potrero Hill in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As president and brew master, Maytag made it his mission to save
Anchor and also preserve the art of classical brewing. By 1972,
says Maytag, Anchor was the most modern small brewery in the world
as well as the most traditional brewery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take modern shortcuts in brewing, and we charged
twice what Michelob charged. I was considered bizarre in the
business,'' says Maytag, who, in a crusade to revive the art of
hand-crafted beers, was a David in an industry of Budweiser
Goliaths. Maytag and a handful of others with a passion for
traditional brewing were instrumental in pioneering the resurgence
of the microbrewery.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor now produces seven brews, including a traditional
festival beer (Christmas beer) and a wheat beer, which the company
believes was the first of its kind produced in America after
Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Steam, with instant name recognition in the Bay Area and
an international reputation, is the company's flagship brew. How
the word steam became linked to beer is unclear, Maytag says, but
in the 19th century, steam was a local nickname for draft beer made
quickly under primitive conditions. Steam is now a trademark of
Anchor Brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Anchor occupies an immaculate, handsome facility on
Potrero Hill. Its annual production is 100,000 barrels, very small
by industry standards. The beers are sold in 49 states, Japan and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Maytag opened a small distillery on the premises to
produce traditional American rye whiskey, christening the spirit
Old Potrero. Since whiskey is distilled beer, Maytag regards Old
Potrero as a natural progression of brewing. A revival of the kind
of whiskey made in George Washington's Day, Old Potrero is
pot-distilled from 100 percent rye malt. As far as Maytag knows, it
is the only single-malt rye being produced in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the unusual product is limited; only 2,000 bottles
have been distributed. The 750 ml bottle retails for $90 at some
liquor stores in San Francisco. The whiskey is also served at some
restaurants, including Moose's, Rumpus and Enrico's, all in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor also distills a minuscule amount of premium gin called
Junipero, which retails for $28 for a 750 ml bottle. It's served at
mc2, South Park Cafe and Scala's Bistro, among other San Francisco
restaurants. Maytag describes it as intense, spicy and complex.
``It makes a great martini.'' Even this has local flair, with a
name that blends the major flavor component of gin and the name of
a Franciscan friar who established the California missions.
</P>
<P>
   Local beer. Local whiskey. Local gin. What else is brewing? Two
more ``fun'' products, says Maytag, for possible spring release. He
will say little more, other than they are bottled. Still, this much
seems bankable: They will fit right in with Anchor's mission of
superior quality and production _ the natural, traditional way.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Cool Cukes Are Reborn in Vodka  
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The name of the restaurant _ Infusion _ gives you
a clue about what to order. On any night you can find up to a dozen
different flavored, or infused, vodkas: jalapeno, watermelon,
pineapple, vanilla and my favorite _ cucumber.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clear liquid takes on a pure, intense flavor of the
cucumber. It's great served as an ice-cold aperitif from the
freezer or over ice. It's also great in a Bloody Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sothern, the former general manager, got the idea for
making infused vodkas while taking a few days off to visit a spa in
Calistoga where cucumber slices were floated in the drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, he talked to staff members about making a
cucumber infusion, but they weren't convinced it would work, so the
idea was quickly forgotten. A few months later, an elderly Russian
woman tried one of the flavored vodkas and told Sothern about a
cucumber infusion her grandmother used to make. The staff started a
batch the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is simple and effortless. All you need is the
``flavoring'' agent and a good-quality vodka. Period.
</P>
<P>
   These infusions are the backbones of Infusion, a trendy
South-of-Market restaurant that features a robust, eclectic menu
and live entertainment. The menu might include spicy tortilla soup
with chicken and lime, spicy rock shrimp and corn risotto, or an
excellent grilled pork chop with spicy apple barbecue sauce. As you
can see, spicy is the key word, and these refreshing flavored
vodkas help cool the palate.  &LR; Infusion, 555 &LR;   &LR; Second St. (near
Bryant Street. San Francisco; (415) 543-2282. &LR;   &LR; Lunch weekdays;

   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 (750 ml) bottle vodka
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 hothouse cucumbers
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Peel the cucumbers and cut into 1/8-inch rounds (you'll need
about 5 cups).
</P>
<P>
   Place the cucumber slices in a large, clean glass container and
pour in vodka to completely cover them. Cover the container and
store at room temperature for 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When the vodka is ready, strain it through a fine mesh sieve
lined with a paper coffee filter or two thicknesses of damp
cheesecloth. Pour into a clean bottle (the original vodka bottle is
fine), seal tightly and store in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Serve straight up like a martini, use in a Bloody Mary, or mix
with club soda over ice.

 AT THE SOURCE: Fruit of the Forest Journeys to Table  
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; NAPA VALLEY, Calif. _ &LR;  ``These yellow mushrooms may look like
chanterelles, but they aren't chanterelles _ because there are no
chanterelles in America.''
<P>
   With that generalization, French chefs dismissed Connie Green
when she offered them the fruit of her foraging 20 years ago.
Today, Green has a waiting list of chefs _ including French chefs _
who can't get enough of those yellow mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our chanterelles are the largest in the world and the
meatiest,'' says Green, who abandoned two careers for the joy of
tramping through the forests and glens of Northern California and
the Pacific Northwest. She now pursues the plentiful yet elusive
darlings of upscale cuisine, wild mushrooms: black trumpets,
hedgehogs, morels, candy cups, c &LR; e &LR; pes, matsutakes and
chanterelles, large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Green no longer finds time to forage more than a
couple of days a week, relying on a loosely knit band of pickers _
from 12 to 40 at a time _ to deliver the goods for her 6-year-old
company, Wine Forest Wild Mushrooms of Napa Valley, which she
operates from her home in the Mayacmas Mountains. The business
supplies an average of 1,400 pounds of cleaned mushrooms each week
to Campton Place, LuLu, Zuni Cafe, Jardini &LR; e &LR; re, Masa's, Green's
and French Laundry.
</P>
<P>
   These pickers travel the mushroom trail, as Green calls it,
which stretches north from Northern California through the Pacific
Northwest and occasionally into the Yukon and Alaska. They live in
campers, pickup trucks or motels as they follow the fruiting season
of the treasured 'rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their independence, Green says, they are also
interdependent, and she often serves as a messenger conveying
information among individuals or small groups. She calls them the
new cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   On a bad day, a picker might make only $9; on a good day, it
could be $400.
</P>
<P>
   Green inspects all mushrooms delivered to her _ much of them
freighted from small airports _ before she takes them to her chef
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Green is an expert in identifying the various species of wild
mushrooms, as are her pickers. She occasionally takes chefs on
outings to teach them about wild mushrooms _ it's important for
them to know about the source of their ingredients, she feels _ and
she still thrills to the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mushrooms,'' she says, ``have magic about them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tips for Using and Storing
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Connie Green's business card identifies her as the head huntress of
her company, Wine Forest Mushrooms of Napa Valley. Her 25-year love
affair with wild mushrooms grew from aficionado to part-time
mushroom forager to full-time mushroom entrepreneur. Naturally, she
has strong opinions on mushrooms &LR;  matters and offers these tips:
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooms are not as perishable as many people think. Avoid
getting them wet, but store them in a slightly damp cloth or fabric
bag in the refrigerator and use them within the week (storage life
will depend on the species and the freshness of the fungi when
purchased).
</P>
<P>
   Green cleans her mushrooms before delivery, using a damp brush
to lift off particles of dirt, then dries the fungi on racks under
fans.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing mushrooms, she generally opts for simplicity,
without too many other flavors masking the essential taste.
Roasting is a great option for such mushrooms as chanterelles and
hen of the forest _ just brush with a little flavored butter and
roast at fairly high heat. Roasting or grilling enhances the flavor
of many mushrooms, Green says, among them the matsutake, the prized
(and pricey) Japanese fungus that's gaining popularity among top
chefs. Never saute it, she advises. Instead, grill it over very
high heat.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer indulgence, she suggests chanterelle soup. Roast
chanterelles, add stock, puree some of the mushrooms and chop some
into meaty morsels, add plenty of cream and garnish with chives and
parsley.
</P>

 &UR; GEORGEANNE'S KITCHEN: Cooking Wild Mushrooms &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Georgeanne Brennan &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Wild mushrooms give a wonderful flavors-of-the-forest kind of feel
to any dish they're used in. And they may be used in a multitude of
ways. Here are just a few suggestions on how to enjoy them:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Warm Chanterelle, Escarole and Baby Spinach Salad.  &LR; Coarsely
tear the pale yellow inner leaves of escarole into bite-sized
pieces, then arrange them on individual salad plates. Add a few
leaves of baby spinach to each. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Quarter large chanterelles lengthwise, leave small ones whole.
Saute in a nugget of butter, with a little salt, pepper and fresh
thyme, for about 3 or 4 minutes, just until the mushrooms begin to
soften. Divide evenly among the salad plates.
</P>
<P>
   Add some minced shallots to the pan juices, and saute for 2 or 3
minutes, just until soft. Deglaze the pan with red wine vinegar.
Remove from the heat, add a little olive oil, mix well and pour a
little over each salad. Serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wild Mushroom Crostini.  &LR; Grill slices of baguette, then rub
them with peeled garlic cloves. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop a selection of wild mushrooms, adding a few brown
mushrooms if desired. Season with salt, pepper and rosemary and
saute in olive oil until softened. Add minced Italian parsley, then
spoon onto the grilled bread slices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Breaded Puffball Mushrooms.  &LR; Cut firm puffballs into 1/4-inch
thick slices. Heat a little butter and olive oil in a skillet over
medium heat. When the butter is foamy, dip the mushroom slices into
beaten egg, then into freshly made breadcrumbs seasoned with salt,
pepper, parsley and a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. Saute
for about 2 minutes per side, until golden. Serve immediately with
lemon or aioli.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Creamy Wild Mushrooms with Basmati Rice.  &LR; Coarsely chop a
selection of wild mushrooms, adding portobello, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the rice.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a bechamel sauce, and when it is almost ready, saute the
mushrooms in butter, seasoning them with salt, pepper and fresh
thyme. Stir them into the sauce, along with the pan juices. If
desired, add chopped roasted red pepper and chunks of chicken
breast.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spoon over the rice and garnish with a sprinkling of
pasilla or other chili powder.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Skewered Wild Mushrooms.  &LR; Thread mushrooms on skewers. Place
them in a shallow dish and sprinkle with a mixture of olive oil,
minced garlic, minced parsley, salt and pepper. Turn to coat, then
marinate for several hours, turning occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Place on a grill or under a broiler and cook for about 3 or 4
minutes per side, just until slightly golden.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, alternate the mushrooms with thin slivers of beef.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wild Mushroom Tart.  &LR; Quarter large mushrooms lengthwise, leave
smaller ones whole. Saute the mushrooms and minced shallots in
butter, adding salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375. Roll out a sheet of thawed, frozen puff
pastry. Leave whole, or cut into individual sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Combine fresh goat cheese, a little salt and pepper, and the
juices from the mushrooms; mix well to form a paste, adding a
little chicken broth if necessary to thin the mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pastry on a baking sheet, folding up the edges to make
a crust. Poke with the tines of a fork. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove
from oven, spread with the goat cheese and top with the mushrooms.
Sprinkle with a little olive oil and bake another 10 minutes.

 WILD ABOUT WEEDS  
 Bay Area forager hunts untamed edibles her own back yard  
   
   
 By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  As spring approaches, most Bay Area gardeners eye
their yardswith hope and chagrin. There are tomatoes to plant and
roses to mulch _ but first there are all those darned weeds.
<P>
   Or, as Margit Roos-Collins might put it, all those delicious
weeds. For Roos-Collins, the Berkeley author of ``Flavors of Home:
A Guide to Wild Edible Plants of the San Francisco Bay Area''
(Heyday Books, 1990), the chickweed, nettles, wild onions and
purslane that pepper untended yards belong on the dinner plate, not
in the Dumpster. By learning to recognize a few wild edibles _ and
by steering clear of the toxic ones _ Bay Area gardeners, hikers
and other outdoor enthusiasts can graze at nature's table, says the
author. Where legal, foraging for wild fruits, nuts, greens and
roots can be a year-round pastime, she says, and a profound way to
experience one's surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Roos-Collins led a private Bay Area foray that
included fellow weed enthusiast and cookbook author Paula Wolfert.
</P>
<P>
   On a short hike in a woodsy location that she asked to keep
unidentified, Roos-Collins pointed out dozens of wild edibles, from
coast strawberries and sea figs (neither fruiting yet) to at least
a dozen of the wild leafy greens from nature's winter buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike wild mushrooms, which can require a sharp eye to find,
the greens were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's your mallow,'' Wolfert said, pointing to a clump of
furry, rounded leaves less than 10 feet from the trailhead.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, she said, cooks stuff the large mallow leaves with
rice or meat as they might stuff grape leaves. In Tunisia, they
steam the leaves, then beat in oil and spices to make a dip for
bread. The nutrient-rich green is so high in vitamin A _ second
only to polar bear liver, says Roos-Collins _ that too much can be
toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the trail, she points to a shady patch of
scallionlike foliage with delicate, nodding white blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of San Francisco has these in their back yard,''
Roos-Collins says. ``I've seen truckoads of it going out of
people's yards. They try desperately to eradicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, gardeners could exploit these wild onions and their
faintly oniony blossoms in salads and fish preparations.
Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the New York celebrity chef, scatters
the blossoms over salads, Wolfert says.
</P>
<P>
   In a thicket of 8-foot-tall wild fennel, a holdover from last
year, Wolfert bends a seed head down and shakes its contents into
her hand. ``Too bad you can't photograph smell,'' she says, holding
out a palm filled with dark, licorice-scented seeds. In Provence,
restaurants stuff whole fish with wild fennel stalks before
grilling and toss dried fennel stalks on the coals. In Italy, cooks
gather the pollen from fennel flowers and use it to season pork, a
practice showing up here. ``All the chefs are talking about it,''
Wolfert says. ``It's going to be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny slope beyond the overgrown fennel, Roos-Collins finds
a seasonal treat: young radish shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the prize at this time of year,'' she says, pointing to
tiny clusters of the tender greens all over the slope. ``If I'm
only going to teach people one plant, that's the one.'' It's easy
to recognize, easy to like when cooked and present in abundance.
The tiny pastel blossoms, which have a slight horseradish taste,
are so fragrant on a sunny day, she says, ``you can smell the
sweetness coming off the flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   On just such a sunny slope years ago, nibbling on radish
blossoms, Roos-Collins first understood why foraging resonated so
deeply for her. The revelation led to one of the most moving
passages in her book, testimony to nature's ability to provide.
``Understanding that I still had a place at the animals' table was
such sweet relief that it made me cry,'' Roos-Collins wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, humans have chosen agriculture to feed everyone more
easily and to allow time for other pursuits, she acknowledges. But
recognizing nature's providence _ ``that there was food set out for
me,'' Roos-Collins says _ was a deeply spiritual experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love plants,'' she says. ``I love watching them grow,
watching the sunlight on them, the way they smell when you brush
them. Foraging slows me down. It makes me sit still in one place
and focus on their taste, their feel, their smell, their growth
habits. It makes me feel I've really been in a place that I was
otherwise just walking through.''
</P>
<P>
   As parks clamp down on foraging, Roos-Collins sees opportunities
vanishing for people to have similar encounters with nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to preserve resources not just for today but
for future generations,'' says Tracy Fortmann, a communications
officer for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. ``People say
to themselves, `Well, I'm just going to take one flower,' but we
have 20 million visitors a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials acknowledge some of the edibles that foragers
seek are pesky non-native weeds that keep native plants from
flourishing. But allowing uncontrolled foraging can harm the
environment, they say, as people trample into off-trail areas,
damaging native habitats, disturbing streams and promoting erosion.
Even respectful foraging can cause problems, they argue, if
observers see someone fill a bag with chickweed and conclude that
it must be all right to pick wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions on foraging sadden Roos-Collins, a former
environmental lawyer who sympathizes with the park managers'
concerns. But surely, she argues, foraging could be controlled and
monitored in the same way hunting and fishing are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would give us the chance to buy a license for
foraging and put more rangers on the trail _ whatever it would take
to make it work,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the frequent edible-plant walks he leads in the Bay Area,
Adam Seller emphasizes conscientious foraging. ``I focus on
teaching people how to look at a place and see whether it's
reasonable to take anything at all,'' says Seller, a professional
herbalist. But he has no qualms about what he calls ``sustainable
harvesting,'' which has contributed to the human diet in most
places through most of time.
</P>
<P>
   Many Bay Area immigrants come from foraging cultures, Seller
says, and foraging has nurtured them here. Even the United States
has a foraging tradition, he says, particularly in the Southwest
and the rural South. Today, many of his plant-walk customers are
African-American women who want to learn the weeds their Southern
grandmothers used to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Others join his walks in preparation for Y2K, when, they
believe, all computer systems may crash and only the prepared will
survive. ``The millennium has been good for my walks,'' Seller
says.
</P>
<P>
   In his early spring forays, he might point out curly dock, a
long, narrow leaf that tastes like sorrel; stinging nettles, which
thrive in the Berkeley hills and are delicious in soup; and
fragrant wild plum blossoms he steeps in rice vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Bay Area chefs have embraced these wild foods,
among them Reed Hearon of Rose Pistola and Black Cat; Todd
Humphries, former chef of Campton Place; and Paul Bertolli of
Oliveto.
</P>
<P>
   At Oliveto, Bertolli kneads cooked nettles into pasta dough or
pounds them with olive oil to make a sauce for wild steelhead. He
steams mussels with California bay leaves and adds wild mustard
greens to salads served with rabbit. He pounds wild fennel seeds
into powder, mixes it with salt and flavors pork roast with it, and
he adds the chopped feathery leaves to vinaigrettes. He also heats
the crushed seeds gently with olive oil to make a highly scented
condiment for fish and pork.

   ``It animates your cooking when you can connect with the source
of the food,'' Bertolli says. ``It's the same feeling you get when
you make something from scratch, the satisfaction of being with the
process from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pomponio Creek Produce, an organic farm near Pescadero,
Martin Bournhonesque harvests the nettles that turn up on plates at
Oliveto, Chez Panisse, Boulevard and Zuni Cafe. ``In the last two
years, nettles have gone from a pesky weed to a profitable crop,''
says the astonished grower. ``I sell every last leaf in my field.''
</P>
<P>
   He also harvests milk thistle, wild watercress and
lamb's-quarter for chefs; Hearon puts the milk thistle, along with
other greens, in a ravioli filling.
</P>
<P>
   With park foraging frowned upon, organic farms like Pomponio
Creek may provide the most promising setting for would-be foragers.
In their fertile beds untouched by herbicides, sour grass,
lamb's-quarter and chickweed flourish _ plants that most farmers
would prefer not to have and aren't set up to sell. Wolfert says
that, when she lived on the East Coast, one farmer gave her a
``lifetime right to weed,'' so she could scour his beds for
purslane and mallow for recipe testing.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert predicts American farmers will soon begin
cultivatingwild edibles to satisfy a growing demand from chefs.
That's happening in Crete, she says, as people move from farm to
city and can't forage for the wild greens they love. But if
supermarkets of the future carry thistles and nettles, will that
eliminate the lure of foraging?
</P>
<P>
   Not for Roos-Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to Andronico's or Monterey Market, and it's fantastic,''
she says. ``There are always five or six gorgeous-looking greens
for sale. It's not that there's more variety in the wild; there's
probably less, because there's only what can grow in this climate.
But as you forage, you're tuned in to seasonal changes. There's a
greens season now, then a flower and wild strawberry season, then
berries and nuts in the fall. The natural seasonal rhythm is
something people are sorely missing, and foraging gives that
back.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries the strict park regulations governing foraging will
make the natural world into an art object to be observed but not
touched. For Roos-Collins, who has savored the warm fragrance of
Douglas fir tea and the pleasing chewiness of local seaweed, the
hands-off approach ``is clearly an inadequate way to relate to
nature.''

Ask Before Taking Plants From Parks &QL; 
 &QL; 
With a few exceptions, removing plant material from a park _
whether it's a national, state, county, city or regional park _ is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   A few state park districts allow berry or nut gathering and
limited mushroom gathering, a decision made by each district. Some
parks allow you to nibble as you hike but don't let you take
anything out.
</P>
<P>
   Limited mushroom collecting is permitted in designated areas of
Land's End in San Francisco, and the San Francisco Mycological
Society typically receives permits to forage for its annual
mushroom fair.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wayne, natural areas director for the San Francisco
Recreation and Parks Department, says her office might issue
permits to people seeking to weed _ don't say forage _ some of the
non-native greens in city parks.
</P>
<P>
   Before foraging in any park, call the appropriate administrative
office to inquire about policies, limits and whether the plants
have been sprayed with insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational _ not commercial _ foraging is permitted in
national forests. However, National Forest Service spokesman Dave
Reider encourages would-be foragers to call the nearest National
Forest Service office to inquire about ecologically sensitive areas
or endangered plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some national forests require permits for gathering some types
of plants. Rules vary among forests, so check before picking. Also
keep in mind that, although national forests belong to everyone,
some land within the forests' boundaries is privately owned.
Rangers can provide information to help keep visitors from
trespassing.

 &QL; 
 &LR; Tips for Foragers
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Margit Roos-Collins offers the following advice for new
foragers:
</P>
<P>
   Don't taste a plant unless you're certain that it's edible.
</P>
<P>
   Learn to recognize common poisonous plants in this area, such as
poison hemlock and lupine. Poison hemlock often grows among other
edible wild plants, such as chickweed. If you recognize it, you can
pick it out or, better yet, forage elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need comprehensive knowledge of wild plants to begin
foraging. To start, learn to recognize four or five wild edibles
and look only for those. ``How hard has it been to walk into a
grocery store and recognize strawberries from melons?,''
Roos-Collins asks. ``It's no different in the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Take only a small portion of any plant species so you're not
compromising its ability to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Be mindful that your foraging site is a place of beauty. Pick in
a way that leaves the least evidence you have been there. Don't
pick off leaves and let the bare stalk remain, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Take only what you can use.
</P>
<P>
   Sort wild greens carefully at home to remove grass or bits of
other plants that might be harmful. Wash them well. Treat them just
like supermarket greens, steaming or boiling them or, if tender,
adding them to salads. ``They are really just the same,''
Roos-Collins says. ``All that's different about the ones in the
supermarket is that we gather the seeds and grow them in a
systematic way. Experiment and have fun, but don't feel like they
need special rules.''

WALL STREET ANALYSTS WELCOME HEWLETT-PACKARD SPLIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Wall Street analysts say splitting the
Hewlett-Packard Co. into two businesses _ one specializing in
computers and printers, the other focusing on electronic test
equipment and medical technology _ is a good move for the
technology giant.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Palo Alto-based company is intended to give the
computer-maker a more competitive edge in a crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test and measurements operations and the computer-based
divisions weren't synergistic,'' said George Elling, a technology
analyst at Lehman Bros. in New York. ``And the measurement business
dragged down the overall shareholder picture of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's computer and printer business accounted for
about 85 percent of the company's $47.1 billion sales for fiscal
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The other company, as yet unnamed, will be devoted to four
equipment testing and products units, which pulled in $7.7 billion
in sales last year. Those divisions reported sales losses in the
first quarter ended Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Eisenbarth, a portfolio manager at Collins &AMP; Co., an
investment bank in Larkspur, Calif., said splitting the assets into
two groups should make Hewlett-Packard's mission clearer to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is maybe a solution to alleviate those problems,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The four equipment testing and scientific product divisions that
will become one company are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The test and measurement division, which makes devices that
test the viability of telecommunications products _ such as
cellular phones _ and networks. These devices are sold to
manufacturers, including Motorola and Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   This division, which accounted for more than half of
Hewlett-Packard's testing sales last year, also develops quality of
service measurements for Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The chemical analysis division, which makes and sells
equipment for use in the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ The components division, which makes parts for electronic
gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The medical products division, which makes a variety of
hospital and out-patient devices, including patient-monitoring
systems and ultrasound imaging systems.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hewlett-Packard sells more than 19,000 testing and
scientific products.
</P>
<P>
   But by creating a separate company for these devices,
Hewlett-Packard has moved away from the business that launched the
company in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard sold their
first product, called an audio oscillator, to Walt Disney Co.,
which used the device to test sound levels on the animated classic
``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eisenbarth said the testing industry in particular is mature
and not as profitable as the computer hardware sector.
</P>
<P>
   Galen Wampler, president of Prime Data Inc., a Carlsbad,
Calif.-based market research company that follows the high-tech
instrument industry, said the testing products sector had its
heyday in the 1970s, when defense contractors were the main
customers. But demand for testing equipment has slowed in recent
years, Wampler said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sluggish projections for testing equipment and
scientific products, analysts said putting the four units under a
separate roof should allow them to grow faster because they will no
longer have to vie for resources at a bigger company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should achieve better growth rates than being part of the
overall Hewlett umbrella,'' Eisenbarth said.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, he added, would be ``fairly big and could grow
through acquisition'' in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The testing company's new chief executive, Edward ``Ned''
Barnholt, said he anticipated big growth ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got tremendous opportunities in telecommunications,'' he
said. ``We see big opportunities in the wireless arena. The whole
Internet is driving a lot of opportunities for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said it was considering an initial public
offering of about 15 percent of the testing company's outstanding
shares by year's end that would be the largest-ever technology IPO
for Silicon Valley.

TECH GIANT DEFIES A FOUNDER'S PRINCIPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The planned split of the Hewlett-Packard Co.
into two separate companies was fueled by Wall Street pressures
that its late co-founder once vowed to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never sold any stock,'' David Packard proclaimed in a
1952 lecture to securities analysts. ``And I hope we never have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   In his company history, ``The H-P Way: How Bill Hewlett and I
Built Our Company,'' Packard explained why he wanted to avoid Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   He said the markets are a two-edged sword. Publicly traded stock
gave Hewlett-Packard the currency needed for acquiring new
companies, but Packard complained of Wall Street's fixation on
short-term profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``(T)hat effect is frequently unrelated to the basic strength
and long-term prospects of the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Packard's vow to avoid the public markets came years before many
Silicon Valley moguls were even a glimmer in their parents' eyes,
yet in 1952, the year of Packard's lecture, Hewlett-Packard Co. was
already considered a mature, but decidedly off-beat, success story.
</P>
<P>
   At that lecture, Packard regaled the crowd of analysts at a
downtown San Francisco meeting hall with tales of a casual office
culture, now a modern-day given, but unheard of in then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere at Hewlett-Packard is informal, and departments
mix freely,'' wrote a San Francisco Examiner business reporter
covering the lecture. ``Employees use few memos, never hold a
conference and rarely write a report.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Hewlett-Packard was already 14 years old, having been
created in a Palo Alto garage in 1938, backed by $538 in cash and a
used Sears drill press. (Today, that garage is a historical
landmark noted as the birthplace of Silicon Valley.)
</P>
<P>
   Founders William Hewlett and Packard, two young Stanford
University-trained engineers, started the company to ``manufacture
and merchandise our own manufactured goods.''
</P>
<P>
   The order of names on the company masthead was determined by a
flip of a coin, according to Packard's breezy ``The H-P Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard, whose father was a lawyer and mother a high school
teacher in Colorado, had a distorted thumb after childhood
experiments with gun powder. Hewlett, the son of a San Francisco
doctor, was a child math whiz who was dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   They met in Stanford engineering classes and bonded their
friendship during fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   According to company lore, Hewlett was seen as the idea man,
while Packard was considered the hands-on manager. One of their
first products was the Model 200B audio oscillator, used to control
sound volume and quality for Walt Disney Studios' full-length
``Fantasia'' cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   The company would go on to become the dominant force in
electronics, laying the bedrock for the Silicon Valley's dominance
in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard is credited with producing such varied devices
as fetal heart monitors (1967), programmable scientific calculators
and light-emitting diode displays (1968), the first commercial data
processing machines (1973), the first random access memory
computers (1974), the first affordable laser printers (1980) and a
pioneering e-mail system (1982).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the company became a behemoth. Today,
Hewlett-Packard's catalog lists more than 25,000 products. It
employs more than 124,000 people in offices around the globe, and
produced $47.1 billion in sales in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Packard died in March 1996. Hewlett retired in 1987.

</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the stock markets that Packard had vowed to avoid
finally persuaded the Hewlett-Packard management to announce it
would divide itself into two separate entities.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's electronics, especially its measures and
medical equipment, could be counted on to produce steady long-term
profits, its computing business could not create the go-go
performance that other Silicon Valley companies were producing, in
part because the casual workplace that was Packard's pride had
become bogged down in corporate complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Cost-cutting and restructuring fueled a short-lived recovery,
but it ebbed, in part because of lagging non-computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Hewlett-Packard reported that sales had risen only
4 percent companywide, a sharp drop from the 20 percent growth seen
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   A huddle with corporate consultants produced Tuesday's stunning
news that Bill Packard's company would bow to Wall Street pressures
and split. The commercial electronics that Hewlett-Packard
pioneered will be produced and sold by a new, separate, as yet
unnamed company. The present Hewlett-Packard will retain its
high-growth computer and Internet technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street ``pressures were a significant factor in the
decision,'' said Edward ``Ned'' Barnholt, executive vice president
and general manager of Hewlett-Packard's Measurement Organization,
who will head the as-yet-named company. ``Investors have to be
listened to.''

down on the floor, little clouds of hair drifting into the air, I

If she slept in the same room with me, I'd wake up with that
``tight'' feeling in my chest so familiar from an asthmatic
childhood. ``Get rid of the dog,'' my doctor said; control the
problem at its source. ``Open the windows,'' said Dr. David
Valacer, director of the Children's Allergy, Immunology and

his wife's forgiveness. The life of Rivera, a Rabelaisian omnivore,
was a legend wrapped in scandal surrounded by myth that played

Giovannini.

   SUPER-BRIGHT-HEADLIGHTS (Undated) _ Laurie Cribbs bought her new
Lexus LS 400 for its luxurious appointments, but what really

O'Hara swept down the grand stair in a red velvet gown made from
Tara's drapes has fashion enjoyed such an intimate affair with the
decor tastes of the day. From luxe cashmeres to of-the-moment
Ultrasuede, upholstery and decorative home textiles are in the

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In what is shaping up to be one of the snowiest winters on
record, with about 65 feet covering parts of the west and dozens of
people dying in avalanches in Europe, back-country skiers,
snowshoers and snowmobilers are welcoming new digital technology
used in searching for avalanche victims.
</P>
<P>
   Each year in North America 40 to 50 people die in avalanches.
Speed in finding a buried victim is crucial: only one in three
survive, though of those found within the first 15 minutes of
complete burial, 86 percent are found alive.
</P>
<P>
   For years, smart backcountry travelers have strapped on
battery-powered avalanche transceivers, about the size of a
portable CD player, that emit a constant radio signal and can be
switched over to receive such a signal during a search for a buried
victim.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional analog transceivers detect beeps from a buried
victim's transceiver, which increase in volume as the searcher
approaches the victim.
</P>
<P>
   But within the last year or so, three companies have introduced
transceivers with digital technology _ or at least digital screens
_ that tell searchers how far away a victim is and in which
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know most recreational users can't use a beacon well enough
to save a life,'' said Dale Atkins of the Colorado Avalanche
Information Center. ``One of the big problems with conventional
beacons is it's up to individual to interpret the signal, and the
ear does a lousy job of interpreting volume.''
</P>
<P>
   With digital technology, the microchip does all the
triangulation. ``It takes the person out of the interpretation
process,'' said Bruce Edgerly, vice president of Backcountry
Access, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   His Boulder, Colo., firm manufactures the Tracker DTS, featuring
a dual antenna system producing more precise readings. Arva's
digital transceiver, the 9000 model, was rated the best by Rock and
Ice magazine, and the Ortovox M-1, the least digital, received the
highest overall rating from the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest,
Snow and Landscape Research.
</P>
<P>
   All cost around $300. They vary significantly in the range they
can scan, their speed, and the quality of their display screens.

WHALES IN THE MINNESOTA RIVER? ONLY ON THE WEB, WHERE SKEPTICISM IS
REQUIRED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Tourists drove six hours to Mankato, Minn., in search of
underground caves and hot springs mentioned on a web site. When
they arrived, there were no such attractions.
</P>
<P>
   People searching for a discussion of Amnesty International's
views on Tunisia learned about human rights in that North African
country _ but from supporters of the Tunisian authorities, not from
the human rights group. The government supporters brought surfers
to a site with a soothing Webaddress: www.amnesty-tunisia.org.
</P>
<P>
   And bibliophiles who trust the grande dame of online retailers,
Amazon.com, for suggestions under the headings of ``Destined for
Greatness'' and ``What We're Reading'' were dismayed to learn that
some publishers had paid for special treatment for their books _
meaning a more accurate heading would have been ``What We're Paid
to Say We're Reading.'' (After the disclosure, Amazon added a note
on its home page to make a subtle acknowledgement of the practice.)
</P>
<P>
   On the World Wide Web, straight facts can be hard to find. After
plowing through dense and recalcitrant search engines that offer
more sites than you can point a mouse at, after enduring delays,
lost links and dead ends and arriving at a site that looks just
right, Web surfers must deal with uncertainty: Is the information
true, unbiased and free of hidden sales pitches?
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is easy to fall prey to parodies, politics,
payola and ignorance on line, solid, watertight information can
indeed be found on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But experts on Internet research point out that the Web is
largely unregulated and unchecked, and so they agree that it is
wise to be skeptical: Consider the source. Reconsider the source.
Is the information up to date and professional and traceable? Can
it be verified, or the source checked, off line? And just who was
that source again?
</P>
<P>
   Don Ray, a freelance investigative reporter in Burbank, Calif.,
and the author of ``Checking Out Lawyers'' (MIE Publishing, 1997),
has what he calls a JDLR test to apply to Web research. ``There
should be a switch in every Internet user that toggles when
something Just Doesn't Look Right,'' he said, ``to make them
re-evaluate the credibility of the source.''
</P>
<P>
   If a Web page has grammatical errors, sloppy spelling or a goofy
design, that makes him distrust the content.
</P>
<P>
   And people who are getting ready to spend money on the basis of
Web information should, of course, approach their decisions with at
least as much skepticism as they would use about a purchase off
line.
</P>
<P>
   Whoppers have found a home on the Web since the very beginning.
Yet for many people, computers have generally been treated as
authority figures, able to calculate compound interest in a single
bound.
</P>
<P>
   A machine that has been perfected by institutions of higher
learning and is relied on by the government isn't likely to lie, is
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've inherited this notion that if it pops up on a screen and
looks good, we tend to think of it as fairly credible,'' said Paul
Gilster, author of ``Digital Literacy'' (Wiley Computer Publishing,
1997.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the Web has come to resemble a monstrous library system
where everyone has a printing press and all information is
seemingly created equal, even the newest surfers come to it with
useful information-sorting skills from the off-line world.
</P>
<P>
   They can differentiate among information from a trusted
newspaper, a bulk mailing from a charity, a sales pitch from a
stockbroker and a letter from a friend. They can distinguish
commercial broadcasts from public television programs. They can
skim over the pages in Reader's Digest with ``Advertisement''
printed at the top.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Web, the clues for credibility are different, and so
are the tools needed to assess the information. How can someone
know if a favorite portal site is making a nanobuck in sales
commission every time the person buys something at the florist
featured on the page? Comments from people who are either touting
or trashing a stock on the Web for their own financial gain have
been investigated repeatedly by the federal government. And is that
medical information on that site underwritten by a drug company or
by someone on drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Research specialists agree on the importance of determining who
finances a site and what profit motives may be at work. While the
boundary between news material and advertising is fairly clearly
marked in many print publications, on the Web the signals pointing
to paid content are often subtle or nonexistent, or vary widely
from site to site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's practice is only the most visible of many
arrangements between Internet companies _ including one involving
The New York Times. The Web site of The Times includes, on book
review pages, links to Barnesandnoble.com; The Times receives
commissions from the resulting sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, off-line retail stores _ including bookstores and
groceries _ have long accepted pay for product placement. And being
a knowledgeable consumer is important on line as well as off line.
</P>
<P>
   At Time Warner's Pathfinder Network, Andrew Weil's theories on
vitamins and health are used to create a profile of your vitamin
needs and _ surprise, surprise _ sell you vitamins at the end
(cgi.pathfinder.com/drweil/vitaminprofiler).
</P>
<P>
   Or consider www.smokefreekids.com, which presents all kinds of
information on smoke-free dining and how to kick the nicotine habit
_ and won't let visitors miss out on the opportunity to buy No
Smoke software to quit smoking. Even outright spoofs can deceive
the unwary Web traveler. Take the case of a site posted through
Mankato State University by people fed up with the cold winters.
The Mankato, Minn., Home Page advertised sunny beaches, an
underwater city and whale watching on the Minnesota River
(www.lme.mankato.msus.edu/mankato/mankato.html) Deep at the bottom
of the disclaimer page one finds: ``Mankato, as portrayed on these
pages, DOES NOT EXIST! PLEASE do not come here to see these
sites.'' Er, sights. (Of course, anybody looking at a map would
probably be suspicious about the site's statement that ``the winter
temperature in many Mankato neighborhoods has never dropped below a
balmy 70 degrees!'')
</P>
<P>
   That Mankato site ``has caused some bad publicity for us,'' said
Maureen Gustafson, head of the Mankato Area Chamber and Convention
Bureau. ``There was a guy who drove here from Canada with his son
who was really ticked,'' she said. ``And another one from Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote the site's creator a letter _ which he later posted,
to her dismay _ suggesting that he and his companions go play with
Game Boys rather than undercut the city's promotional efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites appear designed to mislead or even intercept
surfers, sometimes for political reasons. For instance, to counter
what it calls intentionally misleading information, Amnesty
International, the human rights group, has posted
www.amnesty.org/tunisia, which includes point-by-point refutations
of the site at www.amnesty-tunisia.org, which Amnesty calls
``official Tunisian Internet propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Internet addresses of the pages are, of course, very close,
adding to the confusion. But most surfers who wanted impartial
information about Tunisia would perhaps choose not to rely on a
site that prominently features a quotation from the president of
Tunisia, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium where truth is so elusive, medical misinformation is
all too easy to find. Beth Mark, a librarian at Messiah College in
Grantham, Pa., said a friend had sent her husband, Ken, an article
from a commercial Web site (munkey.com/health/markle.html) about
the health risks of the artificial sweetener aspartame.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, a diabetic, had recently suffered a mini-stroke, and he
became worried after reading in the article that aspartame in the
sodas he drinks could cause numbness, a claim that is generally not
supported by scientific studies, although other questions have been
raised about aspartame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sensational and contains unfounded claims regarding
aspartame causing symptoms of MS, numbness, etc.,'' Mrs. Mark said
of the article, via e-mail. Soon after, a senior medical adviser to
the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Dr. David Squillacote, posted a
refutation of the article's claims (www.msfacts.org/aspartame.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Cestone, head of the library and media department at the
Pelham Memorial High School and Middle School in Pelham, N.Y.,
teaches students how to evaluate Web sources for their research
papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find sites like the University of Pennsylvania Cancer
Center, and you know that's good solid information, but then you'll
find a paper done by some 10th grader as a project, and he's
created a Web page from it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, anyone with an Internet service provider and a
quarter to call it can set up a Web page that looks as official as
a 1040 form, without the quality control that used to come from
editors, fact checkers and large publishing houses. There are few
barriers to bad information on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to publish a book that says 2 plus 2 equals 5,
you had to go through a lot of effort and spend a great deal of
money,'' said Tara Calishain, co-author of ``The Official Netscape
Guide to Internet Research'' (International Thomson Publishing,
1998). ``But the cost of putting up a Web page saying 2 plus 2
equals 5 is virtually nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Genie Tyburski, a law librarian in Philadelphia, runs a site
about reliable research on line (www.virtualchase.com), which
includes pointers on how to avoid being duped. ``Many of us who are
my age, 41, grew up trusting print,'' she said. ``If we read it, it
must have been true. We translate that same comfort to the Web,
where it's much more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a Web site about the medical uses of marijuana that
had been run from a man's personal home page. It included copies of
articles from medical journals but no mention of permission to
reproduce them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the technology of the Web, there's no barrier to
editing,'' she said. ``An entire interview reproduced in the
article on the bogus site was not in the original article at all,
and there were graphs to support certain statements that weren't in
the original article.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Rosenberger, a computer security expert, set up a Web site
to dispel myths about computer viruses (www.kumite.com). ``I just
claim to be unaligned, but how do you know that?'' Rosenberger said
in an interview. To encourage critical thinking, he has a link on
his site titled ``Learn About Rob Before You Start Taking His
Advice,'' which dares people to treat his writing with the same
skepticism he brings to virus scares.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is hard to know who is paying whom for what kind
of Internet presence. ``There are the ones we know about, like
Amazon.com, which got caught,'' Rosenberger said. ``But there are
unscrupulous people in the securities industry who are trying to
pump up or drive down stocks, to buy at low prices and sell at high
prices, who may not be disclosing their fiduciary interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People send out spams on the greatest IPO on the Internet this
year, or trash an IPO that's going to occur, so they can get in at
the low end,'' Rosenberger said. ``We know that goes on, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilster, the author of ``Digital Literacy,'' said Internet users
need to be trained to triangulate in on the truth. ``We need to set
up content evaluation as part of the intellectual superstructure
here and explain it to kids,'' he said, ``so we end up with
students who can use the Web intelligently and know when to cast
grave doubt on a particular Web site. People have to be their own
editors and take that upon themselves. Once you begin doing that,
the habits become second nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But some questions about the validity of Web sources are
impossible to answer beyond a reasonable doubt without stepping
outside the hermetic box of the Internet. In such cases, no
combination of pixels is sure to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to check citations, your librarian is your best
friend,'' Ms. Calishain said. ``There's a lot of stuff on line, but
working with librarians is one of best things you can do with
research. They're trained to classify information, and they can
help you out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that many librarians are learning to navigate
the world of the Web, and they may just point an information-hungry
consumer elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cestone, the Pelham school librarian, said she worked hard
teaching students how to evaluate what might be the best resource
for a given research problem. ``It may be the Internet is the best
resource, or maybe a book, or maybe a person will be the best
resource,'' she said.

CAN'T GET THAT PAPER? TRY ITS SITE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was growing up a newspaper buff, there was no greater joy
than to take my allowance money to what was known as the
Out-of-Town news stand in Times Square. Spilling out of this
long-gone kiosk were newspapers from Topeka to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Though a similar store still exists in the neighborhood (the
resourceful Hotalings on W. 42nd St. between Broadway and Sixth),
because of the Internet you no longer need to live in New York to
keep up with the out of town news.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web it's possible to keep up with the news in every
corner of the planet from any corner of the planet. Whether it's a
shark-fishing ban in Tonga (www.tongatimes.com), or rugby scores in
New Zealand (www.evpost.co.nz/), the Internet's out-of-town
newsstand gives you the world, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   To get started, the American Journalism Review's Newslink
(http://ajr.newslink.org/searchn.html) lists 4,925 newspapers on
line, categorized by continent, content, and frequency of
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Other gateways for the the wanderlustful news junkie include
(www.Newsdirectory.com), which lists 7,500 newspapers and magazines
with English-language on line content, and the Kidon Media List
www.dds.nl/kidon/media-link/papers.shtml, which is especially
useful if you read the local languages and want to scan through 9
papers in Minsk or 10 in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   The stories to be found in these newspapers give a glimpse of
the world beyond what's available from major news outlets, print or
otherwise. The Yemen Times (www.yementimes.com), for instance, an
independent weekly published in Sanaa, the capital, did a
resourceful job a few weeks ago in presenting the context for the
recent kidnapping and disastrous rescue of British and Australian
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But even more interesting was a deeply personal letter from the
paper's editor, answering a government accusation that he was
``working for Western intelligence agencies, international Zionism,
and the Masonic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Katmandu, the Nepal News web site (www.nepalnews.com) offers
a news digest from various Nepali outlets, links to more than a
dozen of Himalayan nation's individual periodicals, the local top
music hits, a weather page, and an astrology package.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist in The Independent (www.south-asia.com/independent)
in Katmandu recently sneeringly accused a journalist from a rival
paper of writing an ``advertorial'' in favor of a controversial
hotel project, saying that it amounted to ``a desecration of the
opinion page.''
</P>
<P>
   Less contentious, perhaps, is the astrology page
(www.nepalnews.com/zodiac.htm), which offers horoscopes with a
fascinating twist: Based on the Nepalese Lunar calendar, one's
zodiac sign is determined not by birth date, but by the first two
letters of one's name.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of Australian newspapers on line. But why visit
Sydney or Melbourne when you can call up the 7,000-circulation
twice-weekly, 108-year-old Murray Pioneer?
(www.riverland.net.au/pioneer).
</P>
<P>
   Murray is a small town in an agricultural region, which is why
one story, ``California Citrus Freeze to Help Prices,'' may have
been particularly relevant to local readers.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you go, you can't avoid crime. The Haveeru Daily
on line (www.haveeru.com/english/index.html), in the Indian Ocean's
remote Maldives islands, told of an expatriate Sri Lankan hotel
employee who was stabbed to death after an alcohol-fueled argument
with a fellow resort worker.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans had ever heard of the Falklands Islands in the
South Atlantic until Great Britain, which owns the islands, and
Argentina, which claims sovereignty, resorted to war in 1982 to
resolve their dispute. The Falkland Islands News Network
(www.sartma.com), which includes the Teaberry Express, the
Antarctic Sentinel, and the Falkland Islands Newsletter, will bring
you up to speed if you wonder what's been going on in the Falklands
since then.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to know that the 12th West Falkland Ram and Fleece
show was a resounding success, and that Main Point Farm won first
prize in the Full Wool Ram Hoget category.
</P>
<P>
   Near the North Pole, nearly close enough to hail Santa, are the
Inuit people of the Canadian central and eastern Arctic. The
Nunatsiaq News (www.nunatsiaq.com), published weekly since 1993,
offers a link in which you can download the Nunacom font to view
the text in the Inuktituit language.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the English content these last few months has dealt with
the forthcoming political transition to self-government for the
Inuit.
</P>
<P>
   Want to buy a Corolla in Andorra? Try the classifieds of Diari
d'Andorra (www.solucions.ad/Diari/clas/classi.html). But there's a
catch; Diari doesn't have an English edition. (This is one of the
realities of exploring distant countries.) So if you want to
haggle, you had better speak Catalan.

EVALUATING PENTIUM III: YOU SAY YOU WANT EVOLUTION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers based on the new Pentium III microprocessor are now in
the stores, and that is happy news indeed for anyone shopping for a
new PC _ not necessarily because the Pentium III is a such a great
chip, although this third iteration does have its charms.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the arrival of the Pentium III's is welcome because it
means that prices for most lesser PCs are going to come down soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III's have a slight speed advantage over the Pentium
II's that they will eventually replace. The Pentium III's also work
with a new set of instructions that can be used by software makers
to improve the performance of multimedia applications, especially
speech recognition, digital photo editing, streaming audio and
video over networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the speed gains of this first batch of Pentium III's are
incremental compared with the Pentium IIs, and the software that
will fully exploit the parallel processing power of the new
instructions is going to dribble out over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   By the time such software is widely available, perhaps six
months from now, and by the time a critical mass of Internet Web
sites have set up new features to take advantage of the added
power, Intel will have switched to a new manufacturing process that
will greatly increase the speed of future Pentium III's well beyond
the current levels.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Pentium III is an evolutionary advance over the
Pentium II, not a revolutionary one. Intel will promote it with a
$300 million advertising budget, the most ever spent to market a
microprocessor, so the evolution will definitely be televised. But
they can start this evolution without me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going wait a while until there is a compelling reason to
upgrade. In general, I upgrade when I can answer ``yes'' to any or
all of the following: (1) Will the new machine provide me an
immediate 50 percent improvement in performance over what I am
using today? (2) Is the old machine o annoying that it causes me to
have facial tics? (3) Did I just win the lottery.?
</P>
<P>
   Experienced PC users have also learned that it is wise to wait a
few months after any new technology, hardware or software, is first
put on sale. Although the Pentium III uses the same core as the
Pentium II, Intel thought that it was different enough to warrant a
new number. Remember, the early bird gets the bugs as well as the
worm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another incentive to wait is the tempest over Intel's
decision to add a unique Processor Serial Number identifier to
every new Pentium III chip. Intel added the feature in the interest
of improving security and privacy, a company spokesman said, but
some privacy watchdog groups say that feature threatens privacy of
protecting it. The debate is still under way. More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the best thing about the debut of the Pentium III is that
computer makers will cut the prices of machines based on the older
Pentium II and Celeron chips. The Celeron, especially the faster
versions of it, represents the best value among Intel's chips for
home PC users.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium II's are a good value for business applications, and
Intel cut prices for the chips by 15 percent to 20 percent earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's main rival in the PC microprocessor competition,
Advanced Micro Devices, just introduced its own challenger to the
Pentium III, called the K6-3. AMD has vowed to keep its chip prices
25 percent below Intel's, so when Intel cuts prices, AMD cuts
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In January, more AMD-based PCs were sold at retail than
Intel-based PCs, the first time that had happened.
</P>
<P>
   In short, basic PC prices are going to drop across the board in
the months ahead. Since most people do not need the special power
of the Pentium III _ need, as opposed to want _ they can take
advantage of the better deals ahead on Celeron, Pentium II and
AMD-based machines.
</P>
<P>
   The faster versions of these chips will perform almost as well
on common business applications _ word processing, e-mail,
spreadsheets, data bases and the like _ as the Pentium IIIs.
According to PC Week Labs, the Pentium III offers a performance
advantage of no more than 8 percent for common business
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if your favorite business application involves
pulping the guy in the next cubicle in a Quake death match over the
company network, you will definitely want a Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If you spend most of your day designing new 3-D molecules,
working with Adobe Photoshop files, downloading audio and video
files from the net, relying on voice recognition software to get
your work done, or playing games with 3-D graphics, a computer
based on the 500-megahertz version of the Pentium III offers
immediate performance improvements.
</P>
<P>
   For those who demand immediate gratification and cannot wait,
the two Pentium III 500-MHz systems I like best are the Dell
Dimension XPS T-500 (for its superior value) and the Sony PCV-L600
(for its innovating styling). I did not test the Gateway
Performance 500GN, which has been praised by other testing
laboratories as the best system for game players.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell system cost $2,398 and came with 128 megabytes of RAM,
a 12.9- gigabyte hard drive, a 16MB high-end graphics card, a 4.8X
DVD drive with a decoder card for watching movies, a 17-inch Sony
Trinitron monitor, a premium Altec Lansing sound system with a
subwoofer bigger and heavier than the computer itself, a Zip drive,
Microsoft Office, and the usual standard features.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony, also known as the VAIO Slimtop LCD Computer, had less
impressive technical specs and performance compared with the Dell,
and it cost more: $2,999. But for people who want 500-MHz Pentium
III power in a stylish, compact system that will fit on the
smallest desk, the Sony, with its flat-panel monitor, is the way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   The first practical demonstration of the new power of the
Pentium III that I was able to test was on the Sharper Image's Web
site (www.sharperimage.com), the gadget store. There, thanks to the
new processing power of the Pentium III chip, I was able to call up
a three-dimensional image of a nose-hair trimmer. Using mouse
commands, I rotated the gizmo swiftly and smoothly so that I could
see it from any angle, and even zoom in on details.
</P>
<P>
   Although a 3-D image of a ``nose-hair groomer'' is a humble
start, it was the first peek at the future of electronic commerce,
when people will be able to see how a sweater, for example, looks
from the back, or in a different color.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where the Processor Serial Number comes in. The PSN
is a unique identifier that is burned into the Pentium III chip,
the silicon equivalent of a Social Security Number. Intel says the
PSN is a security feature that is designed to help computer network
administrators to keep out unauthorized users, and help banks and
merchants cut down on fraud in electronic commerce transactions.
</P>
<P>
   On the darker side, the unique identifier could make it possible
to track individual machines _ in effect, individuals _ when they
are on line, whether posting messages to a political or health news
group, downloading dirty pictures, or shopping on line.
</P>
<P>
   Intel asserts that the computer owner can choose whether the PSN
is ``on'' or ``off,'' in effect denying Web sites the ability to
read the PSN automatically. Several programming experts counter
that they can read the PSN remotely, using clever hacks, even if
the owner has the PSN feature turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Intel acknowledges that its safeguards are not 100 percent
effective, given that a malicious hacker could in theory sneak a
peek at the number when it is turned ``off'' by surreptitiously
planting a Trojan Horse program on the user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   But if a hacker went to that much trouble, the PSN would be the
last thing I would worry about. I would be more concerned about my
e-mail, my Quicken files and other private data.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has indicated that it plans to extend the PSN feature to
its entire product line over time. I'll wait for even better
machines and better assurances of privacy.

NEW YORK URGED TO OVERHAUL HARSH DRUG LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A coalition of liberals and conservatives,
clerics and children is urging major changes in New York's drug
laws, which critics say have swamped prisons without stopping the
narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, politicians, judges and advocates have
called for changes to the 26-year-old laws that mandate prison
sentences of at least 15 years for offenders caught possessing or
selling relatively small amounts of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the largest and most diverse group to date clamoring
for change, officials believe 1999 is ripe for overhauling the
laws. On Tuesday, more than 500 people from different backgrounds
and all corners of the state rallied at the Capitol to deliver a
stinging attack on the laws.
</P>
<P>
   The laws have ``not solved drugs on your streets,'' said liberal
Assemblyman Jeffrion Aubry of Queens, who introduced a bill last
month to repeal the mandatory sentencing requirements. Aubry said
the tough sentences merely warehouse people in prison without
curbing either the demand or supply of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Enacted in 1973, the laws were Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's
response to a burgeoning narcotic problem. At the time, the
Republican governor was angling for a spot on a presidential
ticket. Now, however, criminologists almost uniformly say the tough
sentencing laws have failed to achieve their goal and have
succeeded only in crowding New York's prisons with nonviolent
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are beginning to draw comparisons between
Rockefeller's political ambitions and those of the current
Republican governor, George Pataki, who is also seeking a national
spotlight. When he came into office in 1995, Pataki called for
changes to the Rockefeller laws _ a proposal he has now all but
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In) the vast majority of these cases, the person sentenced
has a long record or has been involved in massive amounts of drug
peddling,'' Pataki said earlier this week. ``So we're always
willing to look at proposals, but I haven't seen one yet that we're
prepared to support.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, more than 23,000 state prison inmates were
serving sentences for drug offenses, at a cost of $2 billion
annually, according to the Correctional Association of New York.
Two years ago, according to the advocacy group, 80 percent of drug
offenders sent to prison were never convicted of a violent felony.
And 17 percent of them had no prior felony arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Republican-controlled Senate appears ready to change
the laws. Sen. John DeFrancisco, a conservative from Syracuse, has
introduced a bill that would double the quantity of drugs that
would have to be sold or possessed before the tougher terms kick
in. And Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno of Brunswick said it
made more sense to fight addiction with treatment than
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the name of the game would be ... to get people rehab,
treatment ... not just to put people away and lock them up,'' Bruno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Howard Hubbard of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany
described the laws as ``harsh statutes'' that ``keep addicts who
offer no threat to the community incarcerated for unduly long
periods of time with no opportunity for effective treatment and
with no significant benefit to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Also calling for change are Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, who in
her State of the Judiciary address last month, proposed giving
judges the discretion to cut mandated sentences by two-thirds in
appropriate cases, and Court of Appeals Judge Joseph Bellacosa.
Bellacosa, considered one of the most law-and-order jurists on the
court, recently characterized the Rockefeller approach to the drug
problem as an ``utterly failed and disastrous ... experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling testimony so far came Tuesday from
10-year-old Lisa Oberg, whose mother, Arlene, was imprisoned on a
20 years-to-life sentence shortly before Lisa was born. Lisa has
never lived with her mother and only sees her four times a year.
She will be 20 by the time her mother, a first-time, nonviolent
offender, is eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am speaking to the other victims of this law _ the kids,''
said Lisa, who lives in Brooklyn with her grandmother. ``Because
they need their parents as much as I need mine.''

   Nikki Mahaffey e-mails looking for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to have the recipe for cheese and cauliflower
soup that is served at the tearoom in Antiques &AMP; Moore antique mall
in Arlington (Texas). Over the Christmas holiday, I took my
8-year-old granddaughter there for a special grandma/granddaughter
outing and she said the soup was so good we'd have to get seconds.
(This from a child who does not like cauliflower.) I would love to
be able to make it for her on her next visit to Grandma's house.''
</P>
<P>
   For being such a good grandma, here's the recipe, courtesy of
Doris Perritt and Helen Bowers, who manage The Rose Garden Tea
Room.

   On the Friday before Valentine's Day, Ricardo Aguero walked into
the Madison Avenue Bookshop and picked up ``Here Is My Heart,'' a
book of poetry, as a gift for his wife, Lynn Hackstaff.
</P>
<P>
   When she joined him for a late lunch, she, too, handed him a
gift, nicely wrapped, obviously a book. A researcher at a surgical
clinic, she had gone to the bookstore between patients that day and
bought the same volume for him.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who met in an online chat room, had been married for
only five months and both were surprised, and pleased, that they
knew each other's tastes so well. Should they return one of the
books? If so, which one? The result: The twin volumes are cozily
nudging each other on the bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I took a bus to Manhattan that dropped me and my cane
off on an upstairs platform at the Port Authority terminal, so I
sent my granddaughter ahead to see if the escalator was working.
</P>
<P>
   While I waited, a gentleman paused beside me and the following
exchange occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``See, I use a cane, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Well, they help get us where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He, leaning forward confidentially: ``I'm 90 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, triumphantly: ``I'm 91{ years old.''
</P>
<P>
   He lightly planted a kiss on my cheek and departed.
</P>
<P>
   I was giggling when my granddaughter returned. Of course she
wanted to know why. I described the episode and her response was
``He's got some nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, she's not even 30, and she's a feminist to boot.

   Two first-graders were walking down the stairs at their school.
Tia Biasi heard one say to the other: ``It's like yogurt. You don't
have to buy the fat, because it's free. You just have to buy the
yogurt.''

   Two well-dressed businessmen were striding purposefully up
Eighth Avenue in Chelsea when they came upon a large flock of
pigeons feasting on bread crumbs that someone had scattered on the
corner. Sean O'Malley, who was nearby, heard one of them say to the
other, ``Oh, excuse me a second!'' The man then made his way into
the midst of the pigeons, bent low, hands on knees, and asked,
``Any messages?''

   Marilynne Blakely was window shopping from her car when she
spotted a yellow spring suit. Shortly afterward, she made her first
visit to the shop, which happened to be a favorite of her mother's
friends. She asked the saleswoman the fabric of the suit _ it was
polyester. The saleswoman, noticing Mrs. Blakely's disappointment,
quickly added, ``Our ladies don't like to wrinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   I have recently been reminiscing about Second Avenue when I
lived there as a child in the 1930s. We lived behind our jewelry
store on Second, between 78th and 79th streets. A theater was on
the corner of 79th, sometimes playing talkies and sometimes silent
films. Jimmy, the manager, would let us in free. Sometimes we would
swipe sweet peas from a store down the street and then run for our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Avenue El roared and clattered overhead. We could
converse only between trains. The sun that peeked through the
tracks and railway ties danced wildly on the cobblestones below
whenever a train passed by.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked all the way down Second Avenue to where everything
seemed to converge, I believed that was the edge of the world, and
if I could only stand on top of a ladder on one of the rooftops, I
could touch the sky.
</P>

<P>
   A very elderly woman was walking ahead of Helene Bell in the
cosmetics department at Bloomingdale's. A saleswoman carrying a
tray of ``free gift with purchase'' products approached the woman
and asked if there was anything she would like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely offer, but I don't need anything at the
moment,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The saleswoman replied: ``That's no problem. Our products have a
shelf life of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman smiled at her. ``The difficulty is, I'm not sure of my
shelf life,'' she said.

   David B. Angerman, like everyone else, has heard New York
described as Fun City. Still, when he saw the sign at the 86th

uninterested in participating in the fun had been taken into
consideration. The sign read:
</P>
<P>
   No Fun
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

   It was a typical Saturday morning at a Bronx neighborhood
supermarket. Ed Gruber was waiting his turn and observing Irving,
the counterman, who was seemingly frenetic but totally in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else?'' Irving asked an indecisive shopper. ``I don't
know,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a special on smoked sturgeon,'' he announced. There was
a long pause. ``Is it fresh?'' she asked. ``As fresh as a smoked
sturgeon can be, lady.'' he replied. She finally made up her mind:
``All right, give me six slices.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving was waiting for that. ``We ain't got no more,'' he said.

   &UR; BATHROOM PERSONALITY DISORDERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  Being the
perceptive folks that you are, you probably figured out long ago
that the ongoing marital war over which way to hang the toilet
paper roll is symbolic of larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of person who prefers the paper to roll over
the top, then you are an outgoing, free-spending type who gets his
kicks trying to sneak 11 items through the 10-items-or-less line at
the grocery story; if you are the kind of person who prefers the
paper to roll from the bottom, then you are a naturally suspicious
sort who vacuums his house three times a day and thinks Jerry
Springer is god.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Farrell, a Bergen County, N.J., psychologist who
apparently has a lot of free time between patients, told the
Wireless Flash News Service that bathrooms reveal a lot about your
personality.
</P>
<P>
   No, this does not mean that your bathroom is doing unauthorized
interviews with People magazine while you're sleeping. At least I
hope not. It means that your bathroom is a reflection of who you
are.
</P>
<P>
   Our 12-year-old boy's bathroom, for example, reflects a person
who loves the color and texture of fluoride toothpaste so much that
he has decided to cover the walls with it. His bathroom also
reveals a promising future in the field of microbiology, judging by
mold cultures growing in the bottom of his drinking cup.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't need a trained psychologist to analyze the
bathroom of a 12-year-old boy. In fact, you'd probably have trouble
finding one who would agree to go near such a place, even at the
exorbitant rates psychologists charge.
</P>
<P>
   But bathrooms can tell you more than the fact that you're a
slob. According to Dr. Farrell, if you scrub your tile with a
toothbrush, line up all your medicine bottles in a perfect row and
keep 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand, then you are probably an
anxious type who needs to control people. (One might argue that
someone who keeps 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand needs to control
something besides other people, but let us move on.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decorate your bathroom with lots of mirrors so you can
see yourself at every angle, you're probably vain and possibly an
exhibitionist, according to Dr. Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   (If you have lots of mirrors but they're all splattered with
shaving cream and toothpaste, then you're that most unhappy of all
combinations: a vain exhibitionist who happens to be a slob.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farrell did not explain the psychological ramifications of
leaving the toilet seat up or down, and just as well as far as I'm
concerned because way too much has been said on this subject
already. The way I look at it, couples who bicker about this need
to start cheating on one another and/or smoking crack so they have
something more interesting to argue about.
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish Dr. Farrell's research (assuming she did any and
wasn't simply making the whole thing up for a reporter's benefit),
but I think a more useful study would be of bathrooms shared by a
man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   I have no data to support this, but I'm willing to bet that
sharing a bathroom is one of the leading causes of divorce. Take
the subject of guest towels, for instance. A guy's definition of a
guest towel is ``a towel on which you should wipe your hands, like
maybe after working on the lawnmower or something,'' whereas a
woman's definition of a guest towel is ``a decorative piece of
cloth that looks like a towel but really isn't and is not to be
used by anyone, including guests.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue alone would take up a whole book, and I haven't even
mentioned those annoying fuzzy covers that women like to put on the
toilet tank.

   Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says many muscles
in camp are sore. It confused us. We thought the new catcher was
Ben Gay.

   ``America,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``has always risen to great

</P>
<P>
   The Clintons cut short their Utah vacation. We don't know why,
but probably not to get back to watch all the Monica interviews on
their home TV.
</P>
<P>
   While Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea skied in Utah, Mr.
Clinton stayed in to read. No wonder. He's been on enough of a
downhill run lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for anything anymore,'' Mr. Clinton says. Not
after winning the presidency three times _ twice by a vote of the
people, once by a vote of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   From what we can tell, for Chelsea Clinton's recent 19th
birthday, her folks didn't buy her a copy of Monica Lewinsky's new
book.
</P>
<P>
   California's governor has made Mr. Clinton an honorary citizen
of the state for visiting there 43 times as president. Is that why
he's always asking if the coast is clear?
</P>
<P>
   The president is right to worry about little kids being safe in
the back seats of moving cars. But what about teen-agers in the
back of parked cars?
</P>

   &UR; MARRIAGE HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One day, a man walks into a dentist's office and asks how much
it will cost to extract wisdom teeth.
</P>
<P>
   `Eighty dollars,` the dentist says.
</P>
<P>
   `That's a ridiculous amount,` the man says. `Isn't there a
cheaper way?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` the dentist says, `if you don't use an anaesthetic, I
can knock it down to $60.`
</P>
<P>
   `That's still too expensive,` the man says.
</P>
<P>
   `Okay,` says the dentist. `If I save on anesthesia and simply
rip the teeth out with a pair of pliers, I could get away with
charging $20.`
</P>
<P>
   `Nope,` moans the man, `it's still too much.`
</P>
<P>
   `Hm,` says the dentist, scratching his head. `If I let one of my
students do it for the experience, I suppose I could charge you
just $10.`
</P>
<P>
   `Marvelous,` says the man, `book my wife for next Tuesday!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OOPS! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man walks along a lonely beach. Suddenly he hears a deep
voice: DIG!
</P>
<P>
   He looks around: nobody's there. `I am having hallucinations,`
he thinks. Then he hears the voiceagain: I SAID, DIG !
</P>
<P>
   So he starts to dig in the sand with his bare hands, and after
some inches, he finds a small chest with a rusty lock.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: OPEN!
</P>
<P>
   Ok, the man thinks, let's open the thing. He finds a rock with
which to destroy the lock, and when the chest is finally open, he
sees a lot of gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: TO THE CASINO!
</P>
<P>
   Well the casino is only a few miles away, so the man takes the
chest and walks to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: ROULETTE!
</P>
<P>
   So he changes all the gold into a huge pile of roulette tokens
and goes to one of the tables where the players gaze at him with
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: 27!
</P>
<P>
   The man takes the whole pile and drops it at the 27. The table
nearly bursts. Everybody is quiet when the croupier throws the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The ball stays at the 26.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: OOOPS!

<P>
   On the Friday before Valentine's Day, Ricardo Aguero walked into
the Madison Avenue Bookshop and picked up ``Here Is My Heart,'' a
book of poetry, as a gift for his wife, Lynn Hackstaff.
</P>
<P>
   When she joined him for a late lunch, she, too, handed him a
gift, nicely wrapped, obviously a book. A researcher at a surgical
clinic, she had gone to the bookstore between patients that day and
bought the same volume for him.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who met in an online chat room, had been married for
only five months and both were surprised, and pleased, that they
knew each other's tastes so well. Should they return one of the
books? If so, which one? The result: The twin volumes are cozily
nudging each other on the bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I took a bus to Manhattan that dropped me and my cane
off on an upstairs platform at the Port Authority terminal, so I
sent my granddaughter ahead to see if the escalator was working.
</P>
<P>
   While I waited, a gentleman paused beside me and the following
exchange occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``See, I use a cane, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Well, they help get us where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He, leaning forward confidentially: ``I'm 90 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, triumphantly: ``I'm 91{ years old.''
</P>
<P>
   He lightly planted a kiss on my cheek and departed.
</P>
<P>
   I was giggling when my granddaughter returned. Of course she
wanted to know why. I described the episode and her response was
``He's got some nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, she's not even 30, and she's a feminist to boot.

   Two first-graders were walking down the stairs at their school.
Tia Biasi heard one say to the other: ``It's like yogurt. You don't
have to buy the fat, because it's free. You just have to buy the
yogurt.''

   Two well-dressed businessmen were striding purposefully up
Eighth Avenue in Chelsea when they came upon a large flock of
pigeons feasting on bread crumbs that someone had scattered on the
corner. Sean O'Malley, who was nearby, heard one of them say to the
other, ``Oh, excuse me a second!'' The man then made his way into
the midst of the pigeons, bent low, hands on knees, and asked,
``Any messages?''

   Marilynne Blakely was window shopping from her car when she
spotted a yellow spring suit. Shortly afterward, she made her first
visit to the shop, which happened to be a favorite of her mother's
friends. She asked the saleswoman the fabric of the suit _ it was
polyester. The saleswoman, noticing Mrs. Blakely's disappointment,
quickly added, ``Our ladies don't like to wrinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   I have recently been reminiscing about Second Avenue when I
lived there as a child in the 1930s. We lived behind our jewelry
store on Second, between 78th and 79th streets. A theater was on
the corner of 79th, sometimes playing talkies and sometimes silent
films. Jimmy, the manager, would let us in free. Sometimes we would
swipe sweet peas from a store down the street and then run for our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Avenue El roared and clattered overhead. We could
converse only between trains. The sun that peeked through the
tracks and railway ties danced wildly on the cobblestones below
whenever a train passed by.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked all the way down Second Avenue to where everything
seemed to converge, I believed that was the edge of the world, and
if I could only stand on top of a ladder on one of the rooftops, I
could touch the sky.

   A very elderly woman was walking ahead of Helene Bell in the
cosmetics department at Bloomingdale's. A saleswoman carrying a
tray of ``free gift with purchase'' products approached the woman
and asked if there was anything she would like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely offer, but I don't need anything at the
moment,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The saleswoman replied: ``That's no problem. Our products have a
shelf life of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman smiled at her. ``The difficulty is, I'm not sure of my
shelf life,'' she said.

   David B. Angerman, like everyone else, has heard New York
described as Fun City. Still, when he saw the sign at the 86th

uninterested in participating in the fun had been taken into
consideration. The sign read:
</P>
<P>
   No Fun
</P>
<P>

   It was a typical Saturday morning at a Bronx neighborhood
supermarket. Ed Gruber was waiting his turn and observing Irving,
the counterman, who was seemingly frenetic but totally in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else?'' Irving asked an indecisive shopper. ``I don't
know,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a special on smoked sturgeon,'' he announced. There was
a long pause. ``Is it fresh?'' she asked. ``As fresh as a smoked
sturgeon can be, lady.'' he replied. She finally made up her mind:
``All right, give me six slices.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving was waiting for that. ``We ain't got no more,'' he said.

   &UR; BATHROOM PERSONALITY DISORDERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  Being the
perceptive folks that you are, you probably figured out long ago
that the ongoing marital war over which way to hang the toilet
paper roll is symbolic of larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of person who prefers the paper to roll over
the top, then you are an outgoing, free-spending type who gets his
kicks trying to sneak 11 items through the 10-items-or-less line at
the grocery story; if you are the kind of person who prefers the
paper to roll from the bottom, then you are a naturally suspicious
sort who vacuums his house three times a day and thinks Jerry
Springer is god.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Farrell, a Bergen County, N.J., psychologist who
apparently has a lot of free time between patients, told the
Wireless Flash News Service that bathrooms reveal a lot about your
personality.
</P>
<P>
   No, this does not mean that your bathroom is doing unauthorized
interviews with People magazine while you're sleeping. At least I
hope not. It means that your bathroom is a reflection of who you
are.
</P>
<P>
   Our 12-year-old boy's bathroom, for example, reflects a person
who loves the color and texture of fluoride toothpaste so much that
he has decided to cover the walls with it. His bathroom also
reveals a promising future in the field of microbiology, judging by
mold cultures growing in the bottom of his drinking cup.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't need a trained psychologist to analyze the
bathroom of a 12-year-old boy. In fact, you'd probably have trouble
finding one who would agree to go near such a place, even at the
exorbitant rates psychologists charge.
</P>
<P>
   But bathrooms can tell you more than the fact that you're a
slob. According to Dr. Farrell, if you scrub your tile with a
toothbrush, line up all your medicine bottles in a perfect row and
keep 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand, then you are probably an
anxious type who needs to control people. (One might argue that
someone who keeps 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand needs to control
something besides other people, but let us move on.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decorate your bathroom with lots of mirrors so you can
see yourself at every angle, you're probably vain and possibly an
exhibitionist, according to Dr. Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   (If you have lots of mirrors but they're all splattered with
shaving cream and toothpaste, then you're that most unhappy of all
combinations: a vain exhibitionist who happens to be a slob.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farrell did not explain the psychological ramifications of
leaving the toilet seat up or down, and just as well as far as I'm
concerned because way too much has been said on this subject
already. The way I look at it, couples who bicker about this need
to start cheating on one another and/or smoking crack so they have
something more interesting to argue about.
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish Dr. Farrell's research (assuming she did any and
wasn't simply making the whole thing up for a reporter's benefit),
but I think a more useful study would be of bathrooms shared by a
man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   I have no data to support this, but I'm willing to bet that
sharing a bathroom is one of the leading causes of divorce. Take
the subject of guest towels, for instance. A guy's definition of a
guest towel is ``a towel on which you should wipe your hands, like
maybe after working on the lawnmower or something,'' whereas a
woman's definition of a guest towel is ``a decorative piece of
cloth that looks like a towel but really isn't and is not to be
used by anyone, including guests.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue alone would take up a whole book, and I haven't even
mentioned those annoying fuzzy covers that women like to put on the
toilet tank.

   &UR; MARRIAGE HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One day, a man walks into a dentist's office and asks how much
it will cost to extract wisdom teeth.
</P>
<P>
   `Eighty dollars,` the dentist says.
</P>
<P>
   `That's a ridiculous amount,` the man says. `Isn't there a
cheaper way?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` the dentist says, `if you don't use an anaesthetic, I
can knock it down to $60.`
</P>
<P>
   `That's still too expensive,` the man says.
</P>
<P>
   `Okay,` says the dentist. `If I save on anesthesia and simply
rip the teeth out with a pair of pliers, I could get away with
charging $20.`
</P>
<P>
   `Nope,` moans the man, `it's still too much.`
</P>
<P>
   `Hm,` says the dentist, scratching his head. `If I let one of my
students do it for the experience, I suppose I could charge you
just $10.`
</P>
<P>
   `Marvelous,` says the man, `book my wife for next Tuesday!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OOPS! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man walks along a lonely beach. Suddenly he hears a deep
voice: DIG!
</P>
<P>
   He looks around: nobody's there. `I am having hallucinations,`
he thinks. Then he hears the voiceagain: I SAID, DIG !
</P>
<P>
   So he starts to dig in the sand with his bare hands, and after
some inches, he finds a small chest with a rusty lock.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: OPEN!
</P>
<P>
   Ok, the man thinks, let's open the thing. He finds a rock with
which to destroy the lock, and when the chest is finally open, he
sees a lot of gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: TO THE CASINO!
</P>
<P>
   Well the casino is only a few miles away, so the man takes the
chest and walks to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: ROULETTE!
</P>
<P>
   So he changes all the gold into a huge pile of roulette tokens
and goes to one of the tables where the players gaze at him with
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: 27!
</P>
<P>
   The man takes the whole pile and drops it at the 27. The table
nearly bursts. Everybody is quiet when the croupier throws the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The ball stays at the 26.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: OOOPS!

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday before Valentine's Day, Ricardo Aguero walked into
the Madison Avenue Bookshop and picked up ``Here Is My Heart,'' a
book of poetry, as a gift for his wife, Lynn Hackstaff.
</P>
<P>
   When she joined him for a late lunch, she, too, handed him a
gift, nicely wrapped, obviously a book. A researcher at a surgical
clinic, she had gone to the bookstore between patients that day and
bought the same volume for him.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who met in an online chat room, had been married for
only five months and both were surprised, and pleased, that they
knew each other's tastes so well. Should they return one of the
books? If so, which one? The result: The twin volumes are cozily
nudging each other on the bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I took a bus to Manhattan that dropped me and my cane
off on an upstairs platform at the Port Authority terminal, so I
sent my granddaughter ahead to see if the escalator was working.
</P>
<P>
   While I waited, a gentleman paused beside me and the following
exchange occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``See, I use a cane, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Well, they help get us where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He, leaning forward confidentially: ``I'm 90 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, triumphantly: ``I'm 91{ years old.''
</P>
<P>
   He lightly planted a kiss on my cheek and departed.
</P>
<P>
   I was giggling when my granddaughter returned. Of course she
wanted to know why. I described the episode and her response was
``He's got some nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, she's not even 30, and she's a feminist to boot.
</P>
<P>
   _ HORTENSE GUTMANN
</P>
<P>
   Two first-graders were walking down the stairs at their school.
Tia Biasi heard one say to the other: ``It's like yogurt. You don't
have to buy the fat, because it's free. You just have to buy the
yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Two well-dressed businessmen were striding purposefully up
Eighth Avenue in Chelsea when they came upon a large flock of
pigeons feasting on bread crumbs that someone had scattered on the
corner. Sean O'Malley, who was nearby, heard one of them say to the
other, ``Oh, excuse me a second!'' The man then made his way into
the midst of the pigeons, bent low, hands on knees, and asked,
``Any messages?''
</P>
<P>
   THE JEALOUS GOD
</P>
<P>
   Marilynne Blakely was window shopping from her car when she
spotted a yellow spring suit. Shortly afterward, she made her first
visit to the shop, which happened to be a favorite of her mother's
friends. She asked the saleswoman the fabric of the suit _ it was
polyester. The saleswoman, noticing Mrs. Blakely's disappointment,
quickly added, ``Our ladies don't like to wrinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   I have recently been reminiscing about Second Avenue when I
lived there as a child in the 1930s. We lived behind our jewelry
store on Second, between 78th and 79th streets. A theater was on
the corner of 79th, sometimes playing talkies and sometimes silent
films. Jimmy, the manager, would let us in free. Sometimes we would
swipe sweet peas from a store down the street and then run for our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Avenue El roared and clattered overhead. We could
converse only between trains. The sun that peeked through the
tracks and railway ties danced wildly on the cobblestones below
whenever a train passed by.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked all the way down Second Avenue to where everything
seemed to converge, I believed that was the edge of the world, and
if I could only stand on top of a ladder on one of the rooftops, I
could touch the sky.
</P>
<P>
   _ EMANUEL BERGER
</P>
<P>
   A very elderly woman was walking ahead of Helene Bell in the
cosmetics department at Bloomingdale's. A saleswoman carrying a
tray of ``free gift with purchase'' products approached the woman
and asked if there was anything she would like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely offer, but I don't need anything at the
moment,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The saleswoman replied: ``That's no problem. Our products have a
shelf life of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman smiled at her. ``The difficulty is, I'm not sure of my
shelf life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David B. Angerman, like everyone else, has heard New York
described as Fun City. Still, when he saw the sign at the 86th
Street subway station, he was pleased to know that residents
uninterested in participating in the fun had been taken into
consideration. The sign read:
</P>
<P>
   No Fun
</P>
<P>
   Pass
</P>
<P>
   Sold Here
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical Saturday morning at a Bronx neighborhood
supermarket. Ed Gruber was waiting his turn and observing Irving,
the counterman, who was seemingly frenetic but totally in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else?'' Irving asked an indecisive shopper. ``I don't
know,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a special on smoked sturgeon,'' he announced. There was
a long pause. ``Is it fresh?'' she asked. ``As fresh as a smoked
sturgeon can be, lady.'' he replied. She finally made up her mind:
``All right, give me six slices.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving was waiting for that. ``We ain't got no more,'' he said.

   &UR; BATHROOM PERSONALITY DISORDERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  Being the
perceptive folks that you are, you probably figured out long ago
that the ongoing marital war over which way to hang the toilet
paper roll is symbolic of larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of person who prefers the paper to roll over
the top, then you are an outgoing, free-spending type who gets his
kicks trying to sneak 11 items through the 10-items-or-less line at
the grocery story; if you are the kind of person who prefers the
paper to roll from the bottom, then you are a naturally suspicious
sort who vacuums his house three times a day and thinks Jerry
Springer is god.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Farrell, a Bergen County, N.J., psychologist who
apparently has a lot of free time between patients, told the
Wireless Flash News Service that bathrooms reveal a lot about your
personality.
</P>
<P>
   No, this does not mean that your bathroom is doing unauthorized
interviews with People magazine while you're sleeping. At least I
hope not. It means that your bathroom is a reflection of who you
are.
</P>
<P>
   Our 12-year-old boy's bathroom, for example, reflects a person
who loves the color and texture of fluoride toothpaste so much that
he has decided to cover the walls with it. His bathroom also
reveals a promising future in the field of microbiology, judging by
mold cultures growing in the bottom of his drinking cup.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't need a trained psychologist to analyze the
bathroom of a 12-year-old boy. In fact, you'd probably have trouble
finding one who would agree to go near such a place, even at the
exorbitant rates psychologists charge.
</P>
<P>
   But bathrooms can tell you more than the fact that you're a
slob. According to Dr. Farrell, if you scrub your tile with a
toothbrush, line up all your medicine bottles in a perfect row and
keep 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand, then you are probably an
anxious type who needs to control people. (One might argue that
someone who keeps 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand needs to control
something besides other people, but let us move on.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decorate your bathroom with lots of mirrors so you can
see yourself at every angle, you're probably vain and possibly an
exhibitionist, according to Dr. Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   (If you have lots of mirrors but they're all splattered with
shaving cream and toothpaste, then you're that most unhappy of all
combinations: a vain exhibitionist who happens to be a slob.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farrell did not explain the psychological ramifications of
leaving the toilet seat up or down, and just as well as far as I'm
concerned because way too much has been said on this subject
already. The way I look at it, couples who bicker about this need
to start cheating on one another and/or smoking crack so they have
something more interesting to argue about.
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish Dr. Farrell's research (assuming she did any and
wasn't simply making the whole thing up for a reporter's benefit),
but I think a more useful study would be of bathrooms shared by a
man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   I have no data to support this, but I'm willing to bet that
sharing a bathroom is one of the leading causes of divorce. Take
the subject of guest towels, for instance. A guy's definition of a
guest towel is ``a towel on which you should wipe your hands, like
maybe after working on the lawnmower or something,'' whereas a
woman's definition of a guest towel is ``a decorative piece of
cloth that looks like a towel but really isn't and is not to be
used by anyone, including guests.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue alone would take up a whole book, and I haven't even
mentioned those annoying fuzzy covers that women like to put on the
toilet tank.

   Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says many muscles
in camp are sore. It confused us. We thought the new catcher was
Ben Gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``has always risen to great
causes.'' Also to a few that would bore even Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons cut short their Utah vacation. We don't know why,
but probably not to get back to watch all the Monica interviews on
their home TV.
</P>
<P>
   While Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea skied in Utah, Mr.
Clinton stayed in to read. No wonder. He's been on enough of a
downhill run lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for anything anymore,'' Mr. Clinton says. Not
after winning the presidency three times _ twice by a vote of the
people, once by a vote of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   From what we can tell, for Chelsea Clinton's recent 19th
birthday, her folks didn't buy her a copy of Monica Lewinsky's new
book.
</P>
<P>
   California's governor has made Mr. Clinton an honorary citizen
of the state for visiting there 43 times as president. Is that why
he's always asking if the coast is clear?
</P>
<P>
   The president is right to worry about little kids being safe in
the back seats of moving cars. But what about teen-agers in the
back of parked cars?
</P>
<P>
   Two senators say Y2K problems probably are manageable. And,
anyway, we have to get past Y2K before we can worry about Y2.1K,
Y2.2K and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says the season
should be exciting. Especially if rookies keep trying to steal
already occupied bases.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has waived a five-year waiting period to start the
process of declaring Mother Teresa a saint. Apparently there's been
no similar demand among Protestants for the Rev. Henry Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOMS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three mothers are sitting on a park bench in Miami Beach talking
about how much their sons love them.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie says, `You know the Chagall painting hanging in my living
room? My son, Arnold, bought that for me for my 75th birthday. What
a good boy he is and how much he loves his mother.`
</P>
<P>
   Minnie says, `You call that love? You know the Eldorado Cadillac
I just got for Mother's Day? That's from my son Bernie. What a
doll.`
</P>
<P>
   Shirley says, `That's nothing. You know my son Stanley? He's in
analysis with a psychoanalyst on Park Ave. Five session a week. And
what does he talk about? Me.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TWO KIDS TALKING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Did you hear about the two little kids in a hospital who were
lying next to each other? The first kid leans over and asked, `What
are you in here for?` The second kid said,` I'm in here to get my
tonsils out and I'm alittle nervous.`
</P>
<P>
   The first kid said,` You've got nothing to worry about, I had
that done to me once. They put you to sleep and when you wake up
they give youlots of Jell-O and ice cream. It's a piece of cake!`
</P>
<P>
   The second kid then asked, `What are you in here for?` The first
kid responded, `Well, I'm here for a circumcision.` The second kid
said, `Whoa! I had that done when I was born. I couldn't walk for a
year!`

of them as they reached 55, and stayed with them as they sped up to
70.

charging $20.`
</P>
<P>
   `Nope,` moans the man, `it's still too much.`
</P>
<P>
   `Hm,` says the dentist, scratching his head. `If I let one of my
students do it for the experience, I suppose I could charge you
just $10.`

</P>
<P>
   Ok, the man thinks, let's open the thing. He finds a rock with
which to destroy the lock, and when the chest is finally open, he
sees a lot of gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: TO THE CASINO!
</P>
<P>
   Well the casino is only a few miles away, so the man takes the
chest and walks to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: ROULETTE!
</P>
<P>
   So he changes all the gold into a huge pile of roulette tokens
and goes to one of the tables where the players gaze at him with
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: 27!

   He lightly planted a kiss on my cheek and departed.

   I was giggling when my granddaughter returned. Of course she
wanted to know why. I described the episode and her response was
``He's got some nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, she's not even 30, and she's a feminist to boot.

   Two first-graders were walking down the stairs at their school.

   Two well-dressed businessmen were striding purposefully up
Eighth Avenue in Chelsea when they came upon a large flock of
pigeons feasting on bread crumbs that someone had scattered on the
corner. Sean O'Malley, who was nearby, heard one of them say to the
other, ``Oh, excuse me a second!'' The man then made his way into
the midst of the pigeons, bent low, hands on knees, and asked,
``Any messages?''

   Marilynne Blakely was window shopping from her car when she
spotted a yellow spring suit. Shortly afterward, she made her first
visit to the shop, which happened to be a favorite of her mother's
friends. She asked the saleswoman the fabric of the suit _ it was
polyester. The saleswoman, noticing Mrs. Blakely's disappointment,
quickly added, ``Our ladies don't like to wrinkle.''

   I have recently been reminiscing about Second Avenue when I
lived there as a child in the 1930s. We lived behind our jewelry
store on Second, between 78th and 79th streets. A theater was on
the corner of 79th, sometimes playing talkies and sometimes silent
films. Jimmy, the manager, would let us in free. Sometimes we would
swipe sweet peas from a store down the street and then run for our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Avenue El roared and clattered overhead. We could
converse only between trains. The sun that peeked through the
tracks and railway ties danced wildly on the cobblestones below
whenever a train passed by.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked all the way down Second Avenue to where everything
seemed to converge, I believed that was the edge of the world, and
if I could only stand on top of a ladder on one of the rooftops, I
could touch the sky.

   A very elderly woman was walking ahead of Helene Bell in the

and asked if there was anything she would like to buy.

<P>
   ``It's a lovely offer, but I don't need anything at the
moment,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The saleswoman replied: ``That's no problem. Our products have a
shelf life of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman smiled at her. ``The difficulty is, I'm not sure of my

   ``We got a special on smoked sturgeon,'' he announced. There was
a long pause. ``Is it fresh?'' she asked. ``As fresh as a smoked
sturgeon can be, lady.'' he replied. She finally made up her mind:
``All right, give me six slices.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving was waiting for that. ``We ain't got no more,'' he said.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Filiberto and Obdulia Rios sit side-by-side
in antique chairs, two of the most prized possessions of their
daughter-in-law Yolanda.
</P>
<P>
   They look out a picture window on Ryan Place Drive in one of
Fort Worth's most historic neighborhoods, as they talk about their
family, their tailoring business, and the life they've pieced
together through three decades of hard work in this city.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sunday morning, and the house fills with the chatter and
laughter of their three children, seven grandchildren and some
family friends. The smell of bacon and barbacoa drifts into the
room from the kitchen. It's a warm, happy, brick home with hardwood
floors and modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing like the place in their native Mexico that
Filiberto, 60, and Obdulia, or Lula, 58, remember now. In 1965,
they lived with their three small children in a two-room shack in
the border town of Acuna, Mexico, where in winter months they
nearly froze from the cold. The $20 a week that Filiberto made from
his small tailoring business barely began to meet the family's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Filiberto's youngest brother, Jose, wrote to the
couple from Fort Worth, urging them to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Filiberto said the decision was not hard. ``I never felt at home
in Mexico,'' he recalls. ``I didn't see any future for my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, with a 15-day work permit, Filiberto came to Fort Worth
and stayed far beyond the time allowed by the law. After six
months, he sent for his family to join him, betting on an uncertain
future.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rios family joined the increasing number of Hispanics
who come to Texas each year to find a new life, to find hope for
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hispanics make up 28 percent of the state's population.
If current trends continue, say demographers, in 30 years, families
like the Rioses are expected to make up almost half of the Texas
population.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, then, the faces of la familia Rios are not only
the faces of the Texas of today, but the faces of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   After securing his 15-day permit, Filiberto Rios packed his 1946
blue Chevy and made the 12-hour trek to Fort Worth in 1965, leaving
behind his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   While life still proved hard initially, Filiberto's income more
than tripled to $65 a week when he began work at Caudle's, a
menswear store on Camp Bowie Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, that was a lot of money,'' Filiberto says.
</P>
<P>
   Just half a year later, with a promise from his employer that he
could keep his job, Filiberto sent for his family. They came with
just the clothes on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we could get only a 15-day permit,'' Filiberto says.
``To bring more than that, would have placed suspicion on us.
Besides, we really didn't have more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   His eldest son, Edward, was 4; his daughter Edith was 3 and
Filiberto Jr. was 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on the city's north side in an old dilapidated
house. The rent was $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year was very tough,'' Filiberto recalls. ``We had
less than most people who said they were poor.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the family was here illegally after the 15-day
permit had run out, Rios had the added expense of sending young
Edward to a private Catholic school. A year later, the family
applied for and was granted permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Rios says he was determined to provide for his family, to
nurture his dream of opening his own business. His first priority
was to save enough to buy a home. By limiting the family's spending
to the bare necessities over the next three years, he had the $600
down payment for a house he'd set his sights on. The mortgage
payment was $55 a month.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Filiberto had found another day job at R.E. Cox's
department store on West Berry Street. At night, when he wasn't
attending school to learn to speak English, he took in extra work
from customers he met at Cox's. Lula was also attending night
classes and learned more about the tailoring business. Whenever
they could, the two stayed up late, making alterations in the
family's garage.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, Filiberto reached the goal he had had since his
childhood: Tailoring by Rios opened at 6918 Camp Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The three generations of the Rios family gather almost every
day, either at work at the shop, or to visit and eat, as they do
here at Edward's home in Ryan Place.
</P>
<P>
   Amid laughter, Lee Sanchez, a family friend, wonders aloud how
they spend so much time together and remain successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with him 24 hours a day,'' said Lula Rios, referring to
Filiberto.
</P>
<P>
   A slow, silent grin stretches across his face and Filiberto
responds: ``She's very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky or not, Edward Rios said that what has happened for his
family is nothing short of amazing.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of business, Tailoring by Rios has developed an
impressive list of commercial clients, including Banana Republic,
The Wardrobe, John L. Ashe and Harolds, while keeping many of its
original customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the success has been hard-won. Edward Rios says he abandoned
his dream of becoming an accountant to help his father. Filiberto
Jr. gave up becoming an auto mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the two sons and daughter Edith, who has an associate
degree in business, take on various duties at the shop. Edith, 38,
manages the business office; Filiberto Jr., 37, oversees the
commercial accounts and deliveries; and Edward, 39, is the general
manager. The two brothers also do most of the fittings and
alterations. The siblings' seven children, who range in age from 7
to 17, are also there to help on most weekends, answering the
phone, sweeping the floor or taking out the trash.
</P>
<P>
   The store is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, but Filiberto Sr.
often shows up on Sundays and Mondays to do general maintenance on
the machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more work than money,'' said Edward Rios, ``but it's a
decent living for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his family's future, Edward remains optimistic, sure now of
the dream his father once bet on. It's ``better than the lottery _
because with hard work, you can't miss,'' he said.

<P>
   &UR; BATHROOM PERSONALITY DISORDERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  Being the
perceptive folks that you are, you probably figured out long ago
that the ongoing marital war over which way to hang the toilet
paper roll is symbolic of larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of person who prefers the paper to roll over
the top, then you are an outgoing, free-spending type who gets his
kicks trying to sneak 11 items through the 10-items-or-less line at
the grocery story; if you are the kind of person who prefers the
paper to roll from the bottom, then you are a naturally suspicious
sort who vacuums his house three times a day and thinks Jerry
Springer is god.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Farrell, a Bergen County, N.J., psychologist who
apparently has a lot of free time between patients, told the
Wireless Flash News Service that bathrooms reveal a lot about your
personality.
</P>
<P>
   No, this does not mean that your bathroom is doing unauthorized
interviews with People magazine while you're sleeping. At least I
hope not. It means that your bathroom is a reflection of who you
are.
</P>
<P>
   Our 12-year-old boy's bathroom, for example, reflects a person
who loves the color and texture of fluoride toothpaste so much that
he has decided to cover the walls with it. His bathroom also
reveals a promising future in the field of microbiology, judging by
mold cultures growing in the bottom of his drinking cup.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't need a trained psychologist to analyze the
bathroom of a 12-year-old boy. In fact, you'd probably have trouble
finding one who would agree to go near such a place, even at the
exorbitant rates psychologists charge.
</P>
<P>
   But bathrooms can tell you more than the fact that you're a
slob. According to Dr. Farrell, if you scrub your tile with a
toothbrush, line up all your medicine bottles in a perfect row and
keep 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand, then you are probably an
anxious type who needs to control people. (One might argue that
someone who keeps 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand needs to control
something besides other people, but let us move on.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decorate your bathroom with lots of mirrors so you can
see yourself at every angle, you're probably vain and possibly an
exhibitionist, according to Dr. Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   (If you have lots of mirrors but they're all splattered with
shaving cream and toothpaste, then you're that most unhappy of all
combinations: a vain exhibitionist who happens to be a slob.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farrell did not explain the psychological ramifications of
leaving the toilet seat up or down, and just as well as far as I'm
concerned because way too much has been said on this subject
already. The way I look at it, couples who bicker about this need
to start cheating on one another and/or smoking crack so they have
something more interesting to argue about.
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish Dr. Farrell's research (assuming she did any and
wasn't simply making the whole thing up for a reporter's benefit),
but I think a more useful study would be of bathrooms shared by a
man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   I have no data to support this, but I'm willing to bet that
sharing a bathroom is one of the leading causes of divorce. Take
the subject of guest towels, for instance. A guy's definition of a
guest towel is ``a towel on which you should wipe your hands, like
maybe after working on the lawnmower or something,'' whereas a
woman's definition of a guest towel is ``a decorative piece of
cloth that looks like a towel but really isn't and is not to be
used by anyone, including guests.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue alone would take up a whole book, and I haven't even
mentioned those annoying fuzzy covers that women like to put on the
toilet tank.

Clinton stayed in to read. No wonder. He's been on enough of a
downhill run lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for anything anymore,'' Mr. Clinton says. Not
after winning the presidency three times _ twice by a vote of the
people, once by a vote of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   From what we can tell, for Chelsea Clinton's recent 19th
birthday, her folks didn't buy her a copy of Monica Lewinsky's new
book.
</P>
<P>
   California's governor has made Mr. Clinton an honorary citizen
of the state for visiting there 43 times as president. Is that why
he's always asking if the coast is clear?
</P>
<P>
   The president is right to worry about little kids being safe in
the back seats of moving cars. But what about teen-agers in the
back of parked cars?
</P>
<P>
   Two senators say Y2K problems probably are manageable. And,
anyway, we have to get past Y2K before we can worry about Y2.1K,
Y2.2K and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says the season
should be exciting. Especially if rookies keep trying to steal
already occupied bases.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has waived a five-year waiting period to start the
process of declaring Mother Teresa a saint. Apparently there's been
no similar demand among Protestants for the Rev. Henry Lyons.

   Three mothers are sitting on a park bench in Miami Beach talking
about how much their sons love them.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie says, `You know the Chagall painting hanging in my living
room? My son, Arnold, bought that for me for my 75th birthday. What
a good boy he is and how much he loves his mother.`
</P>
<P>
   Minnie says, `You call that love? You know the Eldorado Cadillac
I just got for Mother's Day? That's from my son Bernie. What a
doll.`
</P>
<P>
   Shirley says, `That's nothing. You know my son Stanley? He's in
analysis with a psychoanalyst on Park Ave. Five session a week. And
what does he talk about? Me.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TWO KIDS TALKING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Did you hear about the two little kids in a hospital who were
lying next to each other? The first kid leans over and asked, `What
are you in here for?` The second kid said,` I'm in here to get my
tonsils out and I'm alittle nervous.`
</P>
<P>
   The first kid said,` You've got nothing to worry about, I had
that done to me once. They put you to sleep and when you wake up
they give youlots of Jell-O and ice cream. It's a piece of cake!`
</P>
<P>
   The second kid then asked, `What are you in here for?` The first
kid responded, `Well, I'm here for a circumcision.` The second kid
said, `Whoa! I had that done when I was born. I couldn't walk for a
year!`
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A woman walked into the pet store. `I haven't got much money,`
she told the clerk, `so I'd like to know if you've any kittens
you'll let go cheap.`
</P>
<P>
   `I'd let them, ma'am,` said the clerk, `but they prefer to go
meow.`

</P>
<P>
   Zack and his mule were walking down the road when one of Zack's
friends drove up and offered him a ride to town. Zack got into the
truck while his mule ran along behind. The mule was right in back
of them as they reached 55, and stayed with them as they sped up to
70.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm worried about your mule,` said the driver. `his tongue's
hanging out.`
</P>
<P>
   `Which way?` asked Zack.
</P>
<P>
   `Left,` his friend said.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, stay in this lane - he's about to pass.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARRIAGE HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One day, a man walks into a dentist's office and asks how much
it will cost to extract wisdom teeth.
</P>
<P>
   `Eighty dollars,` the dentist says.
</P>
<P>
   `That's a ridiculous amount,` the man says. `Isn't there a
cheaper way?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` the dentist says, `if you don't use an anaesthetic, I
can knock it down to $60.`
</P>
<P>
   `That's still too expensive,` the man says.
</P>
<P>
   `Okay,` says the dentist. `If I save on anesthesia and simply
rip the teeth out with a pair of pliers, I could get away with
charging $20.`
</P>
<P>
   `Nope,` moans the man, `it's still too much.`
</P>
<P>
   `Hm,` says the dentist, scratching his head. `If I let one of my
students do it for the experience, I suppose I could charge you
just $10.`
</P>
<P>
   `Marvelous,` says the man, `book my wife for next Tuesday!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OOPS! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man walks along a lonely beach. Suddenly he hears a deep
voice: DIG!
</P>
<P>
   He looks around: nobody's there. `I am having hallucinations,`
he thinks. Then he hears the voiceagain: I SAID, DIG !
</P>
<P>
   So he starts to dig in the sand with his bare hands, and after
some inches, he finds a small chest with a rusty lock.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: OPEN!
</P>
<P>
   Ok, the man thinks, let's open the thing. He finds a rock with
which to destroy the lock, and when the chest is finally open, he
sees a lot of gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: TO THE CASINO!
</P>
<P>
   Well the casino is only a few miles away, so the man takes the
chest and walks to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: ROULETTE!
</P>
<P>
   So he changes all the gold into a huge pile of roulette tokens
and goes to one of the tables where the players gaze at him with
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: 27!
</P>
<P>
   The man takes the whole pile and drops it at the 27. The table
nearly bursts. Everybody is quiet when the croupier throws the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The ball stays at the 26.
</P>
<P>
   The deep voice says: OOOPS!

BEHIND THE TOUR DE FRANCE, AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ian Austen, a writer and amateur racing cyclist, has covered the
Tour de France and other major races.  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Greg LeMond showed that an American could win the Tour de
France, following professional cycle racing from the United States
was a desperate business. Race results from the tour and other
races like the Giro D'Italia and the Tour of Flanders typically
came weeks, if not months, late through the pages of outrageously
overpriced European magazines like the old Miroir du Cyclisme.
</P>
<P>
   LeMond's extraordinary success _ he won the Tour de France three
times, first in 1986 _ unquestionably increased cycling coverage,
both in print and on television. But despite that, timely reporting
remained largely concentrated on just the Tour de France. Now the
Web has changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   Through a variety of sources, American fans are now being
informed as quickly and almost as well as their European
counterparts. All that is lacking now is live, full-motion video;
Web experiments last year by France 3, one of the two broadcasters
of the Tour de France in its homeland, suggest that some form of
that may not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   That may put fans ahead of the cycling press. The dirty secret
of covering the Tour de France, which I have done, is that the
journalists rarely see the racers in action. Instead, they crowd
into French cars for hours of white-knuckle driving through huge
crowds ahead of the racers to catch the finish of the race on
television. Be grateful: no Web site recreates that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More Cycling Sites &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.cyclingnews.com Commonly known as Bill's, for Bill Mitchell,
the economist who founded it, this Australian site relies on more
than 50 volunteers to gather race results from around the world. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.procycling.com A British site with daily news on
road-racing, track and cyclo-cross, an off-road running and riding
competition. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.fatnick.com A British site with complete results on six-day
track racing, a sport Americans once dominated. The site's name is
a reference to its creator, Nick Rosenthal, an amateur racer from
Manchester who calls himself ``horribly unfit.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.lancearmstrong.com The online diary of Lance Armstrong, only
the second American world road-race champion, and his wife,
Kristin. Armstrong has recovered from testicular cancer, and last
season he showed in several races he's still among the world's best
cyclists. The coming weeks will presumably be centered on
Armstrong's recovery from a dislocated collarbone he recently
suffered. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Official Tour de France &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.letour.fr &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's doping scandal _ with police raids and riders'
strikes _ wasn't exactly an image builder for France's greatest
annual sports ritual. But the Tour de France remains cycling's most
watched and most important event.
</P>
<P>
   While Web sites have become standard features of most sporting
events, the Societe du Tour de France took to the Web relatively
early and has become a model for many race organizations.
</P>
<P>
   American cycling fans, unlike much of the world, cannot catch
the tour live on television. But once again this July, the site
will offer continual text updates in English and French and still
photos during each of the 21 racing days.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the site, the live reports came from
writers who were clearly more comfortable with a language other
than English. That changed last year when James Startt, an American
cycling journalist based in France, began preparing the English
dispatches. He also winds up the day with a newspaper-style report.
</P>
<P>
   Slackers who go to the tour site while they are supposed to be
working can activate a tiny window with a rolling race update in a
corner of their monitor while ostensibly dealing with, say, a
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, if the tour organization keeps its promises, Web
visitors will be as well informed as the team managers, journalists
and others roaring along the actual race route by car. The Web site
will include a direct audio feed of Radio Tour, an internal radio
network that describes the action by using a team of motorcycle
spotters and officials in the race director's car.
</P>
<P>
   Its commentary _ in French, sometimes awkward English and
Spanish _ is understated in the extreme. ``The main pack is
accelerating,'' is about as colorful as the commentary gets,
unless, of course, there's a crash. And listeners who do not want
to be baffled must print out the race start sheet from the site in
advance because Radio Tour refers to riders by their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes details about each day's route, archived
results from every stage of tours since 1995, a searchable history
section, a ``great moments'' area and regular news updates through
the season on the teams that qualify for the race.
</P>
<P>
   The tour organization also runs 13 other events _ including the
famous Paris-Roubaix race over the cobblestones of northern France.
Most of them are covered by the site, but not as grandly as the
main event. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tour Saga &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (World Media Live; $29; Windows 3.1 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the audio effects and striking music that open
this Tour de France history capture the sound of being there. They
are a clever mix of blaring horns, revving motorcycles, roaring
helicopters, buzzy radio transmissions and the unmistakable voice
of Daniel Mangeas, the official race announcer, blasting from
loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the real thing, however, you can shut off the CD-ROMs
sound when the racket becomes overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   This CD-ROM tries hard to make what is essentially a collection
of historical statistics entertaining. And it largely succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The database consists of histories and statistics for every Tour
de France since its start in 1903 up to 1996. With that are
biographies of about 1,000 riders and a large number of photos.
</P>
<P>
   The material is available in French or English and packaged in
several different ways. A banner across the opening page groups the
race history into nine different eras, generally named for the
dominant rider of the time. Individual years can also be selected.
And users can look up a rider and use hyperlinks to get the history
of any year that person rode the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the amount of material presented depends on
how far back you go. The histories of the earliest editions can be
quite brief and the results limited to top placings.
</P>
<P>
   The histories and results from 1981 onward are much more
complete. Those years even begin with a short video commentary by
Stephen Roche, the Irish rider who in 1987 performed the rare feat
of winning the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia and the world road
race championship. Now a television commentator, Roche gives'
introductions that are heavy on personal anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   The excellent and cleanly reproduced historical photographs are
from the archives of Miroir du Cyclisme and its predecessor, Miroir
Sprint. But the 24 videos on the disk are extremely disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The ones covering the tour up until 1981 are mostly Pathe
newsreels, complete with their original staccato French commentary
and furious orchestral music. The newreels condense a month's
racing into a little more than a minute and seemingly always
concluding that the overall winner is indeed a great champion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the transfer to the CD-ROM has left the newsreel
images so muddy and dark that it is often almost impossible to make
out what is happening, let alone distinguish riders. The post-1981
videos show Roche standing in front of a tree recalling his
glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest failing of the Tour Saga is that it cannot be
updated by the user. While it has a link to the producer's European
cycling Web site, Velocity (www.worldmedia.fr/velo), there is no
easy way to download to a hard drive its reports and photos from
the tour since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While several very good books do a better job of capturing the
essence of the race, nothing in English comes close to the Tour
Saga CD-ROM as a reference source. And of course, no book lets you
hear Daniel Mangeas. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Total Cycling Encyclopedia  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Infostrada, $30; Windows 95 and 98.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick: Who won the 1937 edition of Belgium's one-day race known
as the Fleche Wallonne? That's right, it was Adolf Braeckeveldt, a
Belgian who averaged a relatively sedate 18 mph but nevertheless
headed a group of 19 who were the only riders among 84 starters who
made it to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that you don't care about Braeckeveldt, who had only
two victories in his career. But just as baseball breeds a type of
fan for whom no statistic is too obscure, ancient cycling results
have their own following.
</P>
<P>
   Until Infostrada's CD-ROM came along last year, the definitive
sources for settling arguments about riders' performances were
generally two fat books issued annually by publishers in the
Netherlands and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, however, went beyond the careers of current riders,
leaving earlier results to several incomplete and hard-to-obtain
history books, none of which are in English.
</P>
<P>
   The Total Cycling Encyclopedia, by contrast, cannot be accused
of lacking scope. It says it contains 110,000 results dating back
109 years. And it has a Web site link that can update information
with relatively little fuss. All this is produced in eight
languages on a single disk.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who ignore its amateurish graphics will find that the
CD-ROM mostly lives up to its claims. Pull-down menus allow users
to search the data by race, year or rider name.
</P>
<P>
   But the English translations are not always successful. In one
case, the publishers have confused the World Cup, a somewhat
unimportant season-long points competition, with the World
Championships, a prestigious title decided by a one-day race.
</P>
<P>
   An added feature is a package of profiles of notable European
mountain passes. But they are presented as poorly rendered graphs
that offer little sense of the passes' grades; they more closely
resemble charts of Amazon.com's recent share price. (For ordering
information, see the www.sportplaza.com/tce site.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Union Cycliste Internationale  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.uci.ch &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tour de France doping affair, the Union Cycliste
Internationale has become as controversial in many cycling circles
as the International Olympic Committee is in the Olympic community.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is the sport's governing body, so it still sets
the rules, ranks the riders on a complex point scale, organizes the
world championships and tries to promote all things on two wheels.
Its Web site reflects that broad role.
</P>
<P>
   For the championships and mountain bike and road bike World Cup
events, it offers rapid and complete results along with
high-quality photos and sometimes a race report. Similarly, the
riders' points rankings _ which determine, to a large extent, their
pay _ are also available, along with mountains of mind-numbing
rules. You can, for example, try to decipher the union's latest
attempt to standardize frame design.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is too obscure for the UCI. For example, the site
includes a large section on artistic cycling, a sort of figure
skating on bicycles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Velo News Interactive &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.greatoutdoors.com/velonews &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Velo News, based in Boulder, Colo., is not America's largest
cycling magazine. That title belongs to Bicycling. But nothing
matches Velo News in terms of the attention it pays to amateur and
professional racers (both road and mountain biking) in the United
States and their counterparts overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to several experienced contributors, Velo News was the
first American magazine to deliver informed and sometimes critical
reporting on cycling. At its best, the magazine delivers insider
news with outsider independence.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the occasional feature, very little of the magazine's
contents make their way onto the site. The Web version mostly
offers a frequently updated cycling news service along with chat
groups.
</P>
<P>
   This season, for the first time since the magazine went on line,
Velo News has no full-time correspondent based in Europe. The
online director, Tim Johnson, said staff members would travel
overseas for major races. He plans to cover any gaps with Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   The United States-based staff includes John Wilcockson, a
knowledgeable veteran of several cycling publications here and in
Britain. But if too much of the site winds up coming from Agence
France-Presse, Velo News may lose the distinctive style that has
made it a regular stopping point for many cyclists.

CLUES TO SEPARATE GOOD DATA FROM BAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Calif.)   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first rule of information found on the Web (and many other
places as well) is this: be skeptical. You wouldn't buy a stock,
write a check or believe a contentious statement from an unknown
source off line _ so bring the same challenging attitude to
information found on line.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be shy about going off-line to check something: go to
a library, pick up a phone or call your own doctor to check.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a handful of suggestions to help surfers assess
information found on line.
</P>
<P>
   Know the source. If you recognize the source and are sure that
particular source is running the site, you are likely to be on
solid ground. Don't forget, though, that some of the people running
sites are trying to confuse you: www.amnesty-tunisia.org, and
www.amnesty.org/tunisia, for instance, carry opposing messages.
Don't forget that hackers can sometimes commandeer legitimate
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Check to see if the site is objective, or at least takes account
of opposing points of view.
</P>
<P>
   Pay close attention to when a site was most recently updated.
The last revision dates of some sites can be determined via the
Netscape Navigator browser. Click the View option and go to ``Page
Info'' to see information on when the site was last revised. Other
sites have ``last updated'' lines _ which in themselves are, of
course, hard to check.
</P>
<P>
   Gauge a site's credibility by seeing who runs it. To check, go
to rs.internic.net and use the ``whois'' search of the database of
registered domain names run by InterNic, an organization that is
the registry for the most recognized categories of Internet
domains. (Be aware, though, that this information is not
conclusive.) When you have an idea of who runs the site, you can
better judge its information.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to whether a site's address (called a uniform
resource locator, or URL) ends with a .com for commercial, .org
(technically for non-profit organizations), .gov for government,
.net for network or .edu for educational.
</P>
<P>
   While many .edu sites describe bona fide research, others are
individual homepages, with information that is harder to verify. It
is also true that anybody with a little bit of money can get a .org
or .net site, so the suffix is not definitive _ a strip miner could
register lovetheenvironment.org. Foreign websites have different
suffix: .ca for Canada, .ru for Russia and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself if banner advertisements compromise the content of
the page, or lend it credibility, representing an advertiser's
implicit vote of confidence in the site.
</P>
<P>
   If you see a tilde () in a web site's address, that's usually a
sign of a personal home page. The tilde might occur in an .edu
address, suggesting that the page's owner is a professor or student
at a college or university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are they're not a major, major entity,'' said Reva
Basch, author of ``Researching On Line for Dummies'' (Dummies
Technology Press 1998), of tilde site-owners. Often a clue that a
site is a personal page is an address that includes ``geocities,''
``tripod'' or www.members.aol.com/namehere.
</P>
<P>
   If you run across unfamiliar topics or web site authors, run
their names through a search engine or Dejanews.com _ which is a
search engine of news groups _ to see what others have said about
it or them or him or her.
</P>
<P>
   Dejanews is a huge and often highly fractious collection of
personal opinions, some of them highly misleading or
incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Think about contacting a web site owner directly, perhaps using
an e-mail address or phone from the site, or perhaps using the
fruits of your InterNic search.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have doubts about a person's credentials, send him an
e-mail,'' said Paul Gilster, a technology columnist in Raleigh,
N.C., and beware sites that offer no address or do not respond.
``You should be able to use the technology to solve the problem the
technology creates.''
</P>
<P>
   A long and complicated web address is another warning sign, but
someone trying to find out more about a site with an ungainly
address can delete parts of it from right to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm presented with information like that, I always like to
back up level by level, slash by slash and see where I am and what
other information is there like that,'' Ms. Basch said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Quint, editor of Searcher magazine, also sees the value
of exploring a site from top to bottom. ``I'm coming through the
front door,'' she said. ``I want to look around at the building
before I find myself at somebody's broom closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to hyperlinks, the small web addresses appearing
at the bottom of the screen when you move the mouse across a web
page. ``A good page, one using the Internet well, not only has
internal links, but also points outward to other parts of
information,'' Gilster said. ``If I have a good idea, it's to my
advantage for you to look at other ideas, to prove you that mine is
the best. Web pages that are completely inward turning, where all
the information only points to the same server, should raise an
alarm flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilster likes the Northernlight.com search engine, which offers
free searches of magazines, with small fees for viewing entire
articles. By searching for people there, he can confirm that they
have been published in more traditional, edited publications. He
also likes Google.com, a search engine that factors in the number
of other sites linking to it when ranking search results.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Grassian of the UCLA College Library urges surfers to
look for sites that refer to print and other off-line resources.

THE CHIEFTAINS CHARM WITH TRADITIONAL IRISH MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late on a Saturday night in the quiet Irish countryside of the
1940s, a house party jams in an old woman's cottage. The room is
crammed, the music is jaunty jigs and reels, the dancers are
kicking up their heels, their faces flushed with the peat fire's
heat and their own exertion as drink flows and the music plays into
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is right out of an Irish tourism commercial, but for
Paddy Moloney, the founder of The Chieftains, it was regular
entertainment as he spent the summers with his grandmother, Julia
Conroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd dance and sing until 8 a.m. or so and go to Mass, then
everybody would come home, have breakfast and go to bed.'' says
Moloney, who formed the band 36 years ago in Dublin and has since
guided it to six Grammys, including last week's nod for Traditional
Folk Album for the soundtrack to the PBS series ``The Irish in
America: Long Journey Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Saturday nights in Ireland were Moloney's first musical
education. Not only did he hear instrumentals that would inform his
work, but he also heard a cappella ballads such as ``Lowlands of
Holland,'' ``Deserted Soldier'' and ``Raglan Road.'' Now it is
those songs, and others, that form the basis for ``Tears of
Stone,'' the Chieftains' latest CD and their tribute to female
vocalists. The idea was to merge the band's faultless ensemble
playing with different female vocalists _ a combination, Moloney
says, that he has always found intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved female vocalists singing with us,'' he says.
``The blend of vocals is better for me than with male singers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14 songs on ``Tears'' find the band playing subtly, and
often very quietly, as women such as Joni Mitchell, Bonnie Raitt,
Natalie Merchant, Sinead O'Connor and Mary Chapin Carpenter do
ageless songs such as the above, as well as ``A Stor Mo Chroi,
Magdalene Laundries'' and ``Factory Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Moloney actively began approaching singers to
appear on the record. He had a ``wish list'' of several vocalists
(among them O'Connor, Mitchell, and Sarah McLachlan). Once he had
worked through the red tape _ publicists, record companies, etc. _
work on ``Tears'' progressed slowly, with sessions fit in around
the Chieftains' constant road work and the women's schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was worth it. Because female singers dominate the
charts (and the Grammy nominations) at the moment, and because it
features so many popular singers, ``Tears'' is virtually assured of
success. Moloney doesn't make a big deal out of this, but it's
obvious he's happy with the timing. (''If you can't beat them, join
them,'' he says.)
</P>
<P>
   For years the Chieftains put out excellent, insular records of
traditional Irish music, with Moloney's playing on the uilleann
pipes and Matt Molloy's flute firmly anchoring the proceedings.
They became an institution in Ireland by the late '70s and then
began devoting more of their time to soundtrack work. They also
began an ongoing series of collaborative CDs with musicians from
China to Nashville to Spain, highlighting their ability to blend
with different sounds and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But it was 1995's ``The Long Black Veil'' (which paired them
with Sting, Sinead O'Connor, Mark Knopfler, the Rolling Stones, Tom
Jones and several others) that put them on the map. It sold more
than 500,000 copies (a career high and an enormous amount for a
traditional Irish group) and earned the band a Best Pop
Collaboration Grammy for their work with Van Morrison on ``Have I
Told You Lately That I Love You?''
</P>
<P>
   Moloney seems to know that the band needs to get back to simply
recording traditional music on its own, something critics have been
suggesting for years. The band's next CD, due out next year, will
be called ``The Chieftains in Ireland,'' and exactly what the title
implies: The band traveling around the island, digging into the
different regional styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a particular style of playing the fiddle in Kerry, and
up in Galway, 60 or 70 miles away, it's completely different,'' he
says. ``And there's different themes, different battles in
different places people wrote about, different poets who lived in
different parts of the country who wrote songs. You can go on and
on.''

HANOVER'S SNOWY PLAYGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wasn't even in Hanover, N.H., yet, and I already felt I had
escaped New York City. A few days before leaving, I received a
postcard from Pierce's Country Inn, where I had made reservations
for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be serving breakfast,'' read the handwritten note.
``Lots of good places for dinner in town.'' Then it continued in
curly cursive letters with directions to the inn. ``Reg and
Nancy,'' it was signed.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend with the Pierces, I sensed, was going to be too brief.
</P>
<P>
   And there was lots to do in Hanover. Just far enough from the
ski resorts and major tourist sights, this part of New Hampshire is
accessible and affordable (our budget was not to exceed $500).
There is little traffic getting there and almost no pressure to
plan anything, so it's easy to take advantage of its offerings in a
single weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Hanover centers on Dartmouth College. Even for a
tourist, it's inescapable. ``A voice crying in the wilderness,''
the school's motto, is an image embraced by students and town
residents alike. Hiking and cross-country skiing are part of the
daily ritual; Patagonia is the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   And it just so happened that a friend, Matthew, and I planned to
go during the biggest celebration of the season, Winter Carnival.
In addition to the outdoor activities we had in mind, there would
be events at the college _ concerts, campus tours and, of course,
the famous keg-jumping competition, which involves jumping a row of
beer kegs, Evel Knievel-style, on ice skates.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, we drove north from Boston, where it was warm
and balmy. As we passed bare trees and brown woods, my hopes for
snowshoeing and skating sank. We were almost at Hanover, just over
two hours from Boston, before we saw frozen ponds and mountains.
Real mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But when we arrived at Pierce's Country Inn, a red barn-shaped
house high in the hills above Hanover, it was snowy, all right. And
completely silent. The only voices crying in the wilderness were
ours.
</P>
<P>
   The inn seemed closed; no one answered our knocks. Just then, a
car pulled up and out came a man in a Dartmouth sweatshirt.
``They're probably napping,'' he said, as he pushed open the door
and began calling out for Reg and Nancy. A moment later Reg Pierce
appeared, a tall, elderly man, with sharp greyish-blue eyes and
white hair.
</P>
<P>
   He took us to our upstairs room, which was a mild shock to the
system. It had mint green walls and linoleum floors, mismatched
towels _ cream, blue, stripes _ and faded flowered comforters on
the two single beds. (Our bare-bones private bath was also painted
green.) The room's best feature was a view of a forest and a ski
hill no longer used. Luxury it was not, but it was warm and
welcoming, and for $60 a night, there was no real disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy and I are going into town for a few things,'' said
Pierce, ``but we'll be back later and I'll build a fire, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most B&AMP;Bs, there were no signs with rules posted in the
house, and if there were any rules, the Pierces never told us about
them. We felt like guests in their home.
</P>
<P>
   We headed into town to scope out the weekend's activities and
get our bearings. We parked by the large, handsome college green,
where the lines between Dartmouth and the town of Hanover blur.
Surrounding the green are Baker Library, the Hanover Inn and
Hopkins Center, administration and classroom buildings. ``Dartmouth
Row,'' along the east side, is said to be one of the finest groups
of early college buildings in the country. We took a short walk,
passing a fraternity house with men in shorts playing ``beer pong''
(a variation of table tennis in which losers must drink a cup) on
the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Then a car, covered with plywood to look like a tank and painted
black, with two students hanging out the sunroof, rumbled by.
``Death Mobile'' was scrawled on the side. Something was afoot.
Three days before, we later found out, James Wright, the president
of Dartmouth, had announced that the school was planning to make
major changes in the fraternity and sorority system. A black cloud
loomed over the light and festive Winter Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Without enough time to get in any skiing before dinner, we took
a stroll around town and were relieved to learn that our cell
phones didn't work this far north and that Starbucks had not yet
wriggled its way into this small community.
</P>
<P>
   We went to the Hood Museum of Art to see the almost
3,000-year-old low-relief panels from the palace of King
Ashurnasirpal II in what is now Iraq. In the mid-19th century,
British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard discovered the panels and
stripped them from the palace. Dartmouth acquired 6 of the 55
panels exported to the United States. Though small, the museum,
where we paid the suggested donation of $3 each, has the solid
collection of an Ivy League teaching museum with paintings by
Rothko, Claude Lorrain and Picasso. A temporary exhibit with works
by such photographers as Cindy Sherman and Henri Cartier-Bresson
was a welcome surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we walked to Baker Library and descended into the
basement study room. There, covering the walls, are the vibrant
political murals painted by the Mexican artist Jose Clemente Orozco
in the 1930s. And you can enjoy them free.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for a drink. We crossed the main campus green in the
center of which stood a sad and pitted snow sculpture, an
all-too-appropriate symbol of this year's carnival. We ended up at
Zins, a wine bar and restaurant in the Hanover Inn, the old-time,
formal hotel on one side of the green. The menu, which had a
well-balanced list of California wines, offered some wines in
flights. I ordered _ and got carded doing so _ a flight of
sauvignon blancs: from California, France and New Zealand. Matthew
ordered one of red rhone varietals.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to eat an early dinner so we could catch the Winter
Whingding, a performance by a cappella groups at the college. We
had been told Cafe Buon Gustaio, an Italian trattoria in town, was
the restaurant of the moment, so we decided to splurge. Ninety-two
dollars and a lot of melted cheese later, I hoped the restaurant's
moment was passing.
</P>
<P>
   We moved on to the Hopkins Center, where the Rockapellas, one of
Dartmouth's women's a cappella groups, were deep into their
program. (And we were so late they let us in free.) Afterward, we
relaxed by the fire back at Pierce's Inn. The living room, its
ceiling criss-crossed with hand-hewn beams and walls covered with
family photographs, is just as tattered and mismatched as the
bedrooms and just as charming.
</P>
<P>
   There was a note from the Pierces on a yellow pad by the
staircase asking us to cross off our names to let them know we had
returned, followed by ``Sleep well.'' Which we did.
</P>
<P>
   Snow had fallen overnight. At the breakfast table, by a fire
already going strong, Pierce appeared in an apron. He offered us
blueberry or plain pancakes, English muffins or eggs. We chose the
blueberry pancakes, which were fluffy, salty and so filling I
thought for a moment about going back to bed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But we had a busy day planned. First, we stopped in at the 1929
stone building on Occom Pond that houses the Silver Fox rental
shop. Matthew had brought his own skates, so I rented a pair for
$6.
</P>
<P>
   The pond was dotted with skaters: there were mothers pushing
strollers, young kids with helmets waving hockey sticks, even dogs
cautiously roaming the ice. On the shores a handful of people were
busily carving snow sculptures for the Occom Pond party that
afternoon. The theme was dogs. There was a Snoopy atop his doghouse
and an igloo large enough to walk through.
</P>
<P>
   We skated around a few times, then rested on a beat-up sofa on
the ice. Before leaving, we rented cross-country equipment; skis,
poles and boots for 24 hours were just $26.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost time for the legendary keg-jumping competition, so
we hurried into town. When we arrived at Psi Upsilon, though, there
were no signs of kegs or skating surface, just fraternity brothers
gathered in groups in the yard. I asked what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The keg jump has been canceled this year,'' said Mike Rand,
who happened to be president of the fraternity. Instead, they were
going to have a rally. ``It should be good,'' he said.``I mean,
obviously, we'd rather be jumping kegs.''
</P>
<P>
   And we decided we'd rather be exploring Main Street, a short
manageable strip that's uncrowded even on a Saturday afternoon.
Then it was on to the Dirt Cowboy Cafe for a rest and a much-needed
dirt cowboy, an espresso topped with steamed half-and-half _ a
delicious jolt for $1.75.
</P>
<P>
   As we were leaving the cafe we could hear the cries of students
at the Psi Upsilon rally. It was time to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the Connecticut River into Norwich, Vt., a small,
pretty town just over the border. We stopped at Dan &AMP; Whit's
General Store, on Main Street. Inside was an unexpected delight.
Fishing rods, gasoline siphons, pickles and scrapple shared shelf
space with no rhyme or reason. There were suspenders and wines from
Spain, Potato Head and kazoos. And everything was dirt cheap. We
picked up some curiosities: maple syrup, local cheese and boiled
cider.
</P>
<P>
   On our way in we had smelled beer brewing, so before we left, we
tracked it down at the Norwich Inn, which also houses Jasper
Murdock's Alehouse. Starving, we each had a rich, creamy Bally
Shannon dry stout and shared an order of grilled calamari, another
deal for $18. The menu for the main restaurant was so appealing
that we made a reservation for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   On our way back to the Pierces, we stopped along the road at a
golf course, and went cross-country skiing. The conditions were
less than perfect (somewhat icy), and I am a less-than-perfect
cross-country skier, so while Matthew glided along flawlessly, I
spent much of the outing on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   When we returned to the Norwich Inn for dinner, we were reminded
of how small a place we were in. At the next table was the same
family we had sat next to at dinner the night before. Only this
time they were dining with Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon
general who is senior scholar of the Koop Institute at the college.
He was reminiscing about Winter Carnival when he was a student at
Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have huge snow sculptures on the green,'' he said
smiling, ``They used to bring in snow from northern New Hampshire
for it.'' We eavesdropped for a while, then became distracted by
our meal, which was refreshingly good.
</P>
<P>
   I had Wellfleet oysters that tasted like a distillation of the
ocean, and ravioli filled with a puree of Vermont chevre and
sun-dried tomatoes and drizzled with a tarragon oil. Matthew had a
gently peppered lobster bisque and grilled rare venison with yellow
beets and a mustard tarragon oil. The desserts were even better. A
simple raspberry Napoleon, though way out of season, was a perfect
balance of crisp and creamy, and the caramelized crust on the Grand
Marnier creme brulee cracked like ice on a pond.
</P>
<P>
   This was just the beginning of our evening, however. We had to
hustle to the Hopkins Center again _ this time for a jazz concert
with Maria Schneider, a guest composer. After such a serious
dinner, going into a dark concert hall with relaxing music was not
the best idea. We went straight to the Dirt Cowboy Cafe for another
dirt cowboy to wake us up. There was one more event.
</P>
<P>
   We had heard through a friend about a bluegrass band playing in
the neighborhood. Arriving at the house on School Street around 11,
we blended as best we could into the crowd of baggy pants and
baseball caps, even stomaching a little Bud Light from the keg out
in the snowy alley. The band, a group of five college students,
proved to be the best entertainment of the weekend. We lasted until
midnight, then went back to the Pierces and collapsed in bed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, Mrs. Pierce cooked us french toast and bacon
while we told her husband all that we had done during our stay,
including going to Dan &AMP; Whit's. ``That's an institution,'' he
said. ``You've been to Dan &AMP; Whit's, boy, you've seen a real
American classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Boston, we took one more crack at
cross-country skiing. This time we tried the neighbor's field,
suggested by Pierce. As we scaled the hill, an elderly woman
approached us. It was the owner of the property. ``Where you
from?'' she asked. ``New York City,'' I said. She frowned.
``Yuck.'' Just then, her husband staggered out of the woods, his
eyes teary from the cold air and a large pruner over his shoulder.
``We need more tracks on our property,'' he said. ``Go and have a
good time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of welcome we were getting used to in New
Hampshire. And so we continued on.

<P>
   DENVER _ For staying in touch with neighbors around the corner
or even next door, it may come to this: the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver company called E.Central is offering neighborhoods in
11 metropolitan areas access to an Internet tool that residents can
use to communicate among themselves and with local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The system, called Neighborhood Link (www.neighborhoodlink.com),
sets up online neighborhood Web sites that include Web pages for
the neighborhood association and for other groups and individuals,
as well as areas for notices and announcements, newsletters,
interactive discussions and links to various city officials and
departments. It's all easy to use and free.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood Link's oldest site, which opened in October, has
been set up to serve 1,186 neighborhoods in Denver. There are also
sites for the Portland, Ore., area, which also has a site for
Vancouver-Clark County, Wash.; Sacramento, Calif.; San Diego;
Colorado Springs; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Phoenix; Tucson, Ariz.; San
Antonio; the Tampa Bay, Fla., area, which also has a site for
Clearwater-St. Petersburg, and Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are catching on slowly. Ted Pinkowitz, president and
chief executive of E.Central, said that in Denver, 285 neighborhood
associations had begun using their Web pages and that online
discussions were going on at 100 neighborhood sites. Among all the
Web sites, there are discussions at 320 neighborhood pages, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   E.Central, which also has a Denver city guide on line and is an
Internet service provider, plans to provide the neighborhood
service in more than 20 markets by the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind Neighborhood Link is not unique. Local
neighborhood associations and other civic organizations in many
cities use free Web sites provided by nonprofit community networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tons of them,'' said Bruce T. Henderson, director of
the New Media Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The
Seattle Community Network (www.scn.org), for example, lists more
than 100 sites in the Neighborhoods section of its prize-winning
Web site. Such nonprofit networks, often known as freenets, are
commonly financed by grants. A directory of freenets around the
world can be found at www.lights.com/freenet.
</P>
<P>
   But Neighborhood Link differs from the freenets in that it
intends to make money from advertising. ``It's really significant
that they're looking at local advertising because that's really the
franchise of newspapers,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Neighborhood Link's grass-roots contents will attract
enough viewers, and therefore advertisers, to thrive is an open
question, Henderson said. ``It's hard to tell these days what's
going to catch on and what's not,'' he said. Success may depend on
whether volunteers in neighborhood organizations keep the sites
current with content that can draw visitors, he said. Volunteers
called neighborhood coordinators help Neighborhood Link get its
sites up and keep them running.
</P>
<P>
   Six sponsors, including AT&AMP;T and the Conoco oil company, are
advertising on the Denver site. Each paid $30,000 to get its banner
advertisements and links on the neighborhood Web pages for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkowitz's goal, of course, is to draw viewers to attract
advertisers. When the numbers warrant it, Neighborhood Link will
charge much more for advertisements and links than sponsors now
pay, Pinkowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Hudson, a spokesman for Mayor Wellington E. Webb, said
Denver and other local governments thought Neighborhood Link was a
good idea. ``The city is very welcoming of the concept,'' Hudson
said, ``because it's just going to revolutionize the way
neighborhoods and organizations can communicate with the community
and with themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that in poorer neighborhoods, only a small
percentage of homes had computers with Internet access. But he said
the city's 22 branch libraries had computer kiosks where people
could log on to Neighborhood Link. ``I think people will use it,
and they'll use it as a great source of information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan DuBois, chairman of a Denver neighborhood umbrella
organization called Interneighborhood Cooperation, has been an
active advocate of Neighborhood Link.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tremendous idea,'' DuBois said. He said the
network made it easy for his organization to disseminate
information to neighborhoods about zoning changes, new ordinances
or dealing with the city government.
</P>
<P>
   But like many of the sites in Denver's Neighborhood Link system,
Southbridge IIs is just starting to be promoted. Karen Walczak, the
neighborhood coordinator for that site, said most residents did not
learn about the site until December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had good response from people who have looked at it,''
Ms. Walczak said. ``I think people will use the notice board, and
probably the discussion area.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many homes in Ms. Walczak's neighborhood do not have
Internet access, she predicted that the percentage would rise
rapidly. ``In a couple of years, so many people will be on the Web,
this will be a great thing to have,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the cactus fence around his house near Mexico City has
been replanted, its vivid colors restored and offending additions
removed, Diego Rivera can easily be imagined on the third-floor
bridge leading from his red studio to Frida Kahlo's blue studio,
pounding at her glass door and asking his wife's forgiveness. The
life of Rivera, a Rabelaisian omnivore, was a legend wrapped in
scandal surrounded by myth that played against the backdrop of
brightly colored buildings, as if he were a figure walking through
one of his own heroic canvases.
</P>
<P>
   No man is an island, but houses are often worlds unto
themselves, especially the three buildings owned by the Mexican
painters Rivera and Kahlo, together and separately, and designed by
and with the Mexican architect Juan O'Gorman. These buildings, in
the southern suburbs of Mexico City, housed the couple: the paired
red and blue studios they occupied in San Angel from 1932 until
their divorce in 1939; La Casa Azul, or the Blue House, in nearby
Coyoacan, where they lived after their remarriage in 1940 until
Kahlo's death in 1954, and the Aztec-Tolmec house-studio in
Anahuacalli, finished after Rivera's death in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration in 1997 of their San Angel studios means that
the setting for their lives is now fully represented in a
historically accurate cycle of buildings. A biographical
neighborhood of rare character and radical political sensibility,
this Mexican Bloomsbury offers a view into the painters'
relationship and the country's cultural history. Beyond being the
backdrop for a couple with the ideals of cultural revolutionaries
and the mating habits of scorpions, the restoration of the San
Angel studios, along with the other house-museums, reveals a second
history.
</P>
<P>
   The San Angel compound, which marked the operatic birth of
modern architecture in Mexico, was designed in 1930 by O'Gorman,
then 25. The architect came to Rivera's attention after he built
his own simple, glass-fronted modern house in the town. Inspired by
a studio designed by Le Corbusier in Paris, his plan for the
Riveras' studios was more robust and extroverted. The bold volumes,
clay-brick ceilings and cantilevered floors and stairs are
punctuated by proudly displayed water tanks and downspouts. A
southern sun ignites the intense blue and red that are taken
straight from vernacular buildings. Working together, O'Gorman,
Rivera and Kahlo made Mexican modernism, unlike its European
counterpart, warm to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   The modernist imagination has long been a major issue among
artists in Mexico resistant to cultural colonization. The tension
between being Mexican and modern plays itself out in these three
houses belonging to artists whose left-wing politics led them and
their architect to nationalize the International style. In 1922,
Rivera left Paris, where he had befriended Picasso and taken up
Cubism, for a postrevolutionary, socially conscious Mexico. He
turned to a populist realism that mythologized the nation's Indian
past. Even his palette became earthier and brighter, with blood
red, copper brown and the azure of the country's sky. Rivera and
Kahlo's buildings, and even O'Gorman's other designs, moved from
the abstract to the mythic, and the arc of their change starts in
San Angel with the galvanizing blue and red.
</P>
<P>
   Given Rivera's emotional past, crowded with liaisons (including
Paulette Goddard, Louise Nevelson and Frida Kahlo's younger sister,
Cristina), separate studios for the two painters amounted to
spatial wisdom. O'Gorman designed a large glass-walled red studio
at the front of the property for Rivera and a smaller blue building
at the back for Kahlo, next to a studio for her father, an
architectural photographer. ``The architect thought like a
psychologist and decided that Frida needed to live alone,'' said
Blanca Garduno, director of the Diego Rivera Studio Museum, in the
San Angel house.
</P>
<P>
   Kahlo's studio is the more private of the two. Rivera's
double-height studio was on the third floor, beneath the same
saw-tooth factory skylights that Le Corbusier used in Paris. Their
two-story living room and dining area on the second floor of the
front building became a salon for the international avant-garde,
where Rivera and Kahlo entertained their bohemian friends. Tubular
steel furniture was supplanted by brightly colored peasant
furniture, which remains in the house. Dedicated to reviving
Mexican traditions, Rivera and Kahlo bridged the progressive and
the primitive.
</P>
<P>
   A strikingly cantilevered stair leads to a roof terrace on
Kahlo's studio. The buildings are raised on columns that give the
forms visual breathing room. The shock value of these bold blocks
in a culture devoted to decorative styles borrowed from the
European past must have pleased Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the influence of Le Corbusier, you can feel the
influence of Soviet ideas,'' said Victor Jimenez, who as the former
director of architecture in the National Institute of Fine Arts was
responsible for the restoration of the San Angel house. ``The
exposed pipes and chimneys were very machinelike and close to the
sensibility of the Russian avant-garde. It's a very interesting
interpretation of functionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs taken by Kahlo's father, Guillermo Kahlo, a German
emigre, served as archival documents that helped re-establish the
home as it looked in 1932. ``We reinstalled the original electrical
cabling so that it was plain to see,'' said Jimenez, now head of a
literary foundation, ``and restored the water tanks and metallic
trash ducts, which had disappeared.'' The strong colors, which leap
off the walls, must have been defiant when the house was built. The
blue used was most often associated with cantinas, and was
considered in bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Kahlo, who had been injured in a streetcar accident
when she was young, left the San Angel home and retreated to her
paternal house, the Blue House, now the Frida Kahlo Museum, in
Coyoacan. ``She was very angry in the San Angel house, because she
felt she suffered there in two ways,'' Ms. Garduno said.
``Physically, because of her fragile condition, it became very
difficult to walk upstairs, and emotionally, her heart suffered
because of all the women who visited Diego. She realized that Diego
had to make love, because these relationships were one way, with
all his financial pressures, for him to promote his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Married in 1929, the couple separated frequently. But the most
traumatic separation led to divorce in 1939, and remarriage the
next year, when Rivera followed Kahlo to the Blue House. He
returned to San Angel to paint. ``So Frida had her own romances in
Coyoacan, and Diego his own romances in San Angel,'' Ms. Garduno
said. (Trotsky numbered among Kahlo's lovers in Coyoacan.)
</P>
<P>
   The turn-of-the-century, one-story Blue House encloses a patio
open to a tropical garden surrounded by high walls. The blue is so
unrelenting in places, the house seems under water. The first rooms
are now galleries, but beyond, the house remains as it was when
Kahlo and Rivera lived there _ intimate, surreal and devoted to
Mexican folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Reviving Mexican traditions, Rivera and Kahlo translated their
political position into a lifestyle. With giant papier-mache
figures, antiques, tapestries, embroidered clothes, hand-painted
folk effigies and pre-Columbian statuettes, all set against walls
saturated with colors, their interiors mixed the surreal and the
primitive. A collection of devotional folk paintings lines the
stairwell in the kitchen wing, and china, clay pots, jugs and vases
populate the dining room and kitchen. Rivera's hat still hangs on
the coat rack in his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Kahlo never returned to the San Angel studios. In 1946, Rivera
(probably with advice from O'Gorman) added an L-shaped studio with
walls of glass to the Blue House, and after her leg was amputated,
he constructed ramps for her. The addition is a curious hybrid of
reinforced concrete, like the San Angel studios, and surfaces
encrusted with volcanic rock. The underbelly of the studio, raised
off the ground to form an outdoor room, is covered with lava stones
that appear to depict a shooting star with a hammer and sickle at
its center.
</P>
<P>
   Kahlo's studio remains as she left it, her wheelchair parked in
front of an unfinished portrait of a faintly Mexicanized Stalin. A
group of paint jars and brushes has the delicacy of makeup on a
vanity.
</P>
<P>
   The least known of their house-studios is an elemental
pre-Columbian structure, now the Diego Rivera Anahuacalli Museum.
With rock excavated from the lava bed on which it was constructed,
Rivera built a monumental reinforced concrete structure surfaced in
stone, creating the kind of architecture Aztecs might have built in
the 20th century. Taking advantage of modern technology, and
O'Gorman's expertise, he made voluminous interior spaces that never
existed in pyramids. The artist built it not only as a studio but
also as a gift for the Mexican people. Small rooms house his
exquisite collection of pre-Columbian sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman finished Rivera's dream after Rivera died of cancer.
The architect had helped Rivera do the drawings for the Anahuacalli
structure, but disapproved of the idea of mimicking Aztec style and
copying history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, O'Gorman, who so brilliantly introduced modernism to
Mexico, changed his outlook in the 1950s in favor of a more
organic, somewhat surreal, expression of the Mexican landscape.
Influenced by Rivera and Kahlo, he became a muralist who used
colored rocks to ``paint'' walls with figurative compositions, best
seen in his most famous facade, at the library at the University of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For this small group of influential artists, Mexico's mythic
power overcame the cold functionalism of modernism. Like Rivera,
who gave up abstraction for a realism often tinged with fantasy,
O'Gorman moved from functionalism to mythopoetic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swiss puritanism of Le Corbusier's architecture is exactly
the antithesis to the plastic arts of Mexico, from the antique
Anhuac down to the popular expressions of today,'' O'Gorman
declared in a speech at the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City. In
a volcanic landscape of the city, he built for himself a grotto
house, covered with mosaic stone, that was eventually demolished by
a new owner, causing an uproar of protest.
</P>
<P>
   But the three Rivera-Kahlo houses that O'Gorman either designed
or helped with are meticulously preserved and very much alive
because of lingering issues of Mexican identity. Architects today
are still divided between the abstractions of modernism and the
stone walls of the country's past. The three houses represent the
built history of a personal and political search to find and define
the soul of a complex nation.

CREATURES ON THE HEAD OF A CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (af)  
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Davidson first started photographing silicon chips
through a microscope 10 years ago, he wanted ``to promote circuitry
as an art form.'' Four years ago, his microscope excavated another
kind of art from the microprocessor's metallic layers: a drawing of
Where's Waldo.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was an example of reverse
engineering,'' said Davidson, a research scientist with the Natural
Magnetic High Field Laboratory in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he had come across a longstanding, clandestine practice
of chip designers: impressing a microscopic, non-functional cartoon
or drawing into the surface of the chip. Since then, Davidson has
photographed more than 60 chip designs.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he made his gallery of photomicrographs, including
images of lizards, buffaloes, cartoon characters and one of the
space shuttle, available through his laboratory's Web site
(microscopy.fsu.edu).
</P>
<P>
   ``We all did it,'' said Dan Zuras, a chip designer at
Hewlett-Packard who has two designs on the site. ``Eighteen or 20
years ago, they were all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the designs were etched into the uppermost, metallic
layers of the chip, creating the impression of an image in relief
on the chip's surface. The cartoons grew out of the ritual of
having chip designers sign or initial the chips they had worked on.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Zuras drew a roadrunner on a then-fast
Hewlett-Packard 1AK9 chip in 1982. ``Back in those days, I knew
where every one of the 153,000 transistors were on the chip. I knew
it so well that I signed it, like writing your name in wet concrete
after you've poured a driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chips featured inside jokes or references. One of
Davidson's favorites is The Con Artist, a drawing of a shady street
peddler hawking contraband watches, chosen because, according to
chip designers at Hewlett-Packard, the company had used inferior
clock circuitry on the low-cost microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, a chip designer, once contributed a drawing of
his chow chow Nikki to a MIPS Technologies chip, the R4000. ``I've
never seen a chip with more graffiti on it. There must have been
100 pieces, mostly names and initials.'' So why did he draw Nikki?
``Well, I loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some chip companies, like Intel, have banned the chip
graffiti because the designs can interfere with the checking
process.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kuhn, a mask layout designer at Silicon Graphics and
well-known chip artist who drew the Where's Waldo image, hopes that
the craft retains its underground quality, within limits of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an official mandate. But I wouldn't put in
anything that would offend the people on my team or would be in
poor taste, although I've been tempted,'' he said, adding ``I don't
have a grant from the NEA or anything.''

 &HT;    BABBITT WARNED TO CLEAN UP INDIAN TRUST PROBLEMS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington category
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Displaying photos of Bureau of Indian Affairs
records piled in trash bags and beside mop buckets, Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., warned Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt on Wednesday to clean up ``the Indian trust funds mess''
that has tied up billions of dollars owed to tribes and individual
native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be clear that the money in these accounts -- or that
is supposed to be in these accounts -- is Indian money that has
been entrusted to the United States,'' said Campbell, a member of
the Northern Cheyenne tribe and the Senate's only native American.
``It is not federal money.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge has already found Babbitt and Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt of court over a ``shocking
pattern of deception'' and a failure to produce documents sought by
Indian account holders who are suing the government for
mismanagement of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to re-litigate issues that are properly before
the court,'' said Campbell, chairing a joint hearing of the
Committees on Indian Affairs and Energy and Natural Resources.
``But there is clearly massive mismanagement in the Bureau of
Indian Affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying after being threatened with a subpoena, Babbitt
promised to work with Congress and the court on a problem he said
dates to the General Allotment Act of 1887. The law divided Indian
lands into individual and tribal parcels and put the property into
trusts administered by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have apologized to the court ...and intend to do all that
we can to be fully responsive to the court's orders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The contempt citation by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth came
in a class action suit led by Elouise Cobell, a Blackfeet tribe
descendant. The suit charged that native Americans have been denied
information and funds about revenues from their land because of
federal mismanagement of the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank trust departments throughout the United States are
responsible every day for collecting, managing and disbursing
hundreds of billions of funds to those who put their trust in
them,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Energy
and Natural Resources Committee. ``Why, then, can't American
Indians expect the same level of accountability from their
trustees?''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski and other Republicans on the committees said the
Interior Department should concede it cannot manage the trusts and
should turn the job over to outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no excuses,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R- Idaho. ``Why
can't we be smart enough to hire the right people to do the job?''
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trusts for tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs
oversees more than 340,000 individual trust fund accounts. Those
individual beneficiaries complain they can't find out what lands
they own and what funds they are owed from leases for grazing,
farming, oil, mineral or timber rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are billions of dollars at stake,'' said Campbell. ``The
(Interior) Department's Tribal Reconciliation Project was unable to
reconcile some $2.4 billion in tribal funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the $2.4 billion hasn't been ``lost,'' but is stuck
in the federal treasury because documents that show who's entitled
to trust benefits have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Money in the bank won't buy him a car if he has no access to his
money, Campbell retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the problem is complex because -- after five
generations -- the original trusts are now jointly owned by
thousands of individual Indians. He showed an account belonging to
Kevin Gover, the Assistant Interior Secretary for Indian Affairs
and a Pawnee descendent, with a gross value of 36 cents and annual
revenue of 7 cents.
</P>
<P>
   It costs taxpayers $35 a year to administer the account, Babbitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said the Interior Department should pay off
beneficiaries with tiny interests and close the accounts. They
offered to support any needed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem of sorting out the trust problem was
addressed in 1994 with the enactment of the Indian Trust Fund
Management Reform Act. That law called for a ``special trustee'' to
take charge of the effort. However, the special trustee, Paul
Homan, abruptly resigned in protest in January after Babbitt
ordered his office reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying at the hearing on Wednesday, Homan said the
reorganization deprived him of ``the authority and the resources''
to do his duties so he had no choice but to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the Department of Interior can no longer be
trusted to keep and produce trust records,'' he testified. He said
Congress should set up an independent agency to manage the Indian
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has asked Congress for $100 million next year, a $60
million increase from this year, to work on the accounts. However,
Republicans on the committees said the Interior Department has not
complied with the 1994 law to deal with the problems and increasing
funding might be ``throwing good money after bad.''

DINING OUT, NOT JUST FOR THE FOOD, IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `d' code)  
 (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Overheard in a New York restaurant: ``Do you think the chef will
tell us where he gets his quail?''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard in a Washington restaurant: ``What are the chances of
Hillary taking on Giuliani?''
</P>
<P>
   When New Yorkers go out to eat, they go for the food. When
Washingtonians go out to eat, they generally spend the evening
rehashing current events. Out-of-town visitors come either to see
the Capitol and the White House or to lobby their occupants; no one
comes to Washington just to eat. Perhaps as a result, there are
good, even very good restaurants, but none that qualify as either
incomparable or ultra-hip.
</P>
<P>
   The up side is that the $25 first course is almost unheard of in
Washington's restaurants. The best and grandest this
price-conscious city has to offer cost around $200 for two with
wine and tip.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Washington is in the midst of a serious restaurant
boom, and some new places are so hot that the only weekend
reservation you can get is at 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   If you are transfixed by the inner workings of a fine kitchen,
you might choose the casual elegance of Michel Richard Citronelle
in Georgetown. If you want to see where journalists and federal
officials _ past and present _ hang out, try Ardeo. Should you
desire an evening surrounded by silk damask draperies, where voices
don't rise above a murmur, Lespinasse is definitely the choice. But
if you long for the hipness of New York or L.A., the closest you
will come to it is D.C. Coast, where the best, and maybe only, way
to communicate with your dinner companions is via your cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Richard Citronelle
</P>
<P>
   Michel Richard's sense of fun, which makes his food so enticing,
is part of the charm of his recently redesigned restaurant,
Citronelle. A subdued changing light show plays against the walls
so that the room is never static. Its focal point is the glassed-in
open kitchen; one recent customer was chided by his companion for
paying more attention to the goings-on in the kitchen than to their
conversation. If the kitchen fascinates you, ask for a table in
front of the windows, or better yet, gather a group and reserve the
chef's table in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many restaurant menus where the descriptions of the
food are endless, Richard's menu is deceptively simple. The
sensibility is French: the flavors and surprising textures of his
creations unfold as you eat them. Crunchy shrimp as a first course
are coated with shreds of phyllo called kataifi, the crispness
delightfully contrasted with little beads of pearl pasta and a
velvety sauce of red pepper with a touch of lemon grass. The
intensity of the porcini mushrooms is perfectly modulated by the
cauliflower in a creamy soup punctuated with bits of cooked
cauliflower. Richard's rendition of seared foie gras combines the
expected _ apple _ with the unexpected: a tiny portion of Belgian
endive cole slaw mixed with the apple and an acidic counterpoint,
black bean balsamic sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Richard's playfulness is a rustic dish like chicken
in a pot, the broth and the meltingly tender chicken suffused with
the fragrance and flavor of black truffles. A medallion of rare
tuna crusted with black peppercorns is topped with a napoleon of
mashed potatoes between layers of paper-thin disks of toasted
brioche.
</P>
<P>
   After looking over the wine list because it is well chosen,
extensive and expensive, turn to the sommelier, Mark Slater. This
is one of the rare restaurants where it is worthwhile letting him
choose for you. That night he selected a 1996 Witness Tree Vintage
Select Pinot Noir from Oregon for $65.
</P>
<P>
   Even though each table is served a plate of delightful petits
fours after dinner, we shared Richard's delectably whimsical
version of Reese's peanut butter cups, a mousse of peanut butter
and chocolate in a tart topped with a croquembouche of puffed cocoa
coated in chocolate. Every kid should be so lucky. Or try an
intensely citrus lemon tart with lemon basil.
</P>
<P>
   Since I am a devoted fan of Citronelle, I am known there, but
legions of Washington eaters agree that despite being one of the
city's most expensive restaurant, it is a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Lespinasse
</P>
<P>
   This is Washington's special-occasion restaurant; special
because the food now lives up to the resplendent Belle Epoque
setting. It is a grand room with pale yellow leather chairs and
blue carpet, chandeliers and a massive bouquet of flowers.
Lespinasse appeals particularly to those who like to dress up for
dinner. The rewards are fine service, very good food and, above
all, serenity. How delightful that your nearest neighbor cannot
hear a word you are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Here you definitely want to concentrate on what is being put in
front of you, the contemporary French creations of Sandro Gamba,
who has worked in France's best kitchens, where he earned his own
Michelin star.
</P>
<P>
   Gamba arrived in Washington this fall at the age of 28 to take
over Lespinasse, a sister of the much acclaimed restaurant of the
same name in New York's St. Regis Hotel. The original Washington
version failed to attract a following and closed for two months
this summer. The new chef is making people sit up and take notice
with his modern approach to French food.
</P>
<P>
   While Gamba learns his way around American ingredients, the menu
has been kept small. A shellfish ragout of perfectly poached
seafood is subtly flavored with ginger and chervil. Turbot, coated
with a turbot mousse, is splendid with a sauce of dried figs and
olive oil. The foie gras, crisp on the outside, melting at the
center and drizzled with a port wine reduction, is as fine a
rendition as you could want. When white truffles come back in
season next fall, see if you can order the ambrosial white truffle
risotto.
</P>
<P>
   A symphonic arrangement of baby lamb provides a tiny rack, thin
slices of leg and loin and braised strips bathed in a lamb jus
perfumed with Moroccan spices. The roast squab is an imaginative
plate: a boned leg stuffed like a sausage, one fillet poached and
one roasted. It is served with a beet salad and truffled
tortellini.
</P>
<P>
   Among the desserts, my favorite was a poached glazed fig perched
on a paper-thin crust of crepe resting on plum compote with a
garnish of honey ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Lespinasse may have one of the best wine lists in Washington,
with 7,500 bottles. Prices start at $25 for the house wine, but
they climb rapidly from there. We had a 1997 Acacia Carneros Pinot
Noir for $47.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   D.C. Coast
</P>
<P>
   Even if you didn't like the food at D.C. Coast _ yes, yes, the
only water in Washington is the Potomac River _ you would have to
admire what the owners have done to restore the first Art Deco
skyscraper built in Washington. Designed for a bank, it had the
misfortune to be finished just before the 1929 stock market crash
and lived in ignominy as space for Western Union and McDonald's.
For 70 years, no one saw the soaring two-story-high ceiling on 14th
and K Streets. As business moved west, the street-floor space of
the building was vacant for years. Then, in the mid-'90s,
professional offices moved east again and the building regained its
former splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Even before you enter this grand space, a 10-foot statue of a
Greek mermaid on a 4-foot pedestal lets you know that fish is
important here. She is flanked by two fabulous 1930s bullet-shaped
frosted glass chandeliers, topped with lights that look like
vanilla ice cream cones. Huge oval mirrors above the bar make
people-watching easy from any corner. And they are worth watching,
especially at the bar, divided from the dining room by an
undulating wall.
</P>
<P>
   The bar is what makes D.C. Coast Washington's restaurant of the
moment. Anything goes, from jeans with cuffs to silver sequined
dresses. The smoke from the bar, which can include cigars after
9:30, along with the din, add nothing to the dining experience, so
if you go for the food instead of the scene, ask for a table on the
mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   Like the restaurant itself, Jeff Tunks' food is writ large, and
portions fill the oversized plates. His dishes are intensely
flavored with accents of the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico and the
Chesapeake Bay. Those that work are well balanced, like the fresh
and light Tahitian-style tuna tartare served in a coconut with
deep-fried wonton wrappers or the moist halibut coated with a
woodsy crust of porcini mushrooms served atop wonderfully garlicky
mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In season don't miss the chef's version of a regional specialty:
crab cake and a crisp soft-shell crab are served with corn, pickled
okra relish and a spicy lemon butter. There are good meat dishes,
too, such as the crusted barbecued lamb shank with lusciously
creamy stone-ground grits and the tender piece of rib eye. Those
who have room should go directly to a combination made in heaven:
bananas and chocolate with a rum caramel sauce; second choice is a
classic quivering creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Tunks goes overboard with sweetness in savory dishes,
as in the wild rice hash that was served with smoked quail. And
sometimes the dishes are not as refined as they should be, such as
the Chinese lacquered duck in a Peking pancake.
</P>
<P>
   A plus is the wine list, fairly priced with most bottles between
$30 and $35. A Ravenswood Lodi Zinfandel was $31. The service is
pleasant, not annoyingly familiar, and you get a sense of what
young and hip means in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ardeo
</P>
<P>
   If you go early to Ardeo, something between a neighborhood and
destination restaurant, you will see the government and
journalistic officialdom that used to run Washington. By 8 p.m.,
they have been replaced by those who make Washington run right now.
(Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Vernon Jordan are among
the patrons.)
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Park, the pleasant residential neighborhood where
turn-of-the-century officials decamped to escape the summer's
oppressive humidity, has a thriving restaurant scene, accessible
without a car because it is a block from a Metro stop.
</P>
<P>
   The air at Ardeo is always filled with tantalizing buzz words,
overheard bits of conversation: ``Sidney,'' ``Linda Tripp,''
``Kennedy's office.'' If you go for the scene, ask to be seated on
the first floor; if you want to talk, ask for the second.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome restaurant is in a long narrow space that seats
140, hidden behind a nondescript store front. The decor is retro,
the walls hung with stylized 1940s paintings, black and white
drawings and Art Deco fixtures. The food is anything but retro, and
it works more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   To take the edge off your appetite, the waiter appears with
superb bread from the bakery next door, served with an addictive
garlicky bean dip.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, Fred Przyborowski, likes to add meat to his fish
dishes, which makes them much richer than expected. Oxtail-salsify
ragout intensifies the sweetness of the seared scallops. The beer
in which the tender and plump mussels are steamed adds a pleasingly
malty accent. Foie gras is its usual buttery self, served with thin
crisp-fried potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuna marinated in mirin, the Japanese wine, is cooked just the
way I like it: seared on the outside and rare in the center. And
you can smell the lovely aroma of a perfectly cooked pasta sauced
with an intensely flavored mixture of mushrooms even before it
arrives at the table.
</P>
<P>
   The dessert of choice is praline semifreddo with dried cranberry
and balsamic vinegar sauce. The contrast of the cold sweet
creaminess and the sharpness of the sauce make it a delightfully
indulgent end to a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Portions are large; the prices are relatively low; the wine list
_ we had another Ravenswood zinfandel, this one a 1996 Vintners
Blend for $27 _ is reasonable, with many selections in the
$30-to-$40 range and a fair number of half bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Ardeo offers an opportunity to see Washington at play, or as
close to play as this town ever gets.
</P>

STUDY ATTACKS CALIFORNIA'S `THREE-STRIKES' LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new study says that California's
``three-strikes'' law is not responsible for the 37 percent
reduction in crime throughout the state over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Tuesday by the nonprofit Justice Policy
Institute in San Francisco, contradicts a report released last week
by California Secretary of State Bill Jones lauding the law.
</P>
<P>
   The competing findings were made public just as legislators in
Sacramento are rethinking the 1994 law, which allows nonviolent
offenders to be sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and up to life
in prison, on their third conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In California, convictions for property crimes, such as
shoplifting or bicycle theft, can count as a third strike. Most
states with similar laws require the third offense to be a violent
crime before a criminal can get a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Policy Institute study notes that crime decreased at
a greater rate in San Francisco, where comparatively few
three-strikes cases were prosecuted, than in six other urban
counties that used the law more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco registered its great drop in crime even though
it was not enforcing three-strikes as it could have,'' said Dan
Macallair, a co-author of the Justice Policy Institute study. ``We
did a county-by-county comparison that shows three-strikes is not
responsible for the drop in the state's crime rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that felons in their 30s and 40s were eight
times more likely to be sentenced under the three-strikes law than
those in their 20s. More than 40,000 people have been convicted of
second and third offenses, a quarter of the state's prison
population. About 4,400 of them were sentenced to 25-years-to-life.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, author of the law, said, ``The numbers pretty much speak
for themselves.'' He accused the institute of turning the
statistics ``around to make it appear that three-strikes is
ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Jones said that in the five years since the
three-strikes law was enacted, fewer crimes were being committed,
and fewer new inmates were going to prison while more career
criminals remained behind bars longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three-strikes has revolutionized the way we combat crime in
this country,'' Jones said. ``By closing the revolving prison door,
we have created an effective deterrent to crime that has helped
reduce the crime rate in California by 38 percent in just five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would fight any effort to modify the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no equivalent five-year period in the history of
California where we've seen this dramatic a reduction in crime,''
he said. ``The message of deterrence to the repeat criminals has
gotten through.''
</P>
<P>
   But Macallair and other criminologists said that robust economic
growth, demographic changes and a decline in the popularity of
crack cocaine had driven the state's decrease in crime.
</P>
<P>
   The law was overwhelmingly passed by the Legislature in 1994,
signed on an emergency basis by former Gov. Pete Wilson and
ratified by the voters by a margin of 72 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, has introduced a bill to
require a third conviction be a violent or serious felony.

CHEATING DEATH HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheating is big business in video games. To Interact, the
company that manufactures Game Shark ``enhancement devices,'' it's
worth $40 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Interact is the fifth-largest video game company in America. It
makes no free-standing hardware. It doesn't publish a single
software title. It has, however, sold two million pieces of plastic
and silicon that plug into the back of a Sony Playstation or the
cartridge slot of a Nintendo 64 to give the player invincibility,
extra weapons, superpowers and access to hidden areas and bonus
levels.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to fight the boss on the 17th level (and brag about
it in the schoolyard), you don't have to invest 30 hours to master
the game. Just plug in a Game Shark, which contains hundreds of
cheat codes for all the hottest games in one package.
</P>
<P>
   From a technological standpoint, cheat codes are nothing new.
The factory that manufactures Game Sharks, in Manchester, England,
was cranking out similar devices for the Commodore Amiga in 1979. A
device called the Game Genie turbocharged thousands of eight-bit
Nintendo consoles in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Game Shark's cheat codes function on the same principle as its
predecessors. But it can do what early devices could not because
the world of consumer electronics has changed radically.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference can be summed up in two words: cheap
memory. As any PC owner knows, the price of computer memory has
taken a nose dive since the 1980s. Back then, it was much too
expensive to put memory chips in a game peripheral, so there was no
room to store codes.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to use a cheat code on your Nintendo machine with
a Game Genie, you had to enter it manually every time you played,
and the device could handle only one code at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The Game Shark comes with hundreds of codes and a user-friendly
software interface because four-megabyte memory chips cost $8.
Cheap memory is what made beepers and cellular phones and
Tamagotchis economically viable, and it makes the Game Shark a more
robust and profitable device.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap memory also makes stored information a more important part
of the experience. People buy a Game Shark for the cheat codes
stored on it, not for the raw device.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Interact is an information vendor. So the
information has to be current. ``Previous manufacturers of cheat
devices treated them like toys,'' said Todd Hays, Interact's chief
executive. ``They made them as cheaply as possible, in one big
batch, and shipped them all at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that just wasn't going to work _ you've got to be
able to promote these things year-round. So we invested in a help
line, an 800 number for codes, a 900 number for really advanced
codes. We invented Web site support. And we always ship very fresh
product _ we treat it like a loaf of bread. If there's a hot new
game coming out tomorrow, the Game Sharks we're shipping today will
have a whole new fresh stash of codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Generating those codes involves a squad of full-time hackers who
crank video games through high-powered computers and software
algorithms. ``On a television,'' Hayes said, ``all you can see is
the result of the programming. What we see is a million lines of
actual code, and we have seasoned hackers that go through and look
for aberrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hacking stations are hooked up to a logic analyzer, and
we've written software for it _ find all locations in the game
where life equals zero. Boom, at the end of the game, and here and
here and here _ these are all the places where you might die. Then
you go and look at the code, and you might find a way you can avoid
that place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find all sorts of things. We even find things that the
software company never meant for you to see, places you can't get
to from normal game play. Sometimes developers put things in there,
like the Tiger Woods game that Electronic Arts published _ there
were some lines of code buried in there that produced a pretty
offensive scene from `South Park.' Electronic Arts found out about
it and recalled the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare for something like that to get past quality control,
but it happens _ a lot of these programmers are so creative and so
artistic, and they're cooped up in these little rooms, and it's a
challenge for them to get something past their boss. It's an
anti-Establishment, rebel thing to do _ let's see if the bug police
can find it.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the hardware hackers at Interact are the ultimate
gamers, uncovering everything that is meant to be found, as well as
a few things that are meant to stay buried. Software, by its very
nature, is a palimpsest _ there are always layers that no one is
supposed to see. A piece of hardware loaded with cheat codes is a
lens that reveals those layers.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question is whether the use of this device qualifies
as cheating. What a Game Shark allows you to do is have more
extensive access, at your discretion, to the software you already
own.
</P>
<P>
   In game play, that is called cheating. But if you buy a book and
skip to page 200, or rent a movie and fast forward to your favorite
scene, does that count as cheating? If you're doing scientific
research and discover a technique that yields vast quantities of
high-quality information at blinding speed, does that qualify as
cheating?
</P>
<P>
   If the object is to gain knowledge of a system, which is the
ultimate object of any computer game, then what separates cheating
from learning? And if using a Game Shark isn't cheating, then what
is?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Hayes said. ``That's a good question. I
suppose if you changed the game code itself. Like, there's another
company that makes devices, and their claim to fame most recently
was a nude Lara Croft code for Tomb Raider. We went in and
investigated this, and it turned out that there was no nude Lara
Croft in the game, that what they'd actually done was take skin
tone from other parts of the game and paste it over her bathing
suit so that she (italics)looked(end italics) nude. But she was
never actually nude. And they are currently being sued by Eidos,
the publisher, for intellectual property infringement. If
something's buried in the game, I'll unbury it. But I'm not going
to make something up or interfere with the integrity of the code.''
</P>
<P>
   In a medium subject to infinite manipulation, outright
fabrication is still a no-no. Cheating may be ill defined, but it's
fairly easy to spot an outright lie. Look for the topless virtual
celebrity, then check for neck seams.

WHITE HOUSE AND GOP JOCKEY OVER LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Republicans battled Wednesday
over the post-impeachment agenda for Congress _ a struggle pitting
Democrats' bid to use the federal budget surplus to rescue Social
Security and Medicare against a Republican plan for an
across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetorical skirmish flared just eight days after a
bipartisan summit between the president and congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton traveled to Capitol Hill to rally with Vice President Al
Gore, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., at a meeting of House and
Senate Democrats to proclaim Democratic unity behind an agenda
dubbed ``Families First.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' new-found unity stems in part from Democratic
solidarity in preventing the GOP-led Senate from removing Clinton
from office after impeachment by the House in the sex-and-cover-up
scandal involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' agenda calls for federal aid to modernize
schools, cut class size, expand patients' rights within health
maintenance organizations, hiking the minimum wage and offering
targeted tax cuts to parents home with children and relatives
caring for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had been ``encouraged to see some of the
Republicans backing away from the irresponsible across-the-board
tax cut that is too costly _ in favor of standing with us for
targeted tax cuts benefiting mostly middle-class working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton cautioned that ``strong differences'' remain between
the rival parties' legislative agendas, adding: ``We must resolve
them in a way that benefits the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke just hours before Lewinsky was scheduled to break
14 months of public silence to appear on a prime-time interview
with Barbara Walters on ABC News' program ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance on Capitol Hill at the Library of Congress,
Clinton challenged Republicans to set aside 15 percent of the
projected $4.4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15
years to rescue the financially-ailing Medicare system that
provides federal health care insurance coverage to millions of
elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already won GOP backing for his proposal to devote
62 percent of the budget surplus to bolstering the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held out the prospect of a tax cut but only after there
is bipartisan agreement to funnel 77 percent of the surplus to
protect the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton said, the White House and Republicans in Congress
``can have an honest and principled disagreement about how much and
what kind of tax cut'' to finance with the remainder of the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who hopes to succeed Clinton in the White House, jovially
denied that the gathering had campaign overtones. ``Now this is not
an election rally,'' Gore observed. ``This is the beginning of a
congressional term.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders underscored their different priorities in
separate appearances on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., tweaked Democrats for their attempt to seize the
advantage in setting the agenda for the GOP-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see that three months after the Republicans
announced their agenda, the Democrats are getting around to doing
the same,'' Lott's spokesman said. ``We have already made
significant progress on our agenda, which emphasized education,
strengthening national security, among others.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, held a rally
with Reps. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., to drum up support for the across-the-board tax cuts
favored by some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said Republicans plan to hold town meetings and rallies
across the country before the April 15 deadline for filing federal
income tax returns in order to alert taxpayers that they are
bearing ``the highest-ever'' tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said House Republican leaders favor devoting the bulk of
the federal budget surplus to shoring up Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Armey added: ``But we strongly disagree with him over what to do
with the remaining money. If we don't return this money, President
Clinton will spend it on more big government.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Republicans hope the American people will view the
projected budget surplus as ``an overcharge'' by the federal
government that they want returned to them in the form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders agreed Tuesday to push legislation that protects
Social Security payroll tax revenues from being used for anything
other than strengthening the pension system or paying down the $5.3
trillion federal debt.

(EDS: This is the first in a weekly decade-by-decade series
detailing the serious and silly changes in America's dining habits
during the last century.) IN THE EARLY 1900s, EATING HABITS RANGED(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America strode into the 20th century proud of its industry, sure
of its science and cocky with its prosperity. It was a country with
an appetite for everything.
</P>
<P>
   One percent of the population controlled 50 percent of the
nation's wealth. For that segment, America was a land of plenty,
and the Diamond Jim Bradys of the world wanted more than their fair
share.
</P>
<P>
   For financier Brady, breakfast was eggs, breads, muffins, grits,
pancakes, steaks, chops, fried potatoes and a pitcher of orange
juice. At midmorning, he ate two or three dozen oysters for a
snack. His restaurant lunch (often at New York City's Delmonico's)
would be more oysters and clams, lobsters, crabs, a joint of meat,
pie and more orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was his focal point, however, where he'd again eat
three-dozen oysters, a dozen crabs, six or seven lobsters, terrapin
soup, a steak, coffee, a tray of pastries and 2 pounds of candy.
(When Brady died at 56, his stomach was said to be six times larger
than the average man's.)
</P>
<P>
   Brady was usually accompanied by his lover, Lillian Russell, a
popular stage actress. Russell is said to have eaten as much as
Brady, in addition to smoking 500 cigars a month.
</P>
<P>
   This couple was not alone in their conspicuous display of
caloric consumption. In 1903, the New York Riding Club hosted a
``horse dinner'' in the fourth-floor ballroom of Louis Sherry's
restaurant. Horses were brought to the room in the freight
elevators, hitched to a large dining table and fed oats while the
riders ate a 14-course dinner and sipped champagne out of bottles
stashed in the saddlebags.
</P>
<P>
   But not for the first time in Americans' table matters, and
certainly not the last, there was another segment of the population
eating a very different diet.
</P>
<P>
   William and John Kellogg had introduced cornflakes by the end of
the century and were promoting the cereal at their sanatorium at
Battle Creek, Mich. Later, a former patient of the sanatorium
introduced his take on the benefits of cereal with a beverage he
call Postum and started producing Grape-Nuts. All these products
were promoted as being healthful.
</P>
<P>
   Ah _ manna from heaven _ a breakfast food that didn't need to be
cooked. With fewer and fewer servants (they were finding more
lucrative work as clerks and telephone operators), this was a boon
to households. Also, middle-class America was becoming obsessed
with ``germs,'' a relatively new term that segued into the science
bent of the era's social reformers. These mass-produced cereals
were packaged and were perceived as cleaner than bulk foods
shoveled from bins.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had reason to be suspicious of their food supply. The
Pure Food and Drug Act was instituted in 1906 after the fallout
from the publication of Upton Sinclair's ``The Jungle'' and its
exposure of conditions in Chicago's slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Home economics came into being as a new class of reformers
decided America would be better off eating by the numbers. Food was
viewed as fuel, not fun, and was expected to provide function, not
pleasure. Like machines, the body must be properly fueled to
promote efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   (A lot of this thinking hit a positive note with middle-class
women who didn't relish more time in the kitchen.)
</P>
<P>
   Another time saver in the kitchen was the publication of Fanny
Merritt Farmer's ``Boston Cooking School Cook Book.'' Farmer is
credited with standardizing measures (instead of instructions like
``a knob of butter the size of a hen's egg'') and putting an
emphasis on simpler food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is not far distant when knowledge of the principles
of diet will be an essential part of one's education,'' she wrote.
``Then mankind will eat to live, will be able to do better mental
and physical work and disease will be less frequent.''
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, food was becoming much simpler and less
fussed with. The ``modern'' way to eat included canned goods,
gelatin salads and a breakfast more appropriate for an office
worker than a farmer.

LOOKING FOR THE BEST GAME? HERE'S ONE FOR EVERY DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By CHRIS ANDERSON   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Joe Garagiola was in New York one day, and was
driving to Yogi Berra's house when he got lost. Garagiola stopped
at a pay phone and called Berra for directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly where you are,'' Berra assured Garagiola. ``So
don't go the other way, come toward me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And somehow,'' Garagiola said years later when retelling the
story, ``I always found my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like finding spring training stadiums, really. You
don't always need a map to lead you to the treasure.
</P>
<P>
   To find McKechnie Field in Bradenton, for example, just look for
the old stadium that makes games feel like county fairs.
</P>
<P>
   To find Charlotte County Stadium in Port Charlotte, look for the
alligator in the pond that awaits home runs.
</P>
<P>
   To find Chain of Lakes Stadium in Winter Haven, follow the scent
of the orange groves nearby.
</P>
<P>
   To find Al Lang Stadium in St. Petersburg, look for the boats
sailing on the bay in the background.
</P>
<P>
   To find Grant Field in Dunedin, listen for loudness tucked
inside a sleepy city.
</P>
<P>
   What if you could take off for a month and see a Grapefruit
League game every day?
</P>
<P>
   We have devised the ultimate road trip for baseball fans. The
Last Great Adventure. The best games each day in every stadium from
Orlando to Fort Myers, beginning from the first day of play on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, if you get lost looking for Legends Field in
Tampa, stop the car, close your eyes and listen.
</P>
<P>
   That way, you'll be certain to hear Berra, the former Yankee
manager and great philosopher, say:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the fork in the road, take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Toronto vs. New York Yankees at Tampa, 1:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The defending World Series champions remain intact, and Legends
Field is as good as the Yankees are. Followed by dinner in Ybor
City, there is no better way to start spring.
</P>
<P>
   Friday
</P>
<P>
   Detroit vs. Pittsburgh at Bradenton, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' 31st spring opener at McKechnie Field, and spring
training's version of Wrigley Field makes watching the Pirates and
Tigers not nearly so painful.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore vs. Minnesota at Fort Myers, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Albert Belle played his first game with the White
Sox in this stadium. After the game, Belle claimed he was a changed
man. Oh well. Maybe he makes the trip with his new team, the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Texas vs. Boston at Fort Myers, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, City of Palms Park was the talk of spring
training. It remains a great setting with its towering palm trees
and definitely worth seeing. So are two playoff teams from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Monday
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay vs. Texas at Port Charlotte, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Arrive early, because Juan Gonzalez (Texas) and Jose Canseco
(Tampa Bay) taking batting practice on the same field is one of the
great shows in spring training. Arguably the best stadium to catch
BP homers at.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees vs. Houston at Kissimmee, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Osceola County Stadium does not really stand out, but the Astros
and Yankees do. Last year's World Series champions vs. the NL
Central champions. The only downside is that Randy Johnson left
Houston for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, March 10
</P>
<P>
   Houston vs. Atlanta at Lake Buena Vista, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Sports Complex has 30 sports venues on its site,
including what is the most impressive new stadium in spring
training. Watch a game between two division champions and then eat
at the All-Star cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, March 11
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis vs. Kansas City at Haines City, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is. The game you've been waiting for. The only chance,
within a reasonable drive, to see the Cardinals' new shortstop,
Edgar Renteria. Oh yeah, and maybe some guy named McGwire. Who
knows if he'll make the trip, but it's worth the effort to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, March 12
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland vs. Detroit at Lakeland, 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   No team has trained in one Florida city longer than the Tigers
have in Lakeland.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, March 13
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles vs. Cleveland at Winter Haven, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Say 5,000 fans show up for this game and pay an average of $7
per ticket. That's $35,000. It would take 2,857 spring games to
equal Kevin Brown's $100 million contract with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, March 14
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees vs. Atlanta at Lake Buena Vista, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so spring games are virtually meaningless, and the
superstars don't always play, but the Yankees and the Braves could
be the 1999 World Series preview.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, March 15
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees vs. Cincinnati at Sarasota, 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the Yankees play the Reds in Sarasota, and a sure
sellout at Ed Smith Stadium. Last year's game was rained out. Greg
Vaughn, recently traded to Cincinnati from San Diego, is the
Grapefruit League's newest attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, March 16
</P>
<P>
   Toronto vs. New York Yankees at Tampa, 7:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens against the Yankees in a night game at Legends
Field would be one of the spring's highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, March 17
</P>
<P>
   New York Mets vs. Houston at Kissimmee, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   New York catcher Mike Piazza used to hit in this stadium as a
Florida State League player making a minor-league salary. Now, with
a new $90 million contract, he could buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, March 18
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta vs. Toronto at Dunedin, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto has been unhappy at Dunedin Stadium for years, but it
still has a certain charm. With its restaurants and shops, a walk
down Main Street before the game is worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, March 19
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees vs. Tampa Bay at St. Petersburg, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, starters don't travel to away games. It doesn't
matter with the Yankees. No matter who they bring, you always see
someone good.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, March 20
</P>
<P>
   New York Mets vs. Atlanta at Lake Buena Vista, 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Spring might mean the most to the Mets. They failed in the final
weekend to make the playoffs last year, spent a ton of money in the
off-season and a sense of urgency surrounds the team.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, March 21
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland vs. Philadelphia at Clearwater, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The first and only stop at Jack Russell Stadium, which has been
around since 1955. Clearwater Beach is 3 miles away and Cleveland
shortstop Omar Vizquel is as smooth as its sand.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, March 22
</P>
<P>
   Boston vs. Pittsburgh at Bradenton, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   No more Mo, but the Red Sox still have a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, March 23
</P>
<P>
   Houston vs. Cleveland at Winter Haven, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the McGwire-Sosa home run chase last year was Manny
Ramirez's season for the Indians. Not a big spring draw, but he
should be.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, March 24
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees vs. Texas at Port Charlotte, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   You know what the best thing is about seeing the Yankees play?
You know you'll see a competitive game, even though it's spring.
Everyone wants to beat the Yankees, including the Rangers, losers
to New York in last year's Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, March 25
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles vs. Houston at Kissimmee, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have been talking about moving to Arizona. A
Grapefruit League fixture, their time in Florida may be running
out.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, March 26
</P>
<P>
   Houston vs. New York Yankees at Tampa, 7:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like sunshine and baseball in the afternoon.
Throw in some barbecue smoke, however, and night games in spring
are just as good.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, March 27
</P>
<P>
   Boston vs. Tampa Bay at St. Petersburg, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay is the team that stays in Florida after everyone else
leaves. The lineup you'll see this summer will start to take shape
by now.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, March 28
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore vs. Boston at Fort Myers, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a chance to see Baltimore's Will Clark in a new uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, March 29
</P>
<P>
   Texas vs. Tampa Bay at St. Petersburg, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With the Final Four fast approaching at nearby Tropicana Field,
the buzz in the air makes St. Petersburg the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, March 30
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees vs. Cincinnati at Sarasota, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect spring day.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, March 31
</P>
<P>
   Boston vs. Pittsburgh at Bradenton, 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect spring stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, April 1
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland vs. New York Yankees at Tampa, 1:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect spring ending.

SENATE PANEL APPROVES BILL LIMITING YEAR 2000 LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to head off a flood of lawsuits against
companies that fail to correct their year 2000 computer problems,
the Senate Commerce Committee narrowly approved legislation
Wednesday that would limit the firms' liability.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would cap punitive damages at $250,000 and require a
90-day cooling-off period before any lawsuit could be filed. The
90-day period is designed to give companies time to fix any Y2K
problems and avoid a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's author, Senate Commerce Chairman John McCain,
R-Ariz., noting that most Democrats are strongly against the
legislation, said it will have to be revised before it reaches the
Senate floor in order to have a chance of being enacted. The
commerce committee's nine Democrats voted against the bill while
all 11 Republicans supported it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the bill is to provide incentives to prevent
Y2K failures, to fix the problems which do occur and to avoid
costly litigation,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, fewer than 50 Y2K-related lawsuits have been filed, but
some experts predict thousands will be launched when the so-called
Y2K problem begins _ that is, once some computer systems or
products with embedded computer chips fail on or after Jan. 1.
Unless they are fixed, these computers will misread the year 2000
as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   One lawsuit filed by a Warren, Mich., grocery-store owner has
already been settled for $260,000. In testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee earlier this week, the store owner, Mark
Yarsike, said he faced disaster when he first opened his store in
1995. The $100,000 computer system that ran the store's cash
registers immediately crashed because, as he later found out, it
couldn't handle a credit card with an expiration date of 2000 or
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not make one sale,'' he said. ``People began drifting
out. ... We heard comments like `I'll never come back here.'''
After spending several weeks trying to get the system's
manufacturer, Atlanta-based TEC America Inc., to fix the system,
Yarsike installed another one and took TEC to court. Yarsike said
small businesses like his could be hurt if Y2K liability
legislation is enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day cooling-off period was first suggested by Sens.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who included
it in their own legislation, which is nearly identical to the
McCain bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both the McCain and Feinstein-Hatch bills would require anyone
intending to file a Y2K-related lawsuit to first give a defendant
written notice of the problem. The defendant would have 30 days to
respond in writing and an additional 60 days to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats opposing the Y2K measures say they could give
businesses an incentive to wait to fix any Y2K problems until after
they happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., called the McCain bill a
``get-out-of-jail-free card.'' He said market forces are working to
address the Y2K issues, adding that some businesses have already
cut off suppliers and other vendors that have not fixed their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., argued that the legislation is
necessary to allow companies to put 100 percent of their efforts
into coping with Y2K problems this year rather than worrying about
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he recently met with owners of four small computer
software companies in the Seattle area who are in an ``absolute
panic over Y2K lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain bill would also impose proportionate liability rather
than so-called joint and several liability. This would limit a
company's liability to the proportion of its fault in causing a
problem and is aimed at preventing plaintiffs from going after the
wealthiest defendants in lawsuits where several defendants are
named.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the proposed legislation is too
broad and could improperly override state contract and tort law.
Most Y2K lawsuits would be filed in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure is pending in the House that is supported by
Republicans and by some Democrats from high-tech areas such as Rep.
James Moran of Alexandria, Va., and Calvin Dooley of Hanford,
Calif. The main difference between the House and Senate bills is
that the House measure would cap lawyers' fees at $1,000 per hour.

VINCE GILL'S MANY TRIBUTES TO TRADITION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DeYOUNG   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditions of country music are important to Vince Gill.
Though he has a record 17 Country Music Association awards and last
week took home his 12th Grammy, he acknowledges his debt to the
music's forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   For his latest album, ``The Key,'' Gill wrote a collection of
songs in a variety of classic country styles, from Buck Owens'
twangy Bakersfield Sound, to the gut-wrenching love ballads of
George Jones and the easy shuffles of Nashville Sound pioneers Ray
Price and Floyd Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Key'' doesn't go down as smoothly as some of Gill's
earlier, multi-platinum albums, like ``I Still Believe in You'' or
``When Love Finds You.'' However, the 42-year-old singer-songwriter
says, making a hit was never discussed at the recording sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a labor of love, and such a joy hearing those
kinds of things coming through the speakers, it was important to
me,'' Gill explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This record felt like my whole life, as opposed to just a
period of it. In that I remember what Ray Charles' records sounded
like, from when I was growing up. But there were still a whole lot
of things that I've learned, musically, since I've been
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Key'' is dedicated to Gill's father, Stan Gill, a federal
appellate court judge, who died last year. Young Vince learned to
play guitar by sitting in with his dad, who knew just three or four
banjo chords but joyfully played all the country music hits of the
day in the family's Oklahoma City living room and with a weekend
combo.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of his father, Gill says, made him start thinking about
those old songs. ``I'll always believe that this'll be a
tremendously important record in my entire career,'' he explains.
``I kind of knew what I wanted the record to sound like, and in my
simple way to say, `This is something I missed; this is something I
love.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether it's as commercially successful as `I
Still Believe in You,' it's not a failure. Huge success to me is
just to make the music; music's always about that to me. The
success is in making it, not in where it winds up and how many it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in my heart, it was what I intended it to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill says making ``The Key'' was fun, and something of a cinch,
because a lot of Nashville session musicians have been working
since the old days. ``I think the players had a blast,'' he
explains. ``Pig Robbins played on all those records. He knows what
they sounded like. He was the guy. John Hughey played on all the
Conway Twitty records, and on down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand how great those players are,
that do what they do. You can go to them and say `This has got kind
of a Buck feel right here' and they know exactly what you're
talking about. They are so great, and so chameleon-like, that
wherever you want to point them, they take it. They understand it.
It's really impressive to see musicians with enough talent to be
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Vince Gill has never strayed from his country music
roots. Although he's as well-known as Garth Brooks or Shania Twain,
he makes himself accessible to his fans, participating in dozens of
charity events in Nashville every year. He has affably hosted the
CMA show since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For every big-city, big-money arena tour, he takes a swing
through state fairs and smaller venues in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a balance in your life,'' Gill explains.
``It's not always about who's got the most ... what is it they say,
`The guy who dies with the most toys still dies' ''?
</P>
<P>
   He's also a frequent performer on the Grand Ole Opry stage.
Playing the Opry one or two weekends a year is a requirement once
you become a member; however, it pays less than $100 per night, and
many artists won't come off the road, where they might make 50
times that for a single concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's selfish not to go there if you're a member,''
Gill says, ``if you've been successful in your career and they
think enough of you to say `We'd like to make you a member of this
great tradition.' And you go `OK, thanks, I'll take that, but I'm
never coming back.' Then what good has any of it done?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like investing in people. I love the fact that I knew Roy
Acuff. I knew Minnie Pearl. And I know Jimmy Dickens and I know
Brother Oswald, and those people know I care about 'em. Honestly
care about them and appreciate what they've done. And that's the
easiest way to tell them thank you, and to tell them that I do, to
go and be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill says he loves the fact that the Opry regulars aren't
concerned with chart positions and video shoots, like those who run
in Nashville's fast lane. ``I think everybody gets caught up in the
things that are very temporary, and that's the success of
themselves and their popularity,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fault people for being the way they are ... I just
like it. It's that simple. I wouldn't have the opportunities that I
have, and have had for the last 15, 16 years in this country music
world, if it hadn't have been for Roy Acuff out there at the Opry
every Saturday night, promoting it, supporting it, loving it. And
all those people love it. Think what the Opry'd be like if none of
those people went?''
</P>
<P>
   Gill's reputation as a nice guy precedes him in Nashville.
Before his divorce last year from singer Janis Gill, he had only
made headlines for his charity work. An avid golfer since his
teens, he lent his name to the city's biggest Pro-Celebrity golf
tournament. ``The Vinny'' supports Tennessee's Junior Golf program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that I'm any different than I've ever been,''
Gill explains. ``It maybe shocks people that having success and a
lot of those things hasn't really had an effect on me. It's not
something that I consciously say: 'You're going to be the nicest
guy in town.' I just respond to people and treat 'em decently.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a frequent guest performer on other artists'
recordings, from the well-known to the unknown. Last year, he
produced a song for his friend and frequent singing partner Patty
Loveless, and he was at the helm of Sonya Isaacs' debut album, due
out this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not gonna run from playing music,'' he says. ``I
just like playing music and singing songs. I think a whole lot of
it is the musician factor. Being a musician - I think that
mentality is pretty steeply ingrained in me.''
</P>
<P>
   He stops himself, then chuckles. ``Not all musicians are nice
guys. I just am what I am.''

TRYING TO GET DROWSY DRIVERS OFF THE HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some truck drivers drink coffee when they start to feel drowsy
during long hours on the road. Others pull over and take quick laps
around their trailers, naps in the back of their cabs or, in some
cases, amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   But some truckers do nothing, or feel nothing, until they simply
nod off at the wheel. The result is often an accident, sometimes
fatal to themselves and other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   As a remedy, the federal Department of Transportation is testing
devices that can monitor a driver's alertness and issue a warning
before it is too late. Officials say some of these instruments may
someday be required, though that day is probably many years off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truckers are by and large good drivers,'' said Ronald
Knipling, chief of the research division for the Federal Highway
Administration's Office of Motor Carriers and Highway Safety. ``But
they are pushing the hours.'' Sometimes, he added, the rules on how
long a trucker can drive at a time are not adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the instruments under development to combat drowsiness is
a pen-size infrared camera that would be mounted on the truck's
dashboard and would shine infrared light, which cannot be seen by
people, into the driver's eyes. It would measure the amount of
light reflected off the driver's retinas. When the level became too
low because of droopy eyelids, the camera could trigger a sound,
shake the driver's seat or release peppermint spray inside the cab.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators still have to determine what degree of eyelid droop
signifies fatigue. It may be difficult to arrive at a definitive
answer because people may not show fatigue in the same way and
because the shape of the eye and eyelid can vary from person to
person.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with an infrared camera is that it works only at
night. Sunshine makes the measurements unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, only 1 percent to 2 percent
of truck accidents are caused by drivers' falling asleep. But
Knipling suspects that fatigue contributes to many more accidents
by slowing drivers' reaction times and making drivers less alert.
</P>
<P>
   The government currently regulates fatigue in the trucking
industry indirectly, by limiting the number of hours a driver can
work. But Knipling said those laws could eventually be replaced by
rules saying that drivers can be on the road as long as technology
determines that they are alert.
</P>
<P>
   Another device in the works could alert drivers if they weave
between lanes. Called a lane tracker, it would watch the road and
beep if the driver had trouble steering a relatively straight line.
</P>
<P>
   To differentiate between an intended lane change and drowsiness,
the tracker would have to observe wobbly driving over several
minutes. Prototypes are still being debugged by private companies
and the final product is expected to be expensive, Knipling said.
</P>
<P>
   The devices that are ultimately successful will probably have to
cost less than $1,000 each, Knipling said. And alerting drivers to
their drowsiness will have to be done subtly, he said, because a
loud alarm could be distracting enough to cause an accident on its
own.

 (EDS: This is the first in a monthly decade-by-decade series
detailing the serious and silly changes in America's dining habits
during the last century.) IN THE EARLY 1900s, EATING HABITS RANGED
FROM GLUTTONY TO GOOD INTENTIONS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America strode into the 20th century proud of its industry, sure
of its science and cocky with its prosperity. It was a country with
an appetite for everything.
</P>
<P>
   One percent of the population controlled 50 percent of the
nation's wealth. For that segment, America was a land of plenty,
and the Diamond Jim Bradys of the world wanted more than their fair
share.
</P>
<P>
   For financier Brady, breakfast was eggs, breads, muffins, grits,
pancakes, steaks, chops, fried potatoes and a pitcher of orange
juice. At midmorning, he ate two or three dozen oysters for a
snack. His restaurant lunch (often at New York City's Delmonico's)
would be more oysters and clams, lobsters, crabs, a joint of meat,
pie and more orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was his focal point, however, where he'd again eat
three-dozen oysters, a dozen crabs, six or seven lobsters, terrapin
soup, a steak, coffee, a tray of pastries and 2 pounds of candy.
(When Brady died at 56, his stomach was said to be six times larger
than the average man's.)
</P>
<P>
   Brady was usually accompanied by his lover, Lillian Russell, a
popular stage actress. Russell is said to have eaten as much as
Brady, in addition to smoking 500 cigars a month.
</P>
<P>
   This couple was not alone in their conspicuous display of
caloric consumption. In 1903, the New York Riding Club hosted a
``horse dinner'' in the fourth-floor ballroom of Louis Sherry's
restaurant. Horses were brought to the room in the freight
elevators, hitched to a large dining table and fed oats while the
riders ate a 14-course dinner and sipped champagne out of bottles
stashed in the saddlebags.
</P>
<P>
   But not for the first time in Americans' table matters, and
certainly not the last, there was another segment of the population
eating a very different diet.
</P>
<P>
   William and John Kellogg had introduced cornflakes by the end of
the century and were promoting the cereal at their sanatorium at
Battle Creek, Mich. Later, a former patient of the sanatorium
introduced his take on the benefits of cereal with a beverage he
call Postum and started producing Grape-Nuts. All these products
were promoted as being healthful.
</P>
<P>
   Ah _ manna from heaven _ a breakfast food that didn't need to be
cooked. With fewer and fewer servants (they were finding more
lucrative work as clerks and telephone operators), this was a boon
to households. Also, middle-class America was becoming obsessed
with ``germs,'' a relatively new term that segued into the science
bent of the era's social reformers. These mass-produced cereals
were packaged and were perceived as cleaner than bulk foods
shoveled from bins.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had reason to be suspicious of their food supply. The
Pure Food and Drug Act was instituted in 1906 after the fallout
from the publication of Upton Sinclair's ``The Jungle'' and its
exposure of conditions in Chicago's slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Home economics came into being as a new class of reformers
decided America would be better off eating by the numbers. Food was
viewed as fuel, not fun, and was expected to provide function, not
pleasure. Like machines, the body must be properly fueled to
promote efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   (A lot of this thinking hit a positive note with middle-class
women who didn't relish more time in the kitchen.)
</P>
<P>
   Another time saver in the kitchen was the publication of Fanny
Merritt Farmer's ``Boston Cooking School Cook Book.'' Farmer is
credited with standardizing measures (instead of instructions like
``a knob of butter the size of a hen's egg'') and putting an
emphasis on simpler food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is not far distant when knowledge of the principles
of diet will be an essential part of one's education,'' she wrote.
``Then mankind will eat to live, will be able to do better mental
and physical work and disease will be less frequent.''
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, food was becoming much simpler and less
fussed with. The ``modern'' way to eat included canned goods,
gelatin salads and a breakfast more appropriate for an office
worker than a farmer.

FLORIDA AGENCY SEEKS COMMERCIAL DEALS FOR NOVEL USES OF CITRUS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By PAUL POWER JR.   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Florida citrus farmers have plowed hundreds of
thousands of dollars into trying to develop new food products that
might include orange or grapefruit as ingredients. After concocting
items such as orange-based barbecue sauces, fruit bars and a
pudding-like treat made from citrus pulp cells, food scientists
aligned with the Florida Department of Citrus are scouring the
country for companies that will take the prototypes from the lab to
American shopping carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to take some time,'' says Dan Santangelo,
executive director of the Lakeland-based citrus agency, which gets
nearly all of its $70 million budget from a tax on growers. ``We're
still excited about the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities are one thing; inking a deal is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to develop new commercial ways to use the state's
citrus products _ to stimulate demand for oranges and grapefruit
and thus profits for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Florida's oranges are squeezed into
orange juice, which is about a $3 billion market in the United
States. The remainder is sold fresh, though some by-products are
directed into flavors and essences.
</P>
<P>
   Executing hush-hush confidentiality agreements with dozens of
food companies, agency staff members have circled the country,
pitching novel food and ingredient uses _ from citrus salsa to
high-fiber orange flour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy task,'' says Don Zink, a former research and
development manager for Nestle USA. ``It can take a lot of selling,
especially if what you propose hasn't been looked at in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Citrus has been saying it is on the cusp of an
important deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the agency reported in an annual summary, ``A leading
food manufacturer has made a verbal commitment to introduce four
salad dressings and four sauces based on our prototype recipes
which will include at least 25 percent Florida citrus.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was a bit optimistic, but Santangelo says he is
still hopeful for a breakthrough with dressings or food sauces,
perhaps later this year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to break through is when a company's
competitor adds an adventuresome new taste or product, says Zink,
who now is food safety manager for Nestle. ``If that is perceived
as a possibility, other companies may follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunkist Growers Cooperative, which is based in Ontario, Calif.,
has boosted sales in other countries by licensing its name for
juices, snacks, vitamins, baking mixes, jellies and sodas.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus agency staffers in Florida have looked at similar
agreements, and Santangelo says he would like to see companies like
Nabisco and Pepperidge Farms using the state's citrus products.
</P>
<P>
   Under one arrangement, food companies would pay an as-yet
unspecified fee to use a ``Made with Florida Citrus'' label on
packages.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus agency's real intent appears to be to find ways to
use lots of orange juice in individual products.
</P>
<P>
   How much? Well, in the case of salad dressing, the group
envisions products with 25 percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo says he also was optimistic about citrus being used
in fruit bars.
</P>
<P>
   Though some potential uses of citrus sound far-fetched, it was
Department of Citrus scientists who were credited with devising a
way to pack frozen concentrated orange juice about 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, who came to the citrus agency about six years ago,
has tried to rekindle innovation, pushing the agency to investigate
processing technology using microwaves as well as new uses for
grapefruit and oranges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest obstacles the department's effort has run
into is turnover within food companies, Santangelo says. As soon as
a possible door is opened, it can close when key people are
reassigned or leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus agency is now approaching food scientists directly at
national conventions, says Bill Stinson, scientific research
director for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson can see a time when citrus is processed not for its
juice but for its health-enhancing compounds, a growing consumer
area called ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he believes the agency can find a commercial home
for new food uses. ``I think we are getting very, very close to
getting off the dime.''

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE LAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What Ails Camellia?
</P>
<P>
   Q. My mother has a camellia plant that is about 49 years old. It
has buds all over it every year. The buds, however, open only about
halfway, then the petals turn brown, and the buds fall off the
plant. Why does this happen? Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A. If the plant is growing somewhere near the northern edge of
its range, in southern New Jersey, for instance, it may simply be
getting blasted each year by frost. Many old-fashioned hardy
camellias (C. japonica) are vulnerable this way. And if the plant
is growing in a pot and being moved indoors for the winter, the bud
drop could be due to dry air. Camellias need higher humidity than
most living rooms provide.
</P>
<P>
   But if your mother's plant is a japonica, the most common kind,
and if it's living in what's called ``the camellia belt'' _ a more
or less frost-free zone that starts in southern Virginia, goes all
through the Deep South and then snakes along until it winds up in
the Pacific Northwest _ the problem is probably a fungus disease
called petal blight. Dr. William Ackerman, a research
horticulturist now retired from the Agriculture Department, said
that petal blight is epidemic through that area.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ways to deal with petal blight, said Dr.
Ackerman, who was Camellia at the National Arboretum in Washington.
The first is sanitation. If you can rake up and discard or burn all
fallen blossoms and buds as soon as they drop, you may be able to
prevent reinfection. Unfortunately, the spores also travel on the
wind, and ``cleanup won't help much,'' he said, unless the
neighbors for at least half a mile around are willing to work as
hard at it as you are.
</P>
<P>
   Solution 2 is to live outside the camellia belt _ the fungus
isn't a problem north of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Solution 3 is to plant a fall blooming species, which would be
less prone to blight. Japonicas are spring bloomers, with flowers
that come any time between January and May. Fall bloomers flower
between September and December. They include C. sasanqua, which is
almost as hardy as japonica, C. hiemalis, which is a bit more
tender, and most of the varieties developed by Dr. Ackerman, whose
introductions are among the hardiest, capable of surviving as far
north as Long Island and along the southern New England coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ackerman's camellias do not bear his name, but nurseries
that sell them usually point out their Ackerman lineage.

IN SOLITARY, BUT SATISFIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Ariz., N.Y.)  (mk)

<P>
   They have nothing in common and everything in common. ``We eat
over the sink and in bed, and sometimes at a table,'' said the
photographer Adrienne Salinger of people like herself who live
alone. ``We find things where we left them. We always know where
the good scissors are.''
</P>
<P>
   In her recent book, ``Living Solo'' (Andrews McMeel Publishing,
$18.95), Ms. Salinger _ no relation to J.D. _ investigates the
inner lives, dwelling places and somewhat eccentric indulgences of
people who, either by choice or circumstance, find themselves
living alone.
</P>
<P>
   They are an expanding tribe. The motley array of questers that
Ms. Salinger befriended at Laundromats, in department stores, in
bookstores, even at the side of the road, represent possibly the
first generation for which, in her words, ``living alone is
presumed to be a legitimate choice rather than a declaration of
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer perceived as simply a transient state with no respect,
solo living _ sometimes elegant, sometimes scraggly and unkempt _
is a statistical reality: The number of women living alone doubled
between 1970 and 1996, to 15 million, while the number of solitary
men tripled, to 10.3 million, the Census Bureau says.
</P>
<P>
   Among their ranks is Ms. Salinger, 42, an associate professor at
the University of New Mexico, who lives alone in a one-story adobe
house in Albuquerque with interiors that she calls ``fairly
neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated with how people define themselves in their
spaces,'' she said. ``People who live alone are marginalized in our
culture. But when you live alone, you're not compromised in your
space. Living with others, you develop a shorthand for
communicating. You don't consider your own life as clearly, because
you don't have to.'' Opening the shutters on 50 lives _ three of
them excerpted in their own words on this page _ Ms. Salinger finds
that they defy conventional expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Among her subjects are Judd Hostetler, who was dismissed from
his job as a bookkeeper after 22 years for doing a somersault, and
Anne Meredith, a Hollywood screenwriter, who is shown in Ms.
Salinger's photograph in front of an altar assembled from her
home's earthquake debris. She recalls the summer weekdays of her
youth on Cape Cod _ the ``unspoken conspiracy'' of women living a
``totally free and joyous life'' when their husbands were away.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger portrays divorcees, widowers, recovering heroin
addicts and alcoholics, a personal chef, a woman battling multiple
sclerosis alone in her bathroom. They are shown in rooms that are
at times at odds with their stories. Gordon Harrington, who served
two tours in Vietnam, stands in his living room surrounded by
rose-brocade balloon shades and lace curtains, holding his rifle
amid scented candles and a carved bunny on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on an unhappy marriage of 27 years, Abby Bayouth
observes that interiors don't always reveal inner truths. ``People
thought it was a very happy home,'' she says, ``because we had a
very beautiful house.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's decision to explore the lives of people she saw
grocery shopping _ people that ``you always assume don't have
complex inner lives, which is completely untrue'' _ evolved
gradually from her own solo life, though she acknowledged the down
side: ``When you're sick and want someone to take care of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an artist and a furniture manufacturer who now
live in Sedona, Ariz., and ``have the perfect relationship,'' she
said, Ms. Salinger grew up in Los Angeles and San Francisco and
worked briefly as a pastry chef before getting a master of fine
arts degree at the Chicago Art Institute. She taught at Syracuse
University and moved to Albuquerque a year and a half ago. ``I
wanted to change my life, so I just kind of did it,'' she said. ``I
didn't want to be one of those people who stayed in the same place
forever. Those people just become bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is her second book. The first was ``In My Room:
Teen-Agers in Their Bedrooms,'' Chronicle Books, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became interested in whether or not we are in fact a
group,'' she said. ``It's not that simple, because there are 25
million of us living alone. Yet, we're invisible.'' She began her
odyssey, in which she trekked across the country with a 4-by-5 view
camera, by photographing herself in her own home, surrounded by
hundreds of books whose spines remained obsessively unbroken. ``I
was appalled,'' she said of how she looked. ``Which anyone would be
unless they're Gwyneth Paltrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger, who relishes the ``terrifying invasion'' of
photographing people at home, has lived alone on and off since
college. She is not committed to the solitary life and is involved
with someone, but finds lone souls to be more open and articulate
about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In her view, eccentricity has gotten a bad rap, and even the
loopiest characters have profundities to reveal. ``The reason my
marriages didn't work is because I was very much involved in
cocktails,'' says Vivian Grace, a former alcoholic turned substance
abuse counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Such solo fliers have been largely unheralded until now. ``It
takes an enormous amount of courage to live alone,'' Ms. Salinger
said. ``You have no escape from looking at yourself.''

SUITED-UP SOFAS: SHOES AND BAG TO MATCH? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID COLEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not since the resourceful Scarlett O'Hara swept down
the grand stair in a red velvet gown made from Tara's drapes has
fashion enjoyed such an intimate affair with the decor tastes of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   From luxe cashmeres to of-the-moment Ultrasuede, upholstery and
decorative home textiles are in the middle of a rare burst of
synergy: some of the most popular new fabrics are remarkably
similar to those on fashion's runways.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise, given how many fashion designers
are proclaiming fervent passions for high-tech stretch nylons or
blanket-weight cashmeres. And decorators, too, should know their
textiles, haunting the swatch-strewn halls of fabric showrooms as
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Area I.D., a new furnishings store at 262 Elizabeth St., quickly
laid claim to the trend. The owner, Debra LaChance, reupholsters
her mid-century-modern pieces in matte jersey, cashmere and other
clothing fabrics, tracking down the same fabrics used by Isaac
Mizrahi, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan. A 1974 Herman Miller
sectional ($800 a piece) wears skintight black nylon Mizrahi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for pieces with great bones,'' said Ms. LaChance, a
former fashion consultant. ``And we reupholster them in the newest,
greatest fabrics we can find.'' A 1950s sofa in washable Ultrasuede
is $2,400.
</P>
<P>
   At Wyeth, 151 Franklin St., the owner, John Birch, said that he
has been reupholstering ``almost 100 percent'' of the modern
furniture his store stocks in clothing fabric _ from chairs in
military-inspired olive twill to sofas in Scottish keeper's tweed
(pieces start at $6,000). Birch, who has worked in store and
display design for Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani, has equally
fashion-conscious customers, including the designer Helmut Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Birch was inspired to start using clothing fabric for upholstery
by his own search last year for a steady hotel room in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was so upholstered,'' he said, making it sound like
a synonym for infested. ``I don't want to sit on something that
makes me feel like I'm in a flower patch. I'm accustomed to
clothing fabrics. They're more livable.''
</P>
<P>
   While the vogue for extreme minimalist decor is on the wane, the
Spartan color palette of white, gray and camel inspired by Lang,
Jil Sander and Calvin Klein is now waxing at the D.&AMP; D. Building,
that citadel of prints at 979 Third Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray flannel was definitely hard to find a couple of years
ago,'' Tom Beeton, a Los Angeles decorator, said, by way of
example. ``Now you can go to any number of sources. It's much
easier to find.''
</P>
<P>
   ogers &AMP; Goffigon, a to-the-trade fabric showroom in the D.&AMP; D.
Building known for its small but luxurious selection of
blanket-like wool and cashmere upholstery flannels, expanded its
range of grays last month in response to customer demand. (List
prices: $78 a yard for wool; $427 for cashmere). Color was just
part of this fashion-conscious decision, said Jack Flynn, a
co-owner. ``We're interested in fine weaving, which is not always
the focus of our industry,'' he said. ``I think that upholstery
fabrics should feel as good as they look.''
</P>
<P>
   At Nancy Corzine, another to-the-trade company in the D.&AMP; D.
Building, it is simple, rich camel hair ($96 a yard) and gray
cashmere flannel ($270 a yard) that are among the biggest
upholstery sellers. ``We just covered all of Luther Vandross'
apartment with it,'' said Ms. Corzine, brandishing the flannel.
</P>
<P>
   Beeton finds such kindred spirits among textile suppliers still
relatively rare. He lucked across a bolt of the sturdy nylon that
Prada uses for its famous backpacks at a giant fabric wholesaler.
Corzine and Donghia (also in the D.&AMP; D. Building), he said, are
among the few fabric companies in step with the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Without Rogers &AMP; Goffigon, Victoria Hagan, the interior
designer, said she'd be at a loss for fabric. She also goes to the
source, textile houses like Rosen &AMP; Chadick, at 240 W. 40th St.
Open to any and all, Rosen &AMP; Chadick has a wide range of
clothing-based textiles. Ms. Hagan has used striped men's suiting
and shirting fabrics for upholstery and for wall treatments. ``It
lends a room a different kind of formality, one that's not so
commercial,'' said Wayne Nathan, a designer with Ms. Hagan.
(Prices: $30 a yard for flannel; $60 for camel hair; $125 to $150
for cashmere).
</P>
<P>
   Some fashion fabrics _ taffeta, for example _ are not ideal with
energetic children or rambunctious pets. ``With some of these
fabrics, you're making a decision between fashion and durability,''
Ms. LaChance admitted. David Chadick, an owner of Rosen &AMP; Chadick,
said: ``If you're upholstering a sofa in camel hair or cashmere,
it's more for show. You're not going to want to sit on it all the
time.'' (The same goes for other fabrics like Shantung and dupioni
silk). They can pill and bag, and maintenance isn't easy. ``Dry
clean only,'' Chadick said.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion conscious may be glad of such shortcomings: all the
more reason to redecorate. As they say of trends on Seventh Avenue,
there's one born every minute.

ALBUM BRINGS OUT THE KID IN LITHGOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NANCY HEWITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
 
LOS ANGELES _ John Lithgow has just added a notch to his
well-rounded performing belt: singer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Singin' in the Bathtub'' marks Lithgow's foray into the
musical world of family entertainment. This compilation of 16 songs
is not what you'd expect of an album geared to kids and their
folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're old novelty songs,'' he says. ``Some are more than 50
years old. We keyed off songs I loved as a child, because of their
clever lyrics. They're irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   The album came as an outgrowth of Lithgow's love of entertaining
children. In 1990, he did a live performance for 30 kids with only
his guitar for accompaniment _ and loved it. ``Doing it
(performing) for kids live is a real ball,'' he says. ``They get up
and dance while I'm singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Television audiences have gotten to know him as the high
commander of an alien expedition in the NBC sitcom ``3rd Rock From
the Sun'' and spokesman for a long-distance telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, this soft-spoken actor was known mainly for
Oscar-nominated roles in films such as ``The World According to
Garp'' and ``Terms of Endearment'' and stage roles in dramas such
as ``M Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lithgow is no stranger to television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he won the first of three Emmy awards for ``The Doll,''
an episode of Steven Spielberg's ``Amazing Stories.'' His second
and third Emmys came in 1996 and 1997 for his role as ``3rd
Rock's'' Dick Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Working on an album was a challenge for the actor, who fit in
rehearsals and recordings between tapings of ``3rd Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a couple of months breaking in songs,'' he says,
noting that this included performing them for small groups to gauge
reaction. Then, he headed into the studio from September through
November of last year. ``In planning the album, everything was
dependent on my schedule. We decided it had to be first-rate.''
</P>
<P>
   This mix of old but familiar songs includes such standards as
``At the Codfish Ball'' and ``Swinging on a Star.'' But Lithgow
admits to a few favorites of his own. ``I love `Singin' in the
Bathtub,' `Everybody Eats When They Come to My House'' and
`Triplets,' which is an old Danny Kaye song. Kids love songs about
siblings.''
</P>
<P>
   And even before the release of his first album, Lithgow is
already planning a second one, and is on the hunt for more curious
songs.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he would like to do some live performances _ regularly
_ and mentioned UCLA's Royce Hall as a possible location for a
concert this year. ``The idea is to create a yearly tradition at
big venues like Royce Hall,'' he says. ``I really want to do
concerts and sing with the band.'' The band he refers to is Bill
Elliott's Swing Orchestra, which accompanies him on the album.
</P>
<P>
   And performing for families holds real appeal. Part of it is
``the thrill of singing these songs with a big band,'' he says. The
other part is that he loves swing music and loves to entertain.
``Kids nowadays are so into swing (music). You feel like dancing to
it.''

A $1,000 WEEKEND: THE RIGHT PACE IN SAN ANTONIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
 (bl)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texans like their weekends, whether it's bobbing around in a
bass boat in East Texas, promenading along the strand in Galveston
or riding the trail on a Hill Country dude ranch. But San Antonio
has got to be the king of the weekend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This city of just over 1 million people is just the right
distance from most of the state's population centers to feel like a
real journey, and it's got just the right number of attractions to
last two or three days at an easy pace.
</P>
<P>
   It's also refreshingly different from almost every other place
in Texas, a kind of Spanish colonial theme park with good
restaurants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio seems to swell on the weekends, at least in its
tourist precincts. While a lot of the city's visitors come for the
endless procession of conventions _ people wearing name tags are
bumping into each other 365 days a year down on the Riverwalk _ the
weekenders make San Antonio bulge.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My assignment here _ a weekend in San Antonio with my wife,
Barbara Whitaker, and two daughters, Kate, 9, and Laura, 3,
spending as close to $1,000 as possible _ seemed a little daunting
at first. San Antonio is not an expensive city and while it does
have several first-class hotels, even they are priced well below
what a medium-priced hotel would cost in New York or Los Angeles.
But one must never, of course, underestimate the American family's
ability to spend money.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My first inclination was to stay at Le Mansion del Rio, the
fanciest of the hotels right down in the thick of the Riverwalk,
the city's central showpiece, where shops and restaurants line the
concrete banks of the San Antonio River just below street level,
spanned by graceful Spanish-style bridges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Le Mansion del Rio was all booked up. My experience is that
Le Mansion del Rio is always booked up. I have tried on six
different trips to stay there and the answer is always, sorry,
better luck next time. Too bad, it looks like a nice place.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we went for the Hyatt Regency Hill Country Resort,
which is an entirely different sort of San Antonio experience.
Situated just outside the Interstate loop that surrounds the city
and across the highway from Sea World (closed for the winter), it
is set in a thickly wooded and gently rolling enclave that was once
a ranch and is now home to the sprawling, Western-style hotel, an
18-hole golf course, two swimming pools and an 18-acre water park
that includes a meandering man-made stream for tubing, slides,
waterfalls, a short stretch of sandy beach and a couple of hot
tubs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The standard room that we were offered was $210 a night, but
this didn't seem like enough to get us to our $1,000 limit so I
asked about upgrade packages. Yes, they said, there is a romance
weekend champagne package that comes with a bottle of champagne,
valet parking and free breakfasts. Fine, I said, but when we got
there it turned out that the package was $198, cheaper than the
nonchampagne fare. Go figure.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We arrived just after dark, too late to drive into San Antonio
that evening, so we decided to eat at the resort and wander around.
The room was small but nicely appointed, with sturdy furniture of a
Western theme and a balcony overlooking the gardens, and it never
seemed cramped, despite the two children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Antlers, the resort's fancy restaurant near the golf clubhouse,
is dominated by a huge chandelier made of interwoven deer antlers
and the menu was a mouthwatering mix of Southwestern and
Continental fare. But it was all booked up. So we wandered down to
the Springhouse Cafe, the moderately priced restaurant. So far, all
I'd spent was $5 to tip the bellhop, and every effort to live it up
first class had been met with frustration. That $1,000 was looking
more and more elusive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, we managed to do all right at the Springhouse Cafe,
spending $74.27 for dinner, including the seafood buffet and a
couple of glasses of wine for the adults and ribs and a hamburger
for our daughters. On the way out, we dropped another $10.29 at the
resort's general store, a soup-to-nuts emporium geared to making it
possible to spend several days at the resort without ever leaving
to buy anything. We got milk and cereal for early morning
emergencies and a couple of Haagen-Dazs bars. The ice cream went
well with that bottle of champagne, which, sadly, was domestic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Total for day one: $287.56. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word among Texas parents on the Hill Country Resort is that
it's a great place to take the family, especially if there is at
least one golfer in the group, and that it's a place you can spend
the entire weekend happily without leaving. None of us were
golfers, but the rest seemed true. At least, if the weather had
been warmer. But it was a bit too chilly to contemplate tubing.
Only the heated pool, steaming ominously in the brisk morning air,
was remotely tempting and both girls plunged in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The resort's grounds are lovely: thickly wooded and crisscrossed
with meandering paths for walkers and bikers. While it may not be
as sharply rolling as the more dramatic Hill Country farther to the
northwest, it has the same sort of flavor, with twisted Texas trees
and wide open spaces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had to hustle the girls out of the pool, though, because it
had one drawback: it was free. And breakfast had been free, too. We
had to start spending money fast. The day was wasting.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We drove into downtown San Antonio, a 20-minute trip, and parked
at the Rivercenter Mall, a retail complex at the foot of a towering
Marriott hotel at the eastern end of the Riverwalk system. Our goal
was the IMAX theater, where they show a film called ``Alamo: The
Price of Freedom,'' which we had been reliably informed was a
pretty good introduction to the story of the Alamo and a way to get
your children more excited about seeing the place.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I bought a map of the city ($5.33) and Kate, my 9-year-old,
bought two postcards (54 cents) before we came to one of those mall
stores that sell candy. You grab an empty plastic bag and fill it
up yourself from dozens of plastic tubs of candy. Normally, we
steer clear of such places but this time, why not? Everybody got a
bag. Licorice, gummy things, nuts, ribbon candy, chocolate. Total
cost: $8.15.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the movie, which was a little less informed on the
strategy of the battle and a little more rah-rah than I would have
liked, were $7.50 for the adults and $4.75 for the children, and it
lasted about 45 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From there it was a short walk to the far end of the mall,
downstairs and around the corner to the Menger Hotel, where Teddy
Roosevelt gave a rousing speech recruiting Rough Riders. The
historic Menger bar is said to be modeled on the one in the House
of Lords in London.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just outside and across the street is the Alamo, or what's left
of it. The famous chapel facade is there, suitably aged and almost
vibrating with mythic intensity. The facility is owned by the state
of Texas but run by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, the
group that a century ago fought to save the crumbling old structure
and turn it into a shrine to Texas independence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The little side rooms have become secular chapels honoring the
men who fought and died there, complete with flags and pageantry,
and the display cases around the central nave are filled with
memorabilia and items linked to the most famous of the Alamo's
defenders, William Travis, Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An adjacent building holds a museum with more artifacts, as well
as a cogent history of the city and the site. And the jam-packed
gift shop contains as many books, toy soldiers and coonskin caps as
any family could possibly want. But the line was too long, so we
passed. The Alamo is free, though I did slip $5 into a donation
bin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We hustled down to the Riverwalk, a couple of blocks away, to
blow some cash. We walked up and down, trying to figure out where
to eat, finally settling on a faux British pub called Kangaroo
Court. Fish and chips and hamburgers, plus a couple of beers, set
us back $49.11. We were not reminded of London. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BacK at the Hill Country Resort, Barbara and the girls hit the
pool again and I bought a cigar ($8) and sat out on Aunt Mary's
Porch, a wooden platform on the north side of the central lobby
overlooking the woods and a very pleasant place to read a book or
have a margarita.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That evening we had booked a table for a river barge dinner
along the Riverwalk put on by Boudro's, one of best of the
Riverwalk restaurants, specializing in a kind of cross between
Southwest and Cajun. We paid for parking ($5) and got there early,
so we stopped next door at a cafe called Republic of Texas for some
drinks ($10.16) before beginning our candlelit float around the
Riverwalk. It went over big with everyone. The food was terrific
(steak in a chipotle sauce or a grilled and glazed salmon) and the
passing scene _ mariachi bands, crowded riverside cafes, colored
lights and hordes of strolling tourists _ was fascinating. We chose
a decent bottle of wine and it brought the total tab to $171.33. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we walked back to the Alamo and hired a horse-drawn
carriage to clomp us around the old, dark city for 25 minutes ($30
with tip). The narrow downtown streets, Gothic skyscrapers next to
modern cubes and the occasional silhouette of a Spanish church, are
strangely empty at night. All the action is down on the Riverwalk,
all around but out of sight, except for those moments when the
carriage passes over a bridge and the light bleeds up from below
along with the crowd noise and the music, and it's like passing
near a party to which you are not invited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this was more like it. Total tab for the day: $515.12 ($198
for the room and $317.12 for other stuff).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our final morning, we had our usual free breakfast (coffee,
juice and pastries, plus the last of the cereal) and took turns
watching the girls. I got a massage at the health center ($75
including tip) and Barbara got a manicure ($36). For their morning
treat, the girls got another swim in the steaming pool and one
stuffed animal each from the gift shop ($23.38). Then we packed up
and hit the road (the bellhop got a $10 tip this time and the valet
got $5), stopping on the way out of town for a big Mexican lunch at
a place I like called La Fogata in an otherwise unremarkable

CLINTON'S LAWYER CALLS FOR END OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for President Clinton urged Congress
Wednesday to kill the independent counsel law, which he called the
``nuclear weapon'' of partisan politics, but a former Watergate
prosecutor said the statute protects Americans against the White
House's powerful ``spin machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, who represented the president in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit, told a Senate panel, ``The act has
become a vehicle for subjecting public officials, and those around
them, to seemingly perpetual scrutiny more intense than any private
citizen would have to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the law's ``hair-trigger'' provision for appointing
a special prosecutor means that even the most ``flimsy''
allegations put forth by either party must be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than freeing prosecutorial discretion from political
bias, the act has become the nuclear weapon in the arsenal of
partisan politics,'' he told the Senate Government Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett also said the statute has ``ruined'' the lives of many
innocent people who have run up enormous legal bills in the course
of independent counsel investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal people just can't afford to keep a lawyer around for
the many years that it takes to end these investigations,'' he said
in calling on Congress to the let the law expire on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Ruth, former head of the Watergate Special Prosecution
Force in the early 1970s, told the panel that the independent
counsel act was needed to protect the country from the modern
public relations tactics of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my fear that the White House spin machine could lead one
to believe that another Saturday Night Massacre could succeed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday Night Massacre refers to the night of Oct. 20,
1973, when President Richard Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot
Richardson to dismiss special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox
after Cox refused to drop a subpoena for Nixon's incriminating
White House tapes. Nixon also ordered Ruth's office abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson refused to follow the orders and resigned. Nixon then
asked Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox, but
Ruckelshaus also refused, leading to his own dismissal. After two
days, Cox was fired, but the Justice Department investigation of
Nixon continued, and Ruth's office remained in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe how thin the line was during those days
as to whether our office was going to be eliminated,'' Ruth said.
</P>
<P>
   Public outrage over Cox's firing and later over the tapes'
revelations of Nixon's other actions obstructing justice eventually
led to his resignation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who
favors keeping an amended independent counsel act, said: ``You have
to wonder if Nixon had done a spin job on Cox, would there have
been a public outcry over his firing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress passed the
independent counsel act in 1978 to ensure that presidents would be
fairly investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the attorney general to seek appointment of an
independent counsel when there is substantial and credible evidence
of a crime by any one of 49 top federal officials, including the
president. A panel of three federal appellate judges then picks an
attorney for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans opposed the law when it was passed and later
cited as an example of a politically inspired investigation the
probe by Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh into the Iran-Contra
arms-for-hostages deals of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when a three-judge panel appointed Kenneth Starr to
investigate Clinton, Democrats have repeated the GOP criticisms of
the law.
</P>
<P>
   But while the statute has lost favor with many in Congress,
several members of the Senate committee said Wednesday it is needed
to ensure that the public remains confident that investigations of
high-level officials are fair and complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing that's going to keep this law around,
it's that we can't go back _ that the public expects some type of
mechanism to investigate the president that is without reproach,''
said Sen. Fred Thompson, committee chairman.

18 WHEELS, GPS AND RADAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Wis., Neb.)   (af)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONTARIO, Calif. _ The air outside the TA Trucking Center was
laced with more than diesel fumes from the hundreds of 18-wheelers
parked in neat rows at this interstate crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   As drivers finished their dinners, they rumbled out of the
parking lot, but not out of touch, because their satellite dishes
and computers kept them linked to headquarters with radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks are also equipped with sensors and alarms that warn
them of potential crashes. The result is truck dashboards that look
like cockpits. Even though some people may think of long-haul
trucks as no more sophisticated than Studebakers, many of them rely
on technology that far exceeds what is available in the most
expensive Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucks have changed so much since I started driving that it's
like the difference between covered wagons and jet planes,'' said
Marilyn Cochrane, a neatly coiffed and manicured driver with 17
years of experience who looks nothing at all like the
rough-and-tumble image of the long-distance trucker.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is her truck all horsepower and no finesse. She spoke as she
drove in a light drizzle past the Los Angeles suburbs on Interstate
10 in a truck equipped with digital monitors and an array of
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the trucking industry praise these devices for improving
safety, insuring that loads arrive on time and increasing drivers'
comfort. The technology can be expensive and requires extra
maintenance, but trucking companies say it pays for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers, however, say the gadgets have changed their
profession for the worse. Now that trucks can be tracked by
satellite and even tailgating can be recorded for a boss to review,
some drivers complain about the vanishing independence of life on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry's transformation is readily apparent in
the shiny red rig Ms. Cochrane drives. It is equipped with flashing
lights and electronic buzzers that warn her when cars are getting
too close.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm system depends on two sensors. One, on the front
bumper, looks with radar for obstructions in the lanes ahead, while
another monitors the blind spot near the cab's passenger door.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cochrane said this system, built by Eaton Vorad
Technologies, of San Diego, has helped her avert crashes on several
occasions, like the time a car passed her on the highway shoulder.
But on this day, the chimes and flashing lights were often set off
when things were fine _ going off, for example, when Ms. Cochrane
waited behind a car at a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK baby, I hear you,'' she said, patting the dashboard after
one such series of beeps. ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though false alarms are common, Max L. Fuller, co-chairman
of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, the parent company of U.S. Xpress, Ms.
Cochrane's employer, said that collision-avoidance technology was
worthwhile and had helped reduce the cost of accidents for the
company by nearly two-thirds in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The system also acts as a sort of back-seat driver by recording
the performance of the person behind the wheel. It tracks how often
drivers use the brakes and how closely they follow cars on the
highway so the information can be downloaded, by inserting a memory
card into the truck's computer, and analyzed by company management.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these reviews, some drivers have been warned
about tailgating, said Fuller, whose company is based in
Chattanooga, Tenn. Those who are especially aggressive must take
driving classes to reduce the risk of getting into an accident or
causing too much wear on their rigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that isn't enough, they need to go to another company,''
Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   One remedy for drivers who follow others too closely _ or an
option for those who want make driving as effortless as possible _
is to add what is called a Smart Cruise control. That feature, part
of the Eaton Vorad system, can be set to keep the truck from
getting any closer to another vehicle than the distance the truck
could travel in a fixed time period, like three seconds. The driver
does not have to touch the brakes or gas; Smart Cruise takes care
of it.
</P>
<P>
   If the truck is too close to the car ahead, the device
automatically slows the truck's engine, and, if that is not enough,
downshifts the transmission.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone seeking to escape the world of keyboards and e-mail,
trucking is probably not the answer. On-board computers that
connect drivers to dispatchers via satellite are perhaps the most
common technology on trucks these days.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study in 1998 by the American Trucking
Associations, 72 percent of major trucking companies have computers
aboard at least some of their rigs. But the overall figure is
probably much lower because only 6 percent of small trucking
companies have similar equipment.
</P>
<P>
   With computers, a driver (while parked) can, for example, send
headquarters a message when picking up a load, receive directions
and get instructions about the next assignment. The typing often
includes abbreviations because after a certain point, companies
must pay extra for each letter and blank space that is transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ms. Cochrane was about to put her truck in gear, a beep
sounded in the cab to tell her that e-mail had arrived. She reached
over to the keyboard in front of the passenger's seat, looked at
the tiny screen and read a motivational message from a company
executive that was probably sent to every driver in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``As U know, freight gets a little soft this time of year,'' the
message said, referring to the typical slowdown during winter.
``Our service must be flawless.''
</P>
<P>
   Many on-board computers come with Global Positioning System
technology that allows companies to know where their trucks are at
all times. With some systems, it is quite clear when a lazy driver
is parked at the beach instead of rolling through the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The information that arrives at the home office of the Schneider
National trucking company, in Green Bay, Wis., is so detailed that
trucks appear as dots moving along city streets on maps on a
computer screen. The system helps determine areas where the company
has too few trucks and can find stolen trucks.
</P>
<P>
   One such case involved a trailer full of Levis. ``Fortunately,
the thief didn't know that the truck was satellite-monitored,''
said Donald J. Schneider, president of Schneider National. ``The
police knew exactly where the truck was the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Trucking executives say GPS devices are necessary because the
value of cargo in a single trailer can easily surpass the price of
several houses. The information allows clients to know how soon
their goods will arrive, a significant point because many car
manufacturers and groceries keep costs down by keeping very little
in warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Before GPS technology and on-board computers became common on
trucks, drivers frequently had to telephone headquarters to tell
dispatchers where they were and when they had dropped off their
loads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without global positioning, you're at the driver's mercy,''
said Dick Reiser, executive vice president and general counsel for
Werner Enterprises, a trucking company based in Omaha. ``They might
call and say they were in Denver, but they really might be in
Cheyenne or Salt Lake City. We wouldn't really know.''
</P>
<P>
   While many drivers have embraced the infusion of technology into
their profession in recent years, others are quite critical. Jeff
Allen, who owns his own truck cab and travels with a pet rabbit in
the passenger's seat, has a television, a VCR and a microwave in
the back of his cab, but there were no gadgets on his dashboard to
speak of that could be seen recently under the soda cans and food
wrappers that had accumulated in two weeks on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the TA truck stop, Allen said it was no one's
business what he was doing as long as he did not get into an
accident. But that attitude is more a matter of principle, he said,
than an effort to hide illegality. ``If my company is going to dial
me up 24 hours a day, it's an invasion of my privacy,'' Allen said.
``When I'm in my truck, I'm in my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies provide computer technology to contract drivers,
and some require that drivers hired on contracts provide their own
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Allen once worked for a company that tracked his whereabouts
electronically. In response, he occasionally taped a metal bucket
over the satellite dish on the back of his tractor to block the
signal.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's dispatcher asked about his communications gaps only
once. In that case, he was trying to hide the fact that he was
behind schedule and was speeding to make up time. ``They asked: `We
were tracking you and you were in Los Angeles, then we looked and
you were in Flagstaff. What happened?''' Allen recalled. ``I told
them I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of technologies seemed to get universal approval from
the nearly dozen truckers interviewed at the truck stop. They all
liked the prepass cards that allow drivers in good standing to
avoid waiting in line at many state inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
   If trucks are equipped with the cards, which act like radio-wave
transponders, drivers can roll by on the freeway without stopping.
Computers in the inspection station automatically recognize the
truck by scanning from a distance the prepass card mounted on the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Equipping a truck with the latest technology does not come
cheap. Computers and sensors can add nearly $15,000 to the cost of
a tractor (which pulls the trailer); a tractor sells for about
$120,000 without these new bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, satellite systems do fail, and computers do crash.
And some trucking companies stick to the simpler forms of
communication technology: cellular phones, CB radios and beepers,
which all have limited ranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technologies are good, but they can only do so much,'' said
Fuller, of U.S. Xpress. ``If you hire the right driver, they can
exceed whatever technology you can put in place.''

   Q: What is the difference (besides price and size) between
regular monitors and the new flat ones?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: There are many complex issues involved, but perhaps the
biggest difference between conventional desktop computer monitors
and the new flat-panel displays is that they use different
technologies to display images. Most desktop monitors use
cathode-ray tubes, or CRTs. A CRT monitor gets its illumination
from three electron guns firing at the phosphor-coated glass
screen. Because of all the internal hardware, CRTs tend to be
large, hot and bulky. They also flicker more.
</P>
<P>
   Like laptops, the flat-panel displays use liquid-crystal display
(LCD) technology. An LCD screen is illuminated by a fluorescent
backlight. These monitors have been known to cause less eye fatigue
than a CRT monitor. The new flat-panel displays cost much more than
CRT monitors, take up much less room and flicker less.
</P>
<P>
   While LCD screens have often been accused of having inconsistent
color and fuzzier pictures, several manufacturers have come up with
prototypes that have pictures sharper and clearer than those on CRT
screens. If you are making a purchase and want to read some reviews

CLINTON LAWYER URGES CONGRESS TO ABANDON INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for President Clinton said Wednesday that
after years of supporting the independent counsel statute he now
views it as a legal ``nuclear weapon'' that cannot be fixed and
should be allowed to lapse when it expires later this year.
</P>
<P>
   At a Senate hearing, the lawyer, Robert S. Bennett said:
``Rather than freeing prosecutorial discretion from political bias,
the act has become yet another weapon, indeed a nuclear weapon in
the arsenal of partisan politics. Partisan politics infects every
phase of the process. The public now views the independent counsel
process as largely a political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is a veteran Washington defense lawyer who has
represented Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
Bennett has for years defended officials caught up in independent
counsel inquiries, including top Republicans, like former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger, and Democrats, like former White House
Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett told the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is
considering reauthorization of the statute that beyond allowing the
law to die, that existing independent counsels should be shut down
and their work turned over to the Justice Department when the law
expires.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law, enacted in 1978 as an important
post-Watergate reform, was designed to remove politics from
inquiries of high-level executive branch officials. But instead,
lawmakers from both parties have assailed the law as a political
vehicle to use against presidents and their high level appointees.
</P>
<P>
   But at Wednesday's hearing, senators expressed reservations
about eliminating the independent counsel law altogether, primarily
because such a move would leave the Justice Department with a
greater role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to begin preparing eulogies,'' said Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., who has urged colleagues to look for ways to
change the law instead of killing it.
</P>
<P>
   If independent counsel law was abandoned, Attorney General Janet
Reno would wield greater authority in politically sensitive cases
involving high level officials. But Republican lawmakers have long
questioned her objectivity, bitterly criticizing Reno for
protecting the Clinton administration when she repeatedly refused
to seek an independent prosecutor in the campaign finance case.
</P>
<P>
   But Nathan Lewin, an attorney who represented former Attorney
General Edwin Meese III when Meese's financial dealings were
investigated by an independent counsel, said the law should be
maintained in some form. Lewin said that in Meese's case, a
decision by the independent counsel not to charge Meese with a
crime was a far more powerful statement than if it had come from
any official at the Justice Department.

   OLY-USOC-REACT _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Olympic Committee wants
the White House to place the scandal-ridden IOC under federal laws
that will force leaders of the games to live up to the ``noble
ideals they profess.'' Saying strong action was needed to avoid
``the loss of the Olympic Games,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said
today he would ask President Clinton that the IOC be identified as
a public international organization under the Federal Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. He said he expected other nations ``to
support this initiative as an important way to truly level the
playing field'' for all cities seeking to stage the Olympics. Hybl
said the USOC's executive committee had approved all the
recommendations made by the ethics panel led by former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell. (Foskett, Atlanta

basketball circles this season. In a league long dominated by
Kentucky, several teams appear ready to challenge the Wildcats for

Kentucky at the top of the SEC East and Mike Miller was one of
several freshmen who helped Florida contend for the Eastern

jams trying to get to the track. Home at last. Return to the

 &HT;    Online banking seen as a blueprint for change
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine a financial secretary who keeps track of your
bills, pays them when due _ and lives on the Internet or the hard
drive of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   That's the promise of electronic banking: to automate the
routine chores of paying bills, checking bank balances and
balancing your checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   After years of false starts, the software and financial industry
are starting to deliver on that promise. Today, if you have a
computer and a modem, you can pay bills electronically. You also
can check on bank and credit card balances, stop payment on
electronic checks and send messages to your bank.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic ways to bank electronically. First, you can
do so directly through the Internet. Banks such as NationsBank and
Wachovia let you perform most banking services through a Web page.
Those services include viewing statements and paying bills.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need any special software, other than a Web browser,
and can view your banking statements from any computer, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Your second choice is you can bank online through a software
package such as Quicken or Microsoft Money. First Union and
SunTrust are banks that use this method. You have to first buy the
software, which typically sells for between $40 and $60.
</P>
<P>
   The software, using a modem in your computer, contacts the bank.
The bank then sends your banking information electronically into
the software.
</P>
<P>
   How well does electronic banking work? For the past year, I have
been testing it as a consumer. I used the popular personal finance
software Quicken. With it, I paid bills and maintained an
electronic banking account with SunTrust Bank, based in downtown
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust will not say how many electronic banking customers it
has, but officials say the number is higher than they expected.
``We're been very pleased with the results so far,'' says John
McGuire, president and chief executive of SunTrust Online.
</P>
<P>
   He says SunTrust will add a Web-based banking service this
summer similar to that offered by competitors NationsBank and
Wachovia. ``I think the market is right to make a move to the
Internet,'' says McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   I found SunTrust's service, which is representative of what
other banks and software companies are offering, to be secure and
reliable. Not once did either SunTrust or Quicken misstate my
balance, make incorrect charges against my account or lose any of
my money. Every charge I made, whether by check or debit card, was
recorded in my electronic balance.
</P>
<P>
   But electronic banking is far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
   For one, your electronic balance often is not up to date. The
reason is twofold.
</P>
<P>
   Most merchants don't accept electronic payments, says Celia
Saino, Intuit's product manager for the Mac version of Quicken.
Saino says Quicken or SunTrust must pay them by check, which adds
four to five days to the time between when you pay and the payment
clears your bank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, SunTrust and other banks typically wait at least 24
hours before updating your electronic balance, says Saino.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken also can't identify written checks. What you'll see in
your electronic statement is that check number so and so has
cleared _ but it does not identify who cashed the check.
</P>
<P>
   While not as bad, debit card purchases also can be hard to
identify. Often what shows up in your statement is not a merchant's
name but an unintelligible string of numbers or an address.
</P>
<P>
   I have one monthly payment, my mortgage, that Quicken always
fails to recognize and reconcile with my electronic checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   In short, electronic banking is for the patient and forgiving,
and for those who like trying the newest thing. If that describes
you, here's what you'll need to bank electronically:
</P>
<P>
   I'd recommend a computer with the most modern operating system.
That means System 8.5 with the Mac and Windows 98 with PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Next you'll need a modem, the device that lets your computer
communicate with other computers through a telephone line. Modems
are either built into computers or sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   All electronic banking programs work through software. With
Internet banks, that software is embedded in the Web page and is
invisible to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't choose an Internet bank, you'll need to buy one of
the personal finance programs mentioned earlier. Each program walks
you through the process of setting up electronic bill payment and
banking. You don't need a bank to pay your bills electronically.
These programs have their own services that enable that.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll need a bank to do anything more than bill paying.
Each of these programs has a list of participating banks. You'll
have to sign up with the bank yourself, but it's easy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Laurie Cribbs bought her new Lexus LS 400 for its
luxurious appointments, but what really impressed her were its
trend setting superbright headlights. ``I noticed them right away
because I didn't like to drive at night before,'' Ms. Cribbs said
recently from the offices of Marriott International in Potomac,
Md., where she works as a senior financial manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my car now, it's like night and day. The headlights light
up everything so much, it's very noticeable. With the brights on,
it's like daylight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The technology that tamed the night for Ms. Cribbs is called
High Intensity Discharge, or HID, and it is an increasingly
hard-to-miss sight on the nation's roads. HID headlights throw a
broad field of intensely clear light _ so white-hot that it appears
to burn blue at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits for drivers are equally clear. Compared to standard
yellow-white headlights, HID cuts through the night with light that
more closely approximates the spectrum of light from the sun.
Darkness is banished as the car drives forward into its own private
pocket of renewable daylight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But because of its intensity, HID could cause problems for
pedestrians caught in its glare. The same light that's so easy on
the eyes of someone driving one of the high-end imports that now
offer the technology can be blinding for those on the other side of
the windshield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Beschle, engineering manager for HID design at Osram
Sylvania, a leading manufacturer of automotive lighting, says that
it is the novelty of the lights that is catching people off guard.
``It looks so different that people stare at it,'' he said. ``And
if you stare at any bright light, it will bother you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly Ferris, a spokeswoman for Lexus, has come to the same
conclusion. ``When I see them I think, `Are they different, or are
they blinding me?''' she said. ``I've decided that they're just
different.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HID is as different from a typical halogen headlight as a
100-watt bulb is from stadium lighting. In place of a glowing
filament, HID generates light by charging a sealed chamber of inert
xenon gas, a cousin of neon from the far right-hand column of the
periodic table.
</P>
<P>
   To turn the lights on, the xenon is blasted with 10,000 volts of
electricity, which arcs through the gas. A much lower voltage,
regulated by an electrical ballast, is then used to maintain the
scalding glow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, this technology comes at a cost. Currently, HID
is common only on imported luxury cars from Lexus, Mercedes and
BMW, and on two American-made cars, the Acura TL and the GMC Envoy.
Around the world, however, there are now 55 models that support HID
lights.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where an industry source estimates that one car in
five uses them, they are beginning to be standard equipment even on
midrange cars like the Volkswagen Golf. Sally Moran, vice president
for sales and marketing at Osram Sylvania, claims that an HID
invasion of the American market is inevitable, perhaps as soon as
the 2003 model year. ``It's coming. It's coming to the U.S. It'll
be on our cars soon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (For those unwilling to wait and unable to afford a car with
true HID, look-alike halogen lights are being marketed by Sylvania
and other companies under names like Cool Blue, Bluevision and
Plasma Blue.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of New York City, at least, HID is still a
curiosity: an occasional blue flare that punctuates the flow of
yellow headlights rolling down the avenues. But in greater numbers
_ two on every car _ what effect will they have? How will urban
areas absorb a light that was developed to overcome the darkness of
the autobahn and interstate? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leni Schwendinger, a lighting designer and founder of Light
Projects, a New York studio that focuses on public art and
architecture, is concerned that HID headlights are ``asking a lot
of people's pupils.'' Because the HID light is so much brighter,
she says, it will make surrounding areas seem darker by contrast,
initiating a game of catch-up that could ultimately lead to higher
light levels everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But she did not discount the appeal of the hot blue lights: ``It
seems like a dangerous, weaponlike moving body is bearing down on
you,'' she said. ``At the same time, the purity of the light is
sort of sublime: elegant and ominous at the same time.'' &QL;

IN THAILAND, ALBRIGHT HEARS HOW U.S. AID FIGHTS DRUGS AND
PROSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand _ Madeleine Albright put a human face on
foreign policy Wednesday, listening to a group of young Thai women
explain how U.S. aid money had helped turn them away from drugs and
prostitution and toward meaningful jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It was unusual for a U.S. secretary of state to be sitting at a
table with rural women one third her age in an out-of-the-way town
in northern Thailand. Proudly, Albright acknowledged as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing things secretaries of state didn't do,'' she told
the women, some in the ornate dress and headgear of the Hilltribe
people. ``Partially because they interest me but more importantly
because they are new elements of American foreign policy.'' In the
United States, she said, ``combating drugs is a job for the
secretary of state.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with trainees from the New Life Center and Thai
Women of Tomorrow to highlight what money from the U.S. Agency for
International Development can do.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, which were visited two years ago by Hillary Rodham
Clinton, claim success in educating and then giving vocational
training to girls who have been rescued from opium-addicted
parents, or from brothels and drug dens.
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived in Thailand primarily to boost the government
in its painful path of economic reform after the financial crash in
1997. The Thai economy is still shrinking, but Clinton
administration officials said the worst appeared to be over.
Foreign reserves, which had sharply diminished, have begun to build
up, and there are signs of the return of foreign investment.
Washington is encouraged by the government's efforts to restructure
the banking system, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But before meetings in Bangkok, Albright wanted to show the
importance of dealing with the social side of the financial crisis
and to demonstrate her interest in the well-being of women.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Thailand, young women are expected to become the
breadwinners for elderly parents and relatives. Without jobs, they
become vulnerable targets for traffickers in women and prostitution
rings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women at the roundtable session with Albright,
Chanpen Promsen, 21, told how after finishing school she had stayed
at home looking after the family.
</P>
<P>
   A former teacher got in touch with her and suggested she go to
Bangkok for six months vocational training under the Women for
Tomorrow program. She had returned home, Ms. Promsen said, and was
now employed as a garment worker. ``I'm making money and can
support my family,'' Ms. Promsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the morning, Albright took a 20-minute drive through
tropical vegetation of banana and bamboo trees to the village of
Nong Hoi where the Thai royal family has been helping farmers grow
fruit and vegetables instead of opium.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai government has made substantial progress in eliminating
opium-growing in northern Thailand, which is part of the area known
as the Golden Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Albright went out of her way to praise the Thais for curbing
opium growing by the introduction of crop substitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in marked contrast to the country of Burma, where they
are not doing the kinds of things you are doing,'' she said. In the
last two years, she said, Washington has contributed $1.3 million
to the crop substitution program.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic-covered hot houses bearing carrots and cabbages laced
the terraces of the village, and Albright was shown around a
vegetable stand by Prince Bhisadej Rajani, a cousin of King
Bhumibol Adulyadej.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are saying no to narcotics and yes to vegetables,''
said Albright, who was dressed for the tropics in an ankle-length
cotton purple skirt and jacket and black straw sunhat.
</P>
<P>
   With a can of locally produced guava juice in one hand, Albright
listened to the prince explain that growing vegetables was not only
good social policy but good economics, too.
</P>
<P>
   Local farmers who used to earn the equivalent of $100 a year
from opium now earn about $1,200, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's stunning,'' Ms. Albright said. ``It's not as though
they are losing money, they are making money.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I adopted a big Labrador mutt from the streets
of Red Hook, Brooklyn, I never dreamed I'd be allergic to her. But
every time she flopped down on the floor, little clouds of hair
drifting into the air, I sneezed. My eyes itched. I developed what
felt like a chronic cold. If she slept in my room, I'd wake up with
that tight feeling in my chest so familiar from an asthmatic
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get rid of the dog,'' my doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   Control the problem at its source. That's the first advice any
health official will give you. But by then, I was hooked on Red,
and so was Hemingway, the white Great Pyrenees who lives
downstairs. I didn't want to break up the pack. I called an allergy
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open the windows,'' said Dr. David Valacer, director of the
Children's Allergy, Immunology and Respiratory Center at New York
Presbyterian Hospital. ``The dander will be diluted by the air
brought into the house.''
</P>
<P>
   That was my routine, until the cold weather set in. I'd vacuum
the rugs and floors, then open the windows to let out all the dust
and dander that my old vacuum cleaner had belched into the air. But
come winter, I was watching waves of heat roll out the windows
along with the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Valacer said I could try an air cleaner as a third, less than
perfect line of defense. ``We commonly recommend them to people
with chronic respiratory problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I plunged into the world of air cleaners. It's one
thing to test them in sealed laboratories, as engineers do for
Consumers Union and the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers, but how would they work in my overheated, dog-ridden
Brooklyn apartment?
</P>
<P>
   And another thing: How was the consumer supposed to wade through
the variety of air cleaners _ HEPA filters (an acronym for ``high
efficiency particulate arresting''), ionizers, electrostatic
precipitators _ and the promises of clean air that go with them,
and choose a good one? Or are we all being suckered into buying a
$300 machine that's really just a placebo?
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association cites indoor air pollution as a
high-priority health risk, because Americans spend about 90 percent
of their lives indoors. They are breathing hair sprays, cleaning
agents, toxic chemicals in wallboard, furniture and carpets, as
well as allergens produced by dust mites, cockroaches, rodents,
dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, asthma, particularly in children, has
increased from 9.9 million cases in 1988 to the lung association's
projection of 17.3 million in 1998. Asthma-related deaths rose from
4,597 in 1988 to 5,667 in 1996. Though the lung association and the
Environmental Protection Agency suggest that air cleaners can cut
pollutants, they warn that they are not cure-alls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent air devices can clean particles and gases from the air,
but the question is, does that benefit health, and can you clean
enough?'' asked Dr. John Samet, epidemiology chairman of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health. ``By and
large, they can't clean a lot of air. For some problems, like a
cat, they're not strong enough, because cat allergen is so
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   So are allergens from dust mites, those microscopic organisms
that thrive by feeding on our skin debris and spread allergens
through their fecal matter. ``It could be that exposure comes when
you lie down on the couch and breathe the little cloud of dust that
arises,'' Samet said. ``Or the baby crawling on the floor with his
nose grinding into the carpet. An air cleaner is not going to do
much for that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic kinds of air cleaners _ mechanical filters
and electronic cleaners _ and some are hybrids of the two.
</P>
<P>
   HEPA filters are the workhorses of the mechanical class in the
burgeoning world of air cleaners, now a $200 million industry. HEPA
filters, which are used with fans, are made of densely packed glass
fibers, which snag 99.7 percent of airborne particles as small as
0.3 microns (still larger than a virus). But don't think they'll
clean up fumes from the trash transfer station down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``HEPA filters will remove some particulates from the air, but
they won't address gases, which produce odors, and need more than
filtration,'' said Frank Iacopelli, the engineer at Consumers Union
who headed a 1992 study of air cleaners. Some, HEPA models
included, use activated charcoal or zeolite to attract gases _ a
process called adsorption _ but the adsorbent can be used up
quickly. ``I've seen some air cleaners with very small charcoal
filters that could be used up in a matter of days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other air cleaners operate by electrical attraction. The
simplest kind, a negative-ion generator, charges the air with
negative ions, which attract positively charged particles _ pollen,
dog hair, tobacco smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, those particles have to go somewhere,''
Iacopelli said. ``So now they're clinging to the furniture, the
walls and the positively charged carpet, so the minute you walk
over it, they're thrown back in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Electrostatic precipitators solve this problem somewhat by
drawing particle-laden air past collector plates in the unit. You
have to clean the plates, but the machines are quieter than
HEPA-filter devices.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of ozone generators, which are often sold door to door.
They're promoted as air cleaners capable of breaking down odors and
gases, but the EPA and Consumers Union warn against them, because
they can actually increase toxic gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how much ozone these things produce,'' said Dr.
Richard Shaughnessy, a chemical engineer and program manager of
indoor air research at the University of Tulsa. ``And ozone is not
effective in reducing particles or removing gases.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is no standard for measuring air cleaner
performance, though the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers, a voluntary group, has established what it calls a
clean air delivery rate, representing the number of cubic feet of
clean air a unit puts into the room each minute. A high rate is a
good sign, but also pay attention to the unit's efficiency, and
choose a model that suits your room size.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So I went down the list from the manufacturers' group and chose
some top-rated units. I also tried an ionizer from Sharper Image,
which came highly recommended by a friend with respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Honeywell Enviracaire, with a HEPA filter, is the size of an
overnight case and has a pleasing shape, which reminded me of an
ocean wave. I turned it on high for a few hours, with two dogs in
the room, and the air got much less doggy. But I got more and more
agitated by the loud fan, so I turned it down to low and went to
bed. With the windows closed, I got so hot I thought I had a fever.
Another night, my landlady downstairs borrowed it after frying fish
and reported that it cleared the air in about an hour. Her husband
couldn't bear the noise.
</P>
<P>
   The Friedrich C-90A, an electrostatic precipitator, was top
rated in Consumer Reports in 1992. After I vacuumed with the
windows closed and let the dogs jump around, it cleared the air in
an hour and was quieter, at high, than the HEPA fan models. But
it's bulky _ as big as a Friedrich air-conditioner _ and costs a
high-end $499.
</P>
<P>
   Bionaire sent two models, one with an ULPA filter, which goes
HEPA one better, by filtering out particulates at a rate of 99.99
percent at 0.1 micron. It also has an ionizer. I blew cigar smoke
around the room and turned the unit to high, and the ionizer as
well. After an hour, the smoke was gone, but not the stale cigar
smell, and the air had an acrid odor from the ionizer. The machine
was so noisy that I turned it off.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the Bionaire ``odor removing'' model better. It's an
adsorption type, using a powerful fan to draw odors through a
carbon and zeolite filter. It's also a cute, round unit, about the
size of a hatbox. The fan was loud at high, but it cleared the air
of cigar smoke in about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   I tested Vornado units one rainy day when the dogs' wet fur was
flying, and the HEPA filters worked well for clearing the air of
fur. They were too noisy for me. I had the same problem with a
Hunter Fan model, which has an ionizer and a fan that draws
particles through two filters. It did a fair job of clearing the
air, but I thought I was living inside an aircraft hangar.
</P>
<P>
   This is a personal thing, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noise doesn't bother me; it's like white noise,'' said
Tara Adler, who has four Honeywell Enviracaire units. She has three
cats and smokes. And she shares the house with a man who's allergic
to cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filters are a lifesaver,'' Ms. Adler said. ``We run one in
the dining room, one in the workroom, one in the bedroom, and one
goes wherever we need it. At first, we were running them on high
all the time, and our electric bill shot up $90, so now we run them
more selectively.'' The noise bothers her domestic partner, though,
so he turns the bedroom unit on in the evenings, then turns it off
when he goes to bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image ionizer was gloriously silent _ it has no fan
_ and it has a sleek, space-age design. A narrow tower has a
four-pronged set of plates that look like a tuning fork. You clean
them off when they get gray with particles. It got rid of the dog
fur, but I hated the way the air smelled _ like bleach. That's the
smell of ozone, and ionizers make some but not enough to be
unhealthful, the experts say, unless they are improperly
maintained. (The Food and Drug Administration has set a limit of 50
parts per billion as a safe level in the home.)
</P>
<P>
   I didn't like the idea of adding any ozone to my house, so I
opened a window _ a no-no if you want optimal performance in an air
cleaner. Opening a window on my street brings in more pollution, of
course. It's the same problem as someone smoking in the room. ``The
air cleaner is continually trying to remove smoke, but you're
continually adding,'' said John Sabelli, a staff engineer for
Intertek Testing Services in Cortland, N.Y., which tests the units
in the manufacturers' association program. ``Still, you'll have a
lower level of smoke than if you didn't have the air cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect an air cleaner the size of a hatbox to clean
your whole house. ``It's like putting an air-conditioner
outdoors,'' Sabelli said. ``You're not going to cool the whole
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. I would crack the windows and operate my favorite _ the
Honeywell _ only when that dog hair reached tornado levels. I could
turn it up to high and leave the house for a few hours. I would
turn it off when the noise got to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want,'' Sabelli said. ``Quiet, or clean air?''
Yeah. Outside the lab, life is full of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to do a bit of research before plunging into the
wonderland of air cleaners. Here are a few places to start:
</P>
<P>
   American Lung Association: www.lungusa.org or (800) 586-4872. It
has a good report, ``Residential Air Cleaning Devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency: www.epa.gov/iaq will lead you
to research on subjects from indoor pollutants to the dangers of
ozone generators.
</P>
<P>
   Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers: www.aham.org or
(312) 984-5800. The association tests air cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union: Web site is www.consunion.org. Researchers will
test air cleaners this year.

FRANCE PLANS AN ARTS BLITZ OF THE WEST COAST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delacroix, Cezanne, Manet, Monet, Matisse ... and, and? While
people around the world are lining up to see French masters, not to
mention expatriates like van Gogh and Picasso who spent most of
their careers in France, the country's contemporary artists are not
carrying on the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Germany can boast of international art stars like Gerhard
Richter, Anselm Kiefer and Sigmar Polke. Britain can take pride in
Lucian Freud and young Brit Pack artists like Damien Hirst and
Rachel Whiteread. The United States has Jasper Johns, Richard
Serra, Bruce Nauman, Elizabeth Murray, Cindy Sherman and many more.
</P>
<P>
   But France?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Arman, but he is of a different generation,'' said
Pierre Buhler, the French cultural counselor in New York. ``And
Christian Boltanski. Annette Messager and Sophie Calle have had
some success here. You know Kiefer is now working in France. But we
will not appropriate him.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is galling to a nation ever eager to proclaim its
cultural superiority.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, in inimitable dirigiste fashion, is now
trying to intervene. If all goes as planned next fall, dozens of
galleries, contemporary art centers, museums and art schools on the
West Coast will participate in ``Cote Ouest: A Season of French
Contemporary Art.'' The promotional material for the event, which
was planned by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, says it is
``the biggest initiative to date to promote foreign art in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   To pull it off, France had to dangle a few enticements. Through
its embassy in the United States and the Association Francaise
d'Action Artistique, a government-financed agency, it paid for
American museum and gallery curators to visit France to view
available art. It offered subsidies to art centers that agreed to
show work in the United States. It promised to bring French artists
to the United States for workshops and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Etant Donnes, a French-American Fund for Contemporary Art,
volunteered to help museums find American corporate and foundation
sponsors for exhibitions. The principal benefactors of Etant
Donnes, aside from the Florence Gould Foundation in New York, are
all French: Air France, Banque Nationale de Paris and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   When everything is added up, government and private support for
``Cote Ouest'' may exceed $1 million, which is not extraordinary.
In 1998 French government agencies spent about $500,000 promoting
their contemporary artists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   French artists lag nonetheless, the magazine L'Express observed
last fall in an article about New York's rule over the art world.
Michael Kimmelman, the chief art critic of The New York Times, was
among the experts interviewed by the magazine. ``For the visual
arts, France is now considered to be the rear guard among the great
European nations,'' he said. Though it was the center of the art
world until World War II, he added, ``France pretty much dropped
off the map'' by the 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Buhler brushed off such talk. ``It's possible that our artists
are not known enough and were not marketed or did not market
themselves enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans agree. Shoshana Wayne, who owns a gallery in
Santa Monica, Calif., and who intends to participate in ``Cote
Ouest,'' cited the publicity coups by France's rivals. ``There is
very good work being done in France right now,'' she said, ``but
the galleries, the museums, the collectors and the government are
not creating a scene the way they do in London.''
</P>
<P>
   But many more experts say the reasons for France's decline in
artistic standing run deeper. Some cite a dearth of French
collectors of contemporary art and France's failure over the years
to generate the wealth that begets new collectors. Others say that
French artists suffer because they shun the commercial system that
creates ``hot'' art stars. It is also possible that French art is
simply in a fallow period.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say that France's arts bureaucracy, which gives
generous grants and even helps artists find studios, has stifled
rather than fostered creativity. ``We have the impression of an
institutionalized system, where creativity is sustained by the
state,'' Kimmelman told L'Express. ``And this induces a certain
complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly at the risk of reinforcing such impressions, then,
France is organizing ``Cote Ouest.'' ``We in the embassy and in the
AFAA decided to go as big as we could,'' Buhler said. They invited
West Coast curators and dealers to Paris to visit museums,
galleries and artists and subsidized the trips. ``About 10 went,
possibly more,'' Buhler said. Thomas Collins, an associate curator
at the Henry Art Gallery of the University of Washington, for
example, spent a week and a half in France last fall, visiting
about 18 studios, about 10 art centers and several galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Buhler said: ``The whole thing snowballed, and now we have
such demand. It's unprecedented to have an exhibition stretch over
so many miles.'' Come October, he hopes, 12 museums, 5
universities, 9 alternative spaces, 3 public art projects, 19
galleries and an art fair will take part in ``Cote Ouest.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; nn
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be a little hype, as well as hope, in the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, for example, is
on the list and did send a curator to Paris to research French
artists, courtesy of the event's French sponsors. But the museum
will not take part. Kathleen S. Bartels, the museum's associate
director, said that a fall show ``didn't fit in our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said that its
schedule for October through January was fully booked by the time
the French approached them, although the museum is cited in the
organizers' news release as a participant.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Sobieszek, the photography curator at the museum,
explained the discrepancy. In a history of photographic portraiture
that he has been working on for 30 years, he is including French
items, from 1830s daguerreotypes to current work of Orlan, a woman
who alters her appearance through numerous plastic surgery
operations and then photographs herself. ``I already had some
French stuff in it, but I haven't changed the show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was no temptation: ``If I did a whole project,''
Sobieszek said, ``they offered me up to $20,000, and they said they
would bring the artist out.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a number of participants. Collins, curator of the
Henry Art Gallery, said that the gallery would show works by Gilles
Barbier. In San Francisco, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts
plans to exhibit sketches and sculptures by Jean-Michel Othoniel,
and Camera Work will show photos by Stephane Couturier. Several
commercial galleries are planning exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wayne, the gallery owner in Santa Monica, said: ``I thought
this was a great opportunity. I can't talk about the money, but
that's not the reason I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point it is hard to determine whether ``Cote Ouest''
will succeed or what criteria should apply in judging it. ``From a
P.R. standpoint, it couldn't fail to gain attention,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other art experts doubt that ``Cote Ouest'' will change
attitudes toward French art. ``Given the efficiency of
communications today, works of art of interest and quality float to
the surface of public perception pretty quickly, internationally
and nationally,'' said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, a dealer and the former
head of Sotheby's contemporary art department in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good artist gets shows in New York with ease today, and
Paris is not some forgotten, out of the way place,'' she said.
``One really has to look at what's being made there.''

   OLY-USOC-REACT _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Olympic Committee wants
the White House to place the scandal-ridden IOC under federal laws
that will force leaders of the games to live up to the ``noble

``the loss of the Olympic Games,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said
today he would ask President Clinton that the IOC be identified as
a public international organization under the Federal Foreign

BACK TO THE OLD GRINDSTONE FOR TRIPP

<TEXT>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; , who turned to a
royalty specialist when she wanted a ghostwriter,  &UR; Linda Tripp &LR; 
approached  &UR; Penny Junor &LR; , who has written biographies of  &UR; Di &LR;  and
 &UR; Charles &LR;  _ and who said no thanks. ``She's the most hated woman in
America,'' said Junor, in remarks quoted in the New York Post,
``and while I feel there is a certain amount of sympathy for
Monica's situation, I can't find it in my heart to feel the same
for Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, with a literary career nipped in the bud, the poor woman
had to go back to work. After a year of pulling down her $94,098
salary while ``working from home,'' Tripp returned to an office
Wednesday as a public affairs specialist in the Defense Manpower
Data Center in Rosslyn, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's job is to ``fulfill the data needs of Pentagon brass,''
a Defense Department spokesman told the Washington Post.

   &UR; THE WORD PLAY'S THE THING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When mystified customer  &UR; Barbara Lewis &LR;  wrote to Yves Veggie
Cuisine, inquiring as to why one of their products is labeled
Veggie Burger Burgers, the company's Consumer Relations Coordinator
got to the heart of the matter:
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to your question, the reason for calling our
product Veggie Burger Burgers is purely marketing strategy _ as we
thought of it as being a `hook' for the consumer. Apparently we
were right!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking the advice of BayTV's Chef Joey,  &UR; Jane Walsh &LR;  intended
to use Alta Vista's translation capability on a recipe she found in
Spanish on the Web. Among the ingredients required for Meatball
Soup for six people: 6 cups of broth of head of cattle; 1/2 &LR;  pound
of back of worn out pig; 1 cup of mass for tortillas; 1 spoonful of
worn out onion, 1 marinate to color salt; 1 cup of worn out
chicken; and 1 spoonful of chiltoma pricked.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is it polite to jump in and help a person fumbling for a word?
</P>
<P>
   ``After a certain age,'' writes  &UR; Susan Roane &LR;  in ``What Do I Say
Next?'' (Warner; $14), ``some of us do forget words or lose our
train of thought. As my friend Lana told me, `Since I turned 50, I
lost all my nouns!' If you remember, feel free to jump-start that
train of thought. It shows you're listening, and we love those who
listen.''

   _  &UR; Randy Jurado Ertll &LR; , spokesman for the California League of

   Tuesday &LR;   &LR; was National Sportsmanship Day, in honor of which
 &UR; Shane Murphy &LR; , author of ``The Cheers and the Tears: The Crisis in
Youth Sports Today'' (Jossey Bass; $15), reminds parents, students
and athletic directors to stop the clock, call a time-out and think
about it. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Reading about those high school boys forced to wear panties
for missing rebounds,  &UR; Chris Beach &LR;  was struck by the real-life
evidence. &LR; :  &UR; Dennis Rodman &LR;  is one of the NBA's most successful
rebounders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reminiscing about the 1987 night she won an Oscar for her
performance in ``Children of a Lesser God,''  &UR; Marlee Matlin &LR;  had
some not very pleasant memories of her co-star and then-boyfriend,
 &UR; William Hurt &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Hurt, 35, had been up for an Oscar for his role in the movie,
too, and had presented Matlin, 19, with the Oscar. In the limo
alone afterward, she recalled in a recent speech quoted in the New
York Daily News, Hurt turned to her and said, ``Just because you
have that little man (the Oscar) sitting next to you, do you really
think you deserve it?''
</P>

   _ Nominated for an Emmy for best host of a daytime talk show,

   Following in the footsteps of  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; , who turned to a
royalty specialist when she wanted a ghostwriter,  &UR; Linda Tripp &LR; 
approached  &UR; Penny Junor &LR; , who has written biographies of  &UR; Di &LR;  and
 &UR; Charles &LR;  _ and who said no thanks. ``She's the most hated woman in
America,'' said Junor, in remarks quoted in the New York Post,
``and while I feel there is a certain amount of sympathy for
Monica's situation, I can't find it in my heart to feel the same
for Linda Tripp.''

   Alas, with a literary career nipped in the bud, the poor woman
had to go back to work. After a year of pulling down her $94,098

MAKING BOOKS: THE GAME OF THE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conundrum faced by many novelists, particularly mystery and
romance writers, is what to do when their sales have been poor and
booksellers will stock only a few copies of their new work.
</P>
<P>
   It's the slipperiest terrain there is for an author, and many
grapple with it in the way they are best trained to do, by creating
their ultimate fiction: reinventing their authorial lives with
fictional identities, pseudonyms. Sometimes more than one. Indeed,
an author often has a separate publisher for each literary life, a
sort of captain's paradise of publishing with the craving for
something fresh and hopefully exciting at each end of the shipping
lane.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to fool the booksellers' computers into believing that a
new talent is at work is not the only reason for a second- or
third-name policy. Even some successful writers do it. There is,
for instance, the desire by an author to stretch in another
direction, to pop into a genre different than the one that made the
writer famous. There is a common belief in publishing that, with
few exceptions, a writer who can produce more than one book a year
is not terribly good, so some authors churn out one book a year for
one publisher and another under a different name for a second
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   And occasionally the use of a new signature is transsexual. A
male writes as a woman, and vice versa. Ralph McInerny, for
instance, writes the Father Dowling mysteries, which form a
television series. But as Monica Quill, he also writes the Sister
Mary Teresa mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the writer's publisher, without intending to, makes
what amounts to a satire out of the whole contrivance. This month
Dutton published both a new hardcover and a paperback reprint by
the prolific literary novelist Joyce Carol Oates. The publisher
decided to piggyback the fictional Rosamond Smith onto the fame of
the real Ms. Oates, so on the cover of each the author's
identification was ``Joyce Carol Oates Writing as Rosamond Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oates, who writes literary fiction under Oates and leaner
mystery novels under Smith, said she was perplexed by the two-name
covers but just assumed that there was a devilishly clever business
reason for it. The editor for both Oates and Smith, Rosemary Ahern,
explained that the ``secret of her pseudonym was known in some
quarters, and we persuaded Joyce to let us use both names to find
out if there was an audience for upscale mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   This thimblerigging of authors' identities is not only an
accepted device but an honored publishing one as well, one that
helps nourish the illusion that a big, if not best, seller is just
around the corner. The champion was probably John Creasey, who
wrote mysteries under 28 different names. Agatha Christie was also
Mary Westmacott, and John Dickson Carr ingeniously fooled readers
by becoming Carter Dickson. Ross Macdonald, a master, was also
Kenneth Millar, and Ed McBain and Evan Hunter are one. Lawrence
Sanders is Lesley Andress and Mark Upton.
</P>
<P>
   The edgy Ruth Rendell has a kinder and gentler self, Barbara
Vine. And Amanda Quick, who writes historical romance fiction for
Bantam Books, is also Jayne Ann Krentz, who produces what are
called ``contemporaries'' for Pocket Books. Even the
mega-best-selling Stephen King recreates himself as Richard Bachman
and John Swithen. So, too, does Ann Rice, as Anne Rampling and A.N.
Roquelaure. The list is endless.
</P>
<P>
   One reason successful genre writers use different names is to
make sure that they are not scaring off their clientele. Mary
Higgins Clark, who is always herself, said that ``if a writer feels
that her audience expects a certain kind of book, when you try
something else, it makes sense _ even if everyone knows who it is _
to use a new name.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``If you've developed a loyal audience, that
audience expects something of you, and you are better off leaving
it intact.'' She said that her first book was about George
Washington, ``and it slithered out of a few bookstores and was
remaindered as it came off the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Slumbering beneath the surface of this publishing shell game is
sales, or, more precisely, lack of sales. Walter Wager, a mystery
writer and secretary of the Mystery Writers' Association of
America, said that ``publishers have a Hollywood outlook _ if you
don't sell a lot of copies, they want to drop you.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few, there is seldom big money in mysteries, which
is why mystery writers are the most frequent users of pseudonyms:
they want to trick bookstore computers to get a fresh start, Wager
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the association, the average advance for a mystery
paperback by an unknown author is $3,500 to $5,000; for an
unknown's hardcover, $5,000 to $7,000. A first printing for a
mainstream mystery _ with clues that the reader discovers the same
time the detective does _ averages about 5,000 to 7,000 copies,
except for stars like Ms. Clark. Unless the book hits, or there's a
clamor for it from the movies or television, there's really not
much money to be made creating these literary puzzles. That's the
reason so many series of mystery novels are based on one detective.
It's easier to sell them in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara D'Amato is a mystery writer and the new president of the
association. She is also president of Sisters In Crime, another
mystery writers' professional group of which 30 percent is actually
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers often feel that a writer's name gets typecast.
There's a certain publishing history on the bookstore's computer,''
Ms. D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a store ordered 15 of the writer's last book, it will
likely order no more than 15 of the next one if it hasn't sold.
It's hard for a writer to break out into higher sales that way. By
using a different name and changing publisher, you're not fooling
anybody; you're just starting out fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   So for many, any edge helps, and each new selling device brings
high hope. It is not recorded that people lined up to buy the works
of Quintus H. Flaccus. But when the pseudonym Horace was put on the
cover, ``The Odes'' became a best seller.

PINE: AN EASY WOOD THAT'S DIFFICULT TO FINISH
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic is

individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204.)

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pine is a light-colored, soft wood with a medium texture and
closed grain. Easy to work and less expensive than most hardwoods,
it is the wood most often used by do-it-yourselfers to make shelves
and furniture. It is also commonly used to manufacture unfinished
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Although pine is easy to cut and shape, it can be difficult to
finish because it is easily scratched and dented and tends to soak
up finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Before applying any finish, it is essential to carefully sand
the wood to remove all scratches and create a smooth surface. Start
with a medium-grit paper (80 to 100) aluminum oxide paper, then
progress to finer grits (120 to 150) before smoothing with a
180-grit paper. (Some stains require sanding with even finer grits.
Read the label on the product for recommendations.) Always sand
with the grain.
</P>
<P>
   A good finishing job requires sanding the entire surface evenly
without missing any spots. A common mistake that many
do-it-yourselfers make is sanding the center of the surface and
neglecting the edges. This creates a dished surface with high spots
around the edges. To avoid this, try drawing a series of light
pencil lines across the entire surface. Next, sand the lines away.
If some disappear while others remain, it is an indication that you
are not sanding evenly.
</P>
<P>
   You can use a power sander, but work carefully because it can
quickly cut into the soft wood. Also keep in mind that most power
sanders do not operate in a strict linear, that is back and forth,
motion. Orbital and vibrating sanders move the sanding pad in a
roughly circular pattern that leaves tiny scratches across the
grain.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason many cabinet makers and craftsmen prefer to
finish the smoothing by hand-sanding. Always use a sanding block
when hand-sanding a flat surface. Without the block, the paper can
quickly cut into the softer sections of the wood, creating valleys
and ripples.
</P>
<P>
   Dent removal calls for a different technique. Place one or two
drops of water in the dent and cover it with a damp cloth. Wait a
few minutes to allow the drops to penetrate, then place the tip of
a hot iron (set on ''cotton'') on the cloth. The heat from the iron
will turn the water into steam, swell the fibers and raise the
dent. For deep dents, you may have to repeat this trick two or
three times.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to remove all the residual surface dust. This
is called ``tacking,'' and is done by wiping the wood with a
special cloth called a tack cloth. Tack cloths are available at
paint stores and home centers. You can also make your own.
</P>
<P>
   To make a tack cloth, soak a clean piece of white cotton fabric
in water, then wring it out. Wet it lightly with turpentine then
dribble varnish freely over the cloth. Roll the cloth to wring out
the water and distribute the varnish and turpentine throughout the
fabric. A properly made tack cloth will be sticky enough to pick up
dust without leaving moisture behind.
</P>
<P>
   Before applying any finish, wipe the surface with mineral
spirits or turpentine. This will reveal any dents that or scratches
that you may have missed while sanding. Focus a bright spotlight
across the surface and examine it carefully for defects. If the
surface is clear, you can apply the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Staining pine can be frustrating because it sucks up the color a
different rates creating a motley surface. For this reason, pine is
often called a `` blotch-prone wood.'' Many woodworkers avoid this
problem by not using any stain. They simply apply a clear finish,
like polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stain, it's best to apply a sealer first. Sealers
are brush-on liquids that penetrate into the wood to limit the
amount of absorption. It is difficult to tell how much sealer
should be used because different products produce different
results. The end grain of boards is particularly absorbent and may
need a few coats of sealer so the end matches the surface color.
</P>
<P>
   To be on the safe side, test the sealer and stain on some scrap
wood or on an inconspicuous part of the finished piece. The sealer
will make the wood less absorbent and the color will be lighter
than indicated on the can. You can either apply additional coats of
stain or switch to a darker hue. After applying the stain, let it
dry for at 24 hours before applying the final finish.
</P>
<P>
   Pine accepts clear finishes like varnish or polyurethane much
like any other wood. Read the label on the can and apply according
to the directions. First, however, seal any knots in the wood with
a coat of clear shellac; this will keep pigments in the knots from
bleeding into the finish.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds will buffet the Northeast Thursday morning as a
vigorous storm center moves north from upstate New York. A narrow
band of heavy snow driven by strong winds from the northwest will
prevail early Thursday morning from northwestern Pennsylvania to
western New York. The snow should taper to a few flurries by
midday. Farther east, a band of early-morning showers and a few
thunderstorms accompanied by strong winds will sweep through
eastern New England. Areas of coastal flooding will occur early
Thursday morning where winds from the southeast gust over 50 mph at
exposed coastal locations. In the wake of the showers, shifting
winds will cause dry air to surge from the Middle Atlantic states
to southern New England.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeast, gusty winds near the Atlantic coast will
gradually diminish as a ridge of high pressure moves east from the
Tennessee Valley. Except for a few early clouds near the Carolina
coast, sunshine will be plentiful throughout the region. Afternoon
temperatures will average a few degrees below the seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and patchy light snow will occur near a front from
northern Iowa through the eastern Dakotas. Farther south, sunshine
will be mixed with a few clouds as winds from the south draw milder
air from Texas toward the central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Developing low pressure over the interior West will produce
patchy snow over the mountains of western Colorado and and eastern
Utah. Meanwhile, onshore breezes will promote scattered showers
near the Northwest coast and intermittent snow in the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: From Sea to Stormy Sea
</P>
<P>
   Angry seas off the coast of Oregon swelled to heights of 40 feet
Tuesday night as a potent low pressure system armed with
hurricane-force winds swept into the Pacific Northwest. One
offshore buoy registered swells of 46 feet, a mark representing the
highest seas in recent memory, according to the National Weather
Service at Portland. The maximum wind gust was 92 mph, recorded by
the U.S. Coast Guard. Though not as fierce as the storm in the
Pacific Northwest, an expansive low pressure system over Quebec
will lash parts of the Northeast Thursday with powerful winds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age when you can't be too rich or too thin or have too
much RAM, is there any reason to buy a secondhand computer, one of
those early wood-burning Pentiums?
</P>
<P>
   There could well be, if you use a computer for simple tasks like
word processing and e-mail and are willing to sacrifice a few
megahertz to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of used machines will suit many people's
daily computer needs, some industry experts say. They predict that
secondhand personal computers could have substantial appeal for
computer buyers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year and a half ago, most of the machines hitting the used
market were 486s _ a bit slow for many applications,'' said
Christine Arrington, an analyst at International Data Corp., a
research business specializing in technology that is based in
Framingham, Mass. ``Now used machines _ low-end Pentiums or
comparable Macs _ can handle applications like Internet connections
and some spreadsheets that are very attractive to buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the older 486s are adequate for e-mail and word processing,
although they often cannot run Windows 95 or 98. Ms. Arrington, who
prepared a research report on secondhand PC sales for her company,
estimated that more than 6.4 million used PCs were shipped in 1998,
mainly to small businesses and offices, local governments and
school systems. In 1999, that number is very likely to be well over
7.4 million, and by 2000, 8.1 million, Ms. Arrington said. The
figures included Apple Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arrington said she saw an increasing number of individual
consumers joining the mix of schools, businesses and government
offices buying used computers. ``As prices continue to drop,
vendors of used PCs will pay less, making the costs very attractive
to the home market,'' Ms. Arrington said, citing the growth of
computer resellers like Computer Renaissance, based in Minneapolis.
Computer Renaissance is a franchise operation that buys and sells
new and used computers from 240 stores in the United States and
Canada. Eighty of them were added in 1998 and another 80 are
expected in 1999, said Richard B. Brill, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively powerful used desktop systems may be bought these
days for as little as $300 _ a low-cost solution to the problem of
two children fighting over who can use the computer. Owners can
even buy home network technology _ wired or wireless _ and link the
computers, eliminating the need for such extras as a second printer
or a second Internet account. Experts say consumers are safest if
they stick to a low-end Pentium, 75 megahertz or faster, with 16
megabytes of RAM and a hard drive of 810 megabytes or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networking has been a growing application for pre-owned
computers,'' said Brian Kushner, chairman and chief executive of
Recompute, an online company that sells new and used PCs to
companies, schools and homes. ``Six months ago, we had no sales of
network cards to individual consumers. Now about 5 percent of the
individual consumers who buy from us want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is in a market in which new computers can cost
as little as $500 and some businesses are offering new computers
free to schools or individual consumers if they are willing to
provide personal information and accept advertising on their
desktops.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arrington said she believed that the home market would
continue to grow despite the plummeting prices of new PCs. ``The
drop in prices may tighten the market, but it won't kill it _ not
until we see a sub-$99 machine,'' Ms. Arrington said. At Computer
Options in Raleigh, N.C., where 90 percent of the business is in
used computers, the shop has been so busy that Annette Freeman, the
owner, recently moved to a bigger location in a shopping center to
double her floor space.
</P>
<P>
   A browser in her shop on a recent Saturday afternoon, Steve
Richards of Raleigh, said over the telephone that he bought a used
computer last year that he thought had been a good deal. ``It's
like buying a car,'' he said. ``You can buy a brand-new car, or
wait a year or two and get roughly the same sort of functions, but
far more cheaply. You don't always have to have the top of the
line.''

<P>
   Len Schiefer, who lives in Ridgewood, Queens, echoed that
philosophy. He bought a powerful computer for $300 last year,
buying it not from a shop or online but from a friend who wanted a
fancier system.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of used computer sales tracked by analysts are
for desktop models, used portable computers are also popular
choices for equipping college students or people who are road
warriors only occasionally and need an inexpensive way to check
their e-mail while traveling. James McQuivey, a senior analyst at
Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass., said portable
computers could be a good buy. ``You can get a good machine that's
a year or two old, but nicely loaded, for half the price of a new
one _ or even less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``New laptops are expensive,'' said Alex Wong, manager of USPC,
a shop in New York City. ``If you have only $500 to spend, you
can't afford a new one. After we've paid $2,500 for a laptop and
rented it for 18 months, we can sell it to you for $500 to $600.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lure of possible savings, it takes nerve to buy a
used computer, as many consumers accustomed to the comforts of
extensive warranties, technical support and preloaded software
realize.
</P>
<P>
   Even the language of used computers can be confusing.
``Pre-owned'' is easy enough, but ``reconditioned,''
``refurbished,'' ``resold,'' ``remanufactured'' and even
``recomputed'' may require some defining.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Refurbished' usually means that the computer went back to
the original manufacturer, perhaps because it was defective,''
explained Phillip Lemmonds, president of Datatech Remarketing, an
online company. ``At Datatech we do the fix-up work ourselves _ the
equipment doesn't go back to Apple. So our computers are
`reconditioned' rather than `refurbished.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, of Recompute, said: ``We upgrade the pre-owned personal
computer systems that we sell. We use the terms `remanufactured'
and `recomputed' to show that we have reconfigured, rebuilt and
upgraded the system.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, buying a machine that is a few years old means
that the inevitable bugs in the hardware and software may actually
have been detected and fixed.
</P>
<P>
   If a new system is going to fail, it tends to fail in the first
90 days, said Joe Ventimiglia, owner of Excess Quality New and Used
Computers in Campbell, Calif. ``After that, failures are usually
much farther out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, new software is made for new computers, and
an older PC might be unable to run common current programs _ or to
handle documents from others _ like e-mail attachments, for example
_ if they are written with those current programs.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of secondhand computers can guard against fly-by-night
operators by checking to see if a business is licensed. They can
also ask for warranties. Most shops offer warranties of 30 days to
a year on used computers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do not need the comfort of a corner shop can try the
Internet. David A. Karp, author of ``Windows 98 Annoyances''
(O'Reilly &AMP; Associates, 1998), developed an online computer swap
site but pointed out that such sites posed inherent difficulties
for some users.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like to send money to someone they've never
met,'' he said. Still, Karp estimated that among the 195,000
visitors to his site, www.creativelement.com, several thousand had
completed sales. ``I put up my modem for $50 _ why not? _ and I had
three people who wanted it in three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The bravest shoppers can try online auction sites like Onsale or
Ebay. Many computer manufacturers sell their refurbished and
discontinued merchandise online. Other sites specialize in a
particular type of used computer, like laptops or Macs. The true
experts can scour computer hardware shows, flea markets and swap
meets.
</P>
<P>
   Datatech Remarketing concentrates solely on secondhand Apples
and Macs. ``We open them up, blow the dust out, test the
components, reload the operating system, put them back together,
clean the case _ and sell them,'' Lemmonds said. He added that he
had benefited from overkill in the computer industry _ the stream
of new machines laden with more memory, speed and storage than the
average user needs. ``Why do most people need a six-gig hard
drive?'' he said. ``I have a 500-meg hard drive, and it does all
that I want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Because comparison shopping for used computers is difficult _
there are so many different configurations _ many users make a list
of desired features and check market prices through computer
magazines and online appraisal services like the Used Computer
Exchange (www.edeal.com) and the American Computer Exchange
(www.amcoex.co). The bible for used computer prices is the Orion
Computer Blue Book, $129 an issue, published quarterly. Many used
computer shops carry the book and use it as a basis for their
pricing (it can be ordered online at www.usedcomputer.com).
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for a used computer takes its toll in time and energy.
According to the small print in many software licensing agreements
_ those from Microsoft, for instance _ owners may transfer their
license to use the software as part of a sale but cannot keep any
copies and must relinquish any entitlement to free upgrades as well
as to all earlier versions. Many owners will not do this. Those who
buy a used computer from such people will legally need to reformat
the hard drive and install new software if the software on the
machine is registered to the original owner.
</P>
<P>
   For the novice, the best choice may be a corner store or
Internet site that offers some initial advice and technical support
along with the used machine.

 Mortgage rates have been climbing since Greenspan's remark  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Goodbye, Goldilocks. Hello, Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, lenders and homeowners have celebrated the
``just-right'' Goldilocks economy that featured low mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the
nation's top cop on the economy, hinted that the U.S. economy might
be running too hot, and the markets went into a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's seeming willingness to increase interest rates to
cool the economy sent an already tumbling bond market even lower,
pushing yields higher. And mortgage rates, which closely track
bonds, surged higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortgage rates didn't creep up,'' said Kansas City mortgage
lender James Nutter Jr., executive vice president of James B.
Nutter &AMP; Co. ``They shot up like a rocket, and unfortunately in our
business, rates go up faster than they come back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages shot past 7
percent in recent days as homebuyers scurried for the best deals,
and lenders worried that renewed inflation fears could increase
interest rates. Just a few weeks earlier, smart shoppers could find
mortgage rates as low as 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average mortgage rate has increased four weeks
in a row, according to the Freddie Mac, which buys mortgages from
lenders, packages them as securities and sells them to investors.
Freddie Mac's weekly survey found an average rate of 6.89 percent,
the highest rate since mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that it will go past 7 percent this week,'' said
Robert Van Order, chief economist at Freddie Mac, based in McLean,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   That jump would end a nine-month streak of average rates below 7
percent, the longest stretch since Freddie Mac started tracking the
market. In early October, the national average fell to 6.49
percent, a 31-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Higher mortgage rates mean borrowers would pay more for money to
buy and fix their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Rates on a standard mortgage at some major Kansas City area
lenders have jumped from a low of 6.5 percent to as much as 7.25
percent. On a $100,000 mortgage, borrowers could pay an additional
$50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The average sale price of a home in Johnson County, Kan., in
January 1999 was $201,339, according to the Johnson County Board of
Realtors. Assuming a $160,000 loan, the borrower would pay an extra
$85 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage rate increase comes near the peak of the
home-buying season. Even so, real estate agents said higher rates
haven't affected sales yet. They note that rates are still near
long-term lows.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Kaplan, a real estate agent with J.D. Reece, said she sold
two houses last weekend and put two more up for sale. None of her
customers mentioned rising interest rates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd be concerned if they go above 8 percent,'' Kaplan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent increases amount to a few dollars a week and
shouldn't make or break a deal, Kaplan said. If the increase adds
only $25 a month to the mortgage, the cost isn't significant, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda LaMarque, an agent for Realty Executives Professional
Group, said: ``I can't say it's making a big difference for my
clients, people who are buying houses for $150,000 or more. It
might be throwing the ratios out of whack for people who are buying
houses in the $60-, $70-, $80,000 range. That extra $25 a month can
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMarque said her clients beat the rising rates anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my clients are pleasantly locked in,'' LaMarque said.
``One locked in earlier this week. Another locked in when she got
her loan application.''
</P>
<P>
   They are the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates are starting to eat away at the market for
homeowners looking to refinance their existing mortgages, Van Order
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main effect will be on refinancings,'' Van Order said.
``That share of the market has been falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, mortgage refinancings had been as much as 60
percent of the market, Van Order said. That share has dropped to
about half and likely will continue falling.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy McCombs, a Kansas City homeowner, said she and her
husband, Rick, refinanced the mortgage on their home after watching
rates drift down for several months.
</P>
<P>
   She locked in a no-cost, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage on Jan. 29
at 7.125 percent. On Feb. 23, when she closed the deal, average
rates were 7.5 percent, still lower than the 8.5 percent rate on
her 10-year-old mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been watching for a few months and felt like that was
as low as they were going to go,'' McCombs said.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs said she plans to use the cash received for the equity
in the home to make repairs, including new gutters and a new roof.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wilson, co-president of Advance Mortgage Corp., a broker in
Overland Park, said the refinancing rate hasn't changed much in
three weeks. About one-third of the company's loan inquiries are
for mortgage refinancings, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson said interest rates at the 40 companies he monitors
have been climbing steadily for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, people call and just gasp and say, `What happened?'
'' Wilson said.

BOOK SAYS KAZAN HAD SCANT REGRET OVER TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Throughout the emotional controversy over the
decision to give him an honorary Academy Award, Elia Kazan has
remained silent in the face of critics who still condemn him for
naming names during the congressional hunt for communists in the
entertainment industry in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   But in a series of remarkably candid interviews recorded 25
years ago and first being made public now, Kazan said that he
regretted ``the human cost'' of his decision to inform on eight old
friends from the Communist Party. But at the same time he said he
named them out of a deep personal conviction that a genuine
communist conspiracy was threatening the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who informs on other people is doing something
disturbing and even disgusting,'' he said. ``It doesn't sit well on
anybody's conscience. But at the same time I felt a certain way,
and I think it has to be judged from the perspective of 1952.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, who is 89 and in uncertain health, made his comments in a
series of remarkably candid and detailed interviews about his films
that were conducted in 1973 and '74 by Jeff Young, a writer and
former film studio executive. For a number of reasons, Young left
the tapes in his garage for years, sharing them only with a few
friends. Newmarket Press, whose books are distributed by Random
House, will publish the interviews in April, as a result of a
decision made months before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences voted without dissent to give Kazan, one of America's
greatest film and theater directors, the honorary Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   That decision to give him the honorary award on March 21 has
touched off a debate of unusual heat in Hollywood, led mostly by
formerly blacklisted writers and their family members who say that
Kazan should not be forgiven by the motion picture industry for his
testimony on April 10, 1952. On that day he appeared before the
House Un-American Activities Committee, which was doggedly looking
for communist influence in Hollywood. Kazan informed on eight
friends from the Group Theater who had once belonged to the
Communist Party with him. Although other entertainment figures
including Lee J. Cobb, Burl Ives and Jerome Robbins also named
names, they were not criticized as fiercely as Kazan was.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews Kazan seemed deeply torn about his decision:
alternately defiant and saying how much he loathed the Communist
Party and contrite about the personal cost. At one point he even
said, ``Maybe I did wrong _ probably did.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kazan discussed the blacklisting issue in his
autobiography, ``A Life,'' published by Knopf in 1988, he had never
gone into such detail about the motives, the personal uncertainties
and the aftermath of his decision. Young, who sought to write a
scholarly book about Kazan's work, was intimately aware of the
blacklist: his uncle Ned Young was a blacklisted writer whose
career was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him my uncle was very dear to me, that I was opposed to
the position he had taken and asked him if this would be a
problem,'' recalled Young, who said he strongly believed that Kazan
should be given the Oscar because of the value of his work. ``He
was very open. He said, `Ask me anything you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young's book offers details about Kazan's casting decisions, his
directorial technique and his personal views on all of his films,
including classics like ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' and ``On the
Waterfront,'' for which he won Oscars, as well as ``A Streetcar
Named Desire,'' ``A Face in the Crowd'' and ``Viva Zapata.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the book especially timely is Kazan's discussion
of the link between some of his films and his Congressional
testimony, and the fact that his decision to name names was never
very far from his artistic consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In his most acclaimed film, ``On the Waterfront,'' the Marlon
Brando character, a boxer turned longshoreman, is branded a stool
pigeon after testifying against the local mob boss. But Brando
emerges victorious. Less than 20 years later in an unsuccessful
Kazan film, ``The Visitors,'' a man also testifies against former
friends, but the movie ends on a note of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting his decision to testify, Kazan seemed at times
unapologetic and at other times sorrowful. But the overriding theme
of the interviews is his loathing for communism, which he
experienced as a member of the Communist Party while in New York in
the 1930s. He called communism ``a slavery of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to know a lot about the Communist Party,'' he said. ``I
used to go downtown to 12th Street where their headquarters were,
get orders and go back like a good ritualized lefty and try to
carry them out. Our orders were to try to take over the Group
Theater. It was child's play in one sense, but in another it
wasn't. We were doing something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, nobody knows the truth about any of this,'' said
Kazan, recalling his decision to reveal names before the House
committee. ``The party was getting all kinds of money out of
Hollywood and out of the theater. Communists were in a lot of
organizations _ unseen, unrecognized, unbeknownst to anybody. I
thought, if I don't talk, nobody will know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan said it was ``disturbing'' to inform on his colleagues.
But he added: ``When I thought about what it meant symbolically,
about what would have happened if I'd lied and said I had no idea
what was going on, it would have been worse. So I said, I'm not
going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan said that the eight friends he named, including playwright
Clifford Odets and Paula Strasberg, wife of Lee Strasberg, were
already known to the committee. ``Everybody knew who they were, so
it wasn't a big deal,'' he said. ``They of course suffered some for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I also did something nobody ever mentions. I told
three of them beforehand. I told Clifford Odets. He said he was
going to do the same thing. I told Mrs. Strasberg, and I told
another guy,'' who replied with an angry curse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During his interviews, Kazan vigorously denied that he named
names to gain favor with studio moguls, as has been charged. ``As
far as doing it for money, it's fantastic, really, because in the
first place they didn't threaten me, and in the second place they
couldn't have, and in the third place I didn't need a job in
Hollywood,'' he said. ``The blacklist did not extend to Broadway,
and I was at the top of my theater career. All my testifying did
was lose me certain things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I'd lose Arthur Miller's plays. I knew a lot of
guys would turn against me, which they did. I've lived through
that. In some ways the experience made a man out of me because it
changed me from being a guy who was everybody's darling and always
living therefore for people's approval, to a fellow who could stand
on his own. It toughened me up a lot. I'm not afraid of anybody.
They avoided my eye. I didn't avoid theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he added, ``I have some regrets about the human cost of
it. One of the guys I told on I really liked a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, the author, said the long delay in publication was, at
first, the result of an agreement he had made with Kazan that the
book would not be published until the director completed his
autobiography. Young said that Kazan had expected the autobiography
to be published in the mid-1970s. But it took years for Kazan to
complete his own book, published in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Young said, he periodically showed the Kazan
transcripts to friends who were directing their first films because
of the instructive information about moviemaking. It was at the
behest of his friends, he said, that he began seeking a publisher
for his book. Young, who lives in Los Angeles, said he had spoken
casually to Kazan, the last time in December. Kazan lives in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Kazan discussed in detail the weight that
Communism held over him even after he quit the party. He mentioned
one of his films, ``Man on a Tightrope'' (1953), from a script by
Robert E. Sherwood, based on a real event about a circus troupe
that escaped communist Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that I had gone through a violent break with
the party, I still found myself thinking like a communist,'' said
Kazan. He felt ``great resistance to making'' that film ``because
it was against the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``And I discovered that
I still unconsciously thought of the Soviet Union as a progressive
political phenomenon. I finally said to myself, if you've got the
courage, you should make this picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Through that film, ``I partly broke myself of my belief in
Soviet communism,'' he said. ``It's hard for anybody who wasn't a
communist to understand how strong a hold those beliefs had on you.
Your emotional commitment keeps overriding everything your
intellect and common sense tell you. It's akin to a kind of
religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, Stalin was as bad as Hitler, maybe worse. Hitler
killed 6 million Jews. Stalin killed the same number of people,
maybe more. He was a monster, but your mind, once you've been a
committed communist, doesn't want to face that fact. So in a way
the film was an important purgative thing for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Kazan discusses his identification with the
Brando character in ``On the Waterfront'' who is snubbed after he
testifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that kind of thing happened to me after I testified
before HUAC,'' said Kazan. ``I was snubbed. People I knew well
would look at me but not talk. People looked down on me. They
couldn't accept the fact that correctly or incorrectly it was
something I did out of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe nobody agreed with me, but I thought that was the right
thing to do,'' Kazan said. ``Maybe I did wrong, probably did. But I
really didn't do it for any reason other than that I thought it was
right.''

 Gender now isn't seen as defining element in KC mayoral race  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In 1975, Sarah Snow became the first woman in
Kansas City history to be nominated for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Then she got hit from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Critics knocked her for being too timid. Others said Snow was
too domineering. She was ``so typically female,'' one woman
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Was Kansas City ready for a woman mayor? Evidently not: Snow
lost by a wide margin in the general election to Charles Wheeler,
then the incumbent mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 years later, will gender play a major role in Kansas
City's next mayoral race?
</P>
<P>
   Kay Waldo Barnes, who was nominated for mayor Tuesday by a
comfortable margin, doesn't think so. Neither does her opponent,
George Blackwood.
</P>
<P>
   If gender was a big deal back in 1975, they say, it simply isn't
today.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, women made up only 4 percent of Congress. Today, that
figure is 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, women held 10 percent of statewide elected offices.
Today, it's 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, women accounted for 8 percent of state legislature
membership across the country, compared with 22 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole is considered a strong candidate for president.
Madeleine Albright is secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   So a woman mayor of Kansas City? What's the big deal, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a little of the novelty has worn off,'' said Debbie
Walsh, associate director for the Center for the American Woman and
Politics at Rutgers University. ``The world does change. People are
at a different place about this now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mayoral primary, the issue of gender never surfaced. And
in the general election, it might not either.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Tuesday night she didn't know whether being a woman
played any role in her victory. Blackwood attributed Barnes'
victory to money, not gender.
</P>
<P>
   Few would suggest that Barnes will triumph just because she is a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think a woman just for the sake of being a
woman can win,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat.
``I think she's got to...have the credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, women bring their own sets of advantages to
campaigns, especially now, in the wake of President Clinton's
impeachment crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of 1,200 adults surveyed last month said they thought
a female president would be better than a man at ``improving
honesty and ethics in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of men say, `Look, these men are messing up.
Maybe it is time to give a woman an opportunity,' '' said former
Rep. Shirley Chisholm, a Democrat who in 1972 became the first
woman to seek the presidential nomination of a major political
party.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, the perception that women are more honest and fair
is aided by the fact that they don't hold as many top offices: They
haven't had as many opportunities to mess up.
</P>
<P>
   Women themselves suggest that their priorities as office holders
are sometimes different from those of their male predecessors.
Topeka, Kan., Mayor Joan Wagnon, for example, said she's placed
more emphasis on child-care issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an economic-development matter,'' Wagnon said. ``I
don't know that my predecessor would have taken up that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although women have made steady gains in winning top elected
offices, the progress has been slow. Scholars blame the relatively
low number of women holding lower-level political offices.
</P>
<P>
   In the mayoral race, Barnes was helped by the fact that she had
served on the City Council and Jackson County Legislature years
ago. Janice Ellis, the race's other female contender, may have lost
points in that area. Mayor Emanuel Cleaver criticized Ellis at one
point because she had not paid her dues by serving in a lower-level
public office.
</P>
<P>
   One problem that didn't bog down Barnes' effort was
fund-raising. Women typically have more trouble than men tapping
into big donors, partly because too few women serve on major
corporate boards, said Missouri Auditor Claire McCaskill, the
former Jackson County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes managed to overcome the problem with an aggressive,
grass-roots fund-raising plan. Blackwood, however, still managed to
outraise Barnes in the last reporting period, $141,000 to $111,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for women is that some traits favorable to men,
such as ambition and aggressiveness, are often frowned upon for
women.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill, for example, has been criticized for saying she would
like to be governor someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who said to me, `Boy, Claire, I hope
you don't run for anything else any time soon.' But I remember Kit
Bond was elected governor (in 1972) two years after he was elected
auditor. It didn't seem to slow him down any.''
</P>
<P>
   Women also face greater scrutiny when it comes to their
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Marinovich, who in 1995 became the first female mayor of
Kansas City, Kan., remembers all the unsolicited comments about her
makeup, her lipstick and her hairstyle. She knows that male
candidates would not have faced similar comments.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1975, Snow took her defeat to Wheeler in stride. She
said she was not bitter about losing or the lack of support from
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women themselves weren't ready,'' Snow said. ``They didn't
want to do it, and they didn't really know why I wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who she voted for on Tuesday, Snow, now 76, didn't
hesitate: Barnes. And not just because she's a woman. The former
City Council member has a good background in city government and is
a good communicator, Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted to something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to see a woman win,'' Snow said. ``I never made
it, and I've wanted someone else to make it.''

MET'S NEXT SEASON TO INCLUDE `GATSBY' PREMIERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 1999-2000 season of the Metropolitan Opera will
include the world premiere of John Harbison's ``Great Gatsby,'' new
productions of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' and Boito's
``Mefistofele,'' and three complete cycles of Wagner's ``Ring.''
The season details were announced Wednesday by Joseph Volpe, the
general manager of the Met.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Gatsby,'' which will have its premiere on Dec. 20,
has long been in progress and is much anticipated. Harbison, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning composer on the faculty at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, has written his own libretto, adapted from
the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, though the score also contains
Harbison's evocations of Gatsby-era popular songs with lyrics by
Murray Horwitz. Jerry Hadley will sing the title role and Dawn
Upshaw will be Daisy Buchanan, with Susan Graham as Jordan Baker,
Dwayne Croft as Nick Caraway and, in her Met debut, Lorraine Hunt
as Myrtle Wilson. James Levine, the Met's artistic director, will
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde,'' last performed at the Met in
1984, will return in a new production directed by Dieter Dorn, in
his Met debut, and conducted by Levine, with Jane Eaglen and Ben
Heppner in the title roles. Samuel Ramey will sing the title role
in ``Mefistofele,'' by the overlooked opera composer Arrigo Boito,
best remembered as the librettist of Verdi's ``Otello'' and
``Falstaff.'' The opera has not been presented at the Met since the
1925-26 season. There will also be a new production by Tim Albery
of Lehar's ``Merry Widow,'' performed in English translation, with
Frederica von Stade as the widow Hanna Glawari.
</P>
<P>
   The three ``Ring'' cycles, which come in the spring of 2000,
will reunite Deborah Voigt as Sieglinde and Placido Domingo as
Siegmund, both of whom have sung these roles to acclaim at the Met.
James Morris, a heralded Wotan, will also be returning. Ms. Eaglen
will sing her first Met performances of Brunnhilde, and Stig
Anderson in his Met debut is Siegfried. There will be additional
performances of ``Die Walkure'' and ``Das Rheingold.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a very promising cast for Strauss'
``Rosenkavalier,'' with Renee Fleming as the Marschallin, Susan
Graham as Octavian and Heidi Grant Murphy as Sophie. Levine will
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Recent productions of operas that are returning next season
include Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District,''
conducted by Valery Gergiev, with Catherine Malfitano in the title
role; Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' with Ms. Upshaw and Croft
as the ill-fated couple, and Schoenberg's ``Moses und Aron.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the singers making notable first-time Met appearances in
important roles are Ms. Voigt as Aida, Ruth Anne Swenson as the
four heroines and Bryn Terfel as the four villains in Offenbach's
``Tales of Hoffmann,'' Bo Skovhus as the Count in ``Le Nozze di
Figaro,'' and Gabriela Benackova as Desdemona in Verdi's
``Otello,'' with Domingo in his signature role as the Moor.
</P>
<P>
   The season opens on Sept. 27 with the double bill of
``Cavalleria Rusticana'' and ``Pagliacci.'' Domingo will sing Tonio
in ``Pagliacci,'' marking his 18th opening-night Met performance,
breaking the record of 17 held by Enrico Caruso.

 &HT;    CLINTON, DEMOCRATS RALLY TO PROMOTE AGENDA
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton stood with fellow Democrats on
Capitol Hill Wednesday to promote a ``Families First'' legislative
agenda designed to pressure Republican congressional leaders this
year and appeal to voters in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The rally recalled the Newt Gingrich-engineered ``Contract With
America'' gathering that propelled Republicans to a congressional
majority in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely tracking the priorities Clinton staked out in this
year's State of the Union address, the four-page legislative
platform is topped by a plan to set aside 77 percent of projected
federal budget surpluses for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for modernizing public schools, a patient's bill
of rights, targeted tax cuts, raising the minimum wage, more cops
on the beat, a crackdown on those who swindle seniors, privacy
protections and policies to promote ``liveability'' in communities.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton urged Democrats to ``put people ahead of
partisanship and common sense ahead of ideology'' in the current
congressional session, his party's congressional leaders, as well
as Vice President Al Gore, attacked Republicans for past opposition
to Clinton's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
recalled how no Republican in the House or Senate voted in favor of
the balanced budget measure Clinton introduced in the first year of
his presidency, when the annual spending gap was approaching $300
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are currently enjoying the harvest of the seeds we planted
in 1993, when Democrats _ without a single Republican vote _ made
the difficult and courageous choice to put our long-term interests
ahead of the short-term politics,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provided all of the votes for the economic plan that is now
responsible for this historic prosperity and momentum in America,''
Gore echoed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota took even
sharper aim at congressional Republicans, charging that the
across-the-board tax cut widely advocated in the GOP would
disproportionately favor wealthy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle noted that working families making $38,000 a year _
currently 60 percent of all families _ would save an average of
only 27 cents a day under the Republican tax cuts. ``You can't
achieve big dreams with small change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican
Conference, responded to the Democratic rally by noting that the
GOP is ``committed to strengthening Social Security,'' improving
public schools and ``providing middle-class, working Americans with
much-needed tax relief now.''
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois called the
Democratic agenda ``a throwback to a time when some believed that
more government, more taxes and more centralized control promoted a
great society.'' In contrast, he said, ``I have worked with my
colleagues in the House and Senate to devise a balanced agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   However, congressional Republicans have yet to arrive at a
consensus on how to accomplish their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, appear more united than at any
time since Clinton was elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real ... political story out of this meeting may be that
we will have to retire that famous old Will Rogers quip, 'I don't
belong to an organized political party _ I'm a Democrat',''
asserted Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democratic political rivalries were checked at the door
as Senate and House Democrats filed into an ornate room at the
Library of Congress for their ``Families First'' event _ the first
party pep rally since the famous post-impeachment gathering on the
White House lawn last December.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is about to walk away with the party's 2000
presidential nomination, called Gephardt, his opponent in the 1988
campaign, ``a special friend'' and referred to him as ``the next
speaker of the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   And Daschle introduced Gore as ``the president of the United
States,'' then paused before adding ``Senate.'' As vice president,
Gore presides over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a way with a line,'' Gore told Daschle. ``Your timing
and rhythm are impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event, the first of its kind since Clinton's
acquittal in the Senate, came as first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
was appearing in New York, where there is widespread speculation
that she will run for a Senate seat next year.
</P>
<P>
   It also occurred only hours before former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky was to appear on network television to discuss her
affair with the president that led to Clinton's impeachment.

 Growing economy lays to rest fiscal policy myth  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The unveiling of a century-ending federal budget
brings to mind how this century's final decade has laid to rest a
generation's worth of fiscal policy myths.
</P>
<P>
   In the long-gone era of perceived budgetary red ink as far as
the eye could see, conventional wisdom said rising federal deficits
would lift interest rates and slow economic growth. It was the
``crowding out'' theory. As Uncle Sam borrowed more, it posited,
the credit capital available for businesses to finance expansion
would become increasingly scarce and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the sort happened, though. The interest rate trend
has been down during much of this decade. This was so even as the
deficit climbed to a record $290 billion in fiscal 1992 and stayed
above $200 billion through fiscal 1994. As the deficit moved into
surplus in 1998 for the first time in nearly 30 years, interest
rates remained on a predictably downward path.
</P>
<P>
   The experts were wrong because they didn't account for the power
of political stability. A rate-boosting credit squeeze failed to
materialize because the world remained willing to lend all U.S.
borrowers most of the credit they wanted at reasonable prices. This
willingness was largely due to America offering the safest
investment haven in the world, which also helps explain why chronic
trade deficits haven't brought the U.S. economy to grief.
</P>
<P>
   Another punctured myth is the belief that huge tax increases
would pose an insurmountable barrier to growth. This myth, too, has
been debunked largely because America is the home of the world's
most investor-friendly financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some die-hard critics of the Clinton administration claim this
economic expansion hasn't been as strong statistically in some ways
as the 1980s recovery, but they can't deny an indisputable fact:
This period of uninterrupted growth has been the longest in
peacetime history despite two substantial tax increases in the
1990s. If growth continues for another year or so, it will be the
longest expansion ever.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. economy grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate in last
year's final quarter, it was a phenomenal performance for a boom
this long in the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom was wrong because the experts failed to
fully comprehend the power of a hospitable investment climate.
Compared with Europe and Japan, for example, the U.S. stock market
is an investor's paradise. While far from perfect, the U.S. market
is probably unique in the way it protects shareholder interests.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting appeal of U.S. equity markets largely explains the
investor demand for stocks in recent years that has driven stock
prices higher than anyone thought they could go, given the
underlying economic fundamentals. As stock prices have soared,
Americans have felt wealthier, which has translated into a desire
to use their new wealth to finance a better life.
</P>
<P>
   With some two-thirds of economic growth fueled by personal
consumption, the result is a virtual circle. Rising consumption
brings economic growth, which encourages the stock investment that
drives equity prices higher and, in turn, creates aggressive
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the mix sound monetary policy that tames inflation, and
the combination becomes unbeatable.

   ``To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is
not given to men,'' wrote Edmund Burke in 1774. Nor, he might have
added, is it often given to humans to write about taxes and be
stimulating. Yet in ``The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans
Crazy and What to Do About It,'' Amity Schlaes not only manages to
keep you wide awake, she also sets your blood to boiling.
</P>
<P>
   She does so by citing particularly egregious examples of how our
current Rube Goldberg machine of a tax code sometimes works. She
tells, for instance, of a New York City couple who lost their
29-year-old son, an investment banker, in the crash of Pan Am's
Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, and were dunned by the Internal
Revenue Service for $6 million in back taxes on the settlement the
IRS estimated they would receive, even before the amount of that
settlement was determined.
</P>
<P>
   She tells of another couple who bought a house in East Dorset,
Vt., because of the area's outstanding schools, only to learn that
the state's supreme court had ruled that the local school-financing
system was unconstitutional, that it would no longer be all right
for one school district to spend more money on its students than
another, and that henceforth local real estate money was to be sent
to the state capital so that it could be given out equitably.
</P>
<P>
   She writes that Tax Freedom Day _ which is what a
Washington-based think tank called the Tax Foundation names the day
on which the average American has paid off his total annual burden
of federal, state and local taxes _ fell in 1998 on May 10, ``the
latest day in history.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Schlaes is getting at with these illustrations is not
exactly subtle. She is talking about estate taxes, real-estate
taxes and social-security taxes, and the point she is making is
that the present American tax system is greedy, intrusive,
unpredictable and meddling. The Internal Revenue Service in
administering this system acts with all the restraint and subtlety
of a 500-pound gorilla on amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Ms. Schlaes details other alleged excesses of what
Thomas Paine in ``The Rights of Man'' described as ``the greedy
hand of government thrusting itself into every corner and crevice
of industry, and grasping the spoil of the multitude.'' In a
chapter called ``Your Clothes,'' she describes shopping for
tax-free apparel at the Mall of America in Minneapolis-St. Paul as
an example of the lengths to which people will go to escape sales
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Your Work,'' she argues that the present Social Security
System is ``indeed and truly a Ponzi scheme,'' or a ruse in which
money from one generation flows into the pockets of another until
there are simply not enough people to pay. In ``Your Marriage,''
she explains how two conflicting goals, ``equality for the poor''
and ``equality for women,'' have combined to produce a result
whereby married people pay higher taxes than a comparably earning
single man and woman.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Your House,'' she argues apropos of the home-mortgage
deduction that if real estate did not ``enjoy a huge advantage over
other investments, our economy would grow more efficiently
overall.'' In ``Your Baby,'' she laments how the cost and
difficulty of hiring proper child care is actually causing couples
to give up having additional children. In ``Your Success,'' she
insists that the progressive income tax does more harm than good
and fails to fulfill its stated purpose of taxing the truly rich.
In ``Your Retirement,'' she describes how the Social Security
system has the effect of idling and infantilizing older people even
as the economy demands more workers and people are living longer,
more active lives.
</P>
<P>
   How does the book propose to solve these myriad ills, which add
up to such an indictment of our tax system that by the end you are
almost ready to accept the flat tax proposed by the House majority
leader, Dick Armey? Or the single tax once dreamed up by Henry
George. Or even a system based on cowrie shells or maybe bubble
gum. Encouragingly, Ms. Schlaes, a member of The Wall Street
Journal's editorial board, concludes that ``our impasse, in fact,
contains the outline of its own solution, if only we allow
ourselves to look at it clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``our long struggle with Paine's greedy hand'' tells us,
she writes, is that ``taxes have to be ``visible,'' ``simple,''
``for revenue'' (as opposed to for the purpose of steering
behavior), and ``lower.'' She goes on: ``We don't have to load
extra taxes on the rich''; ``It's time to privatize Social
Security''; ``Local is good,'' (``The federal government cannot
solve everything''), and ``We must lock in change.'' By this last
she means that we ought to clear out the present ``underbrush,''
and ``put through lower, simpler rates that apply to all in a
consistent manner'' and that we ought to pass a constitutional
amendment ``that calls for limiting federal taxes, including Social
Security, to 25 percent of our income, or even a lower share.''
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that ``luck is on our side. Today the nation is
actually in a better position to undertake a tax reform than at any
point in living memory. . . . Today we have no deficit and no Cold
War.'' We need only look to our own history of resisting taxes for
``the path to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be any number of details about which to quarrel with
Ms. Schlaes. For instance, she fails to prove her case that all
progressive systems inevitably fail to tax the rich proportionally,
and she leaves one to suspect that the real reason the rich gain
the benefit of loopholes is not because ``progressivity'' is flawed
but simply because the rich have more power. Many will question her
larger assumptions that the welfare state has proved itself useless
and that an untrammeled free market will not create its own
systemic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by criticizing our present tax code so concretely, Ms.
Schlaes has provided a thoughtful overview of the system's many
contradictions and inequities. Even if you don't always agree with
her conclusions, she defines the debate over what we ought to do
and gets you thinking constructively about the problems she
identifies.

CELTICS GET A DAY OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rick Pitino did a good thing for his tallest employees
Wednesday. He gave them the day off. His Celtics needed to rest
after playing five games in seven days. Not only does that mean
they are tired, it means they should not be surprised when they see
the remaining March schedule: 16 games in the next 29 days _ or a
game every other night. Ten of those games are on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pitino is tired from his coaching and presidential duties,
too. But he only has time for those trendy, 15-minute power naps.
While the Celtics were sleeping, shopping, catching up on their
bills, and playing video games, Pitino and general manager Chris
Wallace were at work.
</P>
<P>
   They have a lot to think about.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's trading deadline is a week from Thursday, at 6 p.m.
Pitino already has said he has made inquiries to teams, but he
insists he hasn't gone shopping for a power forward or center. He
knows that's one thing he has to think about in the next seven
days. Does he want to shop for this shortened season, especially
with his young team struggling with man-to-man defense? Or does he
maintain his position and hope his youthful players grow into
fierce defenders?
</P>
<P>
   Pitino became frustrated with his defense after the Celtics gave
up 116 points to the Cavaliers Tuesday night. Keep in mind that the
Cavs are usually the parched wanderers of the NBA desert,
desperately seeking offense. Their starting point guard, Brevin
Knight, had a sprained right index finger Tuesday and, if he had
played, wouldn't have been able to shoot. ``I don't know what we
would have done if he had to shoot free throws,'' Cavs coach Mike
Fratello said. ``Maybe shoot them lefthanded?''
</P>
<P>
   It never became an issue. The Cavs shot 58 percent, nearly
double their field-goal percentage from the previous night, and won
by 17 points. Knight didn't play. He used his healthy hand to
high-five teammates when they came to the Cavs bench. And Pitino
sat on the Celtics bench, seething because his team could not
press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very lacking in defensive talent,'' Pitino said
after the loss.
</P>
<P>
   What does he mean by that? Well, he looks at his roster and sees
four exceptional or potentially exceptional defenders, all of whom
have asterisks next to their names.
</P>
<P>
   --Bruce Bowen is a terrific defender. He knows where he and his
teammates should be on the Pitino Press. He rarely gets tired.
Twice this season, he has made one of the toughest plays a defender
can make: He has disrupted a point guard's dribble and cleanly
stolen the ball from him. The asterisk on Bowen is that he doesn't
score often and is making less than half of his free throws this
season.
</P>
<P>
   --Paul Pierce is a good defender _ for a rookie. But he is a
rookie. Not only does that mean he has to learn how to avoid
illegal defenses, flat feet, handchecks, and picks. It also means
he has to learn to keep an edge, which all veterans do. Pitino was
asked about Pierce's 0-for-11 shooting night on Tuesday. He halfway
joked that if Pierce had worked harder on defense, the ``Hoop God
would have let good things happen to him'' on offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the Celtics prefer a hungry Pierce. They
want the rookie who responded with a jump-shooting vengeance during
practice when someone screamed out the names of players drafted
ahead of him. They want the rookie who scowls when he blocks a
shot. That's one reason the coaching staff continually puts
challenges before Pierce, such as telling him that he graded out
dead-last during the team's game analysis charts. Pierce said he
likes those challenges and that ``Coach really knows how to
motivate me.''
</P>
<P>
   --Popeye Jones is a good defender who knows all the industry
secrets of pivot work. Asterisk: Pitino says Jones, coming off knee
surgery, probably won't be able to help this season.
</P>
<P>
   --Ron Mercer could grow into a solid defender. The team already
knows he can play a controlled offensive game (22 points, 4
assists, 1 turnover Tuesday). Now he has to prove he can control an
opposing shooting guard. Asterisk: If the Celtics are going to make
a trade and remain a talented team, Mercer would probably have to
be a part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pitino said finding an impact free agent in the
summer was his top priority. Maybe he will change that position and
pursue a center now. And if not, he still has some interesting
things to show the Celtics when they return to practice Thursday.
They fouled the Cavaliers 40 times, a sign of either poor
conditioning or poor positioning. They also missed six free throws
against the Nets and lost by 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's game against the Nuggets at the FleetCenter, the
Celtics have five consecutive road games. You will know a lot more
about the team when it returns to the FleetCenter on St. Patrick's
Day. You will know if the Celtics improved their defense and foul
shooting. And since they will be on the road when the trading
deadline strikes, you will know if there will be a new Celtic
returning home with them.

DISNEY NEGOTIATING TO BUILD THEME PARK IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Confirming weeks of breathless rumors, Hong Kong and
the Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that they were in early
negotiations about building a theme park in the former British
colony.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second Asia-based theme park for the
entertainment company and would mark a major expansion of Disney's
dealings with China, which regained sovereignty over Hong Kong 19
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said Disney
and the Hong Kong government had reached a ``common understanding''
about building a park in Hong Kong. He said they would now begin
``intensive negotiations'' and hoped to make a final decision by
the end of June. If a definitive agreement is reached, Sir Donald
said the first phase of a Hong Kong Disneyland could be completed
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its parks in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif., Disney
operates theme parks in suburban Paris and outside Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The mere whisper of Disney's interest has generated giddy
excitement in Hong Kong, which has been racked by recession and a
steep drop in tourism in the aftermath of Asia's financial crises
and the British-Chinese agreement that converted Hong Kong into a
special autonomous region of China.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Hong Kong have come to view a Disney park almost
as a pot of gold. Even as he confirmed the negotiations, Sir Donald
felt obliged to temper public expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully aware of, and indeed share, the public's excitement
at the prospect of seeing Mickey and his friends in Hong Kong,''
Sir Donald said in his annual budget address in the former colony.
``However, I must caution that while we have made the first
important steps, there is still much ground to cover. Much hard
negotiating lies ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which is based in Burbank, Calif., confirmed through a
spokesman that it was in preliminary discussions about building a
theme park resort in Hong Kong but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Disney, Michael Eisner, had said in the latest
annual report that Disney would likely build a park in China in the
coming years, and speculation grew that Hong Kong and Shanghai were
preferred locations.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where in China a Disney park is built, the
negotiations themselves are persuasive evidence that Disney's
fortunes in the world's most populous country are improving after a
three-year chill.
</P>
<P>
   China's film market was closed to Disney movies after the
company's 1996 release of ``Kundun,'' a film about the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is considered a
political enemy by Beijing. But in February, in an early sign of a
thaw, China approved the release of the Disney animated hit about
the Chinese heroine ``Mulan,'' which opened in theaters there last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Before Disney committed to Hong Kong, it would need to agree on
the price of the land for a theme park. Indeed, Ian Perkin, the
chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said:
``I'd say the chances of this are less than 50-50. If you look at
the cost of land in Hong Kong, I'm not sure Disney is willing to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald said the government and the company envisioned
building the park on reclaimed land north of Lantau Island, not far
from the new Hong Kong International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, which is also built on reclaimed land, cost $20
billion, an amount that included the vast network of bridges,
tunnels, highways and railways that connect the airport to central
Hong Kong. Some of that infrastructure could presumably serve a new
Disneyland as well. But the cost of another enormous reclamation
project could easily reach billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   One person with knowledge of the talks between Hong Kong and
Disney said the company had initially proposed that the government
give Disney the land. No matter how much Hong Kong wants to lure
Disney, analysts said it could not accede to such a deal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sir Donald said a theme park would generate thousands of new
jobs at a time when Hong Kong is suffering from record
unemployment. He said the park would also protect the territory's
status as a tourist destination in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Perkin agreed that a Disney theme park would be a potent growth
engine for Hong Kong. But because such a project would require
years of planning before construction started _ let alone the gates
opened _ he said it should not be viewed as a panacea for Hong
Kong's current problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Disney project, Sir Donald announced that the
government would build a giant industrial park for technology
companies. The $2 billion project, called Cyberport, will be
financed partly by the government and partly by the Pacific Century
Group, a real estate and technology company controlled by Richard
Li, the son of Hong Kong's most prominent tycoon, Li Ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald also forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product
would grow five-tenths of 1 percent in 1999, after plummeting 5.1
percent last year. Perkin said even that modest goal would be hard
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   For all the caveats, the prospect of a Disney park has been a
tonic to a city sorely in need of good news. The shares of Hong
Kong property developers have soared in recent days as the Disney
rumors percolated. Analysts said the value of real estate near the
park would rise significantly. In New York Stock Exchange trading
Wednesday, Disney shares rose 31.25 cents, to $34.50.

EXUBERANCE AND POWER IN A `GISELLE' MADE NEW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill., Spain)   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK _ The Ballet Nacional de Cuba, founded and directed by
Alicia Alonso, closed a U.S. tour with ``Giselle'' Tuesday night at
the New Jersey Performing Arts Center here. New York's loss is
Newark's gain: a new generation of young Cuban dancers led by the
vivacious Lorna Feijoo in the title role was cheered deservedly to
the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet superstars are more often than not linked to signature
ballets. Ms. Alonso, who danced with a variety of companies in the
United States from the 1930s, always has been associated with two
works. One is ``Theme and Variations,'' which George Balanchine
choreographed for her and Igor Youskevitch at American Ballet
Theater in 1947. That company honored her at a Metropolitan Opera
House Gala in 1997 on the ballet's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The other Alonso signature is ``Giselle,'' which the Cuban
ballerina first danced on Nov. 2, 1943, with Ballet Theater. That
debut made Ms. Alonso a star, and it is that 1940 Ballet Theater
production by Anton Dolin that is the springboard for the vibrant
and dramatically detailed version Ms. Alonso staged for her company
in 1959. New Yorkers saw it in 1978 and 1979 with Ms. Alonso
triumphant as Giselle in her troupe's official U. S. debut. Yet
then as now, it was obvious that the staging was carried not only
by a star's charisma but by a solid production, strong on details
in mime and technique.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feijoo is not a copy of Ms. Alonso; her onstage persona is
less internalized, more exuberant, and her wholesome appearance,
effectively transformed from Act I to Act II into a ghostly
presence, is very different from Ms. Alonso's long-legged elegance.
The beauty of the production is that it allows for individual
interpretations within a strong framework. It is true that the mime
in Act I sometimes verged on the over-coached. But it is also clear
that without every person onstage reacting to the unfolding events,
this outstanding production would not have its special character.
</P>
<P>
   It would be healthy to throw political assumptions out the
window. Ms. Alonso, now 79, founded a small troupe in 1948 that
grew into the present company. This ``Giselle,'' as Ballet Theater
veterans said in 1978 and repeated tonight, is remarkably close to
the old Ballet Theater version. Ms. Alonso substituted a pas de dix
instead of the usual Peasant Pas de Deux. But it is not the copy of
Soviet stagings that some in the public expected in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht, the aristocrat who betrays the peasant girl Giselle,
adds virtuoso steps that were not done in 1940. Essentially, this
``Giselle'' is pre-Soviet. Unlike Ballet Theater, which now
includes steps introduced by the Soviet defectors in its company,
it omits the passage at the end when Albrecht cradles Giselle, now
a ghost, before she glides out. This was a touch from the 1944
Bolshoi version.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Alonso's version, Giselle does a deep penche arabesque at
her grave. Albrecht presses her hand to his cheek; suddenly she is
sucked into the wings as she is pulled out. It is a tremendously
dramatic and moving moment. When Albrecht lies sobbing at the grave
(very Dolin), his grief is made real and a Romantic story of
remorse and regeneration has no truly happy end.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban ballet training recently has produced some male virtuosos:
Jose Manuel Carreno at Ballet Theater, Carlos Acosta at Houston
Ballet. In a company whose oldest dancer is now 29, the four male
soloists in the pas de dix stood out. Some were elegant and some
have an extraordinary spring to their leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Long dominated by Ms. Alonso, the Ballet Nacional traditionally
has focused on its women. Josefina Mendez, the company's ballet
mistress, has maintained a disciplined female corps. Ms. Alonso has
introduced some dancers from Spain. Myrtha, who led the corps of
wilis, or ghosts of jilted maidens, was Laura Hormigon, an immature
dancer from Spain who nonetheless has a wondrously tight bourree.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feijoo (whose sister, Lorena Feijoo, is with the Joffrey
Ballet of Chicago) embodies the strong projection and centered
dancing of the Cuban ballerinas. Her technique is powerful; she was
more a determined wili than an ethereal one. Exceptionally, she
keeps her toes always pointed, marvelously stretched and taut.
Dramatically, she understands the production's clear line between a
realistic first act and the supernatural Act II, where wilis run
head first and bent over, furies out to destroy men.
</P>
<P>
   In Act I, her impetuous peasant girl offered a controlled solo
with smooth attitude turns and astounding hops on one foot on toe
that covered the entire stage. Her mime in the mad scene, which
focused on her memories of the past and a developing breakdown (we
could see her chills) was emotionally powerful. Last but not least,
her arabesques went deeply into penche, and in the Alonso
tradition, her rapid entrechats brought down the house.
</P>
<P>
   As Albrecht, Oscar Torrado held his own, always classical in his
partnering stance. If not a virtuoso, he is an intelligent dancer.
As the seducer, he was contrasted with his woodcutter rival,
Hilarion, rugged and honest in Jose Zamorano's consistent
portrayal. Yet the only class-conscious touch was subtle: When
Albrecht's betrayal was revealed, the stage was metaphorically
divided into two groups, peasants on one side, aristocrats on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other versions, this one made a distinction between two
sets of flowers: Albrecht's roses that Giselle rejected, and white
lilies that he tore from her as tangible evidence of her ghostly
presence. From such details do superb restagings of the classic
grow.

THE VAST CONSPIRACY THAT CRIED WOLF 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<TEXT>
<P>
   As usual, Dan Quayle put it best. ``Do we really want to ask or
answer all these irrelevant questions about what someone may or may
not have done 20 or 30 years ago? Quite frankly, the American
people don't care,'' he told the New York Times recently. ``And
quite frankly, it's not that important. What's important is who you
are today, what you're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite right. What does it matter if, for example, Bill Clinton
forced himself on Juanita Broaddrick way back in 1978? Whom a man
may have raped in the privacy of her hotel room when he was
attorney general of Arkansas has nothing to do with his ability to
lead the nation into the 21st century. If an elected official is
doing a good job, how he relaxes during his free time is not a
legitimate public concern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denies the accusation, and there are good reasons not to
believe it. But it would have been better if he had said, with
simple dignity, ``none of your business.'' Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are winning press plaudits for
refusing to answer press questions about past private peccadilloes.
Exhausted by the Year of Flytrap, we have all decided that
politicians' private lives should stay private.
</P>
<P>
   Some might demur that rape is not a peccadillo. It is, among
other things, illegal. But so are pot smoking and cocaine snorting,
which are high on the list of private behavior politicians are
getting little gold stars for refusing to discuss. Is rape a worse
crime than using drugs? Well, many might think so, but you wouldn't
know it from the way most politicians talk about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In declining to talk about his own drug experience, George W.
made the interesting point that he didn't want to give young people
today the unfortunate (though accurate) impression that you could
do whatever he did when young and still end up governor of Texas.
Certainly this argument applies in the case of alleged rape by a
president even more currently popular than the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious why the liberal perverts and druggies of the
Democratic Party favor a curtain being drawn on politicians'
private lives. But how did Republican politicians--pure of body and
spirit--get into this position? One way is by repeating the mantra
``it's not about sex'' just once or twice too often. They thought
they had him by the legalities on perjury and obstruction of
justice, and in attempting to win converts to their cause they may
have been more dismissive than they intended about the sex thing.
Too late, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Larry Flynt. A few conservative voices, such as the
Weekly Standard and the Wall Street Journal editorial page,
remained steadfast in their hysterical disapproval of the
president's private sexual behavior, and remained adamant that it
is a legitimate public issue. But even they--like all politicians
of both parties, almost all the media, and most of the
citizenry--were hysterical and adamant that Larry Flynt should not
be allowed to draw public attention to the private sexual behavior
of anyone else. (The Journal even insisted that Flynt should be
prosecuted for blackmail.)
</P>
<P>
   Why? If a category of information is legitimately useful in
judging an elected public official, how can it be illegitimate and
outrageous to gather and publish such information? Maybe they
decided that Clinton was a good place to stop. When your side has
launched an offensive, been driven back and nervously awaits a
counteroffensive, it's not a bad time for an armistice. That would
be hypocritical of course. But newspapers have the right to
practice hypocrisy in the privacy of their own editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   But did the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy tragically call for a
cease-fire just as the ultimate weapon was about to be delivered
into their hands? Did they dig a tunnel to within an inch of
freedom from their Clinton imprisonment when they gave up? Did they
finally have an accusation that would shock a seemingly unshockable
public? Rape! Those few elements of the VRWC that haven't been
drained of fight--Fox News, for example--are flogging the Juanita
Broaddrick story with at least a bit of the old spirit and are
puzzled that even this hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   It is puzzling. The evidence is flaky--a woman who has both
confirmed and denied the story, corroborators with their own
reasons to lie--but major scandals have been built on less. Yes,
we're all suffering from scandal fatigue, but rape? The explanation
is partly the frog-in-hot-water phenomenon (he'll jump out if you
drop him in boiling water, but not if you put him in cold water and
slowly heat it to boiling).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has faced an escalating series of serious
accusations--serious in the sense that they were all plausible and
some were true. One or another of them might have stuck, but each
one inured the public to the next. (Clinton skillfully augmented
this process by pacing any admissions he has been forced to make,
so that each new one was just a small accretion on a large pile of
old news.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has also faced a continuing barrage of
unserious allegations--implausible and untrue. He's been accused of
murdering 23 people, among other things. The effect of these
stories from the nether regions of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy
has been like crying wolf. When you've heard the president
preposterously accused of murder so often, you just yawn when he's
accused of rape.
</P>
<P>
   So now we are living in the world everyone has long claimed to
want: where we judge politicians based only on the issues and their
public records of governance. Some might feel that healthy
indifference to what politicians do in their private lives has gone
too far when it covers allegations of rape. But they'll get used to
it.

WHAT MAKES SOCIETY CIVIL? 
</HEADLINE>
  By HERBERT STEIN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making Nice
</P>
<P>
   As I understand it, when political scientists and sociologists
refer to a society as ``civil'' they are citing the many important
functions that are performed by voluntary, intermediate
institutions. These institutions are intermediate between the state
and the individual. They are voluntary in that the performance of
individuals within these institutions is not dictated by the state
or by the exigencies of the market. Churches, trade unions,
philanthropic bodies, and clubs are examples of such institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these intermediate institutions is a society in itself,
and each of us spends much of his life in them. Some of these
little societies are civil and some are not. I use the word
``civil'' here to mean that the participants are cooperative and
respectful of the others and their interests. That is different
from ``polite,'' which is a surface quality. The chairman of a
congressional committee who calls upon ``the gentle lady from
Arkasota,'' while thinking, ``you dumb hillbilly bitch,'' is polite
but not civil in my sense.
</P>
<P>
   What makes some of these minisocieties civil and some not? I
think of two in my experience that were especially civil. One was
the Center for Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences, where I
spent a year as a fellow more than 30 years ago. There were about
30 of us fellows at the center--economists, political scientists,
historians, sociologists and psychologists. Most of us knew few--if
any--of the others before we met there, but we immediately became
friends and enjoyed a pleasant social life together. More
important, we could consult each other and collect candid advice.
There was no feeling of rivalry among us.
</P>
<P>
   Being happy just to be at the center had something to do with
the pervasive good feelings. Also, each of us had shed both his ego
requirements and drive for status--at least for the duration of the
year's leave. The fellowship was not part of one's real life, it
was an interlude to be enjoyed and not spoiled by conflict. It was
as if we were on a cruise ship with passengers we had never seen
before and would probably not see again after the cruise was over.
</P>
<P>
   My second example is the book discussion group I belong to at
Washington's Cosmos Club (a venerable gentlemen's club, which now
admits women as well). Book discussion groups are regularly
described as scenes of rivalry and hostility--of fights over which
books to read and who gets to talk the most. Why is our group
civil? I credit, in part, the physical and psychological
environment of the club, which makes for dignified clubbiness. But
what's more important is the character of the participants. We are
all members or spouses of members of the club. We are mostly pretty
old. And we have mostly had, and may still be having, some
achievement and attention outside the book discussion group. So
nobody feels the need to assert his individuality and importance.
We can relax and enjoy the pleasure of civil behavior to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   These may seem trivial cases, in which neither the gain from
cooperative effort nor the possible gain from individual assertion
is very large. The key is not in the absolute strength of these
gains but in their relative strength. In the cases I have
mentioned, the two forces are weak, but the need for
ego-satisfaction in this arena is weaker than the gain from
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I can give a more serious example. For many years, starting with
the end of World War II, I worked for an organization of
businessmen formulating policy statements on issues of economic
policy. We were all--businessmen and staff--impressed with the
failures of policy that caused the Depression and that may have
contributed to the outbreak of war. We thought we had some insights
that would help to avert such failures in the future. At the same
time, the organization was a major scene in which we might struggle
for self-expression and status. It was where we staffers spent most
of our waking hours, derived our incomes, and achieved status
internally and to the rest of the world. But the divisiveness of
these interests was outweighed by our common interest in the
program on which we had embarked. So we all worked together eagerly
and happily to try to bring about a change of policy. We were a
civil society.
</P>
<P>
   But after about 10 years, the memories of Depression and war
were fading, some of what we thought were new ideas had become
conventional wisdom, and many of the most inspiring leaders of the
group had gone on to other things or had retired. Then we gradually
sank into bureaucratic rivalry and sparring--into incivility.
</P>
<P>
   Different participants in a society will have different views of
how civil it is. I thought that those of us who worked on the
economics side of the Nixon administration made up a civil society.
We had a common goal--the success of the administration in
economics--and felt besieged by a common enemy, the media. I did
not covet anyone else's job and did not feel that anyone coveted
mine. I had no ambitions for more status and attention within that
society. But then I read in Bob Haldeman's diary, which was
published in 1994, that in 1972 Secretary of the Treasury John
Connally had complained to Haldeman that several people--including
me--were conspiring against him. Evidently, Connally did not regard
that society as civil. For him it was a jungle out there, even
though one of the predators was really a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Civil behavior has two sides. One side is treating other people
with civility. The second side is interpreting the attitude and
behavior of other people toward oneself as civil. For most people I
suppose the first side is difficult without the second. In the
Nixon administration, John Connally was not civil in the second
sense. That led him to the not-very-civil act of complaining to Bob
Haldeman.
</P>
<P>
   Civility is not one of the major virtues. It is not like courage
or honesty. The friendly cooperation that characterizes civil
societies is a pale shadow of the love that inspires great
self-sacrifice. But to participate in societies that one perceives
to be civil adds much to the pleasure of life.

FOREST ADVOCATES CRITICIZE TREE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A landmark deal signed this week to protect
thousands of acres of redwoods, some 1,500 years old, was hailed by
politicians as a majestic step toward creating a new Yosemite along
the Northern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   But to some environmentalists and others who have watched the
wrangling over what is known as the Headwaters Forest, the $480
million federal and state deal to acquire 10,000 acres from the
Pacific Lumber Co. is flawed, overhyped and wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about the people who gave their very lives for this,
and then I started thinking about what our government was willing
to give,'' said Julia Butterfly, who has lived high up in a redwood
tree for the past 15 months in a quest to protect the forest. ``And
all they were willing to give was compromise upon compromise upon
compromise, until the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the day the agreement was signed, certainly marked a
major turning point for the Headwaters. But the next five years of
the Headwaters may end up looking in many ways like the past five
years: lawsuits and logging, demonstrations and discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are reviewing the agreement to see if it gives
Pacific Lumber loopholes to violate the Endangered Species Act. If
they find them, they say the will sue, as they have sued before.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, taxpayers spent $380 million to buy about
7,500 acres of redwood groves in Humboldt County. An additional
$100 million is expected to buy two other redwood groves in the
coming months, bringing the total acreage to 10,000 under public
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The deal dwarfs the $63 million the federal government recently
paid Utah for almost a million acres of desert in the Grand
Staircase National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped up in the Headwaters purchase is a complicated federal
and state logging plan for 211,000 more acres Pacific Lumber is
harvesting in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The management plan forbids the company to log near streams,
curtails some road building and requires constant monitoring of
logging practices, to protect the coho salmon and other endangered
species living in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout at least five years of negotiating to acquire the
Headwaters, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has always encouraged
environmentalists to see the forest through the trees. This deal
was not perfect, she said repeatedly, but it was the best anyone
could hope for and undoubtedly the strictest logging restrictions
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly was the toughest negotiation I ever got myself
into,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core environmentalists pushed so hard they ended up
alienating many lawmakers they once considered allies. But
mainstream activists ended up seeing what Feinstein and others saw:
This was, after all, private property, and there were no guarantees
that a court battle would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't be certain the Endangered Species Act and
California's logging regulations would be stronger than the omnibus
agreement signed Monday with Houston-based financier Charles
Hurwitz, whose Maxxam Corp. is the parent of Pacific Lumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neglect of the federal Endangered Species Act and state
forestry law allowed Hurwitz to hold the Headwaters for ransom,''
said Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope. ``A pattern of
strict enforcement would have prevented him and other Wall Street
raiders from using property rights arguments as an excuse to
destroy public resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber has contended that under the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment, it had a right to fair compensation for its property.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said the property rights argument was a bluff,
a device Hurwitz used to extort $480 million out of the government
to buy some trees he probably couldn't log anyway because of the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're allowed to do something on private property but not if
it adversely affects your neighbors,'' said Michael Passoff of the
Bay Area Coalition for Headwaters in San Francisco. ``You can't
build a porn shop next to a church and you can't sell guns from
your home next to a school.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several groups have a decade invested in the Headwaters
agreement. They promised continued demonstrations and monitoring,
just as state officials promised to step up enforcement of
environmental laws governing logging.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists worried that logging on steep slopes within
the Headwaters would erode the hills, creating more mudslides and
ruining the habitat for the endangered coho salmon. They say
loopholes in the law allow the company to log even before a
scientific assessment of the logging is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Some Stafford residents have sued Pacific Lumber over a 1997
mudslide that crashed down a clear-cut hillside and destroyed 10
houses in the Humboldt County community. The logging company has
been cited by state forestry officials for 134 violations since
1996 for things such as running heavy equipment through streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took more than a decade of litigation and protest to gain
some measure of protection for the marbled murrelet and the old
growth redwoods,'' said Cecilia Lanman, program director for the
Environmental Protection Information Center. ``It may take 10 more
years to bring about protection for our native salmon and steelhead
_ if we're not already too late.''

CLINTON MUST COME CLEAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Only two people know if Juanita Broaddrick is telling the truth
about what happened in a Little Rock hotel room 21 years ago. The
country heard from one of them in Broaddrick's seemingly credible
interview on ``Dateline NBC'' last week. She said Bill Clinton,
then attorney general of Arkansas and a candidate for governor,
raped her.
</P>
<P>
   The country must hear from the president: not through his lawyer
but directly, in a national address. The seriousness of this charge
demands a response in kind.
</P>
<P>
   An accusation of rape cannot be dismissed as just another
``bimbo eruption'' or one more randy rumor about a man's sexual
escapades. Broaddrick's allegation of sexual assault is something
quite different, for it accuses the man who is now president of
committing a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Broaddrick's accusation, if true, cannot be judged in
the light of politics. It is about callous brutality.
</P>
<P>
   She may be lying, and her story could indeed have politics at
its core. If so, the president should loudly deny it, even at the
risk of being ridiculed for another impassioned assertion of his
nonrelationship with a woman. The truth is more important than the
ridicule. If the truth is in between _ that there was sex but it
was consensual _ Clinton should say that.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Broaddrick has not flinched at the skeptics critical of
her for first filing an affidavit denying the assault and later
recanting to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   She told NBC's Lisa Myers that she had to tell the truth
publicly now because she ``couldn't hold it in any longer.'' She
said she did not go to police in 1978 because she thought no one
would believe her. She said she blamed herself _ a sadly common
reaction of rape victims, even in the more enlightened 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While her story is no longer legally relevant after 21 years, it
is still morally relevant, for it concerns the man elected to lead
a nation. It's time for Bill Clinton to tell us who that man is.

THE REAL THREAT IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The aura of contention hovering over Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's just-concluded visit to China is primarily the
effect of partisan kibitzing and the media's appetite for conflict.
This is not to say that the regime in Beijing has not been cracking
down on citizens who seek to organize political parties to rival
the Communists. It is also true that China has been accumulating
missiles to threaten Taiwan, and some of its nationals have been
arrested while trying to buy US-made missile gyroscopes on a list
of items not to be sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But it is wrong to pretend that Beijing has suddenly become a
serious threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The great threat emanating from today's China is the prospect of
an economic downturn leading to social and political instability.
The same State Department report that castigates China for human
rights abuses also makes the point that the Chinese economy is
suffering a pronounced slowdown. Economic growth last year was
nowhere near the official figure of 7.8 percent, the report says,
but ``was widely considered to be between 3 and 5 percent.''
Enormous problems accompany this declining rate of growth,
including state enterprises that need reform, unemployment,
underemployment, and regional economic disparities.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists are watching a ``floating population'' of as many
as 130 million peasants drifting to the cities in search of work.
They see peasants rioting in villages and workers rioting in
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders who met Albright know they cannot afford to continue
subsidizing uncompetitive state enterprises, but they fear that the
Chinese economy cannot generate enough jobs to absorb the tens of
millions of workers who must be cast out of the state-owned
factories without a social safety net. For their part, China's
neighbors fret about the threat of a Chinese currency devaluation
and cutthroat competition for export markets.
</P>
<P>
   The United States need not muffle its criticism of Beijing's
crackdown on dissidents, but it should nurture a patient and
confident expectation that a new Chinese generation, molded by the
Internet and the entrepreneurial principle of constant change, will
soon undo the structures of the old Reds.

GRILL GURU HAS MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE  
 (ADV: INCLUDES RECIPES) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Grill guru Mad Coyote Joe Daigneault wasn't born with
a spatula in his hand, but almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really destined to be an ironworker,'' said Daigneault
(pronounced DAY-no), charming host of ``The Sonoran Grill,'' a
weekend cooking show produced by Phoenix ABC affiliate Channel 15
(KNXV). ``When I was 13 years old and everybody else had a paper
route, I worked in a steelyard in South Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault's family was big in steel and iron. He was, too, for
a while, rising to supervisory positions on crews and contributing
to various structural landmarks around the Phoenix area, including
Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your job as an ironworker foreman is to take a large group of
men and make them work like dogs,'' he said. ``I was very good at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``I hated it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a guy who got up in the morning and drank coffee and
went out to work and worked my (backside) off and pushed people
around all day long and came home tired. On the weekends, I'd just
drink beer and wait to go back at it again, and I was just dead. I
wasn't happy. I liked my wife, my wife liked me, but it was
soulless.''
</P>
<P>
   One day came a disagreement with a job superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I need some time off,' '' Daigneault said. ``He said,
`How much time off?' I said, `About 35 years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault had been a lifelong cooking and grilling hobbyist.
(Instead of an ashtray or spice rack, he built a barbecue in
junior-high shop class. ``I went home and put some briquettes in,''
he said. ``The thing melted, but it shows I was interested.'')
</P>
<P>
   He also had been dabbling with a home-grown dry spice and
recipe-mix business. (The Mad Coyote brand name already had been
born in a beer-drinking session with some buddies.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, Daigneault was a full-timer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first month that I quit my job, I made $800,'' he said.
``The second month after I quit my job, I made $3,000, and I told
my wife, `We'll never be poor again. This is great. I've found it.'
I didn't have another $3,000 month for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mad Coyote spice-mix business has had its ups and downs over
the past decade _ currently, the company manufactures 54 culinary
products under a variety of labels, including fajitas, chili and
salsa mixes _ but Mad Coyote Joe himself has become a rising star
on local TV.
</P>
<P>
   Discovered by Channel 15 producer Paul Hallowell, Daigneault is
the centerpiece of a minor hit, which began airing slightly more
than a year ago. ``The Sonoran Grill's'' ratings have been
increasing steadily, and its performance has exceeded Channel 15's
expectations. According to Nielsen figures supplied by the station,
an average of nearly 100,000 adults saw the combined weekend
airings during the recent November sweeps ratings period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally spend the first two hours of my day every Monday
answering all the e-mail we get from the show,'' Hallowell said.
``I get stuff from 89-year-olds, kids . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Convicts,'' Daigneault added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very diverse audience from all over the state,''
Hallowell continued.
</P>
<P>
   The show's primary sponsor, AJ's Fine Foods, also is pleased. A
total of 36 episodes is ordered for this year, with expectations of
future seasons to come.
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault specializes in demystifying sophisticated recipe
ingredients _ the kind of fancy stuff you might purchase at a
high-end grocery store like, say, AJ's.
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault, who has worked in the kitchens of several Valley
restaurants and who serves as head judge and master of ceremonies
for the Xerox Southwest Salsa Challenge benefiting the Hemophilia
Association tries ``to take on things that are perceived as
complex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just taking some ingredients and combining them. It's
just not that big of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault's wife, Kathy, a former resort chef, sometimes
contributes to the recipe-selection process, but the show's unusual
appeal comes from its host's offbeat sense of humor and
ultracasual, regular-guy-at-the-grill approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing is, I want to be the guy down the street who drives a
cement truck, your neighbor buddy who loves to cook in his back
yard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A natural performer, Daigneault studied music and drama at
Northern Arizona University, and he occasionally gigs around town
on guitar under various names. When he's done chopping something on
the show, whatever doesn't go in the pot or on the grill tends to
get tossed over his shoulder and into the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The series actually is shot (five production hours per episode)
in the back yard of Daigneault's Cave Creek, Ariz., home, and that
setting provides the show its underlying philosophy: No matter how
out-there the recipes and ingredients might get _ octopus tacos,
say, or game hen with stuffing made from pinon nuts and fresh
roasted green chiles _ it's still a cookout. The show's gimmick
would appear to be the visual contradiction of a great big,
sometimes goofy guy dicing dainty victuals, but there's more to it
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a television show called ``The Sonoran Grill,''
Daigneault said. ``It stars the food. It has a host. Humor is the
guest star, but only a guest star. We don't want to turn it into
the ``Saturday Night Live'' of cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula seems to be working. ``Sonoran Grill'' recipes are
distributed on Channel 15's World Wide Web site _ www.knxv.com _
and in AJ's stores in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people come up to produce managers, going, `Give me
everything on this recipe card,' '' said Barbara Carrera-Holland,
media director for AJ's parent company, Bashas'. ``We get letters
all the time that say `I've never stepped foot into AJ's until I
saw this show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the legend of Mad Coyote Joe grows.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, ``people think I'm a biker, and they leave me
alone,'' he said. But should he venture out in public wearing the
ball cap and blue-denim shirt he wears on the program, ``I'll have
20 people walk up to me and say, (begin ital) `You're that guy.' ''
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   It happened recently in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., which Channel
15 reaches via translator, and to where Daigneault had traveled to
participate in a chili cook-off. As sometimes happens at such
gatherings, Daigneault found himself in a bar at the end of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trucker comes up and says, `You know, down in Missouri,
we've been watching your show for years,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm not sure we're on in Missouri.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We get it on the satellite.' '' &QL;

and 1/2 cup green chile in a large bowl. Toss all ingredients. Add
broth slowly, stiring, and let stand until moistened. Makes 10 cups
stuffing, enough to stuff a 14-pound turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Note from Joe: You may try adding pinon nuts and green chile to
your family recipe. I would suggest you reduce the level of spice,
because of the delicate flavor of the pinon nuts. Butter is not
used in this recipe because of the natural oil in the pinon nuts.

   Makes 8 to 10 servings.

   Arizona Sweet Corn Pudding
</P>
<P>
   (From Mad Coyote Joe)
</P>
<P>
   4 ears of Arizona sweet corn
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half

<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red bell pepper, sliced in thin julienne strips
</P>
<P>
   1/2 poblano chile, diced into 1/4-inch pieces

HIGH COURT RULES PUBLIC MUST PAY FOR IN-SCHOOL CARE FOR DISABLED
STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Iowa, Pa.)  (fe) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Students with disabilities who require special care
during the school day are entitled to that care at public expense,
the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday, as long as the services can
be provided by someone other than a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision upheld lower court rulings that required an
Iowa school district to provide a trained aide to monitor the needs
of a quadriplegic boy who was dependent on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   It was a substantial victory for families of children with
disabilities, who have become increasingly assertive about their
rights under federal law and who in many cases have met resistance
from school districts burdened by the mounting costs of special
education.
</P>
<P>
   Without someone available at all times, the boy, a bright
student who was injured in a childhood accident, would not have
been able to attend school. The question was whether the parents
had to pay for the full-time aide or whether the school district
had that obligation under a federal law, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act, which guarantees a ``free appropriate
public education'' to students with disabilities. The law provides
that in addition to special education, school districts must pay
for ``related services'' but need not pay for ``medical services.''
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for the family, the court adhered to its view in a
1984 case that as long as a student's physical needs can be met by
someone who is not a doctor, the required services do not fall
within the excluded ``medical services'' category. ``A rule that
limits the medical services exemption to physician services is
unquestionably a reasonable and generally workable interpretation
of the statute,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said in the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cedar Rapids Community School District had argued that the
question should be not whether a doctor or someone else provided
the services, but rather how complex, continuous and expensive the
services were, a ``multifactor test'' requiring a detailed analysis
of each case. But ``the district's multifactor test is not
supported by any recognized source of legal authority,'' Stevens
said. ``The district may have legitimate financial concerns, but
our role in this dispute is to interpret existing law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the district argued that the cost would be more than
$20,000 a year, the majority opinion disputed this, noting that the
boy, identified in the case as Garret F., was already entitled to
an aide who turned pages for him and kept his desk in order. The
district could hire an aide who could both perform those tasks and
be trained to attend to the ventilator and other physical needs,
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that without the services Garret could not stay in
school, Stevens said, ``This case is about whether meaningful
access to the public schools will be assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion in the case,
Cedar Rapids vs. Garret F., No. 96-1793, which Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy joined. Congress passed the law ``to increase the
educational opportunities available to disabled children, not to
provide medical care for them,'' they said, adding that the law as
interpreted by the court ``blindsides unwary states with fiscal
obligations that they could not have anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The National School Boards Association, which joined the case on
the district's side, said in its brief that providing the services
would be particularly burdensome to small school districts. The
association estimated that 17,000 children would be affected
nationwide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a second decision on Wednesday, the court ruled that private
insurance companies that administer part of a state's workers'
compensation program do not thereby become agents of the state for
constitutional purposes. The distinction matters because only state
officials or ``state actors'' can be sued for deprivations of
constitutional rights. The allegation in this case was that
insurers in Pennsylvania deprived injured workers of due process by
suspending payment during disputes over the necessity of particular
medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
which was 7-2 on the state action question, overturned a ruling by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action taken by private entities with the mere approval or
acquiescence of the state is not state action,'' the chief justice
said. Stevens and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not join this
portion of the ruling, arguing that the state action analysis was
unnecessary because the court then went on to decide that the due
process claim lacked merit even against the state officials who
also were defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. vs.
Sullivan, No. 97-2000, was closely watched for its broader
implications in an era when public functions are increasingly being
turned over to private entities. One immediate impact is likely to
be a victory for the federal government in a long-running dispute
over whether the Department of Health and Human Services must hold
private health maintenance organizations, which enroll Medicare
recipients, to various due process requirements in handling
disputes with their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Clinton administration filed a Supreme Court
appeal of an injunction, issued by a federal court in Tucson,
Ariz., in a nationwide class action lawsuit, that required HMOs to
meet various requirements for notice and hearings. In the appeal,
Shalala vs. Grijalva, No. 98-1284, the administration is arguing
that the HMOs are not state actors. On the basis of Wednesday's
ruling, the court is likely to agree and to vacate the injunction.

THREE OF TEXAS OCTUPLETS GO HOME FROM HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three of the seven surviving Chukwu octuplets were
given a clean bill of health and sent home from the hospital
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The discharged babies, the first of the octuplets to leave Texas
Children's Hospital here, ``had kind of done everything we needed
them to do,'' said Dr. Patti Savrick, the pediatrician who will
continue to care for them. The babies had all been removed from
respiratory support and were able to maintain their body
temperature and take food on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the hospital a few hours after
discharge, the parents, Nigerian-born American citizens, laughed
when asked whether they had had seven bassinets waiting for the
babies at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven everything,'' said the mother, Nkem Chukwu.
</P>
<P>
   The infants sent home are Ebuka, a girl born on Dec. 8, about
two weeks before the seven others, who was discharged weighing 4
pounds 8 ounces; her sister Echerem, 4 pounds 7 ounces, and their
brother Jioke, 5 pounds 5 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at the hospital, said
these three had been the first to begin bottle feedings and had
consistently gained weight.

BARBARA FENZL RELISHES ROLE AS CULINARY FORCE  
 (ADV: INCLUDES RECIPES. WITH SAVOR) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Barbara Fenzl didn't grow up under the tutelage of a
mother who cooked. But she grew up with a mother who exposed her
family to wonderful foods.
</P>
<P>
   The day Mom brought home and savored a steamed artichoke is a
culinary memory that lingers in Barbara's mind.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was raising three children of her own, Barbara
was a master in the kitchen, with a sophisticated palate and a
degree from the renowned Cordon Bleu cooking school in London.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, she has operated her own cooking school in Phoenix,
Les Gourmettes, where she teaches three classes a week and spices
up the curriculum with guest instructors, including such globally
known chefs as Jacques Pepin, Martin Yan and Anne Willan and such
local luminaries as Vincent Guerithault and Christopher Gross.
</P>
<P>
   She was food editor of ``Southwest Passages'' magazine from
1992-1995 and food editor of ``Phoenix Home &AMP; Garden'' magazine
from 1987-1992. She is a past president of the International
Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP) and a founding member
of the Phoenix chapter of Les Dames d'Escoffier, a group of 1,900
women food, wine and hospitality experts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a resume any food lover would be content with.
</P>
<P>
   But her grandest adventure yet is just beginning. On March 9,
PBS Channel 8 (KAET), operating from Arizona State University,
launches ``Savor the Southwest,'' a cooking show hosted by Barbara
and 14 noted American chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done so many wonderful things in my life,'' Barbara says.
``And now this show. I keep pinching myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara was the obvious choice to host the Phoenix-based series.
A 30-year Phoenix area resident, she is credited with helping
Phoenix to gain national prominence as a culinary destination.
While president of the IACP, she staked a claim for her city and
made her name among the country's top food wonks. From 1989 to
1995, she served on the IACP's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Phoenix will host the IACP's annual convention,
welcoming an all-star lineup from within the industry.
</P>
<P>
   A founder of the local chapter of the American Institute of Wine
and Food, Barbara serves on its national board of directors and is
an institute benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   She is a charter member of the Arizona Culinary Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara has worked tirelessly over the years to bring the
Phoenix area out of a small-town mentality that as recently as 15
years ago supported little more than a plethora of Mexican eateries
and the odd French restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is small-town no more. Creative chefs make their mark
here. Even jaded Easterners applaud the Phoenix area for its
innovative cuisine, and Barbara is singled out as one who helped
steer that course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona _ how do I put this politely? _ is rather recently
arrived on the culinary scene,'' says R.W. Apple Jr., chief
correspondent for the ``New York Times,'' who recently examined
Phoenix's growth and culture in a multipart series.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara, he says, ``is generally recognized as the best person
in Arizona on these subjects. Her rise has been related to the rise
of Arizona as a place to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple credits her sophistication and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have someone around with the knowledge of
eating in Europe and Asia as an evaluator of what's taking place on
the local scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert McGrath, chef-owner of the Roaring Fork in Scottsdale and
the first chef featured on ``Savor the Southwest,'' is one of
Barbara's biggest fans. It was Barbara, he says, who wooed him to
Phoenix when she invited him to participate in an olive-oil
symposium in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A Texan, he fell in love with the city. They've been friends and
colleagues ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives us a conduit to a national level _ her credentials,
her energy, her name,'' McGrath says, taking precious time away
from his kitchen at the height of the dinner hour to praise his
friend. ``She's just a nice lady. She's great.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Chicago, Barbara, 53, became serious about food when
she married Terry Fenzl, now an attorney for the Phoenix law firm
of Brown and Bain. She and Terry met while students at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Although Terry's mother was a culinary whiz, cooking Austrian
favorites on special occasions, Barbara's mother had grown up in a
family with a cook who banned everyone else from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   After Barbara and Terry were married in 1967 and moved to
Phoenix, they began traveling to Europe, where they tasted the
finest foods from celebrated chefs and learned to re-create the
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   With a bachelor's from Wisconsin and a master's from Arizona
State University, Barbara went to work as a social-studies teacher
in Phoenix. In 1971, she and Terry had their first child, and she
didn't teach again until she took a job at Rio Salado Community
College a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   By then, she and her food-savvy husband had been through several
fantasy cooking courses in such French villages as Perouges,
Annency and Eugenie-les-Bains. The latter school was run by the
legendary Michel Guerard, creator of ``cuisine minceur,'' a
reduced-calorie style of French cooking served at his signature
spa.
</P>
<P>
   While studying at the spa, the Fenzls rubbed elbows with British
lords and ladies and California winemaker Robert Mondavi, who also
were students in the intimate classroom. To the accompaniment of a
piano player flown in from Paris, the students cooked all afternoon
and ate until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing week,'' Barbara says.
</P>
<P>
   On nights off, they dined in local restaurants that served
memorable cuisine. At one, each guest received a hand-embroidered
napkin woven with that night's menu.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the number of Barbara's culinary acquaintances was
growing. She met the suave Pepin and grande dame Julia Child, who
urged her to open a cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been my mentor ever since,'' Barbara says, confirming
that Child is as charming in person as she is on television.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the early 1980s, the Valley offered a handful of
cooking classes. Barbara opened Les Gourmettes with another
teacher, Pam Wischkaemper. The two ran the school out of their
Valley homes while raising preschool children.
</P>
<P>
   When Barbara decided she needed more solid teaching credentials,
Terry took a three-month leave of absence from his law firm, and
the family rented a home for the summer in London. Barbara studied
at the Cordon Bleu while Terry minded the three kids.
</P>
<P>
   Les Gourmettes took off and now enjoys widespread popularity,
serving more than 1,200 students a year.
</P>
<P>
   The notion for a locally based cooking show began in 1994, when
Barbara published the cookbook ``Southwest the Beautiful.'' Jillian
Robinson, a producer at Channel 8, told Barbara she wanted to
develop ``a show like your book.''
</P>
<P>
   They drew up a proposal and assembled a who's-who of
Southwestern chefs. With such an esteemed cast, ``Savor'' will
enhance Phoenix's growing reputation as a tasty destination for
fine cooking and dining, Barbara believes: ``I think this is going
to do even more to put Phoenix on the culinary map.'' &QL;

<P>
   Until recently, people who talked to their cars were generally
considered to be bemused, unstable or possibly nuts. Soon they will
be considered the high-tech elite.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, a driver seen chatting to the dashboard may
in fact be giving voice commands to a new on-board personal
computer (of course, the person could still be nuts).
</P>
<P>
   The first such device was introduced late last year by Clarion,
a car-stereo manufacturer, but the concept is getting a leg up from
Intel, which has developed a microprocessor that is specifically
designed for the rigors of use in a car computer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Society of Automobile Engineers in Detroit this week,
Intel is talking about the capabilities of what it calls its
Connected Car PC. Among the prospective features: a Global
Positioning System that will give a driver the car's location,
directions to destinations and voice control over the radio, CD
player and cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   It will also let passengers have access to e-mail and surf the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers will also be able to ask the computer to download news
stories or traffic news from the Internet, then read the
information aloud using a voice synthesizer, said Patrick Johnson,
director of in-car computing operations at Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that the cost for the computers would be $1,500 to
$2,000 and that various car makers and electronics makers would be
making them available later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's microprocessors will be unusual in that they must
be able to withstand temperatures as high as 200 degrees and as low
as 40 degrees below zero to meet automotive industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   In a variation on the theme, Visteon Automotive Systems has
announced plans to sell an entertainment system for the back seats
of Ford Windstar and Mercury Villager mini-vans. The system,
scheduled to be available on April 1 for around $1,300, will
include a Nintendo 64 game machine and a VCR designed to keep the
children occupied on car trips.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare, Sony this week announced its plans for the
next generation of Playstation, which will be released in early
2000. The company said graphics would come to life and that 3-D
images would pop off the screen of the new console, which will have
a 300-megahertz, 128-bit processor.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also said the machine would be able to function as a CD
player and perhaps as a DVD movie player.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the prospect of DVD capability, Ron Dulin, executive
editor of Gamespot magazine  &UR; (www.gamespot.com) &LR; , an online game
publication, said ``that would be crazy,'' which apparently is a
high compliment in gaming circles.
</P>
<P>
   Dulin said he doubted that consumers would hold off on buying a
Playstation this year in anticipation of the new release.
</P>
<P>
   But Dulin suggested that Sony might be willing to lose a few
customers in order to achieve a bigger aim: positioning itself
against Dreamcast, a next-generation game console that Sega, a
competitor, plans to release in the United States in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sony officials said they were paying close attention to the
progress of Dreamcast but had not altered their schedule as a
result.

   The mobile computer is a given. Now the desk is portable, too.

   A Cincinnati entrepreneur has begun shipping the Lapstand, a
portable two-pound aluminum-alloy table that folds into roughly the
size of large paperback book. John Troyer, president of Lapstand
Inc., said he had got the idea for the tray, which costs $80, after
spending many uncomfortable hours in airports trying to work with
his laptop  &UR; (www.lapstand.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   He said he had constantly faced two problems: the laptop was
difficult to balance on his lap, and the heat from it burned his
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Actual burns?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it didn't really burn it,'' he conceded. ``It felt more
like I was simmering in a crockpot.''

   People using new Siemens technology will need the right touch to
unlock their laptops, power up their P.D.A.'s and make calls on
their cellular phones. Specifically, each user will need to touch
the device with a finger so it can recognize the fingerprint as
being the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens intends to release the new technology, called the
Fingertip Sensor, at the Cebit '99 trade show, scheduled for March
18 in Hanover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor is a specially designed computer chip that has been
programmed to identify an individual's fingerprint and use it as a
de facto password.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, only the user's fingerprint will permit access
to a given gadget.
</P>
<P>
   Such a gadget is part of what is called biometrics, which
permits access by recognizing things like the retina or the voice.
</P>
<P>
   While biometrics is becoming more common, Siemens' effort
represents its newest frontier: lightweight, low-cost devices
designed for portable use. Jeff Davis, a marketing manager for
Siemens, said the company would sell the fingerprint sensor to
mobile computer makers for around $35.
</P>
<P>
   He said consumers should expect to see the device accompanying
portable PC's and P.D.A.'s before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   One gruesome side note is that the companies working on
fingerprint access have worried about whether thieves could
literally cut off and steal a person's finger to use it to gain
entry to a piece of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens' technology is designed to account for that possibility
and ``requires a live finger to operate,'' Davis said.

   While cellular telephones radiate a sort of cordless chic,
anybody who owns one knows that usually sooner rather than later,
they must be reattached to their cords, which are plugged into
electrical outlets for recharging.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer, says the Electric Fuel Corporation, an energy
company based in Israel. The company announced this week that it
was producing a disposable, long-life battery for cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries look and feel like any other and are made to fit
some of the most widely used telephones, like those made by Nokia,
Ericsson and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   They are based on zinc-air technology and may provide up to 30
days of speaking and standby time, depending on usage, the network
and the type of telephone used, said Jonathan Whartman, Electric
Fuel's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Because the batteries are zinc-air, they do not carry toxic or
volatile materials, like the cadmium and lithium found in most
rechargable batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The disposable batteries are not considered dangerous to the
environment, Whartman said. Their materials can even be recycled,
he added. They will cost $19.95 to $29.95 when they are released in
May for retail shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries are expected to sell for much less once production
reaches high levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' Whartman said, ``is to get the price under $10 in
less than a year.''

   Before Pokemon, there were Sea Monkeys. These creatures (really
hybridized brine shrimp extravagantly anthropomorphized in 1960's
comic-book advertisements) can now accompany their human masters in
Exploratoy's Sea Monkey Digital Watch. The five-function LCD watch
has a detachable 8 cc aquarium where sea monkeys can live for up to
24 hours, according to George C. Atamian, a vice president at
Exploratoy's parent company, Educational Insights. After that, they
should be wrangled (using the trademarked ``acqua leash'') and
returned to their permanent aquarium. The watch can hold one or two
sea monkeys but, once they reach adulthood, it becomes difficult to
wrangle just one because, said Atamian, ``they're almost constantly
mating.'' So it is an educational toy, after all.

MEXICAN OFFICIALS HOOK U.S. FISHING BOATS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn.: Okla.) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas _ At first, there was nothing unusual about an
early morning fishing trip to the bass-laden waters of Falcon Lake.
</P>
<P>
   After all, McAllen veterinarian Andy Baker had been fishing this
international reservoir weekly over the past 10 years since moving
his practice from Houston to the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before noon on Feb. 11, as he and his son, Brad, 31,
of the Houston area made a last cast near a rock pile not far from
the Mexican shore, something different happened.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Baker's boat was boarded by two Mexican officials asking
for his fishing license and boat permit. Baker had a valid Mexican
fishing license but didn't have it with him, and his boat permit
had expired. His son had no license.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities told Baker to follow them to shore, where
armed officials were waiting. They seized Baker's 19-foot Dynatrac
bass boat with a 150-horse power Johnson outboard motor _ purchased
new for $25,000 in 1993 _ 10 rods and reels, several tackle boxes,
life jackets, a combination Global Positioning System and sonar
unit, a $500 pair of binoculars and a new trolling motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let us take some Cokes we had iced down in the cooler,''
Andy Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mexican shore, recent Oklahoma retirees James Battles,
62, and his wife, Laura, 58, had just been relieved of their new
Triton bass boat with a 115-hp outboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe the Mexican people and the government an apology, and a
fine, for fishing without a license,'' James Battles told the
Zapata County News. ``But I don't think I owe them a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, it looks as if the boats may be gone for good. The
Battles finally left Zapata, Texas, on Sunday after several
unsuccessful attempts to recover their vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the longer it goes, the less chance I have of getting
my boat,'' Andy Baker said. ``If we have to go through the legal
channels, it will take months.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who just last year towed a bass fishing rig to the
Mexican Pacific coast and frequently pilots his small plane to Baja
California to fish for marlin, said the experience has soured him
on Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 30 years, I've never had anything but good things to say,
but they've lost my tourist business for a while,'' said Baker, who
estimated he spent $4,000 in Mexico last year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consular officials acknowledged that neither of the fishing
parties were carrying the required permits when their boats were
confiscated. But they said it's unusual for Mexican officials to
take such drastic measures to enforce the fishing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very likely these Mexican EPA guys, they just wanted a
couple of nice boats,'' said one federal official, who asked not to
be identified. ``Unfortunately along the border, oftentimes Mexican
officials are looking for an excuse to seize a vehicle. They want
it for them personally or to use as an agency vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   And even learning what the legal channels are for recovering the
boats or learning their location has proved difficult, and U.S.
officials say their Mexican counterparts have not returned calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our efforts have been fruitless,'' said David Schlaefer, chief
of American Citizen Services at the U.S. Consulate in Matamoros,
Mexico. ``We've left numerous messages, and the typical reply is
you need to get in touch with another office.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlaefer said the boats were seized by two officials of
Mexico's environmental protection agency, known as ``PROFEPA.'' The
officials were from the agency's office in San Fernando,
Tamaulipas, a town about two hours' drive south of Brownsville,
Texas. The agency's state headquarters is in the Tamaulipas capital
of Ciudad Victoria, where the anglers were told their boats would
be taken.
</P>
<P>
   But Schlaefer said his two-person consular staff in Matamoros
does not have time to drive to either city and contact the
officials in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see the penalty applied to American citizens be
more consistent with the severity of the offense,'' Schlaefer said.
``It would seem reasonable for the Mexican authorities to perhaps
levy a fine against them and allow them to pay and go on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to seize the boats and all the equipment on the boats was
a very severe penalty for what was, after all, not a very egregious
offense.''

BEHIND THE SCENES ON `SAVOR THE SOUTHWEST' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - ``It's just a little hotbed of Southwestern excitement
here, isn't it?'' chef John Sedlar said as he stood outside the
garage/prep kitchen on the set of ``Savor the Southwest'' during
filming in June in Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   In special previews next week, Arizona viewers will get to see
what went on during the 2{-week location shoot of what was
undoubtedly the most intense Southwestern food experience in recent
memory. Chefs from all over the Southwest strutted their culinary
stuff on camera for 13 episodes with host Barbara Fenzl, author and
Phoenix cooking-school owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savor the Southwest'' is the largest production ever attempted
by Channel 8 (KAET), the Phoenix area's PBS affiliate. As of press
time, more than 80 other public-television stations, including
those in Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and Dallas, had signed up
to air the show.
</P>
<P>
   KAET produced the show with A La Carte Productions, which has
offices in Boston and San Francisco and whose crew ``lived in Julia
Child's kitchen for four years,'' as producer Geoffrey Drummond put
it. Their credits include ``Baking With Julia,'' ``In Julia's
Kitchen With Master Chefs'' and ``Julia Child &AMP; Jacques Pepin,
Cooking in Concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the featured chefs are from Arizona. The others are
from California, New Mexico, Texas and Colorado. Most are pioneers
who helped invent and refine Southwest cuisine since its beginnings
in the late '70s and early '80s. Most will be fresh faces to the
national audience that will see ``Savor,'' but some have television
experience, like the Two Hot Tamales, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan
Feniger of the TV Food Network. You could fill a shelf with the
cookbooks these chefs have written and plaster the walls of a
commercial kitchen with their various awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savor'' took nearly five years from conception to airing.
KAET's Jillian Robinson had brainstorming sessions on showcases for
Southwestern culture with station manager Beth Vershure and thought
food would be an interesting window through which to view the
history, culture and lore of the region.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a party when Fenzl's ``Southwest the Beautiful''
cookbook was released in May 1994 and found her host.
</P>
<P>
   Fenzl had the same vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this dream about five years ago when I was writing the
book,'' she said. ``People said, `Oh, this is so great, this should
be a cooking show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson added, ``Then, Barb and I were sort of attached at the
hip for several years.'' Robinson took classes at Les Gourmettes,
Fenzl's school, and Fenzl introduced her to the Southwestern chefs
teaching there.
</P>
<P>
   They put a proposal together and started the funding search.
They found their sponsoring angels for the series at the Ethel and
Kemper Marley Foundation along with KAET Program Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Once funding was secured, production of the program had to be
put out to bid, because KAET, part of Arizona State University, is
a state agency. The contract was won by A La Carte, whom Robinson
called ``the best in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The next task was to find a location, which involved scouting
dozens of homes in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale for a kitchen
with Southwestern decor and an island with a gas cooktop as well as
owners who didn't mind having their home turned into a television
studio for 2{ weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite worked out, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at one place in Paradise Valley at this great big
sprawling house that was quite wonderful, but I really thought I
was in Bel Air (Calif.),'' A La Carte producer Geoffrey Drummond
said. It wouldn't look Southwestern enough on TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A pro's kitchen &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What finally filled the bill was the 4,000-square-foot
Pueblo-style Prescott home of Hillary Guild, whose business,
Kitchen Consultants, is a network of food professionals across the
country who work with food and equipment companies. This is Guild's
third custom home, and every one has been the site of filming. She
already had a sink, cabinetry, gas lines and heavy-duty wiring in
the garage, and when she knew her kitchen was going to be
considered, ``that of course instantly encouraged us to have the
only garage in Prescott with a working waste disposal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also put a gas cooktop into the island instead of the
smooth-top she usually prefers. When KitchenAid is one of your
clients, it's not that big of a deal to change out a cooktop.
</P>
<P>
   As production drew near, A La Carte's culinary producer, Chris
Styler, contacted all the chefs about their recipes. As the
backstage chef, Styler makes the twin dish that the on-camera chef
pulls from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Styler has one of the most intense jobs on the crew. He worked
the only day that everybody else got off. This was the first
cooking show that he worked on in which every episode featured a
different chef. Some, such as Chuck Wiley, brought everything they
needed, including napkin rings and an assistant. Most came with
little or nothing. For them, he ordered all the food, prepped it
and made the twin dishes. At the end of the day, he made the lists
and did the shopping for the next day's work.
</P>
<P>
   From the East Coast, A La Carte shipped or hand-carried almost
all the equipment needed for the shoot, from pots and pans to
cameras. Geoffrey Drummond says the jampacked three-car garage in
Connecticut where the company stores its culinary equipment looks
like a Williams-Sonoma store with three refrigerators and a stove.
Kitchen Classics in Phoenix supplied Southwestern serving dishes,
which were arrayed on tables in the hallway, site of frequent
impromptu consultations over what to use next.
</P>
<P>
   Styler and his helpers worked downstairs in the garage in a
temporary kitchen with eight burners, two ovens and two
refrigerators. The downstairs crew had to maintain quiet during the
shots and was glued to the set upstairs via intercom and TV
monitors. Specific requests from Fenzl, the chefs or director Bruce
Franchini for a serving spoon or achiote or a certain-size pot
would send Styler or assistant Pat Teel pounding up the stairs at
top speed with the needed item.
</P>
<P>
   Between shots, Styler or Teel would go pounding up the stairs
again with big trays of supplies for the next setup. Each chef did
a run-through of recipes with Styler and then another one with
Franchini and Fenzl before the cameras rolled.
</P>
<P>
   Teel, who has since moved to a job cooking at a winery in
Oregon, was a Prescott freelancer hired for the shoot. Another
Prescott-based freelancer on the set was makeup artist Clara
Taillole-Nardo, a Phoenix native who was happy to have a local job
between her frequent commutes to Hollywood, where her career
includes 20th Century Fox shows such as ``Mad About You'' and ``Two
Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   During breaks, Taillole-Nardo refreshed lipstick and re-powdered
foreheads that were starting to shine from the lights and
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did a good job on your little eyelashes,'' Mary Sue
Milliken said to Susan Feniger in the walk-throughs. The Tamales
constantly teased each other and cracked up with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Taillole-Nardo's time was spent with Fenzl in the
bedroom suite, which was converted into a dressing room. Two racks
of clothing stood under the window; the bed was covered with
Southwestern costume jewelry. As one of the pre-production chores,
Drummond and Franchini went through Fenzl's closets with her to
select outfits.
</P>
<P>
   On the first Friday of the production, Fenzl and Taillole-Nardo
did eight wardrobe and hair changes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pantyhose to the rescue &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first chef to be filmed was Vincent Guerithault, whose show
will appear last in the Channel 8 rotation. Taping was delayed
three hours because the cabinet doors, made of painted twigs,
distorted the camera image. Nothing would fix it until one of the
crew members remembered that years before he had worked on a
program in which the cameras were softened for the aging star with
pantyhose over the lenses. After frantic forays to find two dozen
pair at Wal-Mart and Target, the crew dressed the cabinet doors in
Calvin Klein No. 2 pantyhose. It worked. No more moire effect.
Vincent did his tortilla show.
</P>
<P>
   The production was painstaking, exact. Director Franchini
coached Fenzl and the chefs from the dining room, which was covered
in furniture pads to accommodate the control room. The philosophy
was ``to get in the pot,'' to show real cooking, the integrity of
the food, Drummond said. Takes were shot and re-shot, nothing was
faked.
</P>
<P>
   The crew is a big part of the aura of knowledgeable
professionalism that permeated the set. This crew knows food. At
the end of each taping, when the ``beauty shots'' of the finished
dishes were finally done, the members of the crew got to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Fenzl, who cooks and teaches as easily as she breathes, had to
learn a new set of acting skills: learning lines, timing, how to
position herself next to the chef, how to hit her marks. On one of
the first days of shooting, she had to climb a big rock spire and
fling her arms expansively.
</P>
<P>
   Fenzl opens each episode by demonstrating a cooking technique,
such as roasting chiles. The 13 techniques were edited into one
tape, which KAET plans to offer as a thank-you gift during pledge
drives. But her larger role is to be the audience's guide as she
reacts to the chefs, questions them, clarifies their terms,
mentions that Robert Del Grande has a Ph.D. in chemistry as he rubs
a mixture of coffee, cocoa and cinnamon onto a tenderloin.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Southwest shines. And in a sense, Drummond
said, the region is the real star. Fenzl and the chefs will be
nationally known after this show is seen in different markets, but
until then the food is what is going to draw people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if the spark of the Southwest comes through the
personality of our talent,'' Drummond said. ``What we're looking to
capture through the food and people is the personality of the
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say the air is different here.'' &QL;

<P>
   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent and the Grenadines _ When American troops
helped destroy more than one million marijuana plants in December
in the rugged northern regions of this island, growers were
outraged. They protested on radio and in front of government
offices. They appealed to business and political leaders. They even
started a petition drive to ask President Clinton for damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are not showing any real concern for our
economic and social development,'' said Junior Cottle, chairman of
a group of marijuana growers who described himself as
``representative of the ganja man.''
</P>
<P>
   Cottle said he did not grow marijuana but did smoke it.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is not legal here. But its production in the remote
mountains has, American officials said, taken off in recent years,
making St. Vincent the second largest grower in the Caribbean,
after Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Growers said they were turning to the crop to deal with an
unemployment rate that is officially 20 percent but that many
people here say is far higher.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity directed at the United States comes from two
directions. Residents have a feeling that Washington has abandoned
this corner of the world, now that the Cold War is over and it no
longer sees a Communist threat in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a marked hostility against Clinton for waging war
with Europe over banana trade preferences, the legitimate backbone
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nub of the dispute is that Europe unfairly favors bananas
grown by its former colonies, including this onetime British
outpost, where English is spoken and cricket is a favorite sport.
The preference discriminates against American companies that
produce bananas, the United States says.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here say removing the import protections would deal an
economic catastrophe to countries that have little capacity to grow
anything else and whose bananas are costly to grow. Some government
and business leaders say the United States risks undermining its
anti-drug efforts in the region if banana growers turn to drugs _
not just marijuana, but also trafficking in Colombian heroin and
cocaine as alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, some Caribbean experts note, the banana issue
is creating such deep resentment that it may compromise the
willingness of Caribbean countries to continue cooperating in
anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Caricom countries meet in July, I think you'll see a bold
statement of resistance,'' said Ivelaw Griffith, a Caribbean expert
Florida International University in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Caricom is the Caribbean Community, the regional economic
association.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana growers here are seeking to anger the public against
further eradication while exploring an agenda that includes
promoting marijuana for medicinal purposes and pushing for job
creation in fishing and nonbanana agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Martin
Barnard, said of the U.S.' stance: ``People don't understand it.
They're saying, `What more can they do to us?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister James F. Mitchell, who asked for the mission in
December, refused to see the farmers, telling them in a terse
letter in November that his government was ``firmly opposed to the
illegal drug trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said in an interview that he would like to see even
more American assistance to curb marijuana cultivation and the
heroin and cocaine trafficking through the Caribbean. But he said
he regarded the friend in drug control as a foe on the banana
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a property-owner democracy, and that's what's been
threatened, our quality of life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American trade officials said that they did not want to hurt
Caribbean banana producers and that there were ways to protect them
like subsidies to bring down banana prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Miami in February, the Clinton
administration's director of drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey,
declined to comment on the banana problem, calling it ``a complex
issue.'' But McCaffrey said he did not accept the argument that
``it's either this or drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody turns to marijuana or opium or cocaine production as a
survival mechanism,'' he said. ``They turn to that because you can
make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   But drug riches are not readily apparent at the house of a
39-year-old banana farmer who also grows marijuana and identified
himself only as Nebo. He lives in the northeastern town of
Georgetown, an hour's drive from here, in an unpainted
concrete-block shell with two bedrooms and a family of seven.
</P>
<P>
   As the sweet smell of marijuana wafted in from somewhere around
the house, Nebo said his 10,000 marijuana plants yielded an income
that was at least 10 times the revenue from his three acres of
bananas. Nebo said he had no reason to grow bananas anymore except
that ``it's in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been in my family,'' he said. ``I just keep doing it.
Right now I'm taking my income from ganja to support the banana
crop. Ganja has been beneficial to me. It's paid for my house,
schooling, food, the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Another banana grower in Georgetown, Iris Walker, said she and
her husband would never resort to drugs. But she said marijuana
farmers should be accepted as a necessary evil, underscoring the
feelings of many residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal,'' Ms. Walker said. ``But if some people don't do
it, they don't have bread for the children.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She called the Americans ``selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they were trying hard to diversify the
economy to reduce the reliance on the banana crop, which is
recovering from a slump caused by bad weather and low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in St. Vincent and the Grenadines earns three times as
much as bananas. But officials say that the agricultural dollar
goes longer because it is spent locally and that no industry can
yet replace bananas in importance.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana growers and their supporters say they stand ready to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to be part of the process,'' Cottle said. ``The
fact that we come out and talk illustrates the magnitude of the
problem.''

 &HT;    PORK BARREL SPENDING ROASTED
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    with PORK-List
 &HT;    moving in (w) Washington category
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although partisan rancor dominated much of Congress
last year, Democrats and Republicans had little trouble working
together in one area: spending money for home state projects.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers dipped into the ``pork barrel'' to the tune of $12
billion for 2,838 projects for local constituents, according to the
congressional ``Pig Book,'' made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost went down somewhat from the $13.2 billion counted
a year ago by Citizens Against Government Waste, a private watchdog
group that attempts to embarrass lawmakers who add projects through
back-room deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets sold as the government's money,'' the group's
president Tom Schatz said Wednesday. ``Taxpayers have to realize
it's their money.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a gathering that featured a pot-bellied pig that
noisily chowed down on animal crackers scattered among fake dollar
bills and coins.
</P>
<P>
   Schatz said that despite the annual lampooning, the amount of
congressional pork has fluctuated only slightly since his group
began tracking it eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schatz said projects listed in the ``Pig Book'' fit one of
several criteria: they serve only a narrow or local interest, were
requested by only one chamber of Congress, were not requested by
the president, or were not competitively awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   A water taxi service to shuttle tourists and conventioneers
between Savannah, Ga.'s entertainment district and a new
international trade center on Hutchinson Island. The $500,000
project, which had not been requested by either house or by the
White House, was added to the huge annual spending bill in an 11th
hour bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   Vidalia onion research for Georgia costing $100,000, and
$500,000 for Texas Tech University at Lubbock to study ``stress''
in plants growing in arid regions.
</P>
<P>
   A National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture that would
study whether fish can be raised on farms and in abandoned mines in
West Virginia. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., has captured nearly $16
million for the project since 1995, but the center has yet to be
built. Citizens Against Government Waste awarded him the ``cold
shower award'' for winning $2 million more for the project this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A new $86 million federal courthouse for Jacksonville, Fla.,
secured by Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., and Rep. Corinne Brown,
D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A new glass cockpit flight simulator for C-141 transport planes
for the Air Force Reserve at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
costing $1.6 million, secured by Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors for military ``pork'' went to former Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who was given the ``leaving with a jet plane -or
two- award'' for snaring a $112 million contract to build two
C-130J transports at Lockheed Martin's Marietta plant. The
transports had not been requested by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers defend their projects as protecting jobs and
prosperity at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water taxi project is a valid project,'' said Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga. He said it will ``ease congestion'' on the
Talmadge Bridge that links Savannah to Hutchinson Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vidalia onion is one of the most successful crops in the
first district,'' said Kingston, who argued that the funds were
``well-spent'' to keep the famous sweet onion ahead of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And a spokesman for Hobson argued that the flight simulator
would be a money saver, since pilots could train without the wear
and tear on planes of the fuel expense.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, the states that won the most pork per capita
were Alaska, whose lawmakers brought in $273 per resident, and
Hawaii, which received $155 per capita.
</P>
<P>
   (For TExas only)
</P>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers have grabbed less than some of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have more fiscal conservatives in Texas,'' said
David Williams, chief researcher for Citizens Against Government
Waste. The Texas pork spending totalled only $11.47 per person,
according to the group. That put Texas No. 42 in the list of per
capita ``pork'' spending among states.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Texas lured $12 million for the Dallas-Fort Worth rail
transportation project known as ``Railtran,'' $3.4 million for dam
safety at Waco Lake, and $28 million for a new courthouse at
Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courthouse is extremely old and antiquated,'' said Susan
Phalen, spokeswoman for Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas. ``I don't see
how anyone visiting Laredo could think it was a pork barrel
project.''
</P>
<P>
   (end for texas only)
</P>
<P>
   (CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Against Government Waste, which claims 600,000 members,
also gave a ``hopping mad'' award to Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Ala., for
obtaining $250,000 for grasshopper research in his state. But that
project is tiny compared with a program that has become a pork
classic in the annual ``Pig Book.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few clicks on the Internet, and a web surfer can see U.S.
tax dollars at work with a full-collar photo display, updated
round-the-clock, of a forest of 48 antennas on a field surrounded
by snowy Alaskan peaks.
</P>
<P>
   This is the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program
(HAARP.com), a mysterious project that is either (1) a useful
research project that bombards the ionosphere with low frequency
radio beams, (2) a secret military scheme to control the weather
(as charged by Europeans but denied by U.S. officials), or (3) a
boondoggle that has never been given an objective test by
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Energy project, which will cost $12.5

DUSTY WON'T BE FORGOTTEN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Producer Jerry Wexler remembers Dusty Springfield
in his living room, knee-deep in demos, turning down song after
song for a proposed Memphis album.
</P>
<P>
   There were 75 tunes suggested, ``of which she liked exactly
zero,'' the longtime record man once said, adding that she was at
least considering ``Son of a Preacher Man.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dust cleared, there stood the transcendent ``Dusty in
Memphis,'' in which Springfield, compatriot of Britpop divas Cilla
Black, Marianne Faithfull and Lulu, took a dive into Aretha
Franklin's soul pool.
</P>
<P>
   As great as that album was, most rock fans on this side of the
pond in late 1969 probably thought of Dusty Springfield as Buffalo
Springfield's kid sister _ if they thought of her at all in the age
of Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   But Springfield, who died Tuesday at age 59 at her home outside
London after a long battle with breast cancer _ 11 days before she
was to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at a
ceremony in New York, alongside Paul McCartney and Bruce
Springsteen _ was beloved by many, from her earliest Top 40 hit,
``I Only Want to Be With You,'' in 1964, through such smashes as
``I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,'' ``You Don't Have to
Say You Love Me'' and ``What Have I Done to Deserve This'' (with
the Pet Shop Boys).
</P>
<P>
   As composer Burt Bacharach put it, Springfield boasted one of
the ``truly great, distinctive voices of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, who made up the Pet Shop
Boys: ``Dusty was a tender, exhilarating and soulful singer,
incredibly intelligent at phrasing a song, painstakingly building
it up to a thrilling climax.''
</P>
<P>
   Notoriously insecure, Springfield performed rarely and if she
did, she wouldn't sing her old songs. In 1994, ``Son of a Preacher
Man'' from the Memphis album was the crown jewel of the ``Pulp
Fiction'' soundtrack, bringing Dusty her first platinum album. A
year after its release, she admitted she still hadn't seen the
film.
</P>
<P>
   While legendary records are often dimmed by time, the years have
only strengthened the reputation of the magical ``Dusty in
Memphis.'' The same is bound to occur with Springfield herself. &UR;

LEADERS OF POOR MAN'S MAFIA FOUND GUILTY IN RACKETEERING CASE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ As a so-called general of the Texas Mexican
Mafia, Robert ``Beaver'' Perez was by most accounts a powerful man.
</P>
<P>
   Mafia members delivered to him the 10 percent street tax
collected from drug dealers and prostitutes. Then he distributed a
share of that to imprisoned mafia members around the state.
</P>
<P>
   He even exercised his authority to give the ``green light'' _
mafia code for ordering a colleague's execution.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Perez was one of 10 Texas Mexican Mafia members
found guilty of racketeering in a federal case that accused them of
plotting 15 murders, including the execution of five people.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his influence, painstakingly illustrated in the
six-week trial, the ``general'' was in many ways just another guy
from San Antonio's poor, mostly Mexican-American west side. The
twice married father of eight was living in subsidized housing at
the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no John Gotti,'' said Blair McLeod, his
court-appointed attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the New York mob, at least, the San
Antonio-headquartered Texas Mexican Mafia is nickel-and-dime stuff.
At the time of the arrest of John Gotti's son, John Gotti Jr.,
police seized more than $300,000 in cash. At the home of Perez last
year, authorities found not even $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the Texas Mexican Mafia may help explain why this
organization might be called the poor man's mafia. The organization
is a prison gang, launched in 1984 from behind the walls of Texas
penitentiaries only to emerge in the barrios of most of the state's
major cities as its members were paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Today authorities say ``La Eme,'' as it is known on the street
for the Spanish letter M, is the largest of 10 prison gangs, with
about 1,400 members behind bars and several thousand more on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   While the East Coast mob has traditionally controlled industries
such as garbage hauling and freight moving in addition to exerting
power over politicians, the domain of the Texas Mexican Mafia is
tumble-down neighborhoods that rank among the poorest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are not sophisticated when it comes to money,''
said Bill Baumann, an assistant U.S. attorney who successfully
prosecuted the mafia in the racketeering case. ``They prey on
people in the projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cash added up. Authorities say Perez received between
$5,000 and $10,000 a week from five ``lieutenants'' charged with
collecting 10 percent, or the ``dime,'' as it is known among
members. Much of this money is believed to have gone to members in
prison, or their families.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence is scant that members of the Texas Mexican Mafia
used their money to escape the urban underclass, into which most of
them were born.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Herrera, a ``captain'' who authorities say reported to
Perez, is a high school dropout who nonetheless acquired his GED.
Authorities describe his west side home as a ``hovel.'' According
to his lawyer, Herrera was raised by an uncle and met his mother
when he was 19, only to hear her ask, ``What do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Estrada, a ``soldier'' and key government witness who
confessed with little remorse to committing six murders, finished
eighth grade without learning how to read or write and was raised
by a father who trafficked cocaine. His sister is dead from a
heroin overdose, and he has two brothers in prison.
</P>
<P>
   And Pete Carrion, another ``soldier'' and the only defendant to
take the stand, testified that he fathered the first of his six
children at age 15 and two years later became a drug dealer.
Authorities say mafia members often use drugs as well as sell them,
often frittering away their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people with no structure in their lives,'' said Alan
Futrell, Herrera's court-appointed attorney. ``They're looking for
support or camaraderie or devotion that they can't find
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the Texas Mexican Mafia may share more with
street gangs than with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``La Eme'' operates without the financial savvy of the
East Coast mob, it seems to be every bit as ruthless. That was
evident over the course of the San Antonio trial, in which the 10
members were charged with a racketeering conspiracy that included
15 murders since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was the worst mass murder in San Antonio history, the
execution-style killings of five people, four of them teen-agers,
during a robbery at a house on the west side. Though testimony
never made clear the reason for the slayings, it appears the mafia
members did not find what they had sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the streets of San Antonio's west side a war zone,''
said David Counts, a federal prosecutor who worked alongside
Baumann. ``Everywhere you looked, it was a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which yielded plea bargains for six members of the
organization, was the second major blow to the Mexican Mafia this
decade. In 1994, 16 mafia members were convicted, including
Heriberto ``Herb'' Huerta, the group's founder who is now being
held in a high-security federal prison in Colorado.

 DUSTY SPRINGFIELD, POP STAR OF THE '60s, DEAD AT 59 
 (nk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dusty Springfield, the smoky-voiced English torch singer whose
interpretations of pop ballads were suffused with a heartbroken
wistfulness, died on Tuesday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, near
Oxford, west of London. She was 59.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, said her agent, Paul Fenn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Springfield had one of the longest recording careers of any
contemporary pop star, beginning in 1961 when she had the first of
several hits with her folk-pop trio, the Springfields, and ending
with her 1995 album, ``A Very Fine Love.'' She had most of her
major hits in the 1960s when she was considered the British
equivalent of Dionne Warwick; she recorded only intermittently
after the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Her career was briefly rejuvenated in 1987 when the English duo
the Pet Shop Boys (Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe), who were longtime
fans, produced her Top Five hit, ``What Have I Done to Deserve
This?'' They also wrote and produced ``Nothing Has Been Proved,''
the dense, swirling post-disco theme song that she sang on the
soundtrack of the 1989 movie ``Scandal,'' about the Profumo sex
scandal that had rocked the British government in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Springfield became an international pop star in 1964 with
``I Only Want to Be With You,'' a perky early-Beatles-style love
song. Other major '60s hits included ``Wishin' and Hopin''' (1964),
and ``The Look of Love'' (1967), both written by Burt Bacharach and
Hal David, the team that supplied Ms. Warwick with most of her
early hits. Ms. Springfield's sultry rendition of ``The Look of
Love,'' from the soundtrack of ``Casino Royale,'' anticipated the
heavy-breathing eroticism of Donna Summer a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Her best seller, ``You Don't Have to Say You Love Me'' (1966),
was a big-belting tear-jerker that reached No. 4 on Billboard's
singles chart and won her her first Grammy nomination. The
country-soul ballad ``Son of a Preacher Man,'' her Top 10 hit from
1969, won her new respect and her second Grammy nomination after
being prominently featured in the 1994 movie ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Springfield was born Mary Isabel Catherine Bernadette
O'Brien on April 16, 1939, in Hampstead, London. While attending
British convent schools, she discovered the music of Peggy Lee,
whose intimate come-hither style was a major formative influence.
</P>
<P>
   She got her professional start with an Andrews Sisters-style
group called the Lana Sisters, but quit to form her own folk-pop
group, the Springfields, with a friend, Tim Field, and her brother,
Dion O'Brien, now known as Tom Springfield, who is her only
survivor. Promoted as a British answer to Peter, Paul and Mary, the
group had a popular British television show and scored several
English hits before breaking through in the United States with a
Top 20 single, ``Silver Threads and Golden Needles.''
</P>
<P>
   While visiting New York with the trio, Ms. Springfield recalled
many years later, she heard the Exciters' brash, aggressive song
``Tell Him'' coming out of a Broadway record store and decided that
she wanted to go pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply influenced by black singers from the early
1960s,'' she said. ``I liked everybody at Motown and most of the
Stax artists. I really wanted to be Mavis Staples. What they shared
in common was a kind of strength I didn't hear on English radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Springfield subsequently broke up her folk group and signed
as a soloist with Philips Records. Her first single for the label,
``I Only Want to Be With You,'' established her new direction. Ms.
Springfield, with her teased beehive hairdo and eyes heavily
blackened with mascara, was a 1960s pop fashion icon. From 1964 and
1967, when she left Philips, 11 of her singles hit the American pop
charts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Son of a Preacher Man,'' a song that Aretha Franklin had
rejected but later recorded, became Ms. Springfield's first single
for Atlantic Records and was featured on her Atlantic debut album,
``Dusty in Memphis,'' which is widely regarded as a pop
masterpiece. To make the album, the Atlantic producing team of
Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin, who had brought Ms.
Franklin to her peak of popularity, took Ms. Springfield to Memphis
to record with a hot rhythm section.
</P>
<P>
   The record, which included ``The Windmills of Your Mind,'' an
early collaboration of Michel Legrand with the lyricists Alan and
Marilyn Bergman that was written for the movie ``The Thomas Crown
Affair,'' was a perfect blend of warm country-soul and New York pop
sophistication. For many singers, including Melissa Manchester,
Linda Ronstadt and k.d. lang, it provided a blueprint for
stylistically adventurous vocal showcases.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dusty in Memphis'' was not a big hit, reaching only No. 99
on Billboard's album chart. In 1970 Atlantic released her
much-admired rhythm-and-blues-flavored album, ``A Brand New Me.''
Recorded in Philadelphia, the album fared no better than its
forerunner.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter Ms. Springfield, who was awarded the Order of the
British Empire in January, recorded only sporadically. Although her
subsequent American albums _ ``Cameo'' (1973, ABC-Dunhill), ``It
Begins Again'' (1978, United Artists), ``Living Without Your Love''
(1979, United Artists), ``White Heat'' (1982, Casablanca) and ``A
Very Fine Love'' (1995, Columbia) _ found her voice as full and
compelling as ever, the material and production rarely matched the
singing.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1970s she led a peripatetic existence, living
sometimes in Los Angeles, at other times in the Netherlands and
Britain. In 1997 Mercury Records released the 3-CD, 77-song ``Dusty
Springfield Anthology Collection.'' Last month Rhino Records
released an expanded version of ``Dusty in Memphis.''

   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ When an 86-year-old woman with
Alzheimer's disease broke her hip, Deborah Newquist was the person
who stayed with her at the hospital here. Years earlier, she had
arranged 24-hour home care for the woman and her bedridden husband,
and she also took care of everything from having their house
painted to getting their cat to the veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   When the husband died in November, it seemed fitting that Dr.
Newquist was among the six mourners at his funeral. After eight
years on the job for the couple, she had become a professional
member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newquist, whose doctorate is in medical anthropology, is a
geriatric care manager, an occupation that did not exist when she
received her master's degree in social work 24 years ago. The field
was born in response to the nation's rapidly aging population and
the health care system's complexity.
</P>
<P>
   At $70 to $150 an hour, geriatric care managers generally don't
offer hands-on care. Part counselors and part social workers, they
help manage the healthcare, living arrangements and other affairs
of their elderly clients. In doing so, they perform a role once
filled by families _ not only because families are so scattered and
care has become more complicated, but because outsiders are
listened to, while children often are not _ as some care managers
have discovered with their own families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The systems are so complex now that even some of us who think
we know something about them get confused,'' said Raymond T.
Coward, a gerontologist and the dean of the school of health and
human services at the University of New Hampshire. ``And families
are being pulled in more ways than they have in the past. They've
changed to the point where they're looking to share this
responsibility with someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Rona Bartelstone, a clinical social worker, started her South
Florida geriatric care management business in a bedroom of her home
in Miami 18 years ago after trying to help her grandmothers, both
of whom had dementia and degenerative illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. B.J. Curry Spitler got into the business in San Diego 20
years ago when she was teaching social work at San Diego State
University, and a local psychiatrist asked her to help an elderly
couple whose lives were falling apart as they tried to stay in
their own home.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Fuller was working at a Tucson law firm that specialized
in the elderly when she realized there was a niche to be filled,
and reinvented herself as a geriatric care manager.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Wetter, a former dental hygienist, and her best friend, Pat
Bowen, an investment specialist, went into business together after
spending years coping with the medical needs, home care, insurance
forms, estate planning and nursing homes of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other one day and said, `We're intelligent,
competent people, and we almost ruined our lives taking care of our
parents,' '' said Ms. Wetter, 44. ``You're so emotionally involved
you need help to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the couple in Newport Beach, who had no children,
it was their nephew, Norris Couch, 50, who lives in Austin, Texas,
who found Dr. Newquist. Most often it is the children, worn out
from juggling demanding jobs, children and their aging parents, who
hire managers. Surveys show the overwhelming majority of the
elderly want to remain independent, and in their own homes, and it
often falls to the children to help them stay there.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dr. Newquist's clients was an elderly widow with
Alzheimer's who lived on her own in Anaheim, Calif., and had four
children, three in Connecticut and one in Ohio. ``They were doing a
round robin,'' Dr. Newquist said. ``They would rotate one of them
at a time flying out and spending two weeks with her. They didn't
want Mom to live with a stranger. But they couldn't sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a series of telephone conference calls with the family,
Dr. Newquist was able to introduce live-in caregivers. Eventually,
as the woman continued to decline, she helped the family move her
into an Alzheimer's care facility. The children continued to visit
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was 86, died last month.
</P>
<P>
   Often, it takes an outsider to get the family to make
emotionally fraught decisions about aging relatives. That was the
case with Ms. Bartelstone's grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though my family considered me an expert in aging,
because I was a child they would not take my advice,'' she
recalled. ``So after two years of talking, I got a colleague to
come in and talk to them, and she got them to do what they needed
to do in one meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that she was dealing with her grandmothers, Ms.
Bartelstone, 48, noticed that more and more adult children were
calling her agency with questions about their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them were not local,'' she said. ``They did not know
what services were available. Services and eligibility requirements
are different, not only in every state, but in every county.''
</P>
<P>
   As a geriatric nurse practitioner and associate professor of
nursing in Long Beach, Calif., Dr. Karna Bramble, 55, is supposed
to be an expert on aging. But when it came to acknowledging the
decline of her own mother, she said, ``there was an incredible
amount of denial.''
</P>
<P>
   She was visiting her parents in San Diego four years ago when
her mother, Doris Meek, who is 86, mentioned that she had gotten
lost on a familiar stretch of freeway that evening. ``She said, `I
think I have that Ronald Reagan disease,''' Dr. Bramble recalled.
``I said, `No, Mom, you're fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, on another visit, Ms. Bramble discovered that the
food she had bought for her parents the week before was rotting in
the refrigerator. Her mother, who was later found to have dementia,
had forgotten about preparing meals. Her father, Ray Meek, 90, a
retired engineer, did not know how to cook. The couple had all but
stopped eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left to buy them fresh food, and I was sitting in the car in
the parking lot of the grocery store, crying,'' Dr. Bramble said.
``That was when I knew we needed some help.'' She got it by
contacting Dr. Spitler's firm, Age Concerns, in San Diego.

   Finding someone who was familiar with the ins and outs of the
local health care system was crucial for Diane Huckabee, 41, a bank
manager in San Diego, who called Dr. Spitler after both her parents
landed in the hospital near their home in Los Angeles, her mother
with a stroke, her diabetic father for the amputation of a leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a panic: `What do I do?' '' said Mrs. Huckabee, who
has two sons, 12 and 6, and a husband who works full time as an
accountant. ``I couldn't just quit work and go up there. My mother
had an HMO, and the hospital was about to discharge her, and she
had no help in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spitler recommended a care manager in Los Angeles who
intervened with the hospital so that Mrs. Huckabee's mother, Jean
Dahle, could stay until the care manager could arrange for home
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the system,'' Mrs. Huckabee said. ``You've got to
know somebody who knows somebody to figure out what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Barlam, a care manager based in Beverly Hills, not only
helped Bill Bregar and his family realize that their 82-year-old
mother had to move into a care facility because of Alzheimer's and
helped find the right one, but even drove her to her new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only one who could do it,'' said Bregar, 58, an
engineer in Portland, Ore. Recalling that wrenching day, Bregar
said that only Barlam could get his mother into the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks he's great,'' Bregar said. ``She treats him like a
long-lost friend. The last time I visited her, she threw me out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one measure of the profession's growth, Barlam recently sold
his business _ consisting of himself and five other social workers
_ to a venture capital firm from San Francisco, Bank America
Ventures. The idea is to create an in-home care and care management
company with offices throughout California, said Barlam, who will
stay on as executive vice president and continue to do geriatric
care management.
</P>
<P>
   Many managers are now advocating certification for what started
out as a cottage industry. Ms. Bartelstone is the vice president of
the National Academy of Certified Care Managers, which was founded
in Connecticut in 1994 and has been administering a certification
test since 1997. She is also one of the founders of the National
Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers, in Tucson,
which started in 1986 with 30 members and has since grown to 1,200
of the estimate 4,000 private care managers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Geriatric care managers, generally sought during a crisis, can
initially cost as much as $2,000 a month, but Ms. Bartelstone
points out that long-distance clients are spared the expense of
last-minute plane fares, hotel rooms and lost days at work. As the
crisis passes and only monitoring is needed, the cost can fall to
about $200 a month. In most cases, none of it is covered by
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Geriatric care managers are also good at assuaging the guilt of
those who hire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The care manager always reinforces my feeling that I'm doing
all I can, I can't do more,'' said Jack Veerman, 68, an importer
who lives in Manhattan and visits his 91-year-old mother in Miami
once a month _ unless there is a crisis, when he makes the trip
every weekend. ``You don't think you're doing an adequate job, no
matter what you do. It's your mother. Your memory is that she was
always there for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, the care managers end up spending more time talking with
the children than with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dealing with all sorts of unresolved conflicts from
childhood _ `She liked you better.' '' Ms. Bartelstone said.
``They're worrying about their inheritances. They're trying to get
approval. They're trying to be the perfect son or daughter. They're
trying to make up for prior wrongs, or trying to get back at their
parents for what they perceive is wrong. It's exhausting work, but
you never get bored.''

SUPREME COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS ON REFUGEE ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arguing an important case on federal refugee law,
the Clinton administration told the Supreme Court Wednesday that
foreigners who have committed serious nonpolitical crimes outside
the United States are ineligible for refugee status no matter how
severe a risk of persecution they would face if deported to their
home countries.
</P>
<P>
   The administration asked the justices to overturn a federal
appeals court decision that required immigration officials to
evaluate a foreigner's crimes in light of the severity of
persecution he would likely face if deported.
</P>
<P>
   The Refugee Act of 1980 bars relief, known as withholding of
deportation, for foreigners who would otherwise qualify but who
have committed serious nonpolitical crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether someone faces persecution has no bearing on that
question,'' an assistant solicitor general, Patricia A. Millett,
told the justices. ``It either was or was not a serious
nonpolitical crime, and a later risk of persecution doesn't change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer interjected. ``Doesn't it
make a difference,'' he asked, whether a would-be refugee who had
committed a minor drug offense at home faced death on the one hand
or ``seven hours in a cell'' on the other hand if sent home. ``Why
not make that kind of `all factors considered' analysis?'' Breyer
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The law did not require such a balancing test, Ms. Millett said,
and the attorney general, the official charged with enforcing the
law, has chosen not to employ one. As essential part of the
administration's argument in this case, Immigration and
Naturalization Service vs. Aguirre, No. 97-1754, is that the courts
should defer to the attorney general's overall interpretation of
the law as well as to its application in specific cases.
</P>
<P>
   The case grows out of the government's effort to deport a former
Guatemalan student leader, Juan Anibal Aguirre-Aguirre, who entered
the United States illegally in 1993 after several years of leading
sometimes violent protests against the Guatemalan government's
mistreatment of students and its approval of increased bus fares.
He participated in vandalism, beatings and the burning of at least
10 buses.
</P>
<P>
   An immigration judge granted his request for withholding of
deportation and for asylum, two separate findings that are both
based on the probability of reprisals or persecution. The Board of
Immigration Appeals overturned that ruling, holding that Aguirre's
crimes in Guatemala, which it characterized as serious and
nonpolitical, made him ineligible for relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the appeal
board's opinion in a 1997 ruling. The decision had three parts,
each of which the administration is challenging in its Supreme
Court appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring a weighing of the severity of the
crimes against the likelihood of severe persecution, the appeals
court also said in determining whether a crime was serious and
nonpolitical, immigration officials should focus not just on the
criminal acts but should evaluate the circumstances and the
political context. The appeals court said further that officials
should consider whether the crimes were ``acts of an atrocious
nature,'' which Aguirre's did not, in the court's view.
</P>
<P>
   The argument Wednesday led the justices into a spirited
discussion of basic principles. ``I find it extraordinary that we
take into this country people who have committed any crime at all,
even for political reasons,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said. He said
that purely political crimes, such as speaking out against an
authoritarian government, should not be disqualifying, but that
offenses such as murder or rape should be, no matter what the
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who attempted to kill Hitler would not necessarily be
excluded,'' Ms. Millett, the government lawyer, offered in
response.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That led the justices to muse on whether assassination could be
considered a political offense. Could the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy be considered a political crime, Chief
Justice William J. Rehnquist wondered. Scalia mentioned Queen
Elizabeth. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked whether a failed
assassin of Saddam Hussein might qualify for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Millett said she hesitated to get too specific but added:
``There may be times in this world where there's no way of changing
a government except through violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you have any political ingredient, it can't be a
nonpolitical crime,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said. Ms. Millett
disagreed. ``We're focusing on the crime, not the criminal,'' she
said, adding: ``Political motivation alone doesn't make it a
political crime, any more than blowing up a day care center in
Oklahoma City can be regarded as a political crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for Aguirre, Nadine K. Wettstein said the test for a
political offense should be ``was this out of proportion to his
political goals?'' Aguirre maintains that when evaluated in
context, his crimes were political.
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn considerable international attention because
the Refugee Act was the domestic implementation of the U.N.
Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which the United
States ratified in 1968.

BOOK SAYS KAZAN HAD SCANT REGRET OVER TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 4th graf to give book title)  (bl) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Throughout the emotional controversy over the
decision to give him an honorary Academy Award, Elia Kazan has
remained silent in the face of critics who still condemn him for
naming names during the congressional hunt for communists in the
entertainment industry in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   But in a series of remarkably candid interviews recorded 25
years ago and first being made public now, Kazan said that he
regretted ``the human cost'' of his decision to inform on eight old
friends from the Communist Party. But at the same time he said he
named them out of a deep personal conviction that a genuine
communist conspiracy was threatening the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who informs on other people is doing something
disturbing and even disgusting,'' he said. ``It doesn't sit well on
anybody's conscience. But at the same time I felt a certain way,
and I think it has to be judged from the perspective of 1952.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, who is 89 and in uncertain health, made his comments in a
series of remarkably candid and detailed interviews about his films
that were conducted in 1973 and '74 by Jeff Young, a writer and
former film studio executive. For a number of reasons, Young left
the tapes in his garage for years, sharing them only with a few
friends. Newmarket Press, whose books are distributed by Random
House, will publish the interviews in April, in a book titled,
``Kazan: The Master Discusses His Films.'' The publication decision
was made months before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences voted without dissent to give Kazan, one of America's
greatest film and theater directors, the honorary Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   That decision to give him the honorary award March 21 has
touched off a debate of unusual heat in Hollywood, led mostly by
formerly blacklisted writers and their family members who say that
Kazan should not be forgiven by the motion picture industry for his
testimony on April 10, 1952. On that day he appeared before the
House Un-American Activities Committee, which was doggedly looking
for communist influence in Hollywood. Kazan informed on eight
friends from the Group Theater who had once belonged to the
Communist Party with him. Although other entertainment figures
including Lee J. Cobb, Burl Ives and Jerome Robbins also named
names, they were not criticized as fiercely as Kazan was.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews Kazan seemed deeply torn about his decision:
alternately defiant and saying how much he loathed the Communist
Party and contrite about the personal cost. At one point he even
said, ``Maybe I did wrong _ probably did.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kazan discussed the blacklisting issue in his
autobiography, ``A Life,'' published by Knopf in 1988, he had never
gone into such detail about the motives, the personal uncertainties
and the aftermath of his decision. Young, who sought to write a
scholarly book about Kazan's work, was intimately aware of the
blacklist: his uncle Ned Young was a blacklisted writer whose
career was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him my uncle was very dear to me, that I was opposed to
the position he had taken and asked him if this would be a
problem,'' recalled Young, who said he strongly believed that Kazan
should be given the Oscar because of the value of his work. ``He
was very open. He said, `Ask me anything you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young's book offers details about Kazan's casting decisions, his
directorial technique and his personal views on all of his films,
including classics like ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' and ``On the
Waterfront,'' for which he won Oscars, as well as ``A Streetcar
Named Desire,'' ``A Face in the Crowd'' and ``Viva Zapata.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the book especially timely is Kazan's discussion
of the link between some of his films and his Congressional
testimony, and the fact that his decision to name names was never
very far from his artistic consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In his most acclaimed film, ``On the Waterfront,'' the Marlon
Brando character, a boxer turned longshoreman, is branded a stool
pigeon after testifying against the local mob boss. But Brando
emerges victorious. Less than 20 years later in an unsuccessful
Kazan film, ``The Visitors,'' a man also testifies against former
friends, but the movie ends on a note of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting his decision to testify, Kazan seemed at times
unapologetic and at other times sorrowful. But the overriding theme
of the interviews is his loathing for communism, which he
experienced as a member of the Communist Party while in New York in
the 1930s. He called communism ``a slavery of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to know a lot about the Communist Party,'' he said. ``I
used to go downtown to 12th Street where their headquarters were,
get orders and go back like a good ritualized lefty and try to
carry them out. Our orders were to try to take over the Group
Theater. It was child's play in one sense, but in another it
wasn't. We were doing something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, nobody knows the truth about any of this,'' said
Kazan, recalling his decision to reveal names before the House
committee. ``The party was getting all kinds of money out of
Hollywood and out of the theater. Communists were in a lot of
organizations _ unseen, unrecognized, unbeknownst to anybody. I
thought, if I don't talk, nobody will know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan said it was ``disturbing'' to inform on his colleagues.
But he added: ``When I thought about what it meant symbolically,
about what would have happened if I'd lied and said I had no idea
what was going on, it would have been worse. So I said, I'm not
going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan said that the eight friends he named, including playwright
Clifford Odets and Paula Strasberg, wife of Lee Strasberg, were
already known to the committee. ``Everybody knew who they were, so
it wasn't a big deal,'' he said. ``They of course suffered some for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I also did something nobody ever mentions. I told
three of them beforehand. I told Clifford Odets. He said he was
going to do the same thing. I told Mrs. Strasberg, and I told
another guy,'' who replied with an angry curse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During his interviews, Kazan vigorously denied that he named
names to gain favor with studio moguls, as has been charged. ``As
far as doing it for money, it's fantastic, really, because in the
first place they didn't threaten me, and in the second place they
couldn't have, and in the third place I didn't need a job in
Hollywood,'' he said. ``The blacklist did not extend to Broadway,
and I was at the top of my theater career. All my testifying did
was lose me certain things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I'd lose Arthur Miller's plays. I knew a lot of
guys would turn against me, which they did. I've lived through
that. In some ways the experience made a man out of me because it
changed me from being a guy who was everybody's darling and always
living therefore for people's approval, to a fellow who could stand
on his own. It toughened me up a lot. I'm not afraid of anybody.
They avoided my eye. I didn't avoid theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he added, ``I have some regrets about the human cost of
it. One of the guys I told on I really liked a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, the author, said the long delay in publication was, at
first, the result of an agreement he had made with Kazan that the
book would not be published until the director completed his
autobiography. Young said that Kazan had expected the autobiography
to be published in the mid-1970s. But it took years for Kazan to
complete his own book, published in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Young said, he periodically showed the Kazan
transcripts to friends who were directing their first films because
of the instructive information about moviemaking. It was at the
behest of his friends, he said, that he began seeking a publisher
for his book. Young, who lives in Los Angeles, said he had spoken
casually to Kazan, the last time in December. Kazan lives in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Kazan discussed in detail the weight that
Communism held over him even after he quit the party. He mentioned
one of his films, ``Man on a Tightrope'' (1953), from a script by
Robert E. Sherwood, based on a real event about a circus troupe
that escaped communist Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that I had gone through a violent break with
the party, I still found myself thinking like a communist,'' said
Kazan. He felt ``great resistance to making'' that film ``because
it was against the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``And I discovered that
I still unconsciously thought of the Soviet Union as a progressive
political phenomenon. I finally said to myself, if you've got the
courage, you should make this picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Through that film, ``I partly broke myself of my belief in
Soviet communism,'' he said. ``It's hard for anybody who wasn't a
communist to understand how strong a hold those beliefs had on you.
Your emotional commitment keeps overriding everything your
intellect and common sense tell you. It's akin to a kind of
religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, Stalin was as bad as Hitler, maybe worse. Hitler
killed 6 million Jews. Stalin killed the same number of people,
maybe more. He was a monster, but your mind, once you've been a
committed communist, doesn't want to face that fact. So in a way
the film was an important purgative thing for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Kazan discusses his identification with the
Brando character in ``On the Waterfront'' who is snubbed after he
testifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that kind of thing happened to me after I testified
before HUAC,'' said Kazan. ``I was snubbed. People I knew well
would look at me but not talk. People looked down on me. They
couldn't accept the fact that correctly or incorrectly it was
something I did out of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe nobody agreed with me, but I thought that was the right
thing to do,'' Kazan said. ``Maybe I did wrong, probably did. But I
really didn't do it for any reason other than that I thought it was
right.''

JUSTICES FOCUS ON ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DECISION IN IMMIGRANT CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Supreme Court justices, hearing a
Guatemalan immigrant's plea that he faces persecution if deported,
said Wednesday that the federal government apparently favors
political refugees who flee American enemies over those trying to
escape from U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   The justices focused on the history of political assassinations
as they considered whether Attorney General Janet Reno was on firm
legal ground when she ordered the expulsion of Juan Anibal
Aguirre-Aguirre, who is wanted in Guatemala for attacking people,
burning buses and vandalizing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre-Aguirre, who sneaked into the United States in 1993,
seeks asylum based on the claim that his crimes were political acts
against an oppressive government, an argument the Justice
Department rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Patricia Millett, representing
the federal government, told the justices that they owe the
attorney general latitude in her decisions on whether an
immigrant's crimes were political or wholly criminal. Attorney
Nadine Wettstein, pressing Aguirre-Aguirre's case, said the
attorney general's discretion is limited and can reject claims for
asylum when the immigrants crimes were either not motivated by
politics or so egregious as to render any political motive
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia said he has difficulty accepting
Millett's argument that the attorney general has wide discretion.
In particular, Scalia said he is troubled by the notion that an
attorney general could admit assassins into the United States so
long as they killed for a political purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow those things killings to be done in this
country for a political purpose,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   But Millett responded that the United States might in
extraordinary cases consider admitting someone who killed to
achieve a political goal. For example, the government might have
welcomed Germans who tried but failed to assassinate Adolf Hitler
during World War II, she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice David H. Souter wondered whether the United
States would protect a political dissident of a U.S. ally. ``Have
we rewarded the enemies of our side?'' Souter asked.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the specific details of Aguirre-Aguirre's case,
Millett said the issue of political assassination is irrelevant
because the Guatemalan attacked civilians, dragging them off buses
that he was about to burn and from stores he was going to
vandalize. Attacks on civilians are acts of terror, not politics,
the Justice Department attorney said, citing the April 1995
terrorist bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building that killed
168 people in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Millett, Wettstein said Aguirre-Aguirre did not
attack civilians but rather aimed his outrage at the buses as part
of a political statement opposing the Guatemalan government's
doubling of public transportation fares. The attorney general,
rather than focusing on the political motive and nature of
Aguirre-Aguirre's actions as she should have, concentrated only on
the illegality of his behavior in ordering him back to Guatemala,
Wettstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Immigration Appeals, a Justice Department division,
concluded that Aguirre-Aguirre's offenses were ``serious
non-political crimes'' and recommended his return to Guatemala. But
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco disagreed,
saying that the 1994 Immigration and Nationality Act requires the
attorney general to give greater consideration to the political
nature of Aguirre-Aguirre's crimes and the persecution he might
face upon his forced return to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department then appealed to the Supreme Court,
arguing that the law gives the attorney general great deference in
granting asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, however, wondered how much deference the attorney
general is owed in cases of political assassination. For example,
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked whether an attorney
general could have granted asylum to communist Lee Harvey Oswald,
who assassinated President John F. Kennedy in 1963 for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that would be the position of the United
States,'' Millett responded.
</P>
<P>
   Using a present-day example, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked
whether the United States would grant asylum to someone who
attempted to assassinate Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, with whom
the United States has had a running feud throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Millett declined to address that question, saying she was in no
position to set U.S. policy and that her answer might affect the
situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision by July.

USOC ACTS TO IMPROVE BIDDING OVERSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The US Olympic Committee, moving quickly to respond
to a critical report examining its role in the Salt Lake City
payoff scandal, promised Wednesday to rein in and monitor future
Olympic bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   After a special commission chaired by US Senator George Mitchell
charged Monday that the Olympic committee failed to exercise
adequate oversight of the Salt Lake bidding and organizing
committees for the 2002 Winter Games, the USOC's executive board
adopted a reform package designed to prevent similar abuses. It
also asked the White House to designate the International Olympic
Committee as a ``public international organization'' in order to
apply the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act where bribery may be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here making excuses,'' said Olympic committee
president William Hybl. ``We accept responsibility for the change
that has to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides cracking down on the lavish lobbying and gift giving
that led to the worst scandal in modern Olympic history, the USOC
will:
</P>
<P>
   --Open an independent office to oversee bid committees, with a
full-time staffer on site;
</P>
<P>
   --Ban bidders and organizers from giving assistance funds to
foreign Olympic committees;
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure payments from its own international assistance fund
are legitimate;
</P>
<P>
   --Hold open board of directors and executive committee meetings
and publicize their minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Mitchell commission leveled its harshest criticism at
the IOC for what it said is ``an inevitably corruptive'' culture of
improper gift giving, it also found that the USOC failed in its
federal mandate to have ``exclusive responsibility'' for organizing
the Olympics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While top Salt Lake bid officials were making improper payments
and gifts totalling nearly $1 million to two dozen IOC members, the
report said that the USOC was exercising no authority over SLOC's
day-to-day operations, had no staff members working in the Salt
Lake offices, attended virtually no board or executive committee
meetings between the 1991-95 bidding period, and made no attempt to
audit SLOC's books or records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oversight was abysmal,'' admitted Hybl, who was interim
USOC president between September 1991 and October 1992 before
starting his current term in October 1996. ``There are no excuses
and we're not making any excuses for what happened in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most embarrassing revelation amid the Salt Lake
scandal was that the USOC's own international relations director
(Alfredo LaMont, who resigned in January) was also a paid SLOC
lobbyist who funneled thousands of dollars to an IOC member from
Barbados and steered assistance funds to countries with IOC votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're embarrassed about the whole thing,'' said USOC executive
director Richard Schultz, who assumed the post a few months after
Salt Lake City was awarded the Games. ``The USOC, regardless of the
year, is responsible for this.''
</P>
<P>
   After having partnership difficulties with both the Atlanta and
Salt Lake committees, the USOC had already toughened the rules for
future bid cities before the scandal broke in December. The latest
reforms will also create a separate Office of Compliance to oversee
bidders and deal with conflict-of-interest issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be sure, because of the culture of our country,
that we have rules that are beyond reproach,'' said Schultz. ``You
are what you are perceived to be, and we want to be perceived in a
positive light.''

MASSACHUSETTS SEEKS ACCELERATED HIV COVERAGE BY MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts is aiming to become the first state in
the nation to expand Medicaid to cover the uninsured, working poor
almost as soon as they test HIV positive, in a major step toward
making the AIDS epidemic less deadly here.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci has proposed that $10 million of the expected
tobacco settlement go toward the first year of the expansion, to
provide comprehensive health care for up to 2,000 uninsured
individuals who test positive for the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's fiscal year 2000 budget also includes the
language that would allow the state Division of Medical Assistance
to proceed with the expansion, pending federal approval. State
officials are already in discussions with the US Health Care and
Financing Administration, which oversees the federal-state health
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be one of the most significant advances that
Massachusetts has made in terms of addressing the HIV/AIDS
epidemic,'' said Robert Greenwald, director of public policy and
legal affairs for the AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts, which
is holding a lobby day Thursday at the Statehouse to convince
legislators to approve the governor's proposal and provide even
more funding for AIDS-related programs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Massachusetts has seen its AIDS deaths drop by 60
percent between 1996 and 1997, largely as a result of the
availability of new AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors.
According to state public health statistics released late last
year, 242 people died from AIDS in 1997, compared with 609 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Massachusetts offers a state and federally funded
drug assistance program for HIV-infected people who meet certain
guidelines. But comprehensive Medicaid coverage is now provided
only to those who have become so sick from AIDS that they are
disabled and can no longer work.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion of Medicaid, now known as MassHealth, that
would mean more HIV-infected people could get the comprehensive
care they need to stay as healthy as possible, and to keep working
as long as possible, said Greenwald of AIDS Action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give early intervention and access, and hopefully it
(HIV infection) will not progress, ever, to AIDS,'' Greenwald said.
``We're excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, uninsured HIV-positive people who have
incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about
$16,000 for a single person, $32,000 for a family of four) would
qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   In a previous expansion, Massachusetts extended coverage to
children whose family incomes are up to 200 percent of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The move would ultimately save the government money, by keeping
HIV-infected people healthier and preventing costly
hospitalizations, according to Greenwald.
</P>
<P>
   And it would allow public health officials to launch an
aggressive campaign to encourage people to get tested, since
officials will then be able to offer the Medicaid program to those
who have been reluctant to find out their HIV status because they
have no insurance coverage, Greenwald said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS Action is also asking legislators to provide even more
public health funding than called for in Cellucci's budget: $2.6
million more for the Department of Public Health AIDS line item,
bringing it up to $54.2 million; and $5.1 million more for the
department's substance-abuse treatment line item, bringing it up to
$48.4 million.

LIBERTY FINANCIAL DROPS PURCHASE OF FRENCH FUNDS UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Liberty Financial Cos. Wednesday canceled its agreement
to buy the US mutual fund arm of French bank Societe Generale SA,
citing a precipitous drop in the unit's assets since the $216
million deal was announced last August.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Liberty does not have to pay any penalty for
terminating the agreement, since its contract to buy New York-based
Societe Generale Asset Management Corp. guarded against any changes
in values. Since August, the firm has seen its assets plunge around
40 percent to $2.8 billion, the victim of volatile world markets
and panicky investors who have bailed out of the firm's SoGen
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the value of the assets moves as dramatically as it did
in this case, the numbers just don't work anymore,'' said Liberty
Financial's chief executive, Kenneth R. Leibler.
</P>
<P>
   News that the transaction might be canceled first appeared in
the Globe last month.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler said Liberty had the right to walk away from the deal if
assets at Societe Generale Asset Management declined by about 30
percent or more. Liberty, a group of eight financial services firms
with $61 billion in assets under management, said Societe Generale
had agreed to call off the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Once high fliers, SoGen's six funds have stumbled, as world
markets batter the international stocks the firm focuses on under
the reins of renowned investor Jean-Marie Eveillard.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler said Liberty was still in the market to buy a global
money manager but that any deals this year were unlikely, since few
companies were for sale and overseas stocks were not doing well.
Asked if Liberty could take another look at Societe Generale's fund
arm in the future, Leibler said, ``It's kind of hard to put
toothpaste back in the tube.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Liberty, whose majority owner is Liberty Mutual
Insurance Co. of Boston, fell 1/4 to close at 21 1/2 Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.

YANKEE ACQUISITION TO PAY $1.1 BILLION FOR CONCENTRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Concentra Managed Care Inc. Wednesday announced its
pending acquisition _ valued at $1.1 billion _ by Yankee
Acquisition Corp., a division of Welsh, Carson, Anderson &AMP; Stowe, a
New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, which is expected to be finalized in the
second quarter of this year, Welsh, Carson agreed to assume $328
million in debt held by Concentra, which manages workers
compensation cases for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 93 percent of the company's post-merger stock will
be converted into shares offered for $16.50 each. Welsh, Carson
will also seek an independent investor to purchase the remaining 7
percent, or 1.9 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Concentra says it will continue to operate as an independent
health-care management company under its current name and
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a financial buyer for the company that in taking us
private will give us the opportunity to address a few issues,''
said Joseph F. Pesce, Conentra's executive vice president and chief
executive officer, Wednesday. ``What we have had in the past year
is that we have fallen short of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston company runs the nation's largest network of
occupational health care centers, managing the practices of 278
doctors located in 156 centers in two dozen states. Concentra also
offers medical management services such as pre-employment testing
throughout the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh, Carson, a 20-year-old investment firm, currently manages
more than $7 billion in private equity capital primarily in the
health care and information services industries.
</P>
<P>
   The firm funded one of the companies that merged in the summer
of 1997 to create Concentra, and has an investment track record in
the health services industry. Last year, Welsh, Carson purchased
Centennial Healthcare Corp. of Atlanta for $290 million, a few
months after it joined forces with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. to
buy Medcath Inc. of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement,``was very much expected,'' said Nancy
L. Weaver, who monitors Concentra for Stephens Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Concentra last year went on a Wall Street roller coaster ride,
its stock plunging more than 80 percent from a peak in January,
when more than a dozen brokerage analysts dubbed it a ``best buy.''
</P>
<P>
   By October, the company had formed a special board committee to
cut costs and hired investment bankers to sift through acquisition
offers from a number of discreet suitors. Meanwhile, Welsh, Carson
boosted its ownership of Concentra stock to 14.9 percent of the
company's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver predicts Wells, Carson will increase the company's
presence in the health services industry, a strategy she says would
require capital in the short run but would be profitable down the
road.

SOFTWARE PACKAGING CITED AS WASTEFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The tiny software disc, the width of two credit cards,
arrived by mail in a Bible-sized box supported by a plastic tray
cushioned by foam _ the kind of packaging that drives recycling
activists to fits.
</P>
<P>
   Software manufacturers are among the newest offenders in
wasteful packaging, said Vivien Watts, field organizer for the
Recycling Initiative Campaign, which released its 10th annual
Wastemaker Awards Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dubious distinction goes to manufacturers whose packaging is
difficult to recycle, excessive, contains dioxins, or doesn't
contain recycled material. Though strides are being made in
recycling, activists said, it's obviously more efficient to reduce
the amount of waste people generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling on government and consumers to take actions to
reduce the packaging clog in the waste stream,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Representative Pam Resor of Acton, Mass.
announced legislation Wednesday that would ban packaging made with
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which produces cancer-causing dioxins
when burned in trash incinerators. CVS brand carpet cleaner and
Pine Sol Lemonfresh cleaner and antibacterial spray plastic
containers include PVCs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 billion pounds of trash United States consumers
generate each year, 31 percent of it is packaging, Watts said. With
the increase in disposables, each American now disposes of 4.78
pounds of trash a day _ up from 2.87 pounds in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other biggest offenders named by the campaign:
</P>
<P>
   --Fig Newtons Snack Packs. Like all individually wrapped
products, these Nabisco snacks contain unnecessary plastic.
Consumers could do better buying a regular pack and transporting
them in reusable containers, Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   --EtherFast 10/100 CardBus PC Card, which comes in a 9 1/2-inch
by 6-inch by 2 1/4-inch box, filled with a hollow plastic space and
foam.
</P>
<P>
   --Ban roll-on deodorant. Unlike other brands, it comes in a box.
</P>
<P>
   --Hood opaque milk bottles. Colored plastic may shut out light,
but it also is harder to recycle.
</P>
<P>
   --Coke bottles. Labels urge consumers to recycle but the bottles
contain no recycled material.
</P>
<P>
   --Lunchables. Long the bane of recyclers, the Oscar Meyer snacks
come in segmented plastic trays covered with plastic wrap and a
cardboard shell.
</P>
<P>
   --Sunny Delight. Plastic shrink wrap covers eight individual
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   --Kool Aid Kool Bursts. The six-pack comes in shrink-wrap and
cardboard.

UNITY SEEN AS KEY FOR MEXICO'S RULING PARTY IN 2000 ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Hanging on a wall at the hulking downtown
headquarters of Mexico's governing party are dusty oil portraits of
nearly all the 37 politicians who have headed the party since its
founding in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits are hung only after a president of the party, known as
the PRI, leaves office, and currently, there appears to be space
for only one more painting on the wall, that of the party's current
president, Mariano Palacios Alcocer. The visual suggestion left by
the gallery is that the PRI, the world's longest-ruling political
party, has a rich history but not much of a future.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for years analysts have been predicting the demise of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, but its recent election
victories have undermined those arguments. This week, the debate
over the party's past and future dominated Mexico as President
Ernesto Zedillo and some 2,000 party stalwarts prepared to
celebrate its 70th anniversary, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For decades after its founding, the party was a tool of
successive presidents, using authoritarian methods to insure
one-party rule. Over the last 20 years, however, opposition parties
have chipped away at the PRI monopoly, and now control the Congress
and 10 of the country's 32 state capitals, including Mexico City.
Dozens of PRI leaders have defected to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI has never lost the presidency. Polls suggest the
party can win next year's presidential elections, too, but only if
the party can avoid a damaging split. As a result, the way the
party selects its candidate in coming months is crucial, because
powerful politicians seeking the nomination could bolt the party if
they feel mistreated, several analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who has said that unlike his predecessors he will not
hand-pick his successor, is to outline rules for the candidate
selection during Thursday's celebration. The new rules will join
other recent radical changes within the party, like the decline in
influence of labor and peasant leaders and the rise of
television-oriented campaign managers.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping transformations are prompting analysts to
characterize the current period as the end of an epoch, equivalent
to the end of Spanish colonial rule here in the early 19th century
or the beginning of the 1910 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authoritarian system that ruled Mexico for 70 years is
ending,'' said Jose Antonio Crespo, a political scientist. ``The
PRI has never had internal democracy, and it's never had to
alternate presidential power with the opposition. There's no
precedent for the party in power in Mexico to cede to its
opponents. That's always provoked civil war, coup d'etat or
revolution.'' The PRI has been so dominant that to a large degree,
its history is Mexico's history. Created by President Plutarco
Elias Calles in 1929 to control provincial warlords after the
1910-1917 revolution, the party in its early years helped carry out
land reform and create the national army, central bank and public
school system. It oversaw 20 years of rapid economic growth after
World War II, and during decades when the rest of Latin America
stagnated under military rule, allowed democratic roots to take
hold here.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, however, the PRI's strength has declined. Until
the 1980s, the party consistently received 70 percent or more votes
in national elections. But according to a government analysis of
recent elections and polling data, the PRI could count on only
about 42 percent of votes if national elections were held today.
The combined votes of the two largest opposition parties would
total nearly 52 percent, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the PRI's greatest strength is the opposition's
fragmentation into two large parties of nearly equal strength. In
recent days the two parties' likely presidential candidates, Mexico
City's leftist mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and the populist governor
of Guanajuato state, Vicente Fox, have endorsed the idea of putting
aside ideological differences to mount a single opposition
candidacy to defeat the PRI. But the legal and political obstacles
appear so great that most analysts dismissed the proposal as
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for the PRI to win in 2000 is to avoid a split in its
own ranks that could siphon off PRI votes,'' said Agustin Basave, a
former PRI deputy who has written a history of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Palacios, the PRI president, said
recent victories in gubernatorial races have left party members
``with high spirits and high hopes'' for the 2000 race. He
minimized the risks of a split during the candidate selection
process over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some individuals might leave, that happens in all parties, but
a major, significant rupture, definitely not,'' Palacios said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the PRI is, like its opponents, divided into two broad
camps, and the coming struggle between them to control the
nomination is laden with risks of a rupture. Currently in control
of the party are the technocrats, led by Zedillo and other
economists who have served their careers in the bureaucracy. The
traditionalists, often called dinosaurs, feel their grass-roots
political experience has been ignored by Zedillo, who attended
Yale, and the two previous presidents, who attended Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs' leader is Manuel Bartlett, a former governor who
last month announced his presidential candidacy. In the weeks
since, one PRI union leader who endorsed Bartlett has complained of
threats from PRI officials, and analysts said the government has
sought to undermine Bartlett's candidacy in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's preferred candidate appears to be Interior Minister
Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only risk of a split would come if the party doesn't open
up to real democracy,'' Bartlett said in an interview Wednesday.
``If the party establishes clear rules that lead to a democratic
contest for the candidacy, then the party will be strong in 2000.
If not, there'll be problems.''

CLINTON, DEMOCRATS PUSH FAMILY   ORIENTED AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a day when so much else was happening _ Monica
S. Lewinsky's first television interview and Hillary Rodham
Clinton's first foray into New York since declaring her interest in
a Senate race there _ President Clinton and congressional Democrats
staged a pep rally that was a counterpoint to both.
</P>
<P>
   Within the stately, ornate confines of the Library of Congress,
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore joined their party's
congressional leaders in extolling the virtues of a family oriented
Democratic agenda that focuses on preserving Social Security and
Medicare, improving public schools and access to health care, and
raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   As a roomfull of House and Senate Democrats and their aides
enthusiastically cheered, Clinton and the Democratic leaders
portrayed their party as unified behind its ``Families First''
agenda and brimmed with confidence that Republicans would embrace
many parts of it if for no other reason than to avoid possible
backlash in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is we are organized and we are united,'' Clinton said
to applause. ``And we are united around an agenda for America's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The show of unity seemed designed to contrast with Republicans,
who are still hammering out the details of their own legislative
program and sifting through a crowded field of GOP presidential
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle introduced Gore as
``president of the United States,'' adding after a long pause,
``Senate.'' Gore embraced House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, who opted not to challenge him for the Democratic
presidential nomination, and called him a ``special friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The show of Democratic unity has flowed throughout the Lewinsky
scandal and Clinton's impeachment and trial. The ordeal not only
brought Democrats together but also inflated support for Mrs.
Clinton and led to the current drive to coax her into running for
the Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Democrats Wednesday fanned the flames of
unity, as Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has served in the Senate
since 1962, said in an interview that he has not seen anything like
it ``in all the time that I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats agree with Clinton that 62 percent _ or $2.8 trillion
_ of the $4.9 trillion budget surplus should be preserved to shore
up Social Security and 15 percent used to extend the life of the
Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want a larger amount of the surplus _ about $200
billion more than Clinton over the next decade _ to go toward
Social Security. And Republicans have yet to agree on whether to
set aside 15 percent for Medicare, or $686 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt urged Republicans to join with Democrats in putting
``the national interest above partisanship'' to approve various
pieces of legislation. ``We want to make progress now. This month.
This year. This session. We can't afford to waste another year or
two mired in partisan wrangling and gridlock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on the theme, Clinton said, ``I'd also like to ask
that politics stop and that the Republican majority in Congress
stand with us'' on Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He said he welcomed Republicans' decision ``backing away from
the irresponsible across-the-board tax cut that is too costly'' and
their support for setting aside 62 percent of the budget surplus
for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the Republican majority to join us in devoting a
portion, 15 percent, of the surplus to save Medicare,'' Clinton
said. ``They have not done that so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' agenda also includes renovating public schools,
instituting accountablity measures for schools, raising the minimum
wage, and ensuring a wider set of options for patients in health
maintenance organizations. It also provides targeted tax cuts for
child care, long-term care, and a controversial plan to establish
private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois criticized the
Democratic agenda as ``unbalanced.'' ``It favors Washington
bureaucracy over local control, government budget expansion over
the family budget expansion, tax increase over tax relief,'' he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such rhetoric, Kennedy said he believed that Republicans
and Democrats can come together on several issues, including
minimum wage, education and a patients bill of rights.

DOMINANT PARTY STRUGGLES TO REMAIN DOMINANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Its popularity is eroding. Its leaders are widely
ridiculed as dinosaurs. Its opponents talk of uniting against it.
And its deepening internal battles mean that for the first time in
70 years, it might be in danger of losing a presidential election
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But as it prepares to mark seven decades of unbroken rule
Thursday, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mexico's oldest
and long-dominant political group, is trying to put a brave face on
its struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not overconfident, but we're feeling enthusiastic about
the way we've been able to change with the political climate in
Mexico,'' said Celso Humberto Delgado, who heads the party's
national political council. ``Sometimes it's painful, but this has
always been a party of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Its many critics scoff at the thought. Since its founding in
1929 as a broad-based political group in the aftermath of a bloody
revolution, the party, known by the Spanish acronym PRI, has varied
little in its near monopolistic rule, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is a party without a democratic culture in it,'' said
Luis Javier Garrido, author of a critical history of the party.
``In 1999 we'll see some new methods. . .but the changes are only
superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is still dominant at the ballot box. Most state
governments are controlled by PRI lawmakers and governors. And the
party has never lost a presidential election, though some say it
took fraud to protect its winning streak in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mexico has opened up economically and politically, the
party's hegemony has shown signs of crumbling. Two years ago, it
lost its majority in congress in the face of gains by parties on
left and right. And in recent years it has lost crucial races for
local offices in the capital and in key states such as Nuevo Leon
and Baja California North.
</P>
<P>
   Internal eruptions _ mostly between traditionalists and
reformers _ have prompted defections of key figures, including
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the Mexico City mayor who joined the leftist
Party of the Democratic Revolution in the 1980s and is expected to
run for president next year. Last week, Cardenas urged the
opposition parties to hold a joint primary to choose a unity
candidate to run against the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders insist that losing some elections and the
ideological debates among factions are a normal part of a
transition toward becoming more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only campaigns we've lost have been to former PRI
members,'' Delgado added. ``We haven't lost to anyone produced by
the parties themselves. But it still concerns us that people leave
our party and win against us, and that's something we're studying
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the party is recruiting younger members and promoting
grass-roots candidates who are ``more political with their neighbor
than with their boss.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little evidence of that last week when the party
hosted a press conference with four candidates vying to run for
governor in the northern state of Coahuila. In a dreary,
smoke-filled basement at party headquarters in Mexico City, the
dour-faced rivals sat elbow to elbow at a narrow table. Each talked
about how long he had toiled for the party and offered poetic
tributes to its past. None proposed a campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one party official boasted that having more than one
candidate seeking a nomination was itself something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times past there would've been one candidate and he
would've won. No questions,'' said the official, who wore a pin
bearing the party's red, white, and green logo but refused to give
his name.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, most candidates were selected by party leaders in a
closed process, and every six years the president anointed his own
successor. But in seven winning governor's races in the past two
years, the party chose its candidate in what amounted to a state
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers have called for a similar process to select a
presidential candidate next year. President Ernesto Zedillo, who
won slightly more than 50 percent of the vote in 1994, says he does
not intend to name a candidate and joined those urging US-style
primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   As they mark the party's anniversary, leaders are expected to
announce Thursday how the nominee will be chosen, and perhaps drop
such longstanding restrictions as selecting only candidates who
have previously held elected office. That could open the door to a
flood of new presidential hopefuls, a prospect that worries older
members who fear that further division would bolster the
opposition. But some remain deeply skeptical that the process will
be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they know how to elect a candidate,'' said
Sergio Aguayo Quezada, a political columnist and professor at the
Colegio de Mexico. ``It could cause a bigger rift within the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the days of one-party rule will inevitably give way to
power-sharing among different groups, said a former Mexico City
administrator who is now a researcher at Harvard University's David
Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is such a complicated society that you have to govern
by consensus,'' said Juan Enriquez. ``The future will have to
include coalitions. You can't have your own plan anymore and say,
`Everyone will agree with me.' ''

CHANGE IN KOSOVO REBEL LEADERSHIP RAISES PEACE HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Adem Demaci, the unbending elder statesman of
ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo, stepped aside on Tuesday, he was
replaced by Hashim Thaci, a man half his age but seemingly more
open to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The shift marks a sudden generational and ideological sea change
in the murky separatist politics of Kosovo, where 90 percent of the
people in the Serbian province are ethnic Albanians. It also means,
according to western diplomats, that after months of stalemate in
Kosovo, there is hope for progress.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci spent 28 years in a Serbian jail as a political prisoner
and personifies the unyielding resistance to Serb rule that has
challenged the bigger, better-armed forces of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. Demaci resigned as political leader of the
Kosovo Liberation Army rather than preside over what he considers a
sellout of Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
   For all Demaci's revolutionary rhetoric, however, it was the
29-year-old Thaci and his cadre of like-minded former student
activists who actually carried the fight to the Serbs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both men seem to belie the stereotypes of youthful
revolutionaries who embrace violent struggle and then, in the
winter of their years, become statesmen who lead the rebels to the
negotiating table. In this case, it was the young man putting out
conciliatory signals while the old man continued to rattle sabres
that others were carrying.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the change in leadership, Christopher Hill,
the US envoy in Kosovo, said he was more optimistic than ever that
the Albanians will sign the settlement they had agreed to in
principle before leaving peace talks near Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
   Knut Vollebaek, the Norwegian foreign minister and chairman of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has
1,300 observers in Kosovo, is similarly encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   The ascension of Thaci to the most senior political position in
the Kosovo Liberation Army leads many US diplomats to believe that
the ethnic Albanians will keep their promise to return to France on
March 15 and sign an agreement that would restore autonomy to
Kosovo but keep it within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   To Demaci, a Marxist, fighting for independence is a
non-negotiable principle. Thaci is a college-educated idealist who
took up arms after coming of age just as Kosovar Albanians were
stripped of their autonomy in 1989 and relegated to second-class
citizenship, but he is described as a pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
   Dukagjin Gorani, an ethnic Albanian journalist who is close to
the KLA leadership, said Thaci emerged as the key figure in the
16-member Albanian delegation at the peace talks. Gorani credits
Thaci with helping unify a disparate delegation that included those
like him, who believe the Serbs will only listen to force, and
Ibrahim Rugova, a 53-year-old Sorbonne-educated professor and
pacifist who leads ethnic Albanian moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Like other KLA commanders, Thaci has a nom de guerre,
``Commander Snake.'' Along with his friend, Suleiman ``Commander
Sultan'' Selimi, the KLA's overall commander, he helped mold a
ragtag collection of rebels into a formidable insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials say the a key difference between him and Demaci
is that Thaci is said to recognize his forces' limits in fighting
the militarily superior Serbs. As one western diplomat complained,
Demaci was too ``willing to fight to the last drop of everyone
else's blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaci is seen as someone who tasted battle and found it bitter.
If some KLA leaders see the suffering of ethnic Albanian civilians
as the price that must be paid for independence, Thaci is said to
have been chastened by the Serb offensive that has cost some 2,000
civilian lives and produced 300,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as one US official put it, describing Thaci as a dove
would be wrong, as would be suggesting that Thaci has dissension
among his compatriots under control.
</P>
<P>
   It was Thaci who said he could not sign the agreement without
first consulting with others in Kosovo. But as Hill and other
diplomats point out, Thaci took that line after he had briefly left
the talks to confer with Demaci, who refused to take part and calls
it treachery to consider a deal that does not guarantee a
referendum on independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of sounding out other KLA leaders, Thaci and the
rest of the leadership are making more conciliatory sounds.
Demaci's sudden resignation convinced many western diplomats that,
unless something unforseen occurs, _ always a possibility _ the
rebels will back the compromise settlement.
</P>
<P>
   That would put pressure on Milosevic to accept the 30,000 NATO
troops that the western allies say are needed to police a
settlement. If Milosevic refuses, he faces possible NATO air
strikes, which weren't going to happen if the ethnic Albanians also
turned down the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A major sticking point remains disarming the KLA. But sources
say Thaci and others are arguing that the ethnic Albanians have
nothing to lose by trying to box in Milosevic with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ensure the Albanians will sign, US officials
hope to bring them to Washington before March 15. The White House
will not treat Thaci like a terrorist, as the Serbs do, but as a
fledgling democrat, someone who could get the ethnic Albanians to
put aside their weapons _ and in the process deliver a foreign
policy coup to the Clinton administration.

RJ REYNOLDS' `NO BULL' CIGARETTE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN TO GET A
DISCLAIMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1997, RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. settled on ``No
bull'' as an advertising slogan for its Winston cigarettes, which
it said were 100 percent tobacco with no additives.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, however, detected at least a
little confusion among consumers and announced Wednesday that the
company, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., would start
including disclaimers with its Winston advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The disclaimers, an RJR spokeswoman said, will read, ``No
additives in our tobacco does not mean a safer cigarette.''
Questions about how consumers interpreted the company's advertising
arose after complaints from anti-smoking groups in 1997. The
commission conducted its own research and determined that people
could be confused by the advertising, said Jodie Bernstein,
director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The RJR spokeswoman, Carole Crosslin, said in a statement that
the company had never tried to imply that Winston cigarettes
carried lower risks of smoking-related health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with the FTC's premise, and our own research
demonstrated that smokers do not interpret the phrases to mean that
Winston is safe or safer than other cigarettes,'' she said. ``RJR
has publicly and consistently stated that we do not believe the
risks associated with smoking are reduced due to the lack of
additives, and we have never communicated otherwise to smokers.''
Additives used in cigarettes include flavorings like licorice,
menthol and sugar, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The order will go into effect in May after a comment period, Ms.
Bernstein said. Print ads for Winston that are still running will
have to include the disclaimer, although individual packages of
cigarettes will not, Ms. Crosslin said.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a time when sales of Winston cigarettes have
risen slightly after the repositioning of the brand 18 months ago.
Winston's market share is 4.93 percent, Ms. Crosslin said, up from
4.86 percent when the ``No bull'' campaign began. Sales of
cigarettes overall have been falling steadily, both as a result of
price increases imposed by the companies and from anti-smoking
efforts at the state and federal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indicates that the federal government is becoming more
concerned about the safety perceptions of tobacco consumption by
the American public,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney. ``The FTC is looking to make sure consumers
don't mistake the word `natural' for `healthy.''' Across the board,
consumer-products companies use words like ``low-fat'' and
``natural,'' he said, to get an extra promotional lift.  &QL;

NEW BILL WOULD REWARD COMPANIES THAT CURTAIL EMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid a new report that the 1990s have been the hottest decade in
1,000 years, Congress appears to be warming toward legislation
aimed at reducing emissions of chemicals that many scientists say
are causing the Earth's temperature to rise.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators, including conservatives who
often oppose environmental initiatives, plans to unveil a bill
Thursday that would reward companies for taking steps to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions now, rather than waiting for an
international treaty on global warming to take effect in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which would give businesses potentially valuable
credits in exchange for cutting pollution, still faces tough
challenges, including a skeptical House of Representatives and some
environmentalists who fear that the proposal would result in the
increased us of nuclear power because it causes no carbon dioxide
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   But several observers say the bill, written by Senator John H.
Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, and cosponsored by nine others,
could bestir a Congress that has been largely hostile to efforts to
slow the two-century increase in the Earth's carbon dioxide levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing bipartisan momentum develop for an idea that
makes sense for the environment and makes sense for industry as
well,'' said Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental
Defense Fund of New York, one of the nation's biggest environmental
groups. ``This stands a good chance of passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, said he hopes the bill encourages companies to be
creative in trying to reverse the United State's steadily rising
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, rather
than waiting for an international treaty called the Kyoto Protocol
to order them to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we just sit around and wait another nine years before we do
anything?'' Chafee asked. ``Whether you are for or against the
Kyoto Protocol, the US should do things now to facilitate immediate
environmental gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new study suggests that the 1990s have been the
warmest decade at least since the Norman Conquest of England in
1066. What's more, the researchers say that 1998 was the hottest
year of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Using a combination of ancient tree rings and ice drilled from
glaciers, Raymond Bradley and Michael Mann of the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, along with a University of Arizona
scientist, found that the planet is even warmer than during the
so-called Medievel Warm Period when Europeans complained about the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't quite pin things down as well'' further back in
time, admitted Mann, ``but our results do reveal that . . .
temperatures in the latter 20th century have been exceptionally
warm compared to the preceding 900 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Their paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, joins a
growing body of research showing that the 1990s have been
record-hot, capped by 1998, when the long Texas drought and Florida
wildfires made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But climate change remains one of the most contentious issues in
environmental politics, in part because it is so complex. Skeptical
scientists, such as Thomas Gale Moore of Stanford University, doubt
the temperature has risen abnormally, and they are even more
skeptical that human actions such as burning coal and oil have
caused it.
</P>
<P>
   The climate debate has sharply divided President Clinton from
the Republican-controlled Congress. In 1997, Clinton endorsed the
Kyoto Protocol, which commits the United States to reduce
heat-trapping gases beginning in 2008, but Senate leaders have
vowed not to ratify the deal, arguing it would hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides wrangled, Chafee, along with Senators Joe
Lieberman of Connecticut and Connie Mack of Florida, drafted a bill
late last year to encourage American companies to act now. The fact
that Mack, who received a zero rating from the environmental League
of Conservation Voters, immediately drew attention to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Their bill would allow companies to cut emissions now _ for
instance, by converting from coal to natural gas power _ and claim
credit for the savings under whatever rules the United States later
adopts to fight global warming. Those credits, measured in tons of
avoided emissions, could be subtracted from the company's total
emissions to meet the rules, or sold to other firms that need them.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists fear that the bill may be too loose,
giving companies credit for anything that reduces carbon dioxide
even if it causes new problems. Replacing a coal-burning plant with
a nuclear plant would reduce carbon dioxide emissions, they note,
but would increase nuclear waste. The bill would also give credit
for shutting down factories, they add.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a Congress that only last year was considering a
measure to prevent federal officials from talking about global
warming, other environmentalists see Chafee's initiative as
progress. And, with five Democratic and five Republican cosponsors,
including James Jeffords of Vermont and Susan Collins of Maine,
they say it has a political future.

10 TEXAS MOBSTERS CONVICTED OR RACKETEERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS and BILL HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In a sweeping government victory, the San Antonio
head of the Mexican mafia and nine of his soldiers were convicted
Wednesday of racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 are likely facing life behind bars, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Mafia leader Robert ``Beaver'' Perez stood statuelike as U.S.
District Judge Edward C. Prado read his verdicts: guilty of
racketeering, guilty of conspiring to racketeer.
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of 18 more guilty verdicts followed, two for each
defendant. A hand-clap from somewhere in the courtroom punctuated
the verdict for Jesse ``Chango'' Gomez, the defendant accused of
being the main triggerman in the notorious 1997 shotgun slayings of
five people in a San Antonio home.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of soft weeping gradually emerged from corners in the
courtroom. But the defendants' expressions remained blank except
for a wink and grin from mafia lieutenant Louis ``Big Lou''
Morales, who was described during the trial as having laughed about
strangling a former gang member.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, gang members likely face mandatory life
imprisonment once sentencing dates are set, defense lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering law carries a maximum penalty of roughly 25
years, but because the gang is accused of killing 15 people,
several defense attorneys have said that barring appeals, their
clients would likely die in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Baumann, the lead prosecutor in a
six-week trial that included some seven-day work-weeks and
sleepless nights, lowered his head into his hands as verdict after
verdict turned into a government victory.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the heavily guarded courtroom Wednesday, Baumann said
the case dismantled the prison-bred gang's local leadership. As new
leaders emerge, he said, law enforcement officers will remain
vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to eliminate them, but we're going to restrain
them,'' Baumann said. ``We need to keep a foot on the throat or
they'll be killing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 40, faces murder charges in state court. He is accused of
ordering six slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Several defense lawyers indicated they would appeal the federal
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Ed Camara said his client, 24-year-old Michael Perez, was
convicted simply because his uncle is Robert Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got steamrolled with the other defendants,'' Camara
said, adding, ``It wasn't justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdicts brought the total number of racketeering
convictions on this case to 16. Six pleaded guilty before the trial
began, accepting plea bargains that are likely to put them behind
bars for between 12 to 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the trial, prosecutors relied on the testimony
of former mafia members, a few of whom went to the government when
they feared they would be killed by other mob members.
</P>
<P>
   The massive trial, with more than 150 witnesses and almost 20
crates of evidence, pulled back the covers on San Antonio's
criminal culture.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony attracted, among others, a tattooed minister who
came, he said, offering his faith to anyone who would receive it.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal judges also left their benches to join
observers in the wooden pews in Prado's courtroom.

   HOUSTON _ After more than two months in the hospital, the first
three of the seven surviving Chukwu octuplets went home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ebuka, the firstborn, Echrem, the third child born, and Jioke,
the seventh child to be delivered, left Texas Children's Hospital
about 10 a.m. CST and were driven to their house in southwest
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a full-time job now,'' joked Nkem Chukwu, the mother of
the children, at a Wednesday afternoon news conference at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They opened their eyes when they got there signifying, `We are
now home','' said their father, Iyke Louis Udobi.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors expected the first children to leave the hospital in
late March or early April, but they progressed better than expected
and were released ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of their release, Jioke weighed 5 pounds, 5 ounces,
Echerem weighed 4 pounds, 7 ounces, and Ebuka was 4 pounds, 8
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   There were several medical milestones the children had to meet
before being released from the hospital, said their pediatrician,
Dr. Patti Savrik.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were maintaining their temperatures in open cribs,''
Savrik said. ``They were taking all their nutrition through a
bottle or by breast feeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that figured into their time of release included
the ability to breathe without the help of any respiratory
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are ready to go. They're good babies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Savrik said another baby might be going home in 10 days to two
weeks and that the other three may remain in the hospital for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard right now to predict exactly how these babies are
going to come along because we are dealing with different issues
with different babies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby who will probably be going home next is Chima, a girl,
who is in serious condition in the Level II nursery, while the
others, Chidi, Gorom and Ikem, remain in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Ikem, who is the smaller of the boys, had some abdominal surgery
to repair an intestinal perforation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same type of surgery that was done on Gorom in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the seven children appeared relaxed and happy to
have their first three children home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was elated. We were dancing,'' said Udobi.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the babies, Nkem Chukwu, said there was quite a
celebration when the infants were brought into the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all dancing and rejoicing. My mother was kind of
screaming and praising the lord,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The home was decorated with a ``Welcome'' sign and balloons, and
relatives, neighbors and the family minister were on hand to greet
them, Udobi said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said they still are working out the details of how
they are going to care for the three babies and then eventually all
seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the dust settles down we will be able to tell. Right now
we have my mother-in-law there and some church members and
neighbors also,'' said the father.
</P>
<P>
   Savrik said her experience with multiple birth families has
shown that it takes several days with the children at home before
parents have a good idea of how much help they will need.
</P>
<P>
   Udobi thanked people who had donated services and money to the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll need a bigger van for sure and a bigger house. Where we
live now is not big enough to accommodate and give them freedom,''
he said of the couple's four-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   Udobi, a respiratory therapist, said the couple have still not
taken any photographs of the children and that they do not plan to
show them to the public until ``due time.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said they have not agreed to any commercial offers or
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preoccupation is for the health of these kids and their
coming home. Three are home now and we are expecting four more.
When we get to that bridge we will cross it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, who was treated with fertility drugs, delivered Ebuka
naturally Dec. 8 and the others by Caesarean section Dec. 20. The
smallest baby died a week later.

RELAXED NORMAN READY FOR FRIENDLY DORAL COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Greg Norman may have missed the cut in the tournament
that bears his name in his Australian homeland a little over a
month ago, but he arrived in South Florida fit and ready to go for
the $3 million Doral-Ryder Open, which begins Thursday on a course
where he has won three times.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time of transition for Norman, and the PGA Tour as
well. Norman spent eight months recuperating from shoulder surgery
following the Masters a year ago, and at 44 realizes time isn't his
best friend in terms of his future. ``I have zero pressure,'' he
said Wednesday. ``To me I can stop now and everything I have done
in the game of golf has been for the good of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's perhaps no more than coincidence that Norman returned for
last week's World Match Play Championships in San Diego, the
inaugural event of the World Golf Championships, organized chiefly
by PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. Norman advanced to the second
round of the event, which featured an unprecedented purse of $5
million. Other events of the World Golf Championships are the NEC
Invitational (Aug. 26-29) in Akron, Ohio, and the American Express
Championship (Nov. 4-7) in Valderrama on the southern coast of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The World Championship concept originally was proposed by
Norman, and Finchem shot it down. Now many of the game's top
players are reshaping their schedules around the new events, and a
fourth will be added next year in South Africa. The game's four
major championships still are the signature events, but a
tournament like Doral is hurt this year because six of the top
seven players in the world including, Tiger Woods and David Duval,
are skipping it to rest up.
</P>
<P>
   Even Norman endorsed the match play event at La Costa in
Carlsbad, Calif., that saw Jeff Maggert defeat Andrew Magee in the
championship match that went 38 holes. ``I think from the players'
perspective, we all enjoyed the format,'' said Norman. ``We knew
the format would be a success, because the players like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television ratings were high, and it goes to show, you
don't need the name players in a final to stir up the interest of
the public and the television viewers. I think that was just a good
reflection on the overall quality of the golf tournament. I
definitely would keep the tournament on my schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The will to excel again still burns within, but Norman said he
realized time wasn't on his side in a career that has been more
memorable for lost opportunities than his only two major wins in
the British Open. ``I have to rehab every day,'' he said. ``The
surgery was a complete success, but the surgery is the easiest
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part starts when you have to start your rehab and
continue going basically for the rest of your life as long as you
want to play the game. I have always got to have somebody there as
long as I am playing. It's a good two hours a day in the morning
and evening. That isn't including working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I made the decision, I knew it was going to help my
career. I knew I wanted to play. Before I had the surgery, I had no
desire to go out and hit golf balls because I was in so much pain.
If it was a cool, wet day, I wouldn't even go out there. It all
gave me an unfiltered approach toward my game and my life because I
had more time to sit back and become reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play again. I love being out there. I think that is
what I missed the most. I didn't miss the game, but I missed being
out there on the golf course playing at the competitive level. I
don't want to be out here if I don't think I can compete. I don't
want to take up the space when somebody who is 20 or 21 could be
out here playing. It's in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman pointed to his heart, aware that his left shoulder is
strong and the game he played growing up on the Queensland coast
still has a fascination and an appeal. ``Frustration may never set
in,'' he said. ``It's difficult to say. I know my doctor only wants
me to play no more than two tournaments a month.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   There are reports that Tiger Woods and his caddie, Mike
``Fluff'' Cowan, may be parting company. Woods has already
dismissed his Maine agent, Hughes Norton. Cowan, also of Maine,
didn't tote the bag when Woods won the Buick Invitational in San
Diego or during the match play event. Cowan was replaced by Bryon
Bell, a longtime friend of Woods. Woods said Bell needed some money
to defray medical school expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Rita, a native of Glastonbury, Conn., may be next in line.
Rita caddied for Curtis Strange when Strange won the US Open in
1988 at The Country Club and in 1989 at Oak Hill and has been
working for Scott Hoch recently. ``We're week to week,'' said Hoch
of his arrangement with Rita.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? I wouldn't stand in his way if he had a chance to
go with Tiger,'' said Cowan, who worked for Peter Jacobsen for the
better part of 18 years before getting a call from Woods. Cowan
worked as an assistant professional at Martindale CC in Auburn,
Maine, and was raised in Fairfield, Maine. ``Who caddies for Woods
two weeks up the road at Bay Hill in Orlando should supply the
answer.''

TJX COS. FOURTH TOPS PREDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A strong year for the TJX Cos. is about as commonplace as Roger
Clemens winning another Cy Young Award or the New York Yankees
winning another World Series.
</P>
<P>
   So at a time when many retailers are doing well, it was hardly a
surprise when the Framingham, Mass. operator of such offprice
chains as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls announced Wednesday that it
enjoyed record sales and earnings for the fiscal year that ended
Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth-quarter, profits jumped a better-than-expected 29
percent to $126.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 was a banner year for the TJX Cos.,'' said Bernard
Cammarata, TJX's president and chief executive, who added, ``We
outpaced our objectives in every quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The results pushed TJX shares to a 52-week high of 32 11/16 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock then dipped a bit to close
at 31 15/16, up 1 1/16 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, fourth-quarter sales seemed disappointing,
rising less than 2 percent to $2.28 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's fourth quarter contained an extra week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made TJX's performance this quarter all the more
impressive,'' said Sally H. Wallick, an analyst with Legg Mason
Wood Walker.
</P>
<P>
   When year-to-year comparisons were made on a 13-week basis,
rather than on the basis of a 14-week quarter versus a 13-week
quarter, sales were up 9 percent, and sales at stores open for at
least a year were up 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the full fiscal year, sales were $7.9 billion, up 9 percent
from the comparable 52-week period. Net income was $424.2 million,
compared with $304.8 million in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining some of TJX's success, Cammarata said: ``We did an
excellent job of managing inventories. We remained very fluid in
our inventory position, which enabled us to offer a constant flow
of fresh and exciting merchandise throughout the year.''
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 1,100 stores, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls provide TJX
with the bulk of its revenues and profits. Keeping the identities
of the two chains separate and distinctive in the minds of
consumers is crucial for success, Cammarata said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the strategy has been so successful that the
opportunity for expanding the two chains in the United States may
be greater than previously thought, TJX told analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chains in Canada and the United Kingdom, Winners
Apparel Ltd. and T.K. Maxx, also turned in strong performances, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGoods, which specializes in home furnishings, also ``made
significant strides'' last year, TJX said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, TJX debuted a new concept called A.J. Wright, a chain
aimed at more moderate-income customers than those who shop T.J.
Maxx or Marshalls.
</P>
<P>
   The company opened six A.J. Wright stores last year and expects
to ``more than double its store base in 1999,'' TJX said.

 &HT;    USOC vows change in answer to report
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to move beyond the gift scandal enveloping
the international Olympic movement, U.S. Olympic officials pledged
Wednesday to strengthen internal controls and ``return the Games
and the attention to the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to find the flaws, correct the mistakes and to
create a system that will ensure that these mistakes do not occur
again,'' said Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hybl and other officials delivered their formal response to a
report issued Monday that criticized the USOC for giving virtually
no oversight to the bidding practices of Salt Lake City, host of
the 2002 Winter Games, and other American cities that sought to
become Olympic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized the International Olympic Committee
for creating a culture in which lavish gift-giving to IOC members
flourished with little accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to one recommendation in the report, U.S. Olympic
officials said they would lobby the IOC and President Clinton to
have the IOC named a ``public international organization,'' making
the IOC subject to federal bribery statutes. USOC officials
conceded, however, that such a determination from Clinton would
mean little unless other countries adopted similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee what other countries will do,'' USOC
executive director Dick Schultz said. ``All we can try to do is
provide a model that we hope other countries will take a look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is a private entity currently beyond the jurisdiction of
bribery statutes as defined by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
which prohibits U.S. business people from giving foreign government
officials anything of value to influence them.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the president has not made
a decision on the USOC's recommendation. Clinton could make the
change by executive order.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed meeting Tuesday, the USOC agreed to draft the letter
to Clinton and adopt a series of other proposals dealing with
host-city bidding practices. Officials said they also support
recommendations in Monday's report on changes within the IOC, such
as limiting terms for members and altering the election process.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they are anxious to learn what reforms, if any,
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and other officials will
propose at IOC meetings in two weeks in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged by what President Samaranch has said ...
that they are taking a very careful look at their structure and
their accountability,'' Hybl said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hybl declined to call for Samaranch's resignation. ``It
seems to me that the system really needs to change,'' he said,
``because, if the system doesn't change, the individuals involved
won't make a great deal of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials also said they would ban American bid cities from
operating accounts designed to assist athletes or Olympic efforts
in other countries. The tactic was used by Atlanta officials, who
suggested the possibility of a training camp for African nations
during the bid process and successfully pitched the idea to the
city of LaGrange.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight commission's report released Monday found that
Salt Lake City bid officials gave at least $4 million to IOC
members since 1989 for travel, skiing, scholarships and shopping
sprees, much of it funneled through an account set up to provide
financial assistance to athletes. The account had no oversight and
didn't follow established procedures for awarding the money.
</P>
<P>
   The report also concluded that the USOC dispensed at least
$40,000 to Sudanese athletes at the request of Salt Lake officials
through the USOC's own international assistance program. Several
USOC e-mail messages referred to the payments as ``a payback for
(Salt Lake City) votes.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials said they will not discontinue their own
international assistance program, but they pledged to do a better
job of overseeing disbursement of funds.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the USOC official who oversaw the international
assistance, Alfredo LeMont, resigned. Two other high-ranking USOC
officials involved in the assistance fund _ Tom Wilkinson, USOC's
assistant executive director, and Jim Page, USOC's deputy executive
director for programs _ will not be disciplined, even though they
authored messages that discussed the use of USOC's
international-assistance fund in relation to IOC votes for Salt
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at that very, very carefully,'' Schultz said, ``and,
while the e-mail conversations were inappropriate, neither us or
our general counsel found any indication that there was any type of
conspiracy there to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Separate from the bid commission's recommendations, the USOC
vowed to increase the representation of athletes and minorities on
its boards and in its executive positions, and to hold open
meetings and publish minutes of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   USOC staff no longer will be allowed to visit bid cities at the
expense of those cities, and any payments or gifts to USOC staff
must be turned over to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight the USOC's renewed commitment to athletes, Olympic
swimming gold medalist John Naber and track gold medalist Jackie
Joyner-Kersee were invited to join Wednesday's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee said she is worried about the scandal's impact on
corporate sponsors, who provide much of the financial assistance to
athletes in training. Naber said the scandal had diverted media
attention from the stories about young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that after the dust settles, (we) will once again turn
our attention to where it belongs,'' Naber said. ``It belongs on
the hopes and dreams of the young athletes trying to represent our
country well in the greatest sporting competition in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC POLICY CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibit U.S. bid cities and organizing committees from
establishing assistance funds for other countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strictly apply its criteria for providing grants from its
International Assistance Fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish an Office of Compliance to oversee U.S. bid cities
and conflict-of-interest issues.

MANDELA ANNOUNCES JUNE DATE FOR SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After months of wrangling over how
to conduct the second post-apartheid elections in South Africa,
President Nelson Mandela announced Wednesday that the voting would
be on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela had earlier said he wanted the general elections held
around May 17 to May 28. But Wednesday he said that after
consulting with election officials, he decided to give the
elections commission an extra week to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   To widespread laughter, Mandela, who made his announcement in
Parliament, paused on the verge of saying the date, teasing the
legislators who had been awaiting his decision. He took off his
glasses. He drank a glass of water. Finally he said June 2. The
legislators applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials say they hope that the announcement of the
date will prompt many citizens to register to vote this weekend in
the election commission's third and final registration drive.
</P>
<P>
   So far, South Africans appear to far less interested in voting
than they were in 1994, when nonwhites were allowed to vote for the
first time. That year more than 85 percent of the eligible voters
cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Now fewer than 60 percent have registered. Part of the problem
may be that they do not have the documentation to register. The
government and opposition parties have been locked in a battle over
a decision to allow only citizens with a new ``bar coded''
identification document to register.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said up to five million of the 25 million voters
did not have such documents. Some are blacks in rural areas who
have never had any documents. But many of those who have not yet
received the bar-coded documents are whites who have failed to
update their papers.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks moved far more quickly to obtain documents, because the
apartheid-era documents were so demeaning to them.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties have accused the government of using the
identification rule to gain an advantage in the election. Officials
called such accusations preposterous, saying they simply want an
accurate roll.
</P>
<P>
   Two largely white-supported parties, the small liberal
Democratic Party and the party that instituted apartheid, now
called the New National Party, took the government to court to
relax the registration rules. Last week, the New National Party
suit lost in a lower court. The judge ruled that there had been
plenty of time for citizens to obtain the new papers. The decision
is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party announced Wednesday that it would postpone
its suit until after the registration drive had ended to see how
many citizens had registered.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are not the only protest against the handling of the
elections. Last month, the head of the elections commission, Judge
Johann Kriegler, quit in protest over what he called government
interference in the panel's independence. One sore point was a lack
of financing that he said had reduced the commission staff to
supplicants. The agency has since been given an increase in
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution does not actually allow Mandela to fix the date
of the elections officially until April 30, when Parliament
adjourns. But a constitutional amendment to remedy this problem is
widely expected to pass on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the vote, the party that wins the Parliamentary majority
chooses the president. The winner is widely expected to be the
African National Congress, and the next president Thabo Mbeki,
Mandela's deputy president.

 &HT;    USOC vows change in answer to report
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to move beyond the gift scandal enveloping
the international Olympic movement, U.S. Olympic officials pledged
Wednesday to strengthen internal controls and ``return the Games
and the attention to the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to find the flaws, correct the mistakes and to
create a system that will ensure that these mistakes do not occur
again,'' said Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hybl and other officials delivered their formal response to a
report issued Monday that criticized the USOC for giving virtually
no oversight to the bidding practices of Salt Lake City, host of
the 2002 Winter Games, and other American cities that sought to
become Olympic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized the International Olympic Committee
for creating a culture in which lavish gift-giving to IOC members
flourished with little accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to one recommendation in the report, U.S. Olympic
officials said they would lobby the IOC and President Clinton to
have the IOC named a ``public international organization,'' making
the IOC subject to federal bribery statutes. USOC officials
conceded, however, that such a determination from Clinton would
mean little unless other countries adopted similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee what other countries will do,'' USOC
executive director Dick Schultz said. ``All we can try to do is
provide a model that we hope other countries will take a look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is a private entity currently beyond the jurisdiction of
bribery statutes as defined by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
which prohibits U.S. business people from giving foreign government
officials anything of value to influence them.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the president has not made
a decision on the USOC's recommendation. Clinton could make the
change by executive order.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed meeting Tuesday, the USOC agreed to draft the letter
to Clinton and adopt a series of other proposals dealing with
host-city bidding practices. Officials said they also support
recommendations in Monday's report on changes within the IOC, such
as limiting terms for members and altering the election process.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they are anxious to learn what reforms, if any,
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and other officials will
propose at IOC meetings in two weeks in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged by what President Samaranch has said ...
that they are taking a very careful look at their structure and
their accountability,'' Hybl said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hybl declined to call for Samaranch's resignation. ``It
seems to me that the system really needs to change,'' he said,
``because, if the system doesn't change, the individuals involved
won't make a great deal of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials also said they would ban American bid cities from
operating accounts designed to assist athletes or Olympic efforts
in other countries. The tactic was used by Atlanta officials, who
suggested the possibility of a training camp for African nations
during the bid process and successfully pitched the idea to the
city of LaGrange.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight commission's report released Monday found that
Salt Lake City bid officials gave at least $4 million to IOC
members since 1989 for travel, skiing, scholarships and shopping
sprees, much of it funneled through an account set up to provide
financial assistance to athletes. The account had no oversight and
didn't follow established procedures for awarding the money.
</P>
<P>
   The report also concluded that the USOC dispensed at least
$40,000 to Sudanese athletes at the request of Salt Lake officials
through the USOC's own international assistance program. Several
USOC e-mail messages referred to the payments as ``a payback for
(Salt Lake City) votes.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials said they will not discontinue their own
international assistance program, but they pledged to do a better
job of overseeing disbursement of funds.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the USOC official who oversaw the international
assistance, Alfredo LeMont, resigned. Two other high-ranking USOC
officials involved in the assistance fund _ Tom Wilkinson, USOC's
assistant executive director, and Jim Page, USOC's deputy executive
director for programs _ will not be disciplined, even though they
authored messages that discussed the use of USOC's
international-assistance fund in relation to IOC votes for Salt
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at that very, very carefully,'' Schultz said, ``and,
while the e-mail conversations were inappropriate, neither us or
our general counsel found any indication that there was any type of
conspiracy there to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Separate from the bid commission's recommendations, the USOC
vowed to increase the representation of athletes and minorities on
its boards and in its executive positions, and to hold open
meetings and publish minutes of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   USOC staff no longer will be allowed to visit bid cities at the
expense of those cities, and any payments or gifts to USOC staff
must be turned over to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight the USOC's renewed commitment to athletes, Olympic
swimming gold medalist John Naber and track gold medalist Jackie
Joyner-Kersee were invited to join Wednesday's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee said she is worried about the scandal's impact on
corporate sponsors, who provide much of the financial assistance to
athletes in training. Naber said the scandal had diverted media
attention from the stories about young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that after the dust settles, (we) will once again turn
our attention to where it belongs,'' Naber said. ``It belongs on
the hopes and dreams of the young athletes trying to represent our
country well in the greatest sporting competition in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC POLICY CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibit U.S. bid cities and organizing committees from
establishing assistance funds for other countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strictly apply its criteria for providing grants from its
International Assistance Fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish an Office of Compliance to oversee U.S. bid cities
and conflict-of-interest issues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strengthen its bid and candidate cities' contracts and bid
procedures manual, while putting a full-time staffer in candidate
cities during their bid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attempt to get the IOC designated as a ``public international
organization'' to make it subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act.
</P>
<P>
   _ Open board of directors and executive committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek increased athlete participation and diversity.

Anne Midgette writes frequently on international art, music and
theater. 
 By ANNE MIDGETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Broadway is new territory for Susan Feldman. Not that
she works far away: she is the director of the well-known Arts at
St. Ann's program in Brooklyn Heights. Nor is she a stranger to
music theater.
</P>
<P>
   She has co-commissioned and produced a range of work since 1980,
including ``Songs for 'Drella,'' Lou Reed and John Cale's piece
about Andy Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   But Arts at St. Ann's, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy
Trinity, is more commonly associated with the Brooklyn Academy of
Music than with Broadway, and Ms. Feldman is thought of more as a
producer of other people's work than as the creator of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, after a long incubation period, she has conceived,
written and co-directed her first Broadway show. Entitled ``Band in
Berlin,'' it opens Sunday night at the Helen Hayes Theater, the
product of a close collaboration among Ms. Feldman; the bass Wilbur
Pauley, the show's music director, and the Broadway choreographer
Patricia Birch, who is also a co-director. The project took shape
at Arts at St. Ann's and the American Music Theater Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought in 1992, when an earlier version of the
work first opened at St. Ann's, that it would be a Broadway show,
Ms. Feldman laughed. ``I'm still not sure it is a Broadway show,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the production team has trouble describing the collage of
film, slides, puppets and live singers that constitutes ``Band in
Berlin.'' The story follows the Comedian Harmonists, a singing
group that attained Beatles-like popularity in Germany before the
Nazis banned it in 1935 because three of its six members were
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the show's narrative is contained in a film, portions of
which are projected on a large screen at the rear of the stage, in
which an actor, Herbert Rubens, portrays the elderly Roman
Cycowski, the last surviving member of the Comedian Harmonists.
Cycowski died in November at the age of 97, and the show is
dedicated to him.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying this pseudo-documentary, as well as photomontages
of Germany under Hitler, a live singing group performs the
Harmonists' intricate original arrangements of folk and popular
songs. These are sung in French, English and German and include
``Stormy Weather,'' ``Tea for Two,'' ``Creole Love Call'' and ``Auf
Wiederseh'n, My Dear.''
</P>
<P>
   The singers are also not the Broadway norm. Hudson Shad, the
vocal ensemble that portrays the Harmonists in the show, is made up
of five opera and oratorio singers and a pianist, Robert Wolinsky,
better known in some circles as the harpsichordist for the Chamber
Orchestra of St. Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   This amalgam may be unusual for Broadway, but it is typical of
the two organizations involved with the show: Arts at St. Ann's and
the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia, where ``Band
in Berlin'' reached its final form in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both the arts program and the music theater festival have
explored different aspects of theatrical and musical collaboration,
from the operatic (``Malcolm X'' and ``Tania'' by Anthony Davis) to
the offbeat (``1,000 Airplanes on the Roof'' by Philip Glass), with
the hope that the works they nurture will have extended lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our projects are developed to go on to other places,''
Ms. Feldman said. But those places are usually the Brooklyn
Academy, New York City Opera or the Old Globe Theater in San Diego
rather than a Broadway house.
</P>
<P>
   Arts at St. Ann's was established in 1980 with an eye to the
past: to draw attention to a venerable landmark, one of the oldest
churches in Brooklyn, and to create a public use for the building.
But the program has proved an eminently forward-looking starting
point for some significant works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different institutions are equipped to take on projects at
different stages of development,'' Ms. Feldman said. ``We're good
for the beginning. BAM, for example, can't do the kind of
development and workshop we do; they're not set up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Academy has therefore undertaken several
co-productions with Arts at St. Ann's: ``Songs for 'Drella,''
``Frida,'' the opera about the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, which
went on to the Houston Grand Opera, among other places, and the
forthcoming ``Falling and Waving,'' a digital opera by Ronald Jones
and David Lang that opens on March 25 at St. Ann's.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Feldman, the $1.4 million version of ``Band in Berlin''
on Broadway is ``a culmination of everything I've done at St.
Ann's.'' The show got off the ground when Pauley, an opera singer
and longtime St. Ann's artist, put together a male vocal quartet
for a 1990 St. Ann's production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's
``Seven Deadly Sins,'' with Marianne Faithfull.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing them perform, a friend of Ms. Feldman's, Jonathan Cott,
a music writer, suggested they sing the music of the Comedian
Harmonists. That was the start of Hudson Shad.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman had no idea who the Comedian Harmonists were. Cott
provided her with tapes, took her to the highly regarded
documentary on the group by the German filmmaker Eberhard Fechner,
``The Comedian Harmonists: Six Life Stories,'' and ultimately
brought her to California to interview Cycowski. ``His voice was
amazing,'' Ms. Feldman said, as she described hearing the baritone,
a cantor for more than 40 years, sing the morning temple service at
the age of 91: ``Afterward, I said, `Roman, that was incredible.'
And he said, `Ah, I'm never warmed up in the morning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Before she met Cycowski, Ms. Feldman said, she had equated
Germany with the Holocaust. ``But I realized,'' she added, ``that
there was a whole world before Hitler still in Roman's mind. I felt
like I was given this legacy, this story to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   If St. Ann's is a place where new ideas are born, the American
Music Theater Festival is where they grow up. Founded in 1984, the
festival presents ``theater that sings,'' a definition that
embraces ``Atlas'' by Meredith Monk and ``Strike Up the Band'' by
George and Ira Gershwin, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The music theater festival _ still headed by one of its
founders, Marjorie Samoff, the producing director _ has an
impressive track record: 32 of its more than 70 productions have
gone on to other cities, and 16 of them have been recorded as
professional cast albums. Two have even made it to Broadway:
``Gospel at Colonus,'' which achieved renown if not a long run, and
``Dangerous Games,'' with music by Astor Piazzolla, which did not
do well with New York critics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the festival has shown it can spot Broadway potential:
the director Julie Taymor and the choreographer Garth Fagan both
worked there, separately, in 1986, long before they collaborated on
``The Lion King'' musical.
</P>
<P>
   Arts at St. Ann's and the American Music Theater Festival are
linked, Ms. Samoff said, by ``a long artistic and personal
friendship.'' The artistic part has included three co-productions,
one of which is ``Band in Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the show got to Philadelphia, it had had a run in
1994 at the Geva Theater in Rochester, been broadcast on public
radio, and evolved considerably from its original incarnation. It
had also sat fallow for four years as Ms. Feldman and Ms. Birch
tried to figure out what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual cast for ``Band in Berlin'' also proved a liability.
``Those classical singers all book two years in advance,'' Ms.
Birch said. ``Every time we got a nibble from a theater, one of the
guys would be unable to get out of his contract.'' In addition to
Pauley, the singers are Mark Bleeke, Timothy Leigh Evans, Hugo
Munday and Peter Becker.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only opera that kept the performers busy. Hudson Shad
has become an ensemble in its own right. The group's first visit to
Germany in 1995 proved so popular that it has continued to tour
there and in the United States. On the most recent visit last
month, a sellout crowd at Komische Oper in Berlin gave the group a
five-minute standing ovation. Hudson Shad has released two CDs and
a third is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   When the ensemble did manage to get together for the run of
``Band in Berlin'' at the American Music Theater Festival last
March, the show was a success. But without a permanent theater of
its own, the festival was stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Booking various theaters around the city for individual
productions, the festival was unable to extend a run if a show
proved to be a hit. ``When we had a success, we had no way to
develop it,'' Ms. Samoff said. ``The theater we were in for `Band
in Berlin' was about to be demolished.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the music theater festival is changing both its name and
its site. The new Prince Music Theater, a converted movie theater
in downtown Philadelphia, opens on March 22. With three performance
spaces, including a black box and a theater with 450 seats, the
house will allow Ms. Samoff the freedom to develop work at her own
pace _ in the spirit of the building's namesake, the director
Harold Prince, who is a board member of the American Music Theater
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The first staged work in the new theater will be ``Floyd
Collins.'' The musical by Adam Guettel and Tina Landau, about a
1925 Kentucky cave disaster, was seen at Playwrights Horizons in
New York in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The show first opened in Philadelphia in 1994; an original-cast
recording came out in 1997. Currently at the Old Globe Theater in
San Diego, the show's latest incarnation will go on from its April
run at the Prince Music Theater to the Goodman Theater in Chicago.
The hope is that it will eventually get to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Band in Berlin'' itself was in a race to Broadway with
``Harmony,'' another musical about the Comedian Harmonists that has
an original score by Barry Manilow. ``Harmony'' opened at the La
Jolla Playhouse in California in 1997, but after lukewarm reviews
it was decided to continue working on it.
</P>
<P>
   The show is expected to open on Broadway by 2000. (The German
sextet is also the subject of a Miramax feature film, ``The
Harmonists,'' opening in the United States on Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Harmony,'' ``Band in Berlin'' is not necessarily aiming
at a mainstream audience. And Broadway success is not the ultimate
artistic goal of either Arts at St. Ann's or the Prince Music
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal with any show,'' Ms. Samoff said, ``is to give it the
longest possible life and the widest audience compatible with what
it is: an opera house, or a tiny Off Off Off Off Broadway theater.
I'm just as thrilled and proud that `Frida,' a co-production with
Arts at St. Ann's, went to the Houston opera company, a small
theater in Vermont and to BAM. It was the life `Frida' needed to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the life of ``Band in Berlin'' includes a long Broadway
run remains to be seen. Caught in the middle of a rehearsal week,
Pauley seemed thoughtful. ```Ariadne auf Naxos,''' he said, ``was
easier than this.''

 &HT;    Longtime minister at Peachtree Presbyterian dies
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. W. Frank Harrington, longtime pastor of
Atlanta's Peachtree Presbyterian Church, the country's largest
mainline Presbyterian congregation, died Wednesday at Emory
University Hospital of complications from acute respiratory
distress syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, 63, of Atlanta was admitted to Emory University
Hospital on Jan. 16. He died at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday, and his
family was with him.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service will be at 4 p.m. Sunday at Peachtree
Presbyterian Church. Visitation is 4-8 p.m. Friday at H.M.
Patterson &AMP; Son, Spring Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1971 when his Peachtree pastorate began, Harrington
increased the church's membership fivefold and its annual budget
from $306,000 to $9.4 million, according to church records. He
baptized more than 3,000 infants and about 1,000 adults and
performed nearly 1,000 weddings. And, while garnering many titles
and honors, he built a legacy of ministry to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Harrington was one of the giants of the Presbyterian
Church,'' said the Rev. Edwin Albright, executive presbyter of the
Presbytery of Greater Atlanta, made up of 109 churches in most of
metro Atlanta. ``He was known from coast to coast as a great
preacher, great leader and a person of great inspiration. He is a
great loss to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank is obviously one of the great saints of the church,''
said the Rev. Clifton Kirkpatrick, stated clerk of the 2.6-million
member, Louisville-based Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). ``He has
done remarkable ministry at Peachtree and shared the same good news
throughout the church. He is going to be greatly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   William Franklin Harrington was born May 13, 1935, the son of a
farmer in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. He graduated from
Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C., and from Columbia
Theological Seminary in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was ordained to the ministry in July 1961 and served
as minister of First Presbyterian Church in Hinesville and Fairview
Presbyterian Church in North Augusta, S.C., before taking the
pulpit of Peachtree in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the church rolls grew from about 2,400
members to about 11,882. The growth was largely built on ministries
to single adults and young families.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the church's massive building programs to accommodate
its swelling membership _ including a current $20 million expansion
_ Harrington sometimes joked that neighbors thought of him as ``a
developer in a clerical collar.''
</P>
<P>
   At an interview in 1995 when the church was celebrating its 75th
anniversary, Harrington told writer H.M. Cauley, ``I walk out each
Sunday morning before preaching and think, `Thank God, they came
one more time.' But it's never particularly been my dream to have a
church that was just big. What I did want was a church with a big
heart and a community where people felt cared for and loved. And
when people experience that, they tell others about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was a visible leader in Atlanta's religious
community. A few days before he entered the hospital, he gave the
invocation at the inauguration of Gov. Roy Barnes and Lt. Gov. Mark
Taylor. Harrington, whose church Taylor attends in Atlanta, was
minister to Guy Millner, Barnes' unsuccessful opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In a less pleasant time in the spotlight, Harrington presided
over an Atlanta memorial service for JonBenet Ramsey, the child
beauty queen murdered in her Boulder, Colo., home on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He told mourners at Peachtree Presbyterian not to focus on why
someone would kill the Atlanta-born Little Miss Colorado, but to
remember ``a bright, happy child whose beauty lighted up her
parents' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was co-chairman, with the Rev. Cameron Alexander of
Antioch North Baptist Church, of Atlanta's most recent Billy Graham
crusade in 1994. Graham visited Harrington's church while he was in
town.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington served as chairman of the boards of Westminster
Schools and Presbyterian College and on the boards of trustees at
Oglethorpe University, Queens College in Charlotte, N.C., and
Columbia Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Oldenburg, president of Columbia Theological Seminary
and moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), called
Harrington ``an effective preacher, a caring pastor and an able
administrator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cherished his friendship and admired his leadership at
Peachtree Church and throughout our denomination,'' said Oldenburg.
``No one has given more support to Columbia Seminary and its
president than Frank Harrington.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Harrington's leadership, Peachtree Presbyterian Church
established the Peachtree Chair in Evangelism and Church Growth at
Columbia, and provided funds to build the school's Harrington
Center for Continuing Education and Church Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was a candidate for moderator _ the top elected
office of the denomination _ in 1993, but finished a close second
to the Rev. John M. Fife of Tucson, Ariz. He was known throughout
the denomination as ``an ardent advocate for New Church
Development, for evangelism and for church growth,'' Oldenburg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Harrington's leadership, Peachtree Presbyterian gave
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' to the development of new
churches in metro Atlanta and in other smaller, struggling areas
around the country, said Albright. Within just the last 10 years,
Peachtree contributed to the construction of eight new Presbyterian
churches in metro Atlanta, according to Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington also pushed his church to great involvement with
Habitat for Humanity and was on the board of directors of the
nonprofit organization. Peachtree Presbyterian this month is
completing its 79th Habitat house, more than any other church in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat is only one of many ministries supported by the church.
Some 40 percent of its budget goes to agencies such as the Atlanta
Food Bank, Atlanta Day Shelter for Women and Children and North
Atlanta Senior Services.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was the author of three books, drawing on his studies
and his experience, including successful battles with cancer and
heart problems. His most recent, ``First Comes Faith,'' was
published last year by Westminster John Knox Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the pulpit, he was known for warm, folksy sermons illustrated
with anecdotes from his own life. ``I've never preached a sermon I
didn't need to hear myself,'' he once told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He was acutely aware of the need to nourish his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father once said to me, `It's a great temptation for
preachers to preach more faith than they have,''' he said in 1997.
``I've never forgotten that. Pastors have to constantly make time
for replenishing the springs of their own inner life.''
</P>
<P>
   He read the Bible daily, ``not as a sermon sourcebook but as the
word of God,'' and prayed regularly for anyone who had requested
that he do so.
</P>
<P>
   He also realized that he was the subject of other people's
petitions to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in one place for a long time and that's a great
blessing,'' he said in 1997. ``You become aware that because of
your own journey among people, you're the beneficiary of many
prayers. I feel very comforted by that knowledge. It's been a great
journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Sara Harrington; two daughters,
Victoria Franch of Atlanta and Susan Potter of Shelburne Falls,
Mass.; and three grandchildren.

US, EUROPE LOCKED IN BANANA DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Great nations have been known to skirmish over
land, human rights and lesser causes, such as the right to sell
opium. But over bananas?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a dispute over the fruit prompted the Clinton
administration to announce heavy penalties on a range of imported
European products, which could double the price of Parma ham from
Italy, feta cheese from Greece, Louis Vuitton handbags from France
and 12 other items _ or remove them from store shelves altogether.
</P>
<P>
   While only a tiny fraction of US trade with Europe is affected,
analysts warned that the fight could escalate into a broader war
that tests the ability of a young international body _ the
5-year-old World Trade Organization _ to keep the peace in trade
disputes. ``We're on a dangerous road here that both sides seem to
have embarked on casually,'' said Jeffrey Schott, a trade
specialist at the Institute for International Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the United States nor Europe is a big producer of
bananas, and neither has many jobs tied to the banana trade. And
yet for six years, the banana war has been a preoccupation of top
trade officials.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say the European Union favors bananas from its
former colonies in the Caribbean and Africa, such as Martinique,
the Ivory Coast and Jamaica. They say this cuts into imports from
Latin America, where US distributors operate. An arbitration panel
at the World Trade Organization has ruled in favor of the US
several times.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans answer that they have changed their import
policies to comply with WTO rulings. They say the Clinton
administration is merely pushing for even more advantages for
politically connected US companies, such as Chiquita Brands
International Inc. and Dole Food Co., which grow bananas in Latin
America. Carl H. Lindner, the head of Chiquita, is a major donor to
both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans also put a humanitarian cast on their import
rules, saying that their former colonies are far more dependent on
the banana trade than are the larger nations where Dole and
Chiquita operate. ``Our policy helps these countries subsist,''
said Ella Krucoff, a European Union spokeswoman in Washington.
``Their whole economies are dependent on banana exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, 75 percent of European Union banana imports
come from Latin America. That means the United States is
complaining about rules favoring a mere 25 percent of the imports.
</P>
<P>
   Trade analysts say that bananas are not at the heart of the
case. The real dispute, they say, is the World Trade Organization
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO was created in 1995 during massive negotiations over new
trade rules among 123 nations. It was given powers to hear trade
disputes and to issue binding rulings. Until then, parties in a
trade case could block an arbitrator's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 disputes have been submitted to the WTO, which has
ruled on at least 17 of them. (Many of the other disputes have been
settled or withrawn.) But US officials say the banana dispute is
the first one in which a losing party has refused to abide by the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gotten far beyond bananas,'' said Schott, who
recently wrote a study of the WTO. ``This case calls into question
the credibility of the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO. If
that mechanism is questioned, you could begin an unraveling of the
politcal commitment to the trading system.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate opportunity for conflict could arise, as the European
Union faces a May deadline for adhering to a WTO ruling that it
open its borders to more US beef, Schott said.
</P>
<P>
   But I.M. (Mac) Destler, a trade scholar with the University of
Maryland, said he believed the tariffs announced Wednesday would
provide the political pressure needed to settle the dispute, rather
than escalate it.
</P>
<P>
   Destler said the WTO has often ruled in favor of the United
States. But it has forced the United States to change its import
rules at least once, after a complaint that American standards
unfairly kept Venezuelan gasoline out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the banana dispute, WTO panels ruled for the United States in
1997 and 1998. On Tuesday, the trade group was due to announce the
dollar amount of penalties the US could levy on Euoropean goods.
Instead, it asked for more time and more information to make its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the US Trade Representative announced 100 percent
duties on selected European products, though US officials also said
they would adjust the duty according to how the WTO panel
ultimately rules. In the meantime, importers will have to post a
bond when they move products into the United States to cover the
eventual cost of the tariff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures we are taking today ensure that when the
arbitrators reach their final decision, we will be in the same
position as if they had rendered their final decision Wednesday,''
said Peter Scher, special US trade negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's top negotiator, said the
US action was ``unacceptable and unlawful'' because the WTO had not
sanctioned it. ``Just at the time when we should both be working
toward a settlement, the United States is fanning the flames of
this dispute,'' he said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Because importers must post bonds, prices will rise immediately
on some of the targeted items, especially foods that move quickly
from ship to shelf, said Erik Autor, international trade counsel
for the National Retail Federation. Consumers will not see price
increases for several months on other products, such as linens or
sweaters, because stores restock them slowly, or because they are
currently out of season.
</P>
<P>
   But if the tariffs truly remain in effect, it is even more
likely that Europeans will not ship these products to the United
States at all, Autor said. At twice their current prices, they
could not compete against similar American products.
</P>
<P>
   US trade officials carefully chose which products faced a
tariff. Pointing blame for the dispute at France, they chose a
certain type of plastic handbag produced there. Italy was hit with
tariffs on ham and on cheese, Cashmere sweaters and sweet biscuits
were chosen to hurt the United Kingdom. US officials said they only
chose items that are also made in the United States or in
non-European Union nations, an effort to protect US consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Products from Denmark and Holland were excluded, because US
officials felt those nations had lobbied against the European
banana policy.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of products targeted is $500 million, which US
officials said is roughly equal to what US banana distributors lost
in 1998 because of European import policies.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tiny fraction of the $160 billion in products that the
United States imports annually from European Union nations. But
because the new duties are aimed at particular items, certain
producers will feel pain and presumably bring political pressure on
European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dramatic if not ironic element to this is that the
industries affected have nothing to do with bananas,'' said
Krucoff, the European Union spokeswoman. ``Innocent parties are
always affected in trade war. It's very sad.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six months ago, Steven Spielberg's ``Saving
Private Ryan'' virtually was anointed by Hollywood as the winner of
the Academy Award. How could the 5,500 members of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences vote against one of the most
acclaimed films of Spielberg's career, a searing and patriotic
drama about World War II soldiers, a movie that unexpectedly turned
into a huge box office hit for its studios, Dreamworks and
Paramount?
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the Weinstein brothers, Harvey and Bob. The
co-chairmen of Miramax, the Disney-owned company, the Weinsteins
have proved more successful than any company or studio in town at
gathering Academy Award nominations. In every awards year since
1992, Miramax has been represented in the best picture category
with such movies as ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``The Crying Game'' and ``The
English Patient,'' which won the prize in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year Miramax led all distributors with 23 nominations _
including 13 for the comedy ``Shakespeare in Love'' and seven for
``Life is Beautiful'' (a record for a foreign-language film), a
tragicomedy about a clownish man who struggles to shield his son
from the horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the nominations for the 71st annual Academy Awards
were announced on Feb. 9, the Miramax juggernaut was at work,
spinning journalists and spending lavishly on trade paper
advertisements promoting the films, notably ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' The nominations cemented the belief that ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' a charming romantic comedy, directed by John Madden and
starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, had emerged as the
rival to ``Saving Private Ryan'' for the best picture award. The
awards will be given, for the first time ever on a Sunday evening,
on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   The other best picture candidates are ``Elizabeth,'' ``The Thin
Red Line'' and ``Life is Beautiful'' _ and there is every
possibility that one of these three dark horses could slip in
because of the intense rivalry between the two front-runners, who
could split the votes of Academy members.
</P>
<P>
   This rivalry is unusually intense. Miramax has not only hired a
slew of publicists to pitch newspaper and television stories about
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life is Beautiful''; it is also
outspending every other company with splashy ads and promotion for
the two films in Variety and the Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax went so far as to issue a press release saying that
``Miramax Films is proud to announce that The Vatican has named
`Life is Beautiful' number three on its list of films it regards as
suitable for viewing by the faithful.'' (The first two are
``Schindler's List'' and ``The Gospel According to St. Matthew'').
Miramax went on to say that the list is known as ``the Pope's
Oscars.'' The implication was that the Pope is supporting ``Life is
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with 11 Oscar
nominations, seems to remain the the one to beat as best picture.
``You have to think of the age of the Academy _ they're older, they
like to vote for important films, not comedies,'' said Marvin
Antonowsky, a veteran former studio marketing executive. `` `Ryan'
is an epic; it's patriotic. How do you walk away from that?''
</P>
<P>
   Some Academy members will walk away from the Spielberg film out
of either resentment or jealousy; the director, who already has won
an Oscar for ``Schindler's List,'' is the most successful in film
history.
</P>
<P>
   As to the other nominations the directing category seems to be
heavily in favor of Spielberg over Roberto Benigni for ``Life is
Beautiful,'' John Madden for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Terrence
Malick for ``The Thin Red Line'' and Peter Weir for ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The betting on the best actor category is leaning towards Ian
McKellen for his role as the gay Hollywood film director James
Whale in Bill Condon's ``Gods and Monsters.'' The runner-up seems
to be Nick Nolte, for his brutal performance as a man on the edge
in Paul Schrader's ``Affliction.'' The other candidates are Tom
Hanks for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' who has won two Oscars, Edward
Norton for ``American History X'' (a dark horse) and Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Like political candidates, some of the actors are engaged in
nothing short of a campaign to win votes. Ian McKellen flew into
New York last Monday from Leeds, England, where he's appearing at a
repertory theater. (Not-so-coincidentally, ballots went out last
Tuesday, and the voting deadline is March 16).
</P>
<P>
   McKellen swung into action, with appearances set up by his
handlers on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' ``The Late Show,'' with
David Letterman, Charlie Rose, ``The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central
and several Academy Award specials. Benigni hit the publicity
jackpot, showing up on ``60 Minutes'' last Sunday and ``The Rosie
O'Donnell Show'' as well as being featured on NBC's ``Nightly News
with Tom Brokaw.'' These actors seem to be relishing this rare
moment in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum is Edward Norton. He issued
a statement expressing delight with his nomination on the day it
was announced but has since refused to appear on television shows
or speak to journalists. As to best actress, the two chief
contenders are the Australian actress Cate Blanchett for
``Elizabeth'' and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro for
``Central Station.'' (Ms. Montenegro was flown from Brazil for a
Hollywood blitz of her own just before the Oscar ballots went out.)
The others nominated are Gwyneth Paltrow (``Shakespeare in Love''),
Meryl Streep (``One True Thing'') and the British actress Emily
Watson (``Hilary and Jackie'').
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Dreamworks and other rivals to the Miramax Oscar
machine are dismayed and angry at what they view as a campaign to
oversell ``Shakespeare in Love'' and to raise doubts about ``Saving
Private Ryan'' _ something Miramax denies. (The negative campaign
on ``Ryan'' asserts that after its brutal opening sequence, the
bloodbath at Omaha Beach, the movie turns into a more conventional
World War II drama).
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, said the five
nominated films were the best he had seen in years. As to the
Miramax efforts on behalf of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Weinstein
said: ``It's the same kind of Academy campaign we've always run. I
don't know how to do it differently. There's not that much to do,
to be honest.'' He said ads are purchased and efforts are made to
insure that Academy voters see the movie at least once, maybe
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein pointed out that in the last 14 out of 15 years, the
best picture award has gone to the film with the most nominations _
and ``Shakespeare in Love' has 13 nominations, two more than the
Spielberg epic.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing with `Shakespeare' is that people in the industry
feel it's about them, it's a movie that celebrates writers, actors
and financiers, it's a movie that celebrates what we all do,''
added Weinstein. ``It really resonates.''
</P>
<P>
   But what resonates at Dreamworks is the sense that Miramax is in
overdrive with its plethora of publicists and a seemingly open
checkbook.

HILLARY TALKS _ BUT AVOIDS HINT ABOUT SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is the Democratic pipe dream _ Hillary Rodham Clinton
for Senate _ going up in smoke, just as the fantasy candidate
herself is getting serious?
</P>
<P>
   The first lady delivered an eagerly awaited address here
Wednesday that _ while stopping well short of declaring a run _
amounted to a preview of a campaign stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just hours earlier, a statewide survey, released by the
Marist Institute for Public Opinion, showed Mrs. Clinton in a
statistical dead-heat with her most likely Republican opponent, New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, the Marist poll showed Mrs. Clinton leading
Giuliani, 49-38. Wednesday, however, her edge had been cut to 49-45
_ within the poll's 4 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, the institute's director, said in a phone
interview that many voters who were uncertain two weeks ago _
especially among those who live upstate _ have since moved into
Giuliani's column.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial balloon came back to earth a little bit,'' Miringoff
said. ``She needs to make a transition between celebrity Clinton
and candidate Clinton,'' meaning she will have to start showing up
here a lot more, speaking out on New York issues from a New York
angle. ``No fly-by campaigns here,'' the pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's 35-minute speech at the Plaza Hotel _ before a
sold-out, $150-a-head luncheon of the Democratic National
Committee's Women's Leadership Conference _ could mark the
beginning of that transition.
</P>
<P>
   She started it with a tease. ``I'm told there are some who
thought I might have an announcement to make,'' she said to
laughter. She paused, then said quietly, ``But I don't.'' Many
moaned. ``But,'' she added, ``I do have a lot on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady made it clear that the stresses of this past
scandal-riven year in Washington will not drive her out of some
sort of political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics, in good times and bad times, is the lifeblood of a
democracy,'' she said, reciting specific cases of people she had
met _ many of them during trips to New York _ who have been helped
by policies crafted by her husband's administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot drop out of the political process and leave the
arena to those with very specific agendas,'' she added, leaving it
provocatively ambiguous whether she was talking about her own
situation or merely urging her audience to stay politically
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting some people who want out of politics because they
``don't like the negativity,'' Mrs. Clinton remarked, to
sympathetic laughter, ``I can certainly understand why someone
would feel that way.'' But, she went on, ``somebody's going to make
the decisions'' about a variety of issues _ and ``these are not
decisions we should leave to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues she cited encompassed a whole range of social issues
that President Clinton has laid on the table _ money for more
teachers, a patients' bill of rights, saving Social Security and
Medicare, increasing the minimum wage, the 1992 economics bill that
raised taxes to lower the deficit, and the 1994 crime bill that put
more police on the streets and imposed tighter regulations on
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   If she does run for the Senate, she seemed to be hinting, her
platform would amount to a continuation of Bill Clinton's agenda _
a popular position here.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Charles Schumer, who was greatly helped by the first
lady's campaigning in his own successful election last fall, spoke
before Mrs. Clinton, and warned the crowd not to get too excited by
a possible Senate run by her.
</P>
<P>
   ``One needs to make that decision in a deliberative way, and in
an unfrenzied atmosphere,'' Schumer said. ``So I say to the first
lady, take a little time, think this one through.'' However, he
added, to wild applause, that if she did decide to run, ``you will
be one of the finest senators New York will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 900 Democrats in the audience _ almost all of them
women _ left the event at the Plaza in a buzz of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few men, Peter Vallone, speaker of the New York City
Council, nodded when asked if he thought the speech suggested the
first lady would run for the Senate seat being vacated next year by
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. ``I think she's setting the stage,''
Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton met with several local leaders, including Vallone,
later in the day, and had dinner at the home of financier Roger
Altman, a well-known Democratic donor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the first lady spoke at a middle school in
Queens that has been cited as a model in a new federal report on
arts education. Ironically, that school's arts program was
replenished by a two-year $75 million citywide boost in arts
funding ordered by Giuliani. Among the speakers who preceded Mrs.
Clinton at the auditorium's podium was a mayoral aide who, politely
but pointedly, made that clear.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Giuliani himself, when asked about the first
lady's impending speech at the school, said a bit facetiously that
he would be happy to hear her praise his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wednesday, as if to signal that the race is on, Mrs.
Clinton singled out, as responsible for the school's success, the
Annenberg Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the
New York State government _ but said nothing about City Hall.

JUSTICES RULE SCHOOLS MUST PROVIDE NURSES FOR DISABLED STUDENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that federal law
requires school boards to pay nurses to provide classroom care for
disabled students whose health must be monitored constantly.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court said the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act does not require schools to provide doctors for
severely disabled students who require the continuous care of a
physician.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's ruling that the law includes nursing care was
criticized by the National School Boards Association, which said
the expense of providing nurses will further strain financially
strapped schools. But the Clinton administration and advocates for
the disabled hailed the decision as a giant step in their effort to
ensure that disabled children receive the same level of education
as their able-bodied peers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the IDEA, schools must provide disabled children ``a free
appropriate public education and related services designed to meet
their unique needs.'' But the law does not require schools to
assist students whose disabilities are so severe that they require
``medical services.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 7-2 decision, the high court said the medical-services
exception refers to care that only a doctor can provide. Students
whose needs can be adequately addressed by a nurse are entitled
under the law to receive nursing care in the classroom, the court
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The school boards association said the decision will cost public
schools more than $500 million annually, as it now must provide
continuous nursing care to the approximately 17,000 children
nationwide who depend on the medical assistance while in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worry that school districts will endure a great strain
because of today's decision,'' said Anne Bryant, the association's
executive director. ``It takes the focus of schools away from being
educators and into being medical-service providers. Furthermore,
schools must now assume responsibility for serious life-threatening
conditions, which could lead to greater legal liability.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in several Texas school districts said Wednesday
they do not believe the ruling will have a major impact since their
districts already provide nursing services to physically disabled
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a court case comes about with a ruling, that is
certainly used to look at all other individual cases,'' said Dana
Riley, a special education administrator in the Spring Branch
district in the Houston area. ``But with special education, we have
to look at every child on a child-by-child basis to determine their
needs and in what ways we can provide services.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Edens, a Houston advocate for special education students,
said that case law has long been clear that schools must provide
special education children with necessary personnel to be
successful in the classroom. However, he said, the ruling will
likely have an impact ``in that it gives extra teeth'' to the law.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Education Secretary Judith Heumann said the
court's ruling ``is a very important decision for ... all of
America's disabled children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe disabled students ... should receive the services
necessary to ensure access to an appropriate education. That's what
the law guarantees, and now the courts have made that clear,'' said
Heumann, who is in charge of the department's special education and
rehabilitative services division.
</P>
<P>
   The high court decision marked a win for a quadriplegic
high-school student in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who took the local
school board to court to force it to pay for the continuous health
monitoring he needs. The student, identified in court papers as
Garret F., has normal mental capacity, can speak and uses a
puff-and-sip straw to control his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   But Garret requires constant attention for a variety of health
needs, including regular bladder catheterization; suctioning of his
breathing tube; changing his sitting position; and monitoring his
respiration and blood pressure. Garret suffered his life-altering
injury in 1987 when the then-4-year-old was thrown from a
motorcycle after the blanket he was holding got snarled in the
vehicle's drive mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The jolt jerked Garret's head, severing his spine.
</P>
<P>
   In the litigation over whether the school district should pay
for his care in the classroom, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed with Garret that the nursing assistance he needs
does not qualify as a ``medical service'' under the law. The Cedar
Rapids Community School District _ which pays about $20,000 per
school year for Garret's care _ appealed to the Supreme Court,
arguing that nurses, like doctors, provide critical, continuous
medical services and are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court, agreeing with the 8th Circuit, said the
law's exception for medical services is strictly limited to
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuous services may be more costly and may require
additional school personnel, but they are not thereby more
`medical,''' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
``Whatever its imperfections, a rule that limits the
medical-service exemption to physician services is unquestionably a
reasonable and generally workable interpretation of the statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy
assailed the court for its narrow definition of the law, saying
that school boards should not have to pay for nursing because the
``medical services'' a nurse provides are indistinguishable from
those a doctor performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not typically think that `automotive services' are
limited to those provided by a mechanic, for example,'' Thomas
wrote in a dissenting opinion Kennedy joined. ``Rather, anything
done to repair or service a car, no matter who does the work, is
thought to fall into that category.''

   Terry Press, the marketing chief at Dreamworks who has organized
the Oscar campaign for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' said tartly, ``I'm
running a competitive and respectful campaign.'' With a laugh, she
said, ``My legs are hurting from being on the high road.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the long-time front-runner with ``Saving Private Ryan,''
she said, was not an enviable position. ``When people said it was a
shoo-in for `Ryan,' that's the worst thing that can happen, because
it allows room for an underdog,'' said Ms. Press. ``I cringed every
time someone said it. Shoo-ins exist to be toppled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Press acknowledged that `` `Shakespeare in Love' may have an
advantage in being in current release, making it fresher in the
minds of Academy voters. She added: ``But it is my understanding
that the Academy Award for best picture is supposed to go to the
outstanding achievement in motion picture _ not the most enjoyable
in current release or the easiest to watch twice on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Laura Ziskin, president of Fox 2000, whose studio,
20th Century Fox, released ``The Thin Red Line,'' Terrence Malick's
meditation on war, said: ``Actually, you get numbed by all the
hype. I kind of turn off at some point. Remind me once or twice
about a film and that's fine. Twenty times, it's overkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting question for the Academy is how much of the
best picture award is about box office and ads, and how much of it
is giving an award for artistic achievement,'' Ms. Ziskin said,
clearly pushing hard for the Malick film, which won seven
nominations and which earned about $37 million domestically.
``Saving Private Ryan'' has made more than $203 million at the
domestic box office.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Urman, co-president of Lions Gate Films Releasing,
whose films ``Gods and Monsters,'' and ``Affliction'' earned five
Academy nominations, said he was simply dazzled at the Miramax
approach. ``If we had gone to school anywhere to learn the dark
magic and vodoo of Academy campaigning, we all went to Miramax
University,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made a science and art of Academy campaigning, which
in the past had to do with spending a ton of money,'' said Urman, a
former studio publicist. ``They have customized their campaigns,
film by film, nomination by nomination. They strategize about it;
they add people to their staff just for the awards season. They
don't miss a trick. And there is not a distributor today who plays
the Oscar game who doesn't study what Miramax has done.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Urman's company, a New York-based operation that
he runs with Tom Ortenberg, is the Cinderella candidate of the
Oscar campaign. Their nominations for ``Gods and Monsters'' include
best actor for McKellen, supporting actress for Lynn Redgrave and
adapted screenplay for Bill Condon. The two nominations for
``Affliction'' are for Nolte, as best actor, and James Coburn, as
supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   Urman's company has spent a relatively small amount _ $250,000
each _ to promote the Oscar chances of ``Gods and Monsters'' and
``Affliction.'' By contrast, studios may spend about $4 million for
an overall Academy Award effort, before and after the nominations.
Miramax, by the estimates of rival studio executives, probably will
spend as much as $10 million to promote ``Shakespeare in Love's''
Oscar push, which includes double-page ads in newspapers like The
New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. ``If the campaigns were
just about money and clout, we wouldn't have been nominated at
all,'' Urman said.
</P>
<P>
   For a small company like Lions Gate, the current Oscar season
can be costly. ``One of our greatest expenses has been to receive
the accolades,'' said Urman. ``We have to take out congratulatory
ads in the trade papers. You're frequently required to buy all
sorts of expensive tables and tickets to events in which you're
being honored. You're flying people from one city to another to
receive the awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're nominated for the Golden Globes, you're talking
Concordes and hotel rooms and limousines and tables at great
costs,'' he said. ``So much money goes to showing up and being
proud.'' Urman laughed. ``My wife just bought a fancy dress for the
Oscars,'' he said. ``I'm not complaining. These are the problems
you want.''

LOPSIDED LOSS SHOWS HOW FAR BOSTON COLLEGE HAS TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The end came with neither a bang nor a whimper, but
with a buzzer, which officially concluded not only Boston College's
96-55 loss to Syracuse in Wednesday's opening round Big East
tournament game, but the Eagles' season as well.
</P>
<P>
   For historical purposes only, the loss was the most lopsided in
Big East tournament history, but also gave the Eagles' 21 losses,
the most in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The hard facts will record 6-21, 3-15 in the Big East. Not
pretty numbers. And no one at BC is minimizing how difficult it was
to go through such a season.
</P>
<P>
   But there were few hung heads around the BC locker room
Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. ``We survived,'' said associate
head coach Tim O'Shea with a smile and a shake of his head.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it with their heads held up, the one-sided nature
of the Eagles' loss to Syracuse not withstanding.
</P>
<P>
   That characteristic might have been missing Wednesday, but it
was evident in the latter part of a season that began with people
predicting an 0-fer for the Big East season and, after a
last-second loss to Harvard at home in December, there was even
talk of a total blank for the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (the Harvard game) to me was the low point,'' said BC
athletic director Gene DeFilippo, while watching the Eagles' last
futile effort. ``I felt so bad for (coach) Al (Skinner)and for the
players. I cried coming home that night. I thought that was a game
we were supposed to win. And when we didn't do it, I was wondering
if we were ever going to win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' did sporadically. All six of their wins had to be
called upsets. But they were also showing more signs of a life than
most people would expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't profess to know as much basketball as Al,'' said
DeFilippo. ``But I know I saw two things. I saw a team that was
playing hard and listening to what Al was saying. And that told me
good things were going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you. I'm not happy with what happened.
This hasn't been an easy season. But I've been at places where
programs are rebuilt and you have to be patient. I really think
we're going to get the job here.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Skinner, who just finished the second season of a seven
year contract that he might need all of to get BC basketball back
to the elite status it was approaching two years ago before the
program self destructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, not disheartened,'' said Skinner Wednesday,
walking back through the bowels of the Garden after his final press
conference of the season. ``But what I see encourages me. There
were lots of people out there who didn't give us a chance to win a
game at the start of the season. And the way we were playing they
might have been right.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude the whole year was that we weren't capaple of
beating a lot of teams unless we did a lot of things right. And
most of the season we didn't. But in early January, I started to
see things. I saw an attitude change. We started to get better. We
won three league games. We had a pretty good chance to win a couple
more (Pittsburgh, Georgetown).''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner dismissed Wednesday the way his players did on the
court. Syracuse was a bad matchup for the Eagles and they finished
the game the way they started, lacking any kind of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Skinner stood in the middle of a barren locker
room and told his team two things. That Wednesday's game was not
indicative of the kind of team they were and that next year, if
they wanted to work at it, would be better. Much better.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists out there agree. Next season will bring highly
regarded point guard Troy Bell from Minneapolis and a 6-10 big man
named Andrew Dudley from Bristol, Pa. It will also bring scoring
guard-small forward Xavier Singletary, who is sat out the season
after transferring from Howard.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly it will bring a new attitude of optimism that
has only barely begun to blossom.
</P>
<P>
   When Skinner and his staff arrived two years ago from Rhode
Island, BC basketball was a toxic wasteland, decimated by all the
nonsense involved in the Jim O'Brien/recruiting controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Players left, lines of communications were destroyed. The flow
of talent, which had taken so long to establish, had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, much of that negativity has been washed away. There is
still no cause for celebration in the BC basketball offices.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea and asisstant basketball coach Billy Coen will hit the
the recruiting road starting Thursday

 &HT;    Student survives Hutu attack Uganda
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Several months before University of Chicago
anthropology student Elizabeth Garland left for Uganda, she had
doubts about making the trip because of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, 29, daughter of Miami University President James
Garland, escaped harm Monday by hiding in her tent when Rwandan
Hutu attacked her campsite in southwest Uganda. Four park employees
were killed at the site and eight tourists kidnapped and murdered
in the nearby jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She worried about (traveling there); her advisers worried
about it,'' said Anne Chien, the administrator for graduate student
affairs in the anthropology department at the University of
Chicago, where Garland is a doctoral student.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, four tourists were attacked by Hutu rebels in a
national park in Congo, near where Garland was planning to go to
study the effects of tourism on impoverished African villages.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before, Garland had lined up funding for the trip
through grants, including a Fulbright Scholarship, but put her
plans on hold after news of the attack in Congo, Chien said.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, after discussions with her advisers at the
University of Chicago and others, she decided to go. Fulbright
officials did not pull back its funding, as they have done in the
past when students wish to study in dangerous parts of the world,
Chien said. And the Ugandan national park she would be living in
was considered ``more secure'' than other areas, Chien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone finally came to the conclusion that it was relatively
safe,'' Chien said.
</P>
<P>
   So in early December, Garland left for the Ugandan capital of
Kampala, where she spent the first two months looking through
archives. In February, she set up camp in the village of Buhama on
the edge of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, a national park in
southwest Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Monday's massacre, Garland had sent an e-mail
message to her advisers telling them things were going well, Chien
said. She was building a house and getting settled.
</P>
<P>
   When the rebels attacked the village early Monday morning,
Garland stayed in her tent, which was hidden by bushes, according
to her father. The rebels didn't discover her and she managed to
escape the village unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   She is in Kampala now, according to Chien, and has no immediate
plans to return to the United States. She will however move to a
new location. It was unclear how long she is scheduled to stay in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Chien said she got word that Garland was OK before she learned
what had happened. She immediately sent an e-mail message to
department faculty and then students.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Vogt, a classmate of Garland's, said she couldn't bear to
think of the horror Garland experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the news and I just felt so horrible,'' Vogt said.
``Just her sitting in the tent fearing for her life. Can you
imagine that? It's so horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogt described Garland as ``very positive and happy'' and said
she wasn't surprised her classmate wanted to stay on and complete
her studies in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a strong person with a lot of positive energy,'' Vogt
said. ``She's going to have a great project.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under a campaign-style blue banner, President
Clinton rallied Wednesday with congressional Democrats to show
party unity on a legislative agenda that would reserve more than
three-quarters of federal budget surpluses for Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Vice President Al Gore received standing ovations
from Democrats who protected the president from impeachment but
wanted to censure him for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible''
behavior. Gore and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
who recently gave up plans to challenge Gore for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000, even hugged.
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment over, Democrats and Republicans have quickly
become enmeshed in battles over issues like education and how to
apportion surpluses for tax cutting, spending and the long-term
solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to inoculate themselves against a Democratic assault on
the issue of Social Security, the Republican leaders of Congress
have been working this week to assemble a budget plan that would
segregate Social Security trust funds from the rest of the federal
budget so the money could only be used for the popular retirement
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Wednesday praised Republicans for agreeing to reserve
billions of dollars for Social Security, but said that another 15
percent of the surplus should be put aside for Medicare. This is a
stand that the Democrats hope will allow them to frame the
Republican tax-cutting plans as a raid on the federal health care
program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still strong differences in our approach,'' the
president said in an ornate room in the Library of Congress, ``and
we must resolve them in a way that benefits the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a frieze of ancient warriors carrying back their dead,
Clinton spoke of the Democratic origins of the Great Society
programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do these things _ saving Social Security, saving
Medicare, empowering more Americans to save for their own
retirement,'' he said, ``we will fulfill our historic challenge to
meet the difficulties and the opportunities of the aging of America
in a way that provides a stronger economy and more stable families
for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans countered with their own tax-cutting rally led
by House Majority Leader Dick Armey. The crowd shouted
``Cha-Ching'' _ to imitate the sound of an IRS cash register _ as
the Texas Republican recited all the different ways that a family
is taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., called the surplus the ``overcharge''
and said that with tax cuts, a family could save money ``for a new
home, or money for ballet lessons for your daughter or shots for
the new puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said that Republicans had agreed with Clinton to set aside
62 percent of projected budget surpluses to fix Social Security,
making the real debate over whether to use the remainder of the
surplus to cut taxes or increase government spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the choice is seen that way,'' Armey said, ``the American
people overwhelmingly come out on the side of cutting taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Republicans feuding among themselves over which taxes
to cut, Armey and his fellow Republicans did not showcase any
particular tax cut. Instead they announced plans for town hall
meetings around the nation to promote tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic rally, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota said that one Republican proposal, for a 10 percent
tax cut, would give people who earn $800,000 an annual tax
reduction of $20,000 while families who earn $38,000 or less would
save 27 cents a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe America's families deserve better than 27 cents a
day,'' he said and moved on to highlight other Democratic agenda
items for education and to control health maintenance
organizations. ``They deserve good schools for their children. If
they are sick, they deserve whatever treatment their doctor says
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats Wednesday also called for raising the minimum
wage, putting 50,000 more police on the streets, and for tax
credits devoted to retirement savings, child care and long-term
health care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The competing rallies showed that for all the talk of
bipartisanship in the wake of impeachment, both parties are on a
campaign footing _ not a good sign for legislative achievement. It
was also a telling sign of the mood of Democrats on Capitol Hill
that the most enthusiastic and spontaneous applause came not for
Clinton or Gore, but when Daschle introduced Gephardt as ``the next
speaker of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt urged Democrats to work with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be judged by our progress, our action, our
accomplishment, he said, ``not by our words.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats made clear that they would be happy to
bludgeon the Republicans if they block the Democratic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they reject all of it, they provide the foundation for the
2000 elections,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey,
chairman of the Senate Democratic campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, who is heading
campaign efforts in the House, said, ``We are going to have to
continue to identify Republicans as the party that has put off the
important business of this country for the past year.'' &QL;

ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER BRINGS A TOUCH OF DISDAIN TO U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ On his first vacation as Italy's prime minister, Massimo
D'Alema took his family on a private visit to New York over
Christmas. His children wanted to see the Broadway musical ``Cats''
and FAO Schwarz. D'Alema, a former Communist, wanted to see what
the world's leading superpower has to offer, so he also went to eat
at the TriBeCa Grill, the trendy downtown restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing special,'' he said with a shrug. He then
explained that there are only three cuisines in the world: French,
Italian and Chinese. Italy, he said, was most important because it
had given civilization its first real ``proletarian dish,'' pizza.
Pressed, D'Alema conceded that he had eaten well at one place in
New York, Asia de Cuba a Cuban-Chinese restaurant in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who will turn 50 in April, became the first former
Communist to lead a Western European government in October, and he
underlines the word ``former.'' But even in small talk he retains a
trace of 1970s left-wing hauteur.
</P>
<P>
   When he holds his first official meeting with President Clinton
in Washington on Friday, government officials and ordinary
Americans will get a first-hand look at a prime minister who is
fiercely intelligent, confident and direct.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema is also cold and quite free of easy charm. As he himself
recently confessed to a television talk show host, ``As a child, I
was antipatico,'' using an Italian word that means displeasing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Socialist leaders now in power in Germany, France and
England, D'Alema has distanced himself from the most ideological
extremes of his party and recast himself as a moderate. So far, his
economic and foreign policies have mirrored those of his
predecessor, Romano Prodi, a centrist.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, D'Alema differs from the affable Prodi in background and
personality. D'Alema's churlish assessment of American cuisine,
delivered during an informal chat with foreign journalists in
January, may have also been colored by his mood at that moment. At
the time, the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was in Italy and
seeking political asylum there.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema was under intense pressure from Turkey and the United
States to turn him over for trial in Turkey. The Ocalan affair was
his first real foreign policy test as prime minister, and also his
first taste of how the United States can squeeze an ally.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema refused to extradite Ocalan on the grounds that Italian
law forbids the extradition of prisoners to countries with death
penalties. The United States reacted harshly at first, then backed
off publicly and switched to nagging private diplomacy. Turkey
threatened economic boycotts and worse.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who is sympathetic to the Kurdish cause, initially
suggested Italy might grant Ocalan political asylum. The United
States, Turkey and his many political opponents at home bludgeoned
him for it, and D'Alema began searching for other solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which feared a blowup within its large Turkish and
Kurdish minorities, refused to take him, even though Germany had
outstanding warrants for his arrest. Hopes for an international
trial dried up under Turkey's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Italy finally asked Ocalan to leave in mid-January, and he ended
up under Greek protection in Kenya. Turkish commandos captured him
there, and he is now in a Turkish prison awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who sought a principled approach but eventually had to
bow to realpolitik, views the episode as a learning experience _
but for the United States and Europe, not for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we defend the rights of the Albanians in Kosovo, and
rightly so, then I think we have to also defend the rights of the
Kurdish minority,'' he said in an interview in his office last
week. He said he would raise the issue of Kurdish rights with
Clinton. ``We cannot split up Turkey, but there are other national
issues there which must be addressed by the West, by the United
States and Europe together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign policy is not the most urgent problem on the prime
minister's agenda. D'Alema, who came into office pledging to reduce
Italy's unemployment rate, which in some areas of the south is
about 23 percent, is facing many hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's economy in 1998 showed the slowest growth rate in
Europe: 1.4 percent instead of the 2.5 percent goal the Prodi
government set when Italy agreed to adopt the new European
currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema has made it his mission to reform the chaotic and
chronically unstable Italian electoral system and create a
two-party system. He faces opposition from the conservative right
wing, and even his allies are not exactly on board. This month,
Prodi created his own center-left party, which is likely to further
splinter the left.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema is the first Italian prime minister to hold weekly news
conferences. Yet his relationship with the Italian press is not
exactly cozy. One of his closest aides, Fabrizio Rondolino, his
media adviser, was forced to resign last month after steamy
accounts surfaced of Rondolino's newly published erotic novel.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema accepted his resignation but also attacked the
``vulgarity'' of the Italian media. Italian newspaper columnists
paint D'Alema as arrogant and remote, but they have also attacked
him for recent appearances on popular television shows intended to
warm up his image.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema says the media assaults are the result of his unstinting
honesty. ``Perhaps mistakenly, I have always said what I thought,''
he explained.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alema is also heavily scrutinized for his Communist past.
His parents were Communists and his father was a high-ranking party
official. As a child, D'Alema was sent to Soviet summer camp at
Artek, the Soviet union's most prestigious international
``pioneer'' camp on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   He mostly spoke French to fellow campers, he recalled. ``At the
time, it was the international language of choice.'' ( D'Alema now
studies English during his lunch breaks, in an effort to improve
his communication skills at NATO meetings and summits of the Group
of Seven leading industrial nations).
</P>
<P>
   He was the head of the Young Communist League in the 1970s, and
edited l'Unita, the Communist Party newspaper, from 1988 to 1990.
In 1991, against the backdrop of the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the Italian Communists splintered, and D'Alema left to form a
non-Marxist party, Democrats of the Left. Since then, he has often
denounced the mistakes of Communism, but he gets irritated when
Italian journalists harp on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these gentlemen were to my left, advocating armed
insurrection,'' he said. ``My past is also their past.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, whose trip will be his fourth to the United States,
said he is not anti-American, but he acknowledged that he sees the
United States through the eyes of a left-wing European
intellectual. And that includes a dim view of American popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Benigni fan,'' he said, referring to Italian director
and actor Roberto Benigni, whose Holocaust comedy, ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' won seven Academy Award nominations this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I hope that this time, the Americans will not
betray our hopes and expectations,'' D'Alema said, referring to
Oscar night later this month. But he added that his own
expectations were confounded by the film's popularity with ordinary
Americans. ``I never would have imagined it,'' he said. ``It
improved my image of the United States, the fact that this film
could be successful there, because it is a film that forces one to
think.''

CLINTON JOINS DEMOCRATS IN SUPPORTING `FAMILIES FIRST' PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton joined with Democratic lawmakers
Wednesday in unveiling an ambitious legislative agenda for the
106th Congress, but a Congressional Budget Office report said some
of the proposals would break spending limits set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton and the Democrats said they remain
``united'' behind their ``Families First'' plan to preserve Social
Security by tapping in to the budget surplus, to modernize public
schools, assure access to quality health-care services and provide
targeted tax cuts to help families save for retirement, care for
their children and older relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At a pep rally at the Library of Congress, Clinton told the
lawmakers that the party's agenda, which is basically built around
his 1999 budget proposal and issues the Democrats have long
supported, would ``bring opportunity to every American'' by
building on the economic progress of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is working again,'' Clinton said, borrowing a line
from Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``The question is,
what shall we do? And we're here to say that as proud as we are of
the record of the last six years, this is not a time to boast about
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehashing some of the proposals he laid out in his January State
of the Union address, Clinton issued a long wish list of spending
priorities coupled with limited, specifically targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the life of the Social Security and Medicare programs
is at the top of both parties' agendas this year. Clinton and the
Democrats would like to devote at least 62 percent of the budget
surpluses over the next 10 to 15 years _ an estimated $2.8 trillion
_ to help guarantee the soundness of Social Security for at least
the next 55 years. They also want to take at least 15 percent of
the surpluses _ some $686 billion _ to keep the Medicare program
solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans agree with the idea of setting aside up to 62
percent of the surpluses for Social Security, but have not yet
signed on to the proposal that surplus money also be used to shore
up the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton rallied with his Democratic colleagues, Congress's
chief budget analyst was warning the Senate Budget Committee that
the president's 2000 budget proposal could bust next year's
spending caps by some $30 billion, primarily because of increases
he wants in education, defense, health care and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contends that increased cigarette taxes and other
revenues would be more than enough to pay for the spending
increases. But Dan Crippen, director of the nonpartisan CBO, said
the revenues could not be counted as offsets under current budget
law.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO also criticized Republican spending plans, including one
that would increase education funding by up to 40 percent and raise
defense spending by billions more than even the Pentagon has
sought.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO has also questioned both the Democratic and Republican
proposals to use the biggest chunk of projected surpluses to help
preserve the Social Security program. Crippen noted Wednesday that
the plan could leave both sides short of the money they need to pay
for the big tax cuts and spending increases they are promising.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security was a big topic elsewhere on Capitol Hill
Wednesday. The administration defended its proposal to a House Ways
and Means subcommittee, particularly a controversial element that
would have the federal government invest part of the retirement
funds in the private market.

   In his testimony, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
answered criticism that such large-scale government investment
would be susceptible to political meddling that could interfere
with the investments' performance. Summers said the administration
envisioned setting up an independent board, insulated from
political pressure, to make investment decisions.

   The Democratic rally unfolded as congressional Republicans were
trying to hammer together their own legislative priorities for this
year. Like the Democrats, they hope to focus their efforts on
Social Security, education defense increases and tax cuts. But they
still have significant disagreements among themselves about how to
achieve those goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic event was designed to show the party is united
behind one agenda, unlike the GOP at the moment. Rep. Gene Green,
D-Texas, said that despite Clinton's troubles, he and other
Democratic lawmakers were ``proud'' to stand with him behind a plan
that Green says will address ``real problems affecting Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is intended to help our families prepare for retirement,
educate their children and raise them in a safe neighborhoods, and
have access to quality, affordable health care,'' Green said.

&HT;        TIMONEY TOUTS CITY'S COMPUTER CRIME SYSTEM AS NATIONAL
MODEL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, March 3, -- Philadelphia Police Commissioner John
Timoney urged a congressional panel to set up a nationwide
computerized crime mapping and tracking system modeled after his
department's program.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said Wednesday that if police departments all over the
country had the same technology, it would help departments share
data, and coordinate their actions in solving regional crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange of information between departments becomes a
laborious and expensive undertaking that is only worth doing in
exceptional circumstances,'' Timoney said. ``If all these
departments shared data, the transfer of crime information
electronically would require nothing more than the press of a
button.''
</P>
<P>
   Timoney, who testified at a House Committee on Government Reform
hearing examining how local officials find solutions to problems
that are common to many cities, said there should be national
technology standards for police departments.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting up the Philadelphia police department's
``COMPSTAT,'' program, Timoney had served in the top ranks of New
York City's police department, when it was the first to use the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enabling police departments around the country to share data
... is too important a goal to be left to voluntary action at the
local level,'' Timoney said.
</P>
<P>
   COMPSTAT tracks crime statistics including the locations of
burglaries or stolen cars, and maps them out to help officers spot
trends.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia department uses the program at weekly meetings,
when commanders in each district discuss with top officers the
crimes they are working on, Timoney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps involve the higher-ups like myself with officers as
they plan strategies and solve crimes,'' Timoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said police departments in Bucks, Montgomery, Chester
and Delaware counties will be working with him to set up their own
programs, which would help officers solve crime in the Greater
Philadelphia area.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the panel were Mayor Rudy Giuliani who spoke about how
New York City lowered its crime rate, and Harry Shorstein, the
state attorney from Jacksonville, Florida, who touted his city's
crackdown on juvenile crime.

 &HT;    Hezbollah turns to PR to fight off terroristic image
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ As we ambled around a mountain village in south
Lebanon, our Lebanese translator attempted a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to an Israeli encampment on a hill nearby, he suggested
that the two journalists in our little group take the lead.
Otherwise, he quipped, the Israelis might spot our Hezbollah guide
and open fire.
</P>
<P>
   But our guide, Samir Alami, hardly looked like a target in a
guerrilla war. Clean-cut in his slacks and sweater, he was the
best-dressed of our bunch. And, he was working his cellular
telephone as any good PR man does.
</P>
<P>
   He works in the Hezbollah press office, and he is trying to
spruce up the Party of God's image in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Hezbollah killed seven Israelis, including a
brigadier general, their press machine was in high gear. They
displayed captured Israeli equipment, held news conferences and
released battlefield video.
</P>
<P>
   That was no surprise. Traveling in Lebanon, I found a Hezbollah
that has gone from kidnapping journalists to simply ``spinning''
them.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah was born in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon and took
over the 9-mile strip of that neighboring country's southern border
that it still occupies today. It was a radical offshoot of Amal, a
Shiite Muslim movement. And Iranian financing has kept it going
strong and constantly updating its warfare.
</P>
<P>
   It's a group on the hinge of world opinion. The Israelis and the
United States consider the guerrillas terrorists, but the United
Nations calls them by the more neutral name, ``resistance'' forces.
In Lebanon, Hezbollah's fighters are considered heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah is not only a militant organization. It also does
charity work. It operates nine schools, three hospitals and 13
dental clinics. It provides drinking water to Beirut slums and
rebuilds roads and houses destroyed in fighting in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Hezbollah collection boxes, painted like the Dome of the
Rock mosque in Jerusalem, stand outside many stores in downtown
Beirut, Lebanon's capital city. In Baalbek, a tourist town where
Hezbollah dominates, shops sell desktop Hezbollah flags. Several
party members serve in Lebanon's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   When I arranged a trip to south Lebanon, the confirmation came
as I sat in a dingy Beirut office with a Hezbollah sheikh, who was
sporting a burgundy blazer and tasseled loafers. He copied my
passport and asked about the circulation of newspapers I write for.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave me glossy propaganda pamphlets. One showed e-mail
messages to Hezbollah's Internet home page.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, a guide met me at a specified cafe. He
eventually took me to an unmarked office above a perfume shop in
the port city of Tyre. It's one of the safe houses Hezbollah
maintains for meeting outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the Americans will stop hating us,'' said Sheik Nabil
Kaouk, Hezbollah's leader for southern Lebanon. ``We are dying from
American weapons (used by Israelis) and they don't feel guilty
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaouk, a tall 35-year-old, cuts an elegant figure in the brown
cape and turban-like headgear of Shiite Muslim clerics. He spoke
politely while aides served strawberry juice.
</P>
<P>
   We covered politics and Hezbollah history. When questioned about
his family, Kaouk talked about a son who was getting married. But
then _ because he is an occasional target of Israeli assassination
attempts _ he got edgy and said we should not be discussing his
family.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him why Hezbollah now meets with journalists rather
than kidnapping them, Kaouk denied that Hezbollah staged
kidnappings. Those denials are widely refuted by experts.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaouk said that just shows how Israel's supporters have
tarnished Hezbollah's reputation around the world. He asked me to
write what I had seen and added, ``Thank you for coming here.

U.S. IMPOSES TARIFFS ON EUROPEAN GOODS; A BAN ON THE CONCORDE
THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: This story was budgeted earlier as BANANA-TRADE) 
(fe) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States escalated two politically
contentious trade disputes with Europe on Wednesday, imposing 100
percent tariffs on $520 million in European products and
threatening to ban Europe's supersonic pride, the Concorde, from
landing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The tariffs imposed by the Clinton administration essentially
double the price of such goods as Louis Vuitton handbags, Parma
hams, pecorino cheese and Scottish cashmere sweaters. They are part
of a six-year battle over trade in bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to ban the Concorde was in a bill passed
overwhelmingly on Wednesday in the House of Representatives. It is
in retaliation for a European ruling that would ban many older
American airplanes from landing in Europe. American officials
contend Europe's restriction is intended to promote the sale of new
engines and aircraft made by European manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But both battles are really about the serious tensions that have
erupted between the United States and a Europe newly unified by a
common currency. On both continents, politicians are feeling the
heat from slowing exports and fear a slowdown in economic growth
later this year. And, increasingly, Washington and the European
Union have found themselves unable to resolve seemingly ordinary
economic disputes, with each accusing the other of defying the
World Trade Organization, the four-year-old court of international
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The trade court has stepped in to arbitrate the banana dispute
and has become the battleground for other politically sensitive
issues, including Europe's ban on imported beef from cattle raised
with hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments have resulted in some of the nastiest
trans-Atlantic bickering in years. Wednesday afternoon, American
officials said they hoped that the imposition of the 100 percent
tariffs on European luxury goods _ with the notable exception of
wine and Mercedes Benz cars _ would ``freeze trade'' in those items
and compel the Europeans to negotiate. In response, Europe's top
trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, called the U.S. action
``unacceptable and unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the arguments particularly strange is the fact that
the underlying dispute seems relatively trivial. ``It's hard to
believe,'' one American official mused on Wednesday, ``that we got
to this by arguing over bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade fights with Europe have become a major issue at the
White House, with President Clinton becoming directly involved in
some of the negotiations, most recently with President Jacques
Chirac of France. But the economic impact is relatively modest: The
United States imported $176.3 billion in goods from nations in the
European Union last year, meaning that Wednesday's sanctions apply
to one-quarter of 1 percent of goods imported from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But in trade, as in politics, symbolism counts for more than
statistics. And the symbolism of Wednesday's actions are clear: the
United States is showing that it intends to retaliate if it
believes Europe is manipulating trade rules to keep out
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane battle, like the beef-hormone dispute, is a prime
example of how one continent's environmental and health regulations
are another continent's trade barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament recently passed legislation banning the
takeoff or landing of older airplanes even if their engines have
been retrofitted with devices called ``hush kits'' that cut down on
airplane noise. European officials say that even planes equipped
with the hush kits _ which are also required here to bring older
planes into compliance with international noise-reduction standards
_ make more noise than newer planes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who sponsored the measure to ban
the Concorde flights, calls the rule ``a thinly veiled attempt to
give a competitive advantage'' to the European aircraft consortium,
Airbus Industries, and European engine makers that would benefit if
airlines are forced to buy new engines.
</P>
<P>
   If the ban were actually carried out by the transport ministers
of the European nations, it would drastically lower the value of
about 1,000 planes now in operation. Newer planes, equipped with
quieter engines, are unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   The full House approved the ban on Concorde by a voice vote on
Wednesday, after several members noted that the supersonic plane
violates American noise limitations and flies because of a waiver
of those rules. There are only 12 Concorde aircraft now flying, and
the only aircraft that come into the United States operate between
Kennedy International Airport and London and Paris. They are flown
by British Airways and Air France; both airlines called on
Wednesday for the United States and Europe to settle their
differences at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   That may yet happen. But clearly the House action was intended
to give the Clinton administration more leverage in its talks.

</P>
<P>
   The banana dispute is deeply steeped in American politics. While
the government is acting on behalf of the Dole Food Co. and
Chiquita Brands International, neither company grows or picks
bananas in the United States. Almost all of their bananas are grown
in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has imposed an enormously complex ``banana regime'' that
places quotas on the import of Latin American bananas, to benefit
former European colonies, many in the Caribbean. The WTO has struck
down the quota system several times. In each case, American
officials charge, Europe has made minor modifications to the rules
that essentially kept the trade barrier in place and insisted that
if the United States was unhappy it should litigate the issue all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   So in December the administration warned it was preparing to
retaliate, publishing a list of goods whose wholesale price would
be doubled. It includes Louis Vuitton handbags and pecorino, a
hard, sharp Italian cheese, ``in original loaves, not suitable for
grating.'' European-made cotton bed linens are subject to the huge
tariffs, along with cashmere ``sweaters, pullovers, sweat shirts,
waistcoats and similar articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe insists that the administration is acting on behalf of
Carl Lindner, who controls Chiquita and has close connections to
both political parties. And they note that few if any American jobs
are at stake in the banana trade. Earlier this week the WTO said it
needed more time to determine whether the United States threat of
$500 million in sanctions was proportionate to the injury Europe
was causing with its quota system.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States did not wait and insisted that the Customs
Service apply the sanctions on Wednesday with the understanding
that the tariffs will be lowered retroactively if the WTO reduces
the amount. Ambassador Peter Scher, who heads up agricultural talks
for the U.S. trade representative's office, said that the ``real
issue is whether Europe is prepared to obey the WTO's rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It is becoming more and more difficult for the
commission to solve problems. We are very close to losing support
for the WTO as a viable means to solve trade problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittan said in a statement that the United States ``has today
decided to defy the WTO system by introducing a form of sanctions
which has no WTO authorization whatsoever. The U.S. action is a
measure designed to have an immediate effect on European exports.
The arbitrators yesterday made it clear that they were in no way
authorizing such action, by stating expressly that they were not
ready for the moment to take a decision on the American request.''

   VELIKA HOCA, Yugoslavia _ The whole village turned out, some 300
people gathered on the hillside beside a small 12th-century Serbian
Orthodox chapel. They were burying a villager, a man of 42, who was
kidnapped Saturday and handed back dead a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Peasant women in homespun aprons and head scarves, and men,
mostly farmers, their hands in their pockets, climbed the mud track
and stood among the graves in the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrivoje Savalic was a victim of a sinister trend in the war in
Kosovo. While Serbian forces and guerrillas of the Kosovo
Liberation Army are engaged in a series of clashes around the
province, there is a less obvious war in which people disappear, or
are killed stealthily, often at night and often close to home.
</P>
<P>
   The killings are almost always unexplained, but most seem to be
score-settling or revenge attacks between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians. The district around this Serbian village in southwestern
Kosovo has seen almost one killing each day in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are criminal acts of murder,'' said one international
monitor working in the region. ``Eight people were killed in as
many days. You cannot attribute the murders to either side; they
are just dead bodies on the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Savalic, a father of three, had gone with his brother just
beyond the village to chop wood. They were kidnapped by armed men
and beaten, according to villagers. Three days later they were
handed back _ Dobrivoje Savalic dead and his brother, Novika, badly
injured.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who the kidnappers were, but they were almost
certainly ethnic Albanians. International monitors from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe arranged the
return of the beaten man and his brother's body through members of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, who were apparently very embarrassed by
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt in the minds of the residents of Velika Hoca
as to who was guilty. Emotions spilled over inside the tiny chapel,
as mourners brushed by the centuries-old frescos on the walls to
lay flowers on the open coffin and kiss the body. Men wept, and the
dead man's father collapsed outside on the grass, overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to say farewell to Dobrivoje, killed by terrorists.
His death renews all our memories of kidnapped relatives and
friends of the past months,'' a mourner said in a speech over the
open grave. ``They want to empty Kosovo of all Serbs,'' he went on.
``Nothing is safe from the terrorists, not family nor children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian authorities, and almost all Serbs in the
ethnic-Albanian-dominated province, describe the guerrillas as
terrorists. Velika Hoca, and the neighboring village of Zociste,
are purely Serbian communities, lying in an area controlled by the
rebels. Wooded hills rise up around the village and the villagers
say they are trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police patrols visit the village regularly and a police
armored vehicle guarded the road during the funeral. But most of
the time the villagers are left to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Hoca, beyond what you can see, there is no more
freedom anymore. That was the point of my speech. They went out of
this cradle and look what happened,'' said the Rev. Milenko
Dragicevic, the Orthodox priest who gave a graveside sermon. After
the service, Dragicevic spoke of the troubles racking his
community.
</P>
<P>
   The Savalic brothers were not the first to disappear, he said.
Two villagers who disappeared nine months ago are still missing,
and in all, he knew of 40 cases of missing Serbs since the war
began a year ago. Estimates for missing ethnic Albanians range from
dozens to hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners in Velika Hoca were five Serbian women,
refugees from the nearby village of Retimnje. They said they had
been forced at gunpoint to leave their homes one night last July.
The men were separated from the women and were marched into the
woods. Since that night, the 16 Serbian men taken have not been
seen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know if they are alive or dead,'' said Petra Costic,
who lost two sons that night. ``We just want to know what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Serbs in Kosovo represent only 10 percent of the
population, and despite the heavy presence of the Yugoslav Army and
of police, the village communities feel at risk. They invariably
express a determination to stay on in their ancient villages where
their ancestors are buried, but their determination is a mixture of
aggression and fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never thought of leaving,'' said Mrs. Costic. ``I am
not a politician. I do not know these things. I am just a mother
fighting to know if my sons are alive or dead.''

<P>
   It's now rife with infighting and internal splits, movements to
push the party forward and movements to return it to its more
glorious past. Depending on who is talking, these forces may either
rip the party apart or provide the creative impetus necessary to
take it into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, the 70th anniversary is a heavyweight. The PRI is
painted as exhausted, incapable of change,'' said Sergio Martinez,
director of the Colosio Foundation, the party's think tank. ``We
have to stress the historical balance of the party's achievements,
the positive electoral results of 1998, and show we're ready for
the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The 70th anniversary is special because it comes in what must
certainly rank as one of the most important years in the PRI's
political life.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the party will select a candidate for the
presidential race in 2000, the first in which it has a real chance
of losing. It will also be the first time in memory when the
party's candidate won't be chosen personally by the sitting
president.
</P>
<P>
   That combination of uncertainty both inside the party and out
has opened rifts that long lay underneath the PRI's public show of
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to changes in electoral laws in the early 1990s, the party
sat atop a virtual political monopoly, compared by some analysts to
the dominance enjoyed by the Communist Party in its heyday in the
Soviet Union. Under the PRI's big tent, just about every important
sector, and every ideological stripe, were included: peasants and
students, businessmen and unions, leftists, rightists and
centrists.
</P>
<P>
   That grip eased when the political system opened through a
series of reforms that the PRI itself enacted under former
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the current president,
Ernesto Zedillo. In 1982, the party held 91 percent of all elected
posts in the country from the presidency down to local mayors. That
fell to 62 percent by 1994 and 54 percent by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a more distinct political profile has antagonized
the divide between party traditionalists _ known in Mexico as the
dinosaurs _ and the technocrats, the outward-looking, mostly
foreign-trained bureaucrats who now control the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, they've needed each other,'' said Federico
Esteves, a political scientist in Mexico City. ``The technocrats
know how to run the economy, and the dinosaurs know how to win
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been tensions. Now, they've just become more
open.''
</P>
<P>
   While the party has yet to decide the actual process for
choosing a candidate, the two factions are already lining up behind
the men most likely to carry their banners. And the possibility
looms of a nasty, factional fight erupting in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of whether the fight within the PRI could
conceivably turn into the worst possible scenario for them _ that
is, break the party apart if the losers leave _ is the heart of a
debate that's been going on within the party over the last few
months,'' Esteves said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Bartlett has emerged as the old guard's candidate of
choice. One of Mexico's most seasoned politicians, Bartlett is both
eloquent and soft-spoken. He was also identified by two witnesses
testifying in a U.S. court as present during the torture and murder
of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
officer killed in Mexico in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett has repeatedly denied the charge, and can point to
letters from three former U.S. ambassadors to Mexico that attest to
his character. But as Mexico's interior minister from 1983 to 1988,
he was responsible for the country's now-defunct secret police that
U.S. law enforcers said worked hand in glove with drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   While many Mexicans see Bartlett as a reminder of the PRI's dark
past, others see him as the politician most capable of restoring
the party's greatness. He stresses the party's successes in leading
Mexico into the modern age, and says the PRI needs to return to its
populist roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that governments are for politicians, not for
specialists,`` Bartlett has said. ``This is at the core of the
discussion in Mexico now: Who is going to be the next president? I
say we need a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's technocrats are closing ranks behind Mexico's
current Interior Minister, Francisco Labastida, who is said to be
Zedillo's favorite. Like Zedillo and Salinas before him, Labastida
is a university-trained economist.
</P>
<P>
   Although less charismatic than Bartlett, he has the advantage of
being backed by the party leadership. ``Labastida has fairly good
regional support and the backing of the president,'' Esteves said.
``He's already the front-runner,'' even before officially
announcing his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are speculating that the party may use the
anniversary to announce the method of choosing its presidential
candidate. The options under debate range from convening a
nominating convention of party stalwarts to holding a national
primary open to all candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential for a messy year, nobody is counting the
PRI out. Even suffering through a sagging economy and a series of
scandals, the party can rely on an enormous organizational base. It
won seven of 10 state governorships in elections last year and
consistently leads both main opposition parties in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI still has a strong plurality increasingly based on the
votes of the poor and the uneducated,'' said Carlos Elizondo, a
writer and political analyst. ``The worst off of all still live in
the old Mexico, in terms of access to information.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many interpret as an unexpected birthday present, the
main opposition parties _ the left-of-center Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, and its right-of-center rival, the National Action
Party, or PAN _ announced earlier this week that they would
consider a proposal to offer a joint presidential candidate in the
2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   While it carries potential dangers for the PRI, the proposal
nonetheless suggests that the party's two major opponents believe
they can't unseat it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Elizondo said, ``the two opposition parties are
much less optimistic. They are starting to realize that the PRI
could actually win.'' &QL;

 By DEREK REVERON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Latin America's pay television has traditionally thrived on U.S.
movies, sports, cartoons and a lot of reruns. Viewers were
perenially Perdido en el Espacio (Lost in Space) or visiting Los
Picapiedra (The Flintstones) and Los Locos Adams (The Adam's
Family). Now, however, a cadre of Miami-based pay television
networks are transmitting a growing volume and variety of original
programming to boost ratings in the region.
 &HT;    Over the last six years or so, more than 30 networks have opened
Latin American operations in the Miami area. They have staked a
claim in the region's fledgling, but promising, cable television
market and, in doing so, have stepped up efforts to produce shows
that reflect Latin cultures and tastes.
 &HT;    Pay television _ delivered by cable or satellite _ reaches about
a tenth of Latin American's more than 150 million households.
However, the industry is growing fast, with the number of
subscribers forecast to reach 38 million over the next five years,
according to the Strategis research group. Currently, Argentina and
Mexico are the region's largest cable markets, but Brazil is coming
on fast.
 &HT;    Brazil has been passing laws to allow the expansion of its cable
system and U.S. pay TV channels are cranking out Portuguese feeds
to the nation. ``Sooner or later, Brazil will become the biggest
cable market in Latin America, if the economy keeps holding and
there are no major setbacks,'' says Luis Peraza, senior vice
president of programming and production for U.S.-based Cisneros
Television Group. CTG, a major player in Latin America, is a
subsidiary of the Cisneros Group of Companies, a privately held
Venezuelan conglomerate.
 &HT;    Cable companies are flocking to Miami because it is located near
Latin America and has a large pool of Spanish-speaking talent. More
importantly, the city has a fast-growing cable industry
infrastructure aimed at Latin America. There are an increasing
number of casting outfits, production facilities, media buyers and
broadcasting companies.
 &HT;    In the early 1990s, the Latin American cable industry barely
existed. Now, programmers in the Miami area alone account for more
than US$600 million in annual revenues, according to Miami-Dade
County officials. GlobeCast North America, a provider of satellite
services, reflects the growth. In l997, the company distributed 17
cable networks to Latin America. By the end of l998, it had nearly
doubled its customer base. The company, a subsidiary of
telecommunications giant France Telecom, is investing $18 million
over the next three years to expand operations and recently bought
an 85,000 square foot building and six acres of land that will more
than double its operations.
 &HT;    U.S-based TransAmerica Media Group, which buys advertising space
in Spanish-language media, says its revenues from Latin American
billing doubles annually thanks in part to the region's exploding
cable TV industry. ``Miami is where deals are put together,'' says
Trans-America Chief Executive Officer Jose del Cueto. ``The cable
operators are here. The signal providers are here, and hundreds of
companies who are potential cable advertisers are here.''
 &HT;    Programming cornucopia. U.S. pay TV networks have only just
begun their mission of filling Latin America with the kind of
programming variety that exists in the United States. ``There's
more niche marketing and targeting of audience segments going on
now [in Latin America,'' says Robert Behar, chief executive of
GlobeCast North America. ``You now have specialty channels, music
channels, sports channels, racing channels, movie channels,
documentaries, travel and news. It's evolving almost the way the
U.S. market did.''
 &HT;    Cable companies hope to attract viewers partly by appealing to
cultural sensibilities. U.S. cable executives say that Latin
Americans clamor for more programming that reflects their reality.
``In Mexico, cable operators and distributors say we don't transmit
enough Mexican product. In Argentina and Chile they say the same
thing,'' says Yolanda Ramirez Foster, vice president of programming
at GEMS International Television.
 &HT;    GEMS, which targets Latin women, is increasing its original
programming by about 10 percent this year. Consulte a Su Doctor, a
new call-in medical show, will feature medical professionals from
varying Latin American backgrounds.
 &HT;    Venezuelan-owned CTG plans to expand the number of its channels
from eight to 11 over the next year. The company currently produces
about 5 percent of its own programs, but expects to increase that
substantially as well. CTG is developing original novelas (soap
operas), sitcoms and drama series, the bulk of which it will
produce in Miami. The company also will create shows for its joint
venture with Playboy that will feature talent from across the
region.
 &HT;    Discovery Networks Latin America/Iberia says that 1999 will be
its most aggressive year yet for original programming, which
currently accounts for about one tenth of all shows. The U.S.
broadcaster will produce its first hour-long documentaries
specifically for Latin America. Some of Discovery's new hour-long
shows will explore Mexican colonial history, mark the 500th
anniversary of the discovery of Brazil, and discuss how Latin
Americans are fighting the Year 2000 computer problem. Additional
shows will feature Latin American architecture, famous houses and
their current and former occupants. Other networks are following
suit. The host of cable companies aggressively targeting the region
includes MTV, Sony TV, HBO, Nickelodeon, USA Network, the Weather
Channel, the Travel Channel, music video station HTV and QVC
shopping network.
 &HT;    Limits to local. There is a limit to how much original,
culturally sensitive programming cable operators can afford to
provide due to high production and broadcast costs. That's why
companies try to strike a balance between targeting Latin America
as a region and appealing to certain countries, notably the biggest
cable markets of Argentina and Mexico. They also try to split costs
between the region and the U.S. Hispanic market. GEMS, for
instance, has four feeds: Argentina, Mexico, the rest of Latin
America and the United States. The station plans to launch a
Portuguese-language feed to Brazil this year. Every day, each
region receives the same blocks of programming, but GEMS varies the
content within each daily block. Menu del Dia, a cooking show,
might feature Argentine cuisine one day and Colombian food the next
day. Consulte a Su Doctor might have a Peruvian pediatrician and a
Mexican gynecologist on back-to-back days. Perspectivas, a talk
show produced in Los Angeles, features regional variety every day,
since its three hosts are from Argentina, Mexico and Spain,
respectively. ``We aim to give our shows an international feel,''
says Ramirez Foster. ``We take that approach, as opposed to having
30 feeds to satisfy everybody in Latin America. We focus on the
things that women have in common, like fashion, home improvement
and issues important to them, such as health.''
 &HT;    Historical and cultural cable channels perhaps feel the greatest
urgency to produce programs that reflect Latin America. ``We try
very hard to take into account our audiences' sensitivities,'' says
Rick Rodriguez, vice president of programming for Discovery
Networks Latin America/Iberia. ``Neutral Spanish doesn't work for
these programs.'' When Discovery carried live coverage of the
Titanic shipwreck dive, simultaneous Spanish and Portuguese
translators kept up with the show's English-speaking host the best
they could. But for rebroadcasts of the special, Discovery dubbed
more thoughtful translations in a number of Latin American
dialects.
 &HT;    Sometimes shows based on one aspect of a specific Latin American
culture have regional appeal. Take, for instance, Cisneros
Television Group's version of the animated series Dr. Katz series.
 &HT;    In the Comedy Central channel's English-language version, Dr.
Katz is a New York psychiatrist who treats famous U.S. patients. On
CTG, he is an Argentine psychiatrist who treats Latin American
celebrities; one, for instance, is a Venezuelan Miss Universe.
CTG's Dr. Katz is a humorous takeoff on the stereotype throughout
Latin America that Argentines have a fascination with
psychotherapy, says CTG's Peraza.
 &HT;    Playing on stereotypes doesn't always work. With South Park, an
irreverent animated spoof of growing up somewhere in the U.S.
Rockies, CTG first experimented with using Mexican expressions and
slang. Executives later decided that approach wouldn't help the
show's edgy sarcasm to appeal across Latin America. CTG settled on
neutral Spanish accents to help Latin Americans perceive the show
as a peculiarly kooky U.S. take on childhood.
 &HT;    While cable programmers believe that culturally sensitive
programming will draw more subscribers, they aren't absolutely
sure. Latin America has a formal, standardized ratings system for
pay TV, but audiences measured are so small that it is hard to
judge the true impact of programming. ``We still haven't seen a
correlation in terms of ratings, but they are so immature in this
market that you can't draw much information from them,'' notes
Rodriguez. ``But from what I see in terms of press coverage,
additional advertising and anecdotal feedback about these shows,
they tend to have the viewers' interest.''

<P>
   The medical benefits of circumcision are not compelling enough
to warrant recommending it as a routine procedure for newborn baby
boys, the American Academy of Pediatrics concludes in a new policy
statement released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors say parents should discuss the risks and benefits of
circumcision with their pediatrician and then make an informed
decision about what is in the best interest of their child.
</P>
<P>
   And, they say, if parents decide to circumcise their infant, it
is essential that pain relief be provided. The surgery is often
done without anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   The AAP's task force on circumcision reviewed 40 years of
medical research on the benefits and risks before deciding that the
benefits are not significant enough to make it routine, according
to the policy statement, published in this month's edition of
``Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER HEALTHY
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, butternut squash, lean beef and spinach may not be your
child's idea of a super meal, but researchers at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas say the supernutrients
found in those foods provide a great foundation for pediatric good
health.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin A, iron, omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid are
essential nutrients for growing children, says Dr. Robert Squires
Jr., associate professor of pediatrics at Southwestern.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends that parents seek out foods high in those
nutrients and consider new ways to make them more appetizing to
children.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a child who turns up his nose at a bowl of spinach
might love spinach pizza.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Durante muchos anos, las regulaciones gubernamentales y la falta
de tecnologia limitaron a los televidentes latinoamericanos del
cable a sus programas locales y a retransmisiones de viejos
programas norteamericanos. Pero ahora, un creciente grupo de
cadenas de television por cable con sede en Miami transforma la
television latinoamericana al ofrecer un gran volumen y variedad de
programas a la region.
 &HT;    En los seis ultimos anos, mas de 30 cadenas han iniciado desde
Miami sus operaciones latinoamericanas. Buscan una participacion en
este nuevo y prometedor mercado, para lo cual han decidido producir
programas que reflejen las culturas y los gustos de America Latina.
 &HT;    La TV por cable llega a unos 15 millones de los mas de 150
millones de nucleos familiares latinoamericanos. Sin embargo, el
sector crece a un ritmo del 20 por ciento anual, y los expertos
pronostican que unos 20 millones de nucleos familiares tendran
cable en el 2000. Actualmente, Mexico y Argentina son los mayores
mercados de la region, pero Brasil se acerca a toda velocidad.
 &HT;    En los ultimos anos, Brasil ha aprobado leyes para permitir la
expansion de su sistema de cable y las firmas estadounidenses del
sector envian cada vez mas programas a ese pais. ``Tarde o
temprano, Brasil se convertira en el mayor mercado de TV por cable
en America Latina, si la economia se mantiene y no hay mayores
contratiempos,'' dice Luis Peraza, vicepresidente de programacion y
produccion de Cisneros Television Group, de Estados Unidos. CTG,
que tiene una presencia importante en America Latina, es una filial
del Grupo Cisneros, de Venezuela.
 &HT;    Las companias de cable se instalan en Miami debido a su cercania
a Latinoamerica y a la gran cantidad de profesionales que hablan
espanol. Lo que es mas importante, la ciudad tiene una notable
infraestructura de cable dirigida a Latinoamerica. Hay agencias de
actores, instalaciones de produccion, compradores de medios y
companias de difusion con grandes negocios.
 &HT;    A principios de los anos 90, el sector latinoamericano del cable
era practicamente inexistente. Ahora las empresas del sector con
operaciones en Miami representan mas de US$600 millones en ingresos
anuales, segun funcionarios del condado Miami-Dade. GlobeCast North
America, proveedor de servicios de satelite, es un ejemplo de ese
crecimiento. En 1997, la compania distribuyo 17 redes de cable a
Latinoamerica. Para fines de 1998, casi habia duplicado su base de
clientes. La empresa, filial del gigante France Telecom, invertira
US$18 millones en los proximos tres anos para ampliar sus
operaciones y recientemente compro un edificio de casi 8.000 metros
cuadrados que aumentara sus operaciones en mas del doble.
 &HT;    La norteamericana TransAmerica Media Group, un grupo de compra
de medios en espanol, afirma que sus ingresos de la publicidad
latinoamericana se duplican anualmente gracias en parte al auge del
sector del cable en la region. ''[Miami es el Hong Kong del sector
latinoamericano del cable,'' dice Jose del Cueto, director
ejecutivo de TransAmerica. ``Es donde se hacen los convenios. Los
operadores de cable y los proveedores de senales estan aqui, y
cientos de companias con posibles anunciantes estan aqui``.
 &HT;    Abundancia de programas. Las estaciones norteamericanas de cable
apenas han comenzado su mision de llenar la television
latinoamericana con la variedad de programas que hay en Estados
Unidos. ``Ahora hay mas mercadeo especifico y seleccion de
segmentos de audiencia [en America Latina,'' comenta Robert Behar,
director ejecutivo de GlobeCast North America. ``Hay canales
especializados, canales musicales, canales deportivos, canales de
carreras de autos, canales de peliculas, documentales, viajes y
noticias. Esta evolucionando casi igual que el mercado
norteamericano..'
 &HT;    Las companias de cable esperan atraer televidentes subrayando la
sensibilidad cultural. Los ejecutivos norteamericanos del cable
dicen que el clamor en America Latina por mas programas refleja su
realidad. ``En Mexico, los operadores y distribuidores del cable
dicen que no transmitimos suficientes productos mexicanos. En
Argentina y Chile dicen lo mismo,'' senala Yolanda Ramirez Foster,
vicepresidenta de programacion en Gems International Television.
 &HT;    Gems, que se dirige a las mujeres latinoamericanas, aumenta este
ano su programacion original en un 10 por ciento. Consulte a su
doctor, un nuevo programa de medicina en el que el publico puede
hacer llamadas, presentara a profesionales de la salud de distintas
partes de America Latina.
 &HT;    Con el respaldo del caudal de su compania matriz, CTG planea
incrementar su numero de canales de cable latinoamericanos de ocho
a 11 el ano proximo. La empresa produce alrededor del 5 por ciento
de sus programas pero proyecta aumentar notablemente esa cifra. CTG
produce novelas, comedias y dramas originales, y la mayor parte de
ellos los producira en Miami. La compania tambien planea crear
programas originales para su Canal Latinoamericano de Playboy, con
talentos de la region.
 &HT;    Discovery Networks Latin America/Iberia dice que en 1999
producira mas que nunca antes programas originales, que ahora
representan una decima parte. La empresa norteamericana producira
sus primeros documentales de una hora dirigidos especificamente a
America Latina. Varios programas exploraran el periodo de la
ocupacion francesa en Mexico, senalaran el quinto centenario del
descubrimiento de Brasil y observaran como los latinoamericanos se
enfrentan al problema de los sistemas informaticos en el ano 2000.
Otros programas trataran sobre la arquitectura latinoamericana,
casas famosas y sus ocupantes pasados y presentes. Otras cadenas
siguen la pauta. Entre las companias de cable que apuntan a la
region estan MTV, Sony TV, HBO, Nickelodeon, USA Network, The
Weather Channel, The Travel Channel y las redes de compras HTV y
QVC.
 &HT;    Limites locales. La cantidad de programas originales con un
enfoque local que los operadores de cable pueden hacer tiene un
limite, debido a los altos costos de produccion y transmision. Por
eso las companias buscan un equilibrio entre apuntar a
Latinoamerica en su conjunto y apuntar a paises especificos, sobre
todo a los grandes mercados del cable que son Argentina y Mexico.
GEMS, por ejemplo, tiene cuatro fuentes: Argentina, Mexico, el
resto de America Latina y Estados Unidos. La estacion planea lanzar
este ano una senal en portugues para Brasil. Todos los dias, cada
region recibe los mismos bloques de programas, pero GEMS varia el
contenido dentro de cada bloque diario. Menu del Dia, un programa
de cocina, puede presentar recetas argentinas un dia y colombianas
el siguiente. Consulte a su doctor puede tener un pediatra peruano
hoy y un ginecologo mexicano manana. Perspectivas, un programa de
entrevistas producido en Los Angeles, presenta a diario una
variedad regional ya que sus tres anfitriones son de Argentina,
Mexico y Espana. ``Buscamos dar un aire internacional a nuestros
programas,'' dice Foster. ``Preferimos ese enfoque a tener 30
fuentes para complacer a todo el mundo en America Latina. Nos
concentramos en las cosas que las mujeres tienen en comun, como las
modas, el arreglo del hogar y otras cuestiones de importancia como
la salud..'
 &HT;    Los canales de cable con contenido historico y cultural quiza
sean los mas interesados en producir programas que reflejen a
Latinoamerica. ``Hacemos un gran esfuerzo por tener en cuenta la
sensibilidad de nuestras audiencias,'' afirma Rick Rodriguez,
vicepresidente de programacion de Discovery Networks Latin
America/Iberia. ``El espanol neutral no funciona en estos
programas..' Cuando Discovery transmitio en vivo la exploracion de
los restos del Titanic, se utilizo a interpretes de espanol y
portugues para traducir al presentador angloparlante. Pero en las
retransmisiones del especial, Discovery hizo mas traducciones
adaptadas a giros regionales de America Latina.
 &HT;    Ciertos programas basados en un aspecto de una cultura
latinoamericana especifica tienen un atractivo continental. Un
ejemplo es la version de CTG de la serie de dibujos animados Dr.
Katz, del canal Comedy Central. El programa se transmite en la
cadena Locomotion de CTG, un canal de dibujos animados que
transmite las 24 horas y que llega a mas de dos millones de hogares
en America Latina, Espana y Portugal.
 &HT;    En la version en ingles, Dr. Katz es un siquiatra neoyorquino
que atiende a pacientes norteamericanos famosos. En CTG, es un
siquiatra argentino que atiende a celebridades latinoamericanas,
entre ellas una Miss Universo venezolana. El Dr. Katz de CTG da una
vision humoristica de la opinion generalizada en America Latina
sobre la fascinacion de los argentinos con la sicoterapia, explica
Peraza, de CTG.
 &HT;    El enfoque etnico no siempre funciona. Con South Park, una
satira de la vida de los ninos en las Montanas Rocosas, CTG uso
primero expresiones mexicanas. Mas tarde los ejecutivos decidieron
que ese experimento no permitia que el sarcasmo del programa
tuviera un gran atractivo en toda Latinoamerica. Al final CTG opto
por un acento neutral en espanol, mas apropiado para que los
latinoamericanos vieran el programa como una peculiar satira
norteamericana de los problemas de la infancia.
 &HT;    Los proveedores de programas piensan que los programas dirigidos
a culturas especificas atraeran a mas suscriptores, pero no estan
muy seguros. Latinoamerica tiene un sistema estandar para medir la
sintonia de la TV pagada, pero las audiencias medidas son tan
pequenas que es dificil juzgar el verdadero impacto de los
programas.
 &HT;    ``Todavia no hemos visto una correlacion en ese campo, pero esos
indices son tan inmaduros en este mercado que no ofrecen mucha
informacion,'' senala Rodriguez. ``Sin embargo, sobre la base de lo
que vemos en cobertura de prensa, publicidad adicional y respuestas
a estos programas, podemos decir que captan el interes del
televidente.''

 &HT;    Ever-elegant Armani draws a bead on the slit, the sheer
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Some designers have muddled outlooks on the
future of fashion. Giorgio Armani's views on century's-end
dressing, however, are crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   For the finale of his fall/winter collection, Armani showed the
sort of evening gow ns that should cause jaws to drop harder than
Times Square's apple or Underground Atlanta's peach come New Year's
Eve. All were super-sheer numbers with crystal beading in strategic
places to keep the models from appearing nude.
</P>
<P>
   There was no vulgarity to the look, just masterful manipulation
of fabric and the human form. The eye-catching blue and green
beading _ in stripes, plaids, chevrons and florals _ served as
delicious distractions from the skin just beneath.
</P>
<P>
   And if the pre-millenial hoopla running rampant through the
industry distracted Armani while assembling this collection, it
hardly showed. Understated elegance remains his trademark, even
when he plugs into such trends as the ubiquitous ``utility'' bag
with the vengance of someone who's banking on an upsurge in
accessories sales come fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Armani look has evolved dramatically: in contrast to the
broad-shouldered, tight-waisted, full-legged drape of old, his
latest collection featured: jackets that fit snug on the shoulders
and were cropped at the waist; flat-front pants cut with just
enough room to walk breezily; and semi-sheer knit sweaters and
tanks used in place of blouses.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the jackets were collarless and wrapped asymetrically
around the torso. Most of Armani's skirt were wrap-style as well,
with daringly high slits up the front, back and sides. His models
were shod in flat, molded-sole shoes.

COMMENTARY: AFTER INDY COUNSELS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Back in the Bush administration, press reports
revealed the corrupt use of U.S. government grain guarantees to
help Saddam Hussein build his war machine before he surprised us by
invading Kuwait. When the Justice Department shyly turned away, the
need arose for independent counsel to explore ``Iraqgate.''
</P>
<P>
   No way, said George Bush, already burned by a special
prosecution of Iran-contra. His attorney general instead used a
patsy prosecutor until the Independent Counsel Act lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   During that '92 campaign, I called candidate Bill Clinton to ask
if he favored renewing the Independent Counsel Act to handle such
high-level corruption, and in this space reported his unequivocal
answer: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, I reminded President Clinton of his promise and
asked if he would sign the bill languishing in Congress. He
replied: ``I certainly intend to sign the law just like I always
said I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus publicly encouraged, the Senate Democratic leader, George
Mitchell, put the five-year renewal forward and the majority
leader, Bob Dole, brought it to the floor for passage. Clinton
signed it in June 1994. (For some reason, he has not returned a
call of mine since.)
</P>
<P>
   The act expires in June, and _ thanks to the unpopularity of Ken
Starr _ the idea of an unconflicted investigation of wrongdoing in
high places has become the loneliest legislative orphan in America.
Critics holler: Costs too much! Takes too long! Criminalizes
political mistakes and mere personal flings!
</P>
<P>
   Not since that catastrophic day in 1915 when the Lake Michigan
cruise ship Eastland capsized as it left its dock on the Chicago
River, drowning 800 passengers who had rushed to the railing to
wave goodbye, has there been such a disaster threatened by a crowd
surging to one side.
</P>
<P>
   Not really a disaster; the Republic will survive when denizens
of the White House can rely on a political crony in the attorney
general's chair to shut down investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Renoism is already with us. The illegal financing of the 1996
election by Asian bankers buying influence was the recent case that
most cried out for aggressively independent probing. But Reno
defied the FBI director and punished a too-honest prosecutor who
had dared to recommend that the investigation be entrusted to those
not previously involved in malfeasant befuddlement.
</P>
<P>
   Because that internal Clinton Justice cover-up worked despite
the clear mandate of the act, even a man as steeped in Watergate as
Sen. Fred Thompson has thrown up his hands and joined the crowd
stampeding to the railing.
</P>
<P>
   What can be placed in the indy counsel's stead to prevent the
appointment to high Justice posts of dishonest cronies (like
Webster Hubbell), or to stop the present see-no-evil attitude
toward corruption by the politically grateful?
</P>
<P>
   1. Build some oversight into the way an attorney general selects
outside, ``special'' _ though not independent _ counsels. An
advisory board of judges appointed by all three branches could
provide the names of outsiders capable of giving ethical cover to
an administration under public pressure to show no conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put more subpoena-power bite and professional investigators
into Judiciary committees to act as a whip on the backs of lax
Justice investigators. Such full-time ``oversighters'' would work
best when one House of Congress is of a party different from the
president's.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make the chief of Justice's now-laughable Office of Public
Integrity confirmable by the Senate. Sweep out time-servers
blocking reform.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these thoughts will be transmitted to Justice soon by
Reps. Gekas, Hutchinson and Graham of the House Administrative Law
subcommittee in an effort to get Reno to spell out its alternative
to the Independent Counsel Act.
</P>
<P>
   With no independent counsel, Congress must turn to serious
oversight _ pressing prosecutors to do their anti-corruption job.
The media should reduce their self-flagellation as well as their
dependence on prosecutorial leaks, and invest more in original
investigative stories.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, what will rebuild pressure on the powerful to obey
the law, stick to the truth and adhere to ethical standards? Only
the renascence of public outrage.

BEHIND THE SPIN, SHORTCOMINGS IN LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a weeklong stalemate, it all worked out in the
end.
</P>
<P>
   That's the political polish Gov. Cellucci is applying to the
three-corner compromise that broke an impasse over selecting a new
commissioner of education.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrangement Cellucci approved Wednesday not only marks a
defeat for him, it also highlights the shortcomings of an
administration that has repeatedly been caught off guard on
education, an issue Cellucci calls one of his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, floated Tuesday and approved Wednesday, saw John
Silber resign as chairman of the Board of Education, thereby making
way for James Peyser, Cellucci's candidate for commissioner, to
become board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Political face saved, Cellucci will now bow to the inevitable,
letting the board award the commissioner's job to David Driscoll,
the interim commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guy is going to be chairman. He is going to be the boss of
the commissioner,'' Cellucci said. ``I think it is a good result. .
. . It enables us to move education reform forward. That is the
result I have been focused on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a post crucial to Cellucci's success as governor, the
board will now install a man whom the governor views as too much a
creature of the state's education establishment to reform it.
</P>
<P>
   As Cellucci aides see it, voters will likely hold the governor
accountable if their children don't fare well when student tests
begin to count in upcoming years.
</P>
<P>
   During the standoff last week, one aide drew a comparison to
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who has also made improving
education a top priority. ``If we're going to be held accountable,
we need our own person as commissioner,'' said the aide.
</P>
<P>
   But as John Silber is fond of saying, if wishes were horses,
beggars would ride.
</P>
<P>
   For all his efforts, Cellucci couldn't sway the two votes
necessary to secure the commissioner's job for Peyser. And when he
demanded that Roberta Schaefer and Abigail Thernstrom resign if
they wouldn't support Peyser, the two flatly refused, according to
sources familiar with the Monday meeting exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources say Cellucci learned only belatedly that he
didn't have the votes for Peyser.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the Feb. 6 round of interviews with candidates for
the job, it had become obvious to observers that a majority of the
board had coalesced around Driscoll. Still, several sources say the
administration didn't wake up to that reality until the afternoon
of Feb. 22, the day before the board was scheduled to vote on a new
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   That's the third time in nine months that Cellucci has been
caught off guard by important education developments. The first
time was last summer, when the Board of Education voted to lower
the passing standard for those taking the state's new
teacher-certification test. Cellucci had to make a personal
appearance at the board to get that vote reversed, staving off what
might have been a campaign catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago the University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees
raised tuition, despite the governor's expressed desire that it be
lowered. Once again, Cellucci was put in the position of cajoling _
indeed, even threatening _ his own appointees to reverse an
unpopular decision. He prevailed, but only after days of headlines
that portrayed an administration at odds with itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor didn't prevail last week. That means Cellucci
will be left to nudge education reform along, using like-minded
appointees on a board he no longer controls to ride herd on a
commissioner of whom he's been publicly skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be my responsibility to make sure there is a real
partnership between the governor and the administration and the
board, and that there aren't any surprises,'' Peyser said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's embarrassment, one thing most everyone can
agree on is that Cellucci sorely needs someone to play that role.

 &HT;    Allied Holdings to open unit in Mexico
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Allied Holdings, the biggest car-hauling company in
the United States and Canada, said it will set up a logistics
subsidiary in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur-based Allied Holdings said Wednesday the new unit, Axis
Logistica, will be part of its existing Axis Group subsidiary and
will be based in Guadelajara.
</P>
<P>
   Axis Logistica will arrange third-party transport of automobiles
when needed and provide export and import processing services and
customization work, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Holdings' car-hauling business in Mexico is limited by
trade agreements. But many of its customers have operations there.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fleming, vice president of business development for Axis
Group, said the company ``is being drawn to Mexico because of
customer requirements and the need to have a company to spearhead
our efforts to meet them.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied Holdings last year absorbed Ryder's Automotive Carrier
Group and saw its annual revenues grow to $1.03 billion, up from
$581.5 million in 1997. Profit was $8.5 million vs. $2.4 million.
Shares in Allied Holdings were unchanged Wednesday at $11.93 1/4.

 &HT;    Michael Jordan ads brought big returns
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Chicago Bulls wasn't the only bull market
superstar Michael Jordan was responsible for creating. He did a
pretty spectacular job for Wall Street, too.
</P>
<P>
   Worth (March) calculated the total return of five companies
whose brands Jordan endorsed vs. their five top competitors from
Jan. 1, 1996, to Jan. 13, 1999, when he retired from pro
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The total return of endorsed companies was 101.7 percent vs.
31.9 percent for non-endorsed competitors, Worth says.
</P>
<P>
   Just an accident? Not at all, sports marketer Brandon Steiner
tells Worth. MCI Worldcom stock soared 314 percent to rival AT&AMP;T's
68 percent in the three-year period, thanks to Jordan's MCI
long-distance phone commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's other endorsements cited in the analysis are Quaker
Oats (Gatorade), Nike, Sara Lee (Hanes), and Rayovac. The other top
competitors of these companies are Coca-Cola (PowerAde), Reebok,
Fruit of the Loom and Gillette (Duracell).
</P>
<P>
   MAKE IT SIMPLE, STUPID
</P>
<P>
   Never mind those complex PCs with their spreadsheets and serial
windows. Most people want a simple gizmo that does the basics: fax,
Web surf and phone, with maybe some TV or music, says Business Week
(March 8).
</P>
<P>
   With that type of consumer demand in mind, manufacturers of
personal computers have a host of new products in their pipelines,
including digital picture frames that display as many as 50 photos
_ even a cell phone that automatically locates the nearest greasy
spoon restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   WHICH MARKET IS YOURS?
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports (March) points out there is no such thing as
the stock market. There are various markets, depending on how they
are defined.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P-500 stock index rose 27 percent last year, for example,
but more than 370 mutual funds posted no better than single-digit
gains and another 668 lost money.
</P>
<P>
   This makes fund picking all the more important, says the
magazine, since ``all of the elements that made the past year so
unsettling are still in place this year.''
</P>
<P>
   CLICHES FOR THE MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will solve two big problems, according to
Fortune (March 15).
</P>
<P>
   One is the Y2K computer software dilemma, of course. The other
is the lack of a phrase to replace the cliche ``as we approach the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no small problem because, being a cliche, the phrase of
choice will be used repeatedly by pundits, politicians and press.
The phrase appeared in 277 news reports in 1998 alone, and is
destined to top that by a wide margin in 1999, says Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In just the first two weeks, the phrase appeared in 1,335 news
stories _ including 275 articles that were about President Clinton
or quoted him.

 &HT;    Intuit sues CheckFree in spite of 20% stake
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Intuit, the Silicon Valley-based maker of personal
finance software, has sued Norcross-based CheckFree, a company in
which Intuit owns a 20 percent stake, alleging CheckFree is not
complying with the terms of an April 1998 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View, Calif., company seeks an injunction and
unspecified damages. Neither company would outline the areas of
disagreement late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree spokeswoman Laurinda Wilson said no one at CheckFree
has seen a copy of the lawsuit and therefore could not comment.
Intuit declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree's stock dropped 8.7 percent on news of the lawsuit,
closing at $35.50, down $3.37 1/2. With its 20 percent stake in
CheckFree, Intuit took a $33.8 million paper loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement in question, CheckFree said it would provide
electronic bill paying and bill presenting for users of Intuit's
Quicken software and for visitors to http://www.quicken.com.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Intuit alleges CheckFree agreed to offer those
services to Intuit customers and ``not to offer Web-based bill
presentment products of its own in certain distribution channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Intuit officials, who filed the suit in the Superior Court of
Santa Clara County, Calif., Wednesday, would not say which
distribution channels it referred to in its lawsuit. But CheckFree
announced in January that it had signed a contract with a
high-traffic Internet portal. The agreement would let the portal
offer its visitors the ability to get and pay their bills online.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree has not announced who the portal is, but Avivah Litan,
an analyst with the Gartner Group, said it was Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Gary Craft, an analyst who covers CheckFree for BancBoston
Roberston Stephens, said the suit is a reflection of CheckFree's
important role in bill presentment and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuit is shooting themselves in the foot,'' Craft said.

 &HT;    Impact study confirmation for Research Triangle Park
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. _ In its 40 years, the Research
Triangle Park has attracted tens of thousands of jobs to North
Carolina like bugs to a high-tech light bulb, a study released
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the 6,900-acre park between Raleigh, Durham
and Chapel Hill, it's unlikely that companies employing an
estimated 48,500 people would have started operations in central
North Carolina, according to the economic impact study commissioned
the park's developer.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized for years as one of the South's leading technology
hubs, the Research Triangle Park is touting the study's findings as
further proof that it deserves ranking with Silicon Valley and
Boston's Route 128 corridor as one of the nation's top science and
technology centers.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Silver Spring, Md.-based consulting firm Hammer,
Siler, George Associates largely ignored the Research Triangle's
problems, such as worsening traffic caused by the region's rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1958 at the urging of Gov. Luther Hodges and
other North Carolina leaders seeking to end the state's dependence
on textiles, tobacco and furniture, the park has emerged as a model
of government, academic and private-sector cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that nearly 90 percent of the park's tenants
have formal or informal relationships with regional universities,
including Duke University in Durham, the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in
Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In counties surrounding the park, companies have invested more
than $300 million in technology-related manufacturing plants in the
1990s, the study said. The park also has spurred the start-up of
more than 200 technology companies since 1970, representing more
than 13,900 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accelerated economy of the state is directly attributable
to the Research Triangle Park,'' said retired University of North
Carolina President William Friday, one of numerous state officials
who participated in the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many large businesses and small, both in the park and
elsewhere, are in the state because of the Research Triangle Park
...''
</P>
<P>
   The Research Triangle Foundation, the park's developer, released
the report at a symposium celebrating the park's 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, officials of firms representing 84 percent of the
park's employees were asked to judge whether their companies were
likely, unlikely or very unlikely to have located in the region if
the park were not in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Firms representing 97 percent of the employees responded
unlikely or very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that all of the park's tenants share that view, the
study said more than 38,800 regular employees and more than 9,700
contract employees ``would not be in the region if not for the
park.''
</P>
<P>
   The study estimated that more than 25,000 other people work in
technology-related office parks near the Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER FINDINGS:
</P>
<P>
   _ The park has 98 tenants, including research companies and
government labs, which employ 39,500 people on a regular, full-time
basis and another 10,000 under contract.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average pay per employee is $54,145 a year, resulting in
total park payroll of $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 45 percent of the employees in the park are
scientists or engineers, followed by managers and administrators,
skilled technicians and clerical workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approximately 2.5 million square feet of space is under
construction and 15.4 million square feet is already occupied by
offices and labs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UTTARPARA, India _ Streets in India are an extraordinary sight
for two reasons, one of them the cows that wander sacredly and
indifferently through traffic, the other an antiquated-looking
automobile with a bowler hat of a roof called the Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Little in the look of the car has changed during its 41 years on
the road. The Ambassador is part icon, part curio, a beast of an
automobile that easily seats seven, stands high off the ground and
usually offers a ride with all the smoothness of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1980s, most every car sold in India was an
Ambassador, and, for its manufacturer, Hindustan Motors Ltd., this
was clearly too much of a good thing. Near monopoly conditions led
to lingering corporate somnolence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with India's economy more open and foreign auto makers
joining up with local partners, sales of the ``Amby'' have fallen
to a 5 percent niche in a crowded market. At the same time, after
finally modernizing production, the company finds itself with too
many workers and a prickly dispute with its unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ambassador is in a fight for its survival,'' said Prabal
Chatterjee, the senior vice-president in charge of the factory here
in Uttarpara, just northwest of Calcutta. ``There are so many other
companies making cars right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto sales in India, though modest, have more than doubled
during the past decade, with 1998's total at 403,000. But drivers
prefer vehicles that are smaller, sleeker and made far better.
While the Ambassador, now priced at around $8,000, always has been
a very easy car to keep running, it is not known as a car that runs
particularly well. A standard joke is that everything in the auto
makes a noise except the horn.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, little was done to streamline production or
attend to quality control. A fresh-from-the-factory Ambassador
already could be a rattletrap with doors that did not quite fit and
windows that allowed water to seep in around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company finally responded with $20 million of
improvements for the Uttarpara factory, but the plant was so badly
outdated that some of the newly installed equipment was as basic as
conveyor belts.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to update production _ however much it does or does
not enhance quality _ has brought its own set of problems. The
assembly line no longer needs anywhere near its current 11,000
workers, but, in India, employees are not easily shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make the car with 800 to 1,000 workers,'' said R.
Santhanam, the company's chief executive. ``At one time, when we
made everything including the nuts and bolts ourselves, we needed a
large work force. This is no longer true.''
</P>
<P>
   The average pay in the Uttarpara factory is $140 a month, which
is not insubstantial to a worker in one of the world's poorest
countries. In October, the company offered its older employees a
lump-sum buyout but found few takers.
</P>
<P>
   There is urgency to lowering costs. In the past year, the
factory lost $9.5 million, according to Chatterjee.
</P>
<P>
   Scaling back hours was Hindustan Motors' fallback option, and
late last year the company announced that it wanted to reduce the
work week to three days from six and cut wages accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   By law, such action requires government approval, hard to get in
most states but nearly impossible in West Bengal, where economics
is often seen as a guerrilla war between capital and labor.
Communists have been in power here for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   When the company proposed a retrenchment, its unions protested.
``Hindustan Motors has sucked the blood out of its workers and now
wants to discard them,'' said Samar Chakraborti, joint general
secretary of the Indian Trade Union Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The workers' logic, influential and irrefutable around Calcutta,
might be considered naive in a setting more obedient to
capitalism's ruthless energy: just because the company has been
stupid, the unions say, why should we suffer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has shown little understanding of modern
marketing,'' said Ajit Chakraborty, another union leader. ``The
true punishment should be given to the people who have done the bad
work, the people who run the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Chakraborty points out that Hindustan Motors, flagship of C.K.
Birla Group, is still turning a profit, largely through its
production of other vehicles at other sites. The company's
after-tax earnings in its most recent fiscal year were $9.4
million, according to its annual report. By Chakraborty's
reckoning, any losses on the Ambassador are merely an appropriate
penance, and executives ought to leave their innocent employees
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bosses say they are suffering during a recession, but
recessions ought to be planned for, like a man standing in the sea
prepares for the waves,'' Chakraborty said.
</P>
<P>
   Chatterjee, who runs the factory, said the unions needed to be
more pragmatic or instead of losing a large chunk of the jobs, they
will lose them all. The company has gone ahead with its plans to
operate with a reduced work week. But without government approval,
it must pay the workers their full wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, we are able to save some money on electricity and
water and our subsidized canteen,'' Chatterjee said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the West Bengal labor department rejected the
company's proposed retrenchment plan as ``absurd,'' issuing a
decision that chastised management for inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do understand the economic realities,'' said V. Subramanian,
the labor secretary. ``Hindustan Motors does have too large a work
force, and if we choke them, they might be dead soon. But this is a
leftist government and we are pro-labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't the Ambassador respond to changing times?'' he
added. ``It had a virtual monopoly at one time, but this was not a
monopoly that could last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   The Indian auto market changed radically in 1984 when the first
Maruti 800 came off the assembly line. The product of a joint
venture between the government and Suzuki, the car was small and
cute and easy to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Hindustan Motors never countered with its own subcompact, while
Maruti added a line of sedans, four-wheel drive vehicles and
minivans. For the most recent fiscal year, Maruti Udyog Ltd. had an
86 percent share of new car sales in India.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, as India rid itself of many of the shackles of
Nehru-era socialism, some of the world's biggest auto makers
decided to enter the market and assemble cars. Among the companies
that jumped in were Ford Motor, General Motors, Peugeot, Daewoo and
Honda. To varying degrees, most have forged partnerships with
Indian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, as factories have opened, a new model
or make has entered the showrooms every few months. Hindustan
Motors itself recently introduced the mid-sized Mitsubishi Lancer,
an automobile that the company produces in a modern factory in
Madras using Japanese technology.
</P>
<P>
   India's potential market has sent many an auto executive's
salivary glands into overdrive. The country has nearly a billion
people and 50 million urban households. Two million motorcycles and
scooters are sold here each year.
</P>
<P>
   While most people remain poor, if not destitute, there is a
burgeoning middle class, mostly people of relatively modest means
but millions of others on the cusp of being able to afford a small
$5,000 car.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Telco _ a giant truck manufacturer owned by the
Tata family, a leading name in India's industrial aristocracy _
began selling an eagerly anticipated subcompact auto, the Indica,
for $6,000. Already, tens of thousands of buyers have put down
deposits and joined a fast-lengthening waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years back, as car-buying appeared to be in a pattern
of exponential growth, many analysts predicted that sales were
headed toward nearly 900,000 a year by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   This has proved wildly optimistic, and most manufacturers are
now fighting price wars, offering cheap financing plans, and, in
more costly models, adding extras to the cars: compact disk
players, power windows, remote-control door locks.
</P>
<P>
   In this faddish competition, the Ambassador seems stodgier than
ever, even if it can now be bought with an Isuzu engine. ``The
Indian buyer is getting pretty savvy,'' said Murad Ali Baig, a
leading auto columnist. ``A car is more than a set of wheels and a
motor. A car is a symbol of what kind of guy you are. And, today,
if somebody brought an Ambassador home, it would bring shrieks of
`Oh, no!' from the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Ambassador has a future _ and Santhanam, Hindustan
Motors' chief executive, insists that it does for ``7 to 10 years
minimum'' _ it will be produced with the same familiar appearance
in annual quantities of about 35,000. Much as today, about 80
percent of its buyers will be taxi owners and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car has so many benefits,'' Santhanam said. ``It's so big
it can be used as a mobile office. On Indian roads, where safety is
a big issue, it's rugged. Mechanically, it is unlikely to fail. If
it does, any mechanic in India knows how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that final virtue _ the Ambassador's ease of repair _ may in
the end prove its undoing as much as any cheaper, faster and
flashier competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on inside an Ambassador is simple to understand, no
electric parts that no one's ever seen before,'' said Pramod Shaw,
a mechanic in a Calcutta bazaar. ``You can fix anything with a
hammer and a wrench. Six-year-olds can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Calcutta and most other big cities, there are entire markets
where dozens of resourceful mechanics not only sell used Ambassador
parts but home-made ``duplicate'' ones as well. These copies are
decidedly cut-rate. An entirely ``new'' Ambassador body can be
bought for $350, an entire shiny ``new'' car for under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can take a 1960 Ambassador and make it look and run the same
as an Ambassador just out of the factory,'' Shaw said. ``The
Ambassador never changes. Why would anyone buy a new one?'' &QL;

TEACHERS UNION HITS EDUCATION CHAIRMAN CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci's choice to replace John R.
Silber as education chairman came under heavy fire from the state's
largest teachers union Wednesday, evidence that while the acrimony
surrounding Silber may abate, the battle over the course of
education reform will continue.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Silber offered to quit to end a deadlock over
selection of a new education commissioner, Cellucci accepted and
said he will appoint James Peyser to replace Silber. Cellucci added
he will support David Driscoll as the next commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci dismissed suggestions that the deal marked a serious
political setback for him because he wanted Peyser, not Driscoll,
in the commissioner's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man I wanted is now the chair of the commission,''
Cellucci told reporters. ``He is a change agent... and he is the
boss of the man who did get the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Cellucci put the best face on the deal, the state's
largest teachers union immediately took aim at Peyser, 42,
executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a conservative think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gorrie, president of the Massachusetts Teachers
Assocation, said his union had serious concerns about Peyser
because of his advocacy of vouchers and privatization that the
union claims would damage public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon his past philosophies and current philosophies, he
tends to lean toward toward privatization, vouchers, and those
things which would be detrimental to public education,'' Gorrie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Peyser: ``I am an optimist by nature. Until it doesn't
work out, I am prepared to try.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the board of education, an unpaid post, is
appointed by the governor and oversees the nine-member board as it
sets statewide education policy and regulations. The commissioner,
a full-time post selected by the board, implements them.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, 55, currently the interim commissioner, praised the
compromise that will allow him to keep his post on a permanent
basis. He disputed suggestions _ offered previously by Cellucci and
Silber _ that he is too tied into the education establishment to
push an overhaul of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I are both change agents and I am willing to work with
him in making them,'' Driscoll said, referring to Peyser. ``I just
believe change has to be made in a way that is understandable to
the field and it has to be done after a good discussion. But we do
need to make dramatic changes in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cellucci praised Silber, whose confrontational style
had created acrimony and tension on the board even as he shared the
governor's push to reform the state education system. ``I have only
come here to praise Dr. Silber,'' the governor said, adding his
resignation was a ``remarkable'' act. ``It's not something we often
see in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   The board had been at impasse since last week when Driscoll
received five of the necessary six votes to become commissioner,
while Peyser got four votes. Top Cellucci aides believed the
controversial Boston University chancellor had so alienated several
administraton-appointed board members that the governor stood no
chance of getting Peyser the post.
</P>
<P>
   Silber said he felt obligated to resign because it became clear
it was the only way to break the impasse. He also brushed aside
suggestions that his brusque style of leadership had led to the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a neat way to make it look like I was the problem,''
Silber said. Then referring to his nemeses on the board, Abigail
Thernstrom and Roberta Schafer, he said, ``They were the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber said Cellucci had told him he did not want his
resignation, but wanted the two women to resign. But because they
would not, Silber said he felt obligated to remove himself.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the compromise that reconfigured the board and
elected a new commissioner will restore calm to the debate over the
state's education agenda is not clear. Peyser, while saying he
would try to work with the unions and the education establishment,
adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the union leadership has had some negative things to
say about me from time to time, but I am operating on the
assumption that they have a good faith interest in improving
student achievement and given that, we have something to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he faulted the union leadership for its fierce opposition
to charter schools _ publicly funded schools that operate with
considerable autonomy from the regular school system _ which the
Pioneer Institute has advocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have made, at a minimum, some tactical mistakes
in opposing things like charter schools,'' he said. ``Among other
things, charter schools provide career opportunities for teachers.
That should be something the teachers endorse, but I am not
expecting miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   On another issue that has aroused the ire of the teachers
unions, Peyser said he remains an advocate of vouchers _ using
public money to let students attend private schools _ but noted
that issue would require constitutional change before vouchers
could be legal in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Peyser said vouchers ``are not going to be my leading
priority by any stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorrie made it clear that the MTA strongly favored Driscoll,
saying the educator understands the needs of the state's public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``To characterize him as someone who is not a strong change
agent is... incorrect. He has the experience, the expertise, and
the energy to lead the educational force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if both the union leadership and Peyser seemed tentative,
Thernstrom, who supported Driscoll for commissioner, said she
thought the new arrangement would work well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that upset teachers about Jim Peyser are not Board
of Education issues, they are legislative issues,'' she said,
citing both vouchers and Cellucci's proposal to test veteran
teachers.

MARKET PLACE: GOLDMAN (AGAIN) TO GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barring a repeat of the stock market slump that undid
its carefully laid plans last fall, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the last
big private investment bank in the nation, will go public by early
summer, the firm announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The full roster of 221 partners who own the firm will not vote
formally on the share offering until Monday, but little opposition
is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, which makes most of its money trading and underwriting
securities and advising companies on strategy, plans to sell 10
percent to 15 percent of its shares to the public. If the issue is
successful, Goldman will have more capital to compete with other
banks and brokerage houses in areas like managing client money and
the Internet, where it hopes to grow quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the plan is a sign that some of the top bankers
on Wall Street see the current strength in the stock market as
sustainable, despite fears that the frenzied runup in Internet
stocks that has helped drive stock prices has already begun to
cool. Goldman would be deeply embarrassed to have to cancel its
stock offering a second time. Executives there are making a
calculated gamble that the financial winds are steady enough to
carry them through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the sale of shares in the prestigious
investment bank is likely to be one of the richest in the history
of initial public offerings, but perhaps not as bountiful as it
might have been. Profits at Goldman and other financial companies
are bouncing back after they tumbled last fall. But some analysts
caution that the recovery is still partial and that the financial
markets are more volatile than they were last year, when Goldman's
leaders first overcame longstanding internal opposition and
persuaded the partners to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman hopes to raise $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, a wide
range that could put the full market value of Goldman shares
anywhere between $16 billion and $35 billion. Several people who
have studied the issue believe that Goldman is aiming to sell
shares at a price that would value the full firm at $22 billion to
$25 billion, or about 20 percent less than its target range at the
time of the first offering announcement.
</P>
<P>
   That would reduce the value of the shares that Goldman partners
receive, but hardly by painful amounts. The lowest-ranking
partners, including those named to their posts only a few months
ago, would likely have shares valued at about $15 million. The most
senior executives would see their share holdings reach $150
million, people close to the firm have estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also intends to turn all of its lower-ranking bankers
into shareholders. The last time, the partners agreed to devote
about 20 percent of the total ownership of the firm to employees, a
level that some expect to be maintained this time. All inside
shareholders will hold restricted stock that cannot be sold for a
few years, and the value of their holdings will depend on the share
price at the time of sale.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the lower valuation of the firm this time is that
investors pay less now for shares of Goldman's chief rivals.
Financial stocks have recovered in recent months, but only Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter among the major securities firms has come close
to touching its all-time high. The share price of another leading
competitor, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., is still 30 percent off its peak
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still waiting to see proof of a full recovery in
brokerage stocks,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an industry analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney. ``The momentum is back, but we need to see
the results of the first and second quarter to say they are
completely healthy again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond trading losses and slow underwriting activity slashed
Goldman's profits in the second half of last year, bringing
earnings below what it made in 1997. Such swings in profitability
plague many Wall Street firms. But others have diverse businesses
like credit cards and retail mutual funds that allow them to
weather storms better than Goldman does.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall turmoil, Jon Corzine resigned as Goldman's
co-chief executive officer, leaving Henry Paulson alone in the top
post. Corzine remains a non-executive chairman. The leadership
change disclosed tensions in the executive suite over the way the
firm was run, and its tendency to derive a big chunk of profits
from trading stocks and bonds with its own capital, Goldman
insiders have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldman does not have the same profit stability as some other
firms, and that will be on investors' minds,'' said Michael Holland
of Holland &AMP; Co., a fund manager specializing in financial stocks.
``But they are also one of a kind, and I expect them to try to
price their shares aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Working in Goldman's favor are early signs that the first
quarter of this year is proving to be a rollicking success. Stock
and bond underwriting volumes for the first two months of the year
increased by half as much as levels a year ago, and a backlog of
mergers and acquisition activity promises a steady flow of advisory
fees into the summer months. Goldman profits appear to be on track
to comfortably exceed the first quarter of 1998, when it made more
than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in the sweet spot of their current cycle, striking on
all cylinders,'' Holland said. ``I think they're gushing cash these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials declined to comment on the firm's current
profitability or plans to sell shares, citing government
regulations that prohibit companies from promoting their own stock
in the weeks before a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Goldman's favor these days is a major business that
it does not have: a retail brokerage. Unlike Merrill Lynch, Morgan
Stanley and many other firms, Goldman does not have a network of
brokers who sell stocks and bonds to middle-class individual
investors. That was seen as a weakness for years. But it may now be
a strength of sorts, leaving Goldman free to embrace the Internet
without fear of alienating thousands of employees.
</P>
<P>
   One senior committee at the firm is now pondering strategic
options and another is examining how it should best jump into the
online world. By the time Goldman starts marketing shares to
investors in late April and early May, the firm expects to have an
Internet strategy to talk about, people close to it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the No. 1 thing that every investor in our industry is
looking at,'' said one person close to Goldman. ``Goldman will be
thinking about taking its brand name and accessing new markets.''
</P>
<P>
   People within Goldman are debating whether or not it makes sense
for the firm to jump into the retail brokerage business, either
through its own online brokerage house or in alliance with an
established firm, like Fidelity Investments or Charles Schwab.
Goldman has also explored ways in which new trading networks offer
alternatives to established stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   For that and other reasons, Goldman's public offering has the
rest of Wall Street talking. One subject for speculation is whether
Goldman's brand name will allow it to command a share-price premium
over Merrill and Morgan. Some say yes, others say no.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark to beat is Morgan. At $93 a share, Morgan trades
at 3.8 times its book value, a ratio that serves as the standard
way of measuring financial stock prices. Merrill, which suffered
more in the market downturn last fall, now trades at about 2.9
times book value.
</P>
<P>
   For Goldman to hit a $25 billion valuation, the top of its
hoped-for range, it would have to price its shares at roughly four
times its current book value of $6.3 billion, a slight premium to
Morgan's level. Even at the bottom end of its intended range,
Goldman would have to trade at a hefty premium to Merrill's current
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Goldman will trade at or above Morgan or they won't do
the offering,'' said Holland, the money manager.
</P>
<P>
   But one banker at a rival Wall Street firm, who declined to be
identified because his firm is in contention to help Goldman
underwrite its shares, said he would be surprised if Goldman could
price its shares at a premium to Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will be lucky to get to that level,'' he said.
``My impression is that Morgan is out of reach for them now.''

RAMON MARTINEZ HEADED FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Pending the passage of a routine physical
that has nothing to do with his surgically repaired right shoulder,
pitcher Ramon Martinez will officially become a member of the Red
Sox early next week and be reunited with his younger brother Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Red Sox have suggested it may be July before he is
ready to pitch, Ramon Martinez says it could be much sooner,
perhaps as early as May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be sometime around May, the way everything is
going,'' Martinez said Wednesday from his home in Santo Domingo,
where he was working out after throwing off a mound for the first
time since his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, I'll be throwing batting practice. Everything is
going well. I don't want to rush it, but I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and Martinez, according to sources, have agreed to a
two-year contract, with an option for a third year, that is laden
with performance incentives based largely on innings pitched and
games started. Further details of the deal have not been disclosed,
but officials with other clubs have said Red Sox general manager
Dan Duquette was able to complete the deal by guaranteeing millions
to the righthander who turns 31 March 22. One source said the deal
included close to $8 million in guaranteed money, but neither side
would confirm numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is expected to arrive here Sunday night and undergo a
physical soon thereafter. He said he wanted to speak with Duquette
about where he will continue his rehabilitation, but he would
prefer to return to the Dominican Republic, where he has been
working with the same pitching coach, Eleodoro Arias, he has known
since signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dan wants me to stay, I'll stay,'' Martinez said, ``but
maybe I could work out something where I would go home, then come
back here every two weeks. It's up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he had not yet spoken to his younger brother, but
intended to call him Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's healthy, he can help out a lot,'' Pedro Martinez said.
``To me, it's a great move. I feel happy my brother will be here,
and my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez became a free agent after the Dodgers, for whom
he had won 126 games in 11 seasons, did not exercise the $5.6
million option the team held for the 1999 season. Those
knowledgeable about his deal with the Red Sox say Martinez could
earn significantly more than that next year.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez underwent surgery on his shoulder last June 30 to
repair a hole in his rotator cuff and clean out some cartilage in
his shoulder. Unlike similar procedures, which are done with an
arthroscope, a much less invasive procedure, Martinez had an ``open
cuff'' operation, which involved the use of a scalpel to repair the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   But Duquette, no doubt encouraged by the successful comeback of
Bret Saberhagen from radical shoulder reconstruction, was willing
to take a risk and guarantee Martinez a much better deal than he
would have received from LA.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers made an attempt this winter to re-sign him, offering
him an incentive-laded contract worth about $6 million this season,
but according to Martinez, less than $1 million was guaranteed. He
would have received bonuses for being placed on the big-league
roster, innings pitched, starts, and victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to miss Ramon as an organization and as people
because Ramon represents everything that's good about the
Dodgers,'' Los Angeles general manager Kevin Malone told reporters
Wednesday at the team's training facility in Vero Beach, Fla.
``We're very happy for him, happy that he felt comfortable he could
make this decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt we were willing to assume a lot of the risk, but
we felt we couldn't assume all of the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pedro Martinez lashed out at the Dodgers earlier this week
for the way they approached his brother, Ramon was more measured in
his words, saying he was ``a little bit disappointed.'' He said
that while the Dodgers had watched him throw when he was in LA at
the end of January, they have not seen him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I decided to become a free agent, they didn't make any
offer until a week ago,'' Ramon Martinez said. ``It was like they
were not interested in me. (The offer) they made was something just
to make an offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he was throwing 88 miles an hour off a flat
surface earlier this week and believed he threw nearly as hard
Wednesday, even though his physical therapist had advised he back
off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinez brothers played together in Los Angeles for the
1992 and '93 seasons until Pedro was traded to the Montreal Expos.
At that time, Ramon was considered the ace of the Dodgers staff,
though he had his worst two seasons professionally, going 8-11 and
10-12 after having won 37 games the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, meanwhile, was used almost exclusively in relief
by the Dodgers. If Ramon is successful in his comeback, he would be
in the same rotation as his brother for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, who is 3 years and 7 months older than Pedro, is
very much the same type of pitcher, according to his younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same, except I throw a curveball and he throws a
slider,'' Pedro Martinez said. ``Same velocity, same changeup. His
fastball moves more than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, of course, how Martinez's velocity will
be affected by the surgery. But if healthy, his presence in the Sox
rotation would give the club two Cy Young Award winners (Pedro
Martinez and Saberhagen twice), a World Series MVP (Saberhagen) and
two 20-game winners (Ramon Martinez and Saberhagen twice). Ramon
Martinez and Saberhagen both have thrown no-hitters, and Pedro
Martinez pitched nine perfect innings before giving up a hit in the
10th in San Diego. Ramon Martinez also has struck out 18 batters in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy because now we're going to play together
again,'' Ramon Martinez said. ``I'm glad we have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But while they may be similar pitchers, Pedro Martinez warns not
to expect the same person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very aggressive,'' Pedro Martinez said. ``Ramon is a
cold-blooded man, very quiet on the mound. I'm not. I'm moody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon, he'll say hello, how are you, and give you an interview
if you ask him. But he's like, `I'm not going to be a brat like
Pedro.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, in other words, would not be caught dead wearing
a Yoda mask in the dugout, as his younger brother did last season.
``I don't think he would have allowed me to do that if he had been
here,'' Pedro said.

   UNKINDEST CUT
</P>
<P>
   The medical benefits of circumcision are not compelling enough
to warrant recommending it as a routine procedure for newborn baby
boys, the American Academy of Pediatrics concludes in a new policy
statement released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors say parents should discuss the risks and benefits of
circumcision with their pediatrician and then make an informed
decision about what is in the best interest of their child.
</P>
<P>
   And, they say, if parents decide to circumcise their infant, it
is essential that pain relief be provided. The surgery is often
done without anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   The AAP's task force on circumcision reviewed 40 years of
medical research on the benefits and risks before deciding that the
benefits are not significant enough to make it routine, according
to the policy statement, published in this month's edition of
``Pediatrics.''
</P>
<P>
   SUPER HEALTHY
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, butternut squash, lean beef and spinach may not be your
child's idea of a super meal, but researchers at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas say the supernutrients
found in those foods provide a great foundation for pediatric good
health.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin A, iron, omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid are
essential nutrients for growing children, says Dr. Robert Squires
Jr., associate professor of pediatrics at Southwestern.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends that parents seek out foods high in those
nutrients and consider new ways to make them more appetizing to
children.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a child who turns up his nose at a bowl of spinach
might love spinach pizza.

   ``Breaking Down Barriers''
</P>
<P>
   By Dwight Perry
</P>
<P>
   Baker Books, $12.99
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gospel in Black &AMP; White''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Dennis L. Okholm
</P>
<P>
   InterVarsity Press, $15.99
</P>
<P>
   There are times in every life when ``Just shut up and listen''
is good advice. For the lighter-skinned among us, the time spent
reading ``Breaking Down Barriers'' and ``The Gospel in Black &AMP;
White'' may be one such occasion. Not that the authors would phrase
it anywhere near that bluntly, and not that one needs to agree with
all their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle of Dwight Perry's book is ``A Black Evangelical
Explains the Black Church,'' and the Moody Bible Institute
professor does just that. ``Breaking Down Barriers'' scans
African-American history, black denominations and ministries, music
and preaching styles, and the civil rights era. One area that may
spark discussion: Perry's definitions of ``racism'' and
``institutional racism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking Down Barriers'' is an easy-to-read primer for those
who are unacquainted with black spirituality and its history. ``The
Gospel in Black &AMP; White'' is noticeably different in tone; as a
series of essays originally presented at a 1996 Wheaton College
theology conference, it has a more academic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Dennis L. Okholm presents the work of 10 writers, among
them Pamela Baker Powell, a white minister at a small black
congregation in Lubbock, Texas. The topics range from how the
concept of the Trinity should encourage racial reconciliation to
how dispensational premillennialism can impede it (something
certain to raise many evangelical eyebrows). The styles include
Eugene Rivers' fiery ``The Responsibility of Evangelical
Intellectuals in the Age of White Supremacy'' and Vincent Bacote's
straightforward ``Theological Method in Black &AMP; White: Does Race
Matter at All?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part,'' Craig S. Keener says, ``white
evangelicals have not listened to the perspectives of black church
leaders on issues that often affect the black church directly. Is
the coercive power of a voting majority that ignores minority
concerns less oppressive in principle than slaveholders who imposed
their will on slaves?''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that both ways, but listening to these authors
is definitely educational.

   ``Breaking Down Barriers''
</P>
<P>
   By Dwight Perry
</P>
<P>
   Baker Books, $12.99
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gospel in Black &AMP; White''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Dennis L. Okholm
</P>
<P>
   InterVarsity Press, $15.99
</P>
<P>
   There are times in every life when ``Just shut up and listen''
is good advice. For the lighter-skinned among us, the time spent
reading ``Breaking Down Barriers'' and ``The Gospel in Black &AMP;
White'' may be one such occasion. Not that the authors would phrase
it anywhere near that bluntly, and not that one needs to agree with
all their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle of Dwight Perry's book is ``A Black Evangelical
Explains the Black Church,'' and the Moody Bible Institute
professor does just that. ``Breaking Down Barriers'' scans
African-American history, black denominations and ministries, music
and preaching styles, and the civil rights era. One area that may
spark discussion: Perry's definitions of ``racism'' and
``institutional racism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking Down Barriers'' is an easy-to-read primer for those
who are unacquainted with black spirituality and its history. ``The
Gospel in Black &AMP; White'' is noticeably different in tone; as a
series of essays originally presented at a 1996 Wheaton College
theology conference, it has a more academic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Dennis L. Okholm presents the work of 10 writers, among
them Pamela Baker Powell, a white minister at a small black
congregation in Lubbock, Texas. The topics range from how the
concept of the Trinity should encourage racial reconciliation to
how dispensational premillennialism can impede it (something
certain to raise many evangelical eyebrows). The styles include
Eugene Rivers' fiery ``The Responsibility of Evangelical
Intellectuals in the Age of White Supremacy'' and Vincent Bacote's
straightforward ``Theological Method in Black &AMP; White: Does Race
Matter at All?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part,'' Craig S. Keener says, ``white
evangelicals have not listened to the perspectives of black church
leaders on issues that often affect the black church directly. Is
the coercive power of a voting majority that ignores minority
concerns less oppressive in principle than slaveholders who imposed
their will on slaves?''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that both ways, but listening to these authors
is definitely educational.

SENATE TAKES PARTISAN TURN ON EDUCATION LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Tenn., Conn., Vt., Minn.)   (Eds: See also CLINTON-DEMS)  
 (rk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Eager to show that education is foremost on their
minds, Senate Democrats and Republicans began a debate on federal
education policy Wednesday that they hope will resonate with voters
weary of impeachment and partisan warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, intending to
diminish negative reviews on the Republicans' handling of the
impeachment trial, made it a point to bring Wednesday's education
bill to the floor as one of his first orders of business.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has little real opposition, would give schools
more flexibility over $10 billion in federal aid by permitting
states to waive certain federal requirements. The pilot program is
already in effect in 12 states and would be expanded to all 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe parents, teachers and local education officials know
best what's needed locally, and this bill gives them the ability to
meet their area's individual needs,'' said Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., who co-sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But, to the Republicans' chagrin, Democrats turned the Senate's
consideration of the relatively uncontroversial ``Ed-Flex'' bill
Wednesday into a lengthier debate showcasing one of their prized
proposals, a plan to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 teachers,
which they will propose as an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are important issues to people across the country,''
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., said from the floor. ``How many
teachers are in the room? How well educated are they?''
</P>
<P>
   With a close eye on the 2000 political campaign, Republicans and
Democrats in Congress are already jockeying to seize the education
issue as their own; Democrats have traditionally won that argument
by emphasizing public school dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, though, are anxious to make up lost ground on
education and soften negative public reviews of their impeachment
performance by making education an immediate priority.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, the Republican chairman of the Budget
Committee, is considering a 40 percent increase in the federal
education budget over the next five years, a major turnabout from
four years ago when Republicans sought to abolish the Department of
Education. Federal dollars now make up about 6 percent of the money
spent on elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Domenici and other Republicans are not likely to drop
their desire to reduce the role of the federal government in
education by giving school districts greater local control,
especially through block grants. And they will continue to pursue
ways to funnel taxpayer money to private and parochial schools or
allow parents to use tax savings for tuition, if they choose, an
idea widely reviled by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans also know they must compromise to get important
education legislation passed this year, especially in the House,
where they hold a slim six-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ``Ed-Flex'' bill, sponsored by Frist and Ron Wyden,
D-Ore, is widely supported by lawmakers in both parties, all 50
governors and, with certain caveats, President Clinton. A House
committee voted out a nearly identical bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing states to waive certain requirements, the
legislation would loosen restrictions on how $10 billion in federal
money, most of it designated for poor children, can be spent, so
long as schools show improvement. Federal money earmarked for
specific programs, under the new measure, could be spent for other
purposes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It would be a gross overstatement to suggest that this bill
will revolutionize education,'' said Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt.,
the chairman of the committee on health, education and labor, who
called it a ``sensible step'' in stretching federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said the bill would hold school districts
responsible for improving academic performance, a major concern of
Democrats. Late Tuesday night, the Senate approved one Democratic
amendment aimed at beefing up accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also argued they would prefer to await the results of
a study on the pilot program, due out later this year, before
voting to expand it. Last year, the General Accounting Office gave
the program mixed reviews, concluding it was modestly successful
overall. And Democrats expressed concern about whether poor
children would be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they used this ``Ed-Flex'' to improve the opportunity for
poor children?'' asked Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``We don't
know.''

U.S. AND BRITAIN COME UNDER PRESSURE TO END AIR WAR OVER IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Turkey on Wednesday criticized the air war over
Iraq and declared that the American strike that disrupted a
pipeline to Turkey this week was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, China told a closed session of the
Security Council that all bombardments over Iraq must end,
according to diplomats. And over the weekend, the Arab League
reversed its policy enunciated in January and called on the United
States and Britain to stop the bombing immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Flow from the pipeline resumed on Wednesday, the United Nations
said. But with the souring of the international mood, it was no
accident that the skies over Iraq were quiet on Wednesday, one
allied diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   While many of those countries, as well as France and Russia,
have raised sharp questions about the air war, they seem to have
become more outspoken in their criticism since the American bombing
of a communications station for the Kirkuk to Ceyhan pipeline on
Sunday. That pipeline carries oil to the Mediterranean coast of
Turkey, where it is then sold as part of the United Nations oil for
food program for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is a close ally of the United States and lets American
planes carry out raids from bases in Turkey. But the Pentagon said
that the furor would not lead to any changes in its rules of
engagement that were widened at the end of January to allow
American pilots to hit anything that threatened their ability to
patrol the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq. The
United States created those zones after the Persian Gulf war ended
in 1991 to protect the Kurds and Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq began challenging British and
American jets patrolling those zones in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our view that nothing has changed except that Saddam
Hussein has repeatedly been challenging our enforcement of the
no-flight zone,'' said James Foley, deputy State Department
spokesman. ``We targeted these facilities because we believe that
they serve a function in the operation of Iraq's air defense
system.''
</P>
<P>
   While Britain remains a solid ally in patrolling the zones,
Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday did call the bombing that
disrupted the pipeline a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley said the United States does not intentionally target
the pipeline and other systems associated with the oil for food
program.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Security Council was given the damage
assessment done by the United Nations independent inspection agents
who visited the pipeline station on Monday. The damages temporarily
disrupted the pipeline from Kirkuk to Ceyhan that carries half the
oil Iraq is permitted to export under the oil for food program.
</P>
<P>
   British and American officials say that Saddam has been moving
antiaircraft artillery pieces and surface-to-air missiles near
population centers, antiquities and other sensitive locations,
making it difficult for pilots to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam is playing games and becoming more sophisticated at how
to play these angles,'' said a Pentagon official. ``That repeater
station was relaying radar data for the Iraqi air-defense system
and the strike against it was done in pure self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League on Sunday called for an immediate halt of the
allied bombing because of ``great disquiet'' over the ``loss of
life, destruction of infrastructure and an increase in tension in
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese request for a halt in the bombing was made at a
private session at the United Nations. Diplomats said that Russia
and other member countries agreed with China, citing humanitarian
grounds.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One allied diplomat said on Wednesday: ``There has been a
pile-on effect these last few days. There has to be a balance
between protecting pilots and not falling into one of Saddam's
traps. But given the number of bombs dropped over the last five
days, it's surprising things have gone bad only once.''

GROUP REPORTS NO LINK BETWEEN FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS AND NONPOLLUTING
FACTORIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ill.)   (rk) 
 By   CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For environmentalists in the market for a new car,
the choice is not an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Council on Economic Priorities, an
environmental group based in New York, car buyers face a
rock-and-a-hard-place choice: They can buy cars that were made in
nonpolluting plants or cars that run clean themselves, but they
cannot do both.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Wednesday, the council lauds the fuel
efficiency, and thus environmental cleanliness, of the Honda Civic
and Mitsubishi Mirage. But it criticizes Honda &UR;  &LR; of America
Manufacturing and Mitsubishi Motor &UR;  &LR; Manufacturing of America for
the high levels of pollutants spewing out of the Ohio and Illinois
plants where the cars are made.
</P>
<P>
   It cites the Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee as a gas guzzler, even
when compared with other sport utility vehicles. But it praises the
Toledo plant where the Cherokee is made as one of the cleanest
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the most polluting cars are made at the
least-polluting facilities, while the clean cars are coming out of
dirty plants,'' said Romi Chin Gottfrid, an environmental research
associate at the council.
</P>
<P>
   None of the plants mentioned in the study are flagrant violators
of state or federal environmental regulations. A spokeswoman for
the Environmental Protection Agency, while acknowledging the
``irony that sometimes clean products come from dirty facilities,''
indicated that the agency was not particularly incensed by the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gottfrid responded, ``Regulators should be holding these
companies to a higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, none of the companies are apologizing. ``We've
taken proactive action to minimize environmental impact,'' said a
Mitsubishi spokeswoman, who added that ``the council's data is
incomplete.'' Ron Lietzke, a spokesman for Honda of America, said
that Honda's four Ohio plants were recently certified as
environmentally sound by the International Organization for
Standardization in Geneva. ``We have continuous, active efforts
going to reduce our emissions, waste and use of natural
resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler &UR;  &LR; AG, which makes the Jeep Grand Cherokee,
meanwhile, is focusing on the praise. ``We're very pleased that our
employees' efforts to address environmental performance have been
recognized,'' said Sonja Bultynck, an environmental spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   And about that nagging fuel efficiency problem? ``Well, the 1999
Cherokee is 7 percent more fuel efficient than the 1998 model,''
she said.  &QL;

LESSONS SERVED UP AT THE COOKING TABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some time ago, while watching an episode of ``Family Matters,''
my daughters witnessed Steve Urkel making a fool of himself once
again trying to win the affection of his love interest, this time
taking the girl to dinner at a Japanese restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely little story, but what held my daughters'
attention was the dreaded cooking table. And they couldn't seem to
forget it.
</P>
<P>
   For months, they nagged me to take them to a restaurant ``where
they cook the food at your table.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night, on Asha's eighth birthday, I was obliged to
make that happen, partly because I enjoy watching them partake of
new experiences _ and partly due to guilt.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I'd told a colleague that I was trying desperately to
put together one more double birthday party to try to cut down on
expenses. But it wasn't just the expense. I have yet to sponsor one
of these ventures when the noise level wasn't so, well ...
overwhelming, the movement not so constant.
</P>
<P>
   I'm over 40. It makes me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   But my colleague said to me, ``Poor kids are going to grow up
dysfunctional because they've never had their very own birthday
party.''
</P>
<P>
   I smiled, trying to receive her comment in the spirit in which
it was delivered, but the knife had already pierced my flesh, or my
heart.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to her that their father and I make a point of
acknowledging each of their birthdays but that because they are so
close together, we have one BIG celebration.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on Asha's birthday, Jimmy prepared pancakes, her
favorite, with eight candles on top. And all of us _ Jimmy, Jamila
and I _ sang ``Happy Birthday'' to the tune of Stevie Wonder's
``Happy Birthday,'' sans the Martin Luther King Jr. lyrics, of
course. Then they ate, and Asha opened one of her gifts. We will do
the same thing Thursday, Jamila's 10th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Back to that first excursion to the Japanese cooking table.
</P>
<P>
   Five us _ we invited my niece, Jasmine _ arrived at the
restaurant around 6:30 p.m. It took us 30 minutes to decide what to
eat. Jamila and Jasmine wanted shrimp, Asha and I took the chicken
and Jimmy, the unhealthful red meat. I know better than to say
``cow.'' I can't afford the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about nothing until the cook showed up with platters
of meat and vegetables, and the show began. Soup came first. I
drank mine. Jamila sipped a little. The others sniffed, frowned and
replaced the bowls on the table. The same thing happened with the
salad, and the eggplant, and the bean sprouts, and the grilled
onions and green peppers.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to see food go to waste, money go down the drain. I was
disgusted with their unwillingness to try the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate their meat and bowls of ice cream. We went home. They
were hungry. I was stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   As I thought about it later, I wondered which of those
experiences is more likely to render my daughters dysfunctional
adults: having one BIG birthday celebration, or having me give in
to their every whim.
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting on the latter.

 &HT;    Perot run could stir feud with Bushes
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Leaders in Ross Perot's Reform Party said
Wednesday they hope their party's godfather makes a third run for
president, a move that could lead to a revival of one of the better
political family feuds of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In private, the Bush family still blames Perot's third-party
candidacy in 1992 for the ouster of President George Bush. In
public, Barbara Bush has been highly critical of Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an amazing, insensitive man!'' the mother of Gov. George
W. Bush, a front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination in
2000, wrote of Perot in her 1994 memoir.
</P>
<P>
   At the Reform Party's national headquarters in Dallas, where the
phones are still answered with an earnest ``Perot '96,'' Chairman
Russell Verney said Wednesday he ``absolutely'' wants Perot to run
again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a decision he will have to make,'' Verney said. ``He
has given no indication one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot did not respond to a written request for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Verney would offer no opinion on George W. Bush's probable
presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even thought about him. We are looking at people
outside the Republican and Democratic parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeanne Droogs of Fort Worth, the Reform Party's state
chairwoman, has thought about Bush and doesn't think much of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has really dumped on us,'' she said. ``He is going to spend
the rest of his time going out while he is supposed to be our
governor, and leaving us in the lurch. This is very immature in my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said being governor will be his priority through the
end of the legislative session on May 31. Droogs said she is not
impressed with Bush's performance as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean this to be insulting to him, but I don't know
what he has accomplished,'' she said. ``Please do not think I'm
doing this out of any animosity. I'm looking from an analytical
viewpoint. He is a popular man because he does have charm.
President Clinton has charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Droogs indicated that Perot is her top choice for the Reform
Party nomination in 2000 unless she comes across ``somebody
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Mr. Perot's sake, I would prefer someone of his caliber
coming forward,'' she said. ``If I don't see anyone better, why
should I support them?''
</P>
<P>
   Perot has been mum on whether he is interested in another
presidential race. Last November, he said he would not run next
year if Clinton resigned. Perot organized a petition drive urging
Clinton to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Though Reform Party officials cite studies showing Perot drew
equally from Clinton and Bush in 1992, Bush family members still
think Perot's candidacy took a more severe toll on the
then-president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Clinton won with 43 percent of the popular vote to
37 percent for the elder Bush, Perot ran third with 19 percent, but
got no electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Perot pulled only 8 percent of the popular vote when
Clinton trounced Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush-Perot relationship has been a rocky one, the
Texas governor has a new friend in Perot's party. The younger Bush
shared the spotlight with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform
Party's only statewide elected official, at the National Governors
Association meeting in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bonded with The Body,'' Bush said joking about the former
pro wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Though his party's new star, Ventura has said he would complete
his four-year gubernatorial term and not run for president next
year.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally free to seek self-justification and
personal profit, Monica Lewinsky opened a double-fronted campaign
on Wednesday to explain the sexual affair that triggered the
impeachment of President Clinton and put the nation through a
harrowing year of scandal tracking.
</P>
<P>
   By television interview and book publication, the former White
House intern sought to frame a different, more sympathetic image of
herself as a venturesome romantic who meant well but became
ensnared in the criminal investigation of the president's
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a pawn used to get the president,'' she said in the
book, ``Monica's Story'' (St. Martin's Press), written by Andrew
Morton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's sorry he got caught,'' Ms. Lewinsky said of the
president in the ABC-TV interview. But, ever hesitating to fully
renounce him, she added that ``when I think of the person I thought
Bill Clinton was, he had genuine remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview, with Barbara Walters on ``20-20,'' was one of the
first interrogations conducted without benefit of sworn oath by the
25-year-old California woman since she was confronted by
prosecutors 13 months ago. Her revelations caused a presidential
crisis in which Clinton finally was acquitted by the Senate last
month of perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive
me, but I would ask them to know that I am very sorry for what
happened and for what they've been through,'' Ms. Lewinsky told
Walters in the first of a series of worldwide television and
magazine interviews that, in conjunction with her book, are
expected to garner multimillions of dollars, by the estimates of
her sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, for which ABC increased its commercial rates
for sponsors more than fourfold, Ms. Lewinsky could not discuss her
seven-month struggle to avoid prosecution in exchange for
testifying about the sexual affair. This stricture was made part of
her immunity deal by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who
investigated the president and recommended impeachment. The Justice
Department now is considering an investigation of the fairness of
Starr's methods _ whether he misled Ms. Lewinsky and the Justice
Department in claiming jurisdiction to branch into the president's
private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's book had no such stricture, however, and it
accuses Starr of ``a level of zealous malevolence.'' It endorses
Hillary Rodham Clinton's denouncement of Starr as a ``politically
motivated prosecutor,'' part of the ``vast right-wing conspiracy''
Mrs. Clinton has alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are sentiments with which Monica, in the front line of
the war, entirely agrees,'' Morton writes.
</P>
<P>
   The account that the book gives of her relationship with the
president dovetails almost precisely with the one given by the
Starr report, although there are a few new details.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking is Ms. Lewinsky's revelation that during a lull in
the affair, she briefly dated a Pentagon employee, became pregnant
and had an abortion, which plunged her into depression and, at her
mother's urgings, sent her into psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Starr report obviously did not cover, and the book
explores in bracing and precise detail, is Ms. Lewinsky's treatment
by Starr, his deputies and investigators _ and the feelings she now
holds toward the independent counsel, a man who could still subject
to her criminal prosecution under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ```During his investigation,'' the book declares, ``Kenneth
Starr had not once met Monica Lewinsky, and yet she felt that he
had defiled and molested her _ not physically, but by using his
legal and constitutional power to strip away every last vestige of
her dignity and her humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   In August of last year, when Ms. Lewinsky was still in the midst
of detailing her relationship with the president, Starr wanted to
videotape the session, held away from the grand jury, during which
Ms. Lewinsky recited all of her sexual encounters with the
president, the book reports. ``It would have been the complete and
utter destruction of my soul,'' Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton.
</P>
<P>
   But her lawyers quashed the idea, and Ms. Lewinsky instead
shared the information in a private interview with two female
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton that the release of the Starr
report, with its exacting sexual details, devastated her. ``I just
felt that the world looked at me as a whore,'' she tells him.
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that Starr cared not a whit about his impact on
her or her family's lives. Her first bitter sense of being his
``pawn'' came on the day when she was detained by Starr's
investigators for more than 10 hours in a hotel in nearby Virginia,
lured there by her erstwhile friend, Linda Tripp, and the book
provides fresh details about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Tripp handed her over to Starr's investigators ``like
a latter-day Judas,'' the book says, Ms. Lewinsky reeled with
terror and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if my stomach had been cut open and someone had
poured acid into my wound,'' Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton. She further
says that she looked at Ms. Tripp and ``wanted to hurt her. I felt
like an animal wanting to claw at her skin.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, when Ms. Lewinsky was finally allowed a
brief call to her mother, who had been paging her, an FBI agent sat
by her, his finger hovering above the phone, ready to sever the
connection if Ms. Lewinsky revealed where she was and what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   The book asserts that even as Ms. Lewinsky was being threatened
with decades of prison time if she did not cooperate and even as an
investigator was flashing her the handcuffs beneath his jacket, she
strived to warn the president about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when she was allowed to go into a bathroom in the
mall near the hotel, she contemplated giving Betty Currie's number
and a set of instructions to a young mother changing her baby's
diapers, but decided against it. Days later, she was still trying
unsuccessfully to get word to Ms. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   The book portrays her _ obviously, in a flattering fashion _ as
a loyal, steadfast protector of the president, who had to rebuff
some of the tactics suggested by one of her initial lawyers,
William H. Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the car,'' Morton writes, ``he announced that he was going
to state publicly that the president had sexually harassed Monica
and that he was nothing more than a child molester.'' Monica
forbade it and pleaded to be committed to a psychiatric hospital as
a way out of the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The interview and book gave Ms. Lewinsky, the face that launched
a thousand pundits, a long-awaited and oft-delayed opportunity to
vent some opinions of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Her assessments of Starr, Tripp and even Ginsburg, her lawyer
for several months after she was first approached by Starr's
deputies, are withering; her contempt for these players in her
personal melodrama is untempered and undisguised.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many respects, ``Monica's Story,'' although written
by Morton in the third person, represents Ms. Lewinsky's attempt to
get even with the people who did her wrong, at least in her
generously lashed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp is treated most harshly, and most snidely, making her
entrance into the narrative of ``Monica's Story'' as a ``lumpy
figure'' draped in a ``dun-brown business suit.'' The book says
that at one point, after being successfully coached through a diet
by Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Tripp could finally avail herself of some of
the larger dresses in what Ms. Lewinsky, whose own weight
fluctuated wildly, dubbed her ``fat closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg is portrayed as a glutton for attention who relished
hobnobbing with the media elite, spoke recklessly, sowed suspicion
and ill will among members of the Lewinsky family as a method for
controlling them and exaggerated his closeness with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV interview, Ms. Lewinsky said the ``most difficult''
and pointed question she faced in the long ordeal came from a grand
juror who asked why she has had affairs with married men. ``I know
I will never have an affair with a married man again,'' she
insisted. ``What I've come to see is that that happened because I
didn't have enough feelings of self worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters asked about Ms. Lewinsky's gambit in suddenly flashing
her thong underwear at the president. ``Where do you get that nerve
for that?'' she asked as Ms. Lewinsky laughed and described it as a
``small, subtle, flirtatious gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dance,'' she said. ``I think it was saying, I'm
interested, too. I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said her mother sought to break off the
relationship but she stubbornly resisted. ``From the time I was 2
years old,'' she smilingly recounted, ``one of my first phrases was
_ with my hands on my hips: `You are not the boss of me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Confirming she sometimes screamed at Clinton in frustration, she
explained, ``I didn't see him as the president of the United
States. I saw him as a man. And that was how I treated him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My breath was taken away,'' she said of her first sighting of
the president at a routine White House arrival ceremony. ``It was
this man who was full of energy and sensuality and
attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the president reacted when she inquired if the affair
was merely sexual, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``He started to, uh,
tear up and told me that he never wanted me to think that.'' He
said the president, when told of her love, declared, ``That means a
lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the president gave her hope he might some day
marry her, Ms. Lewinsky firmly responded, ``He did. He said, `Well,
I might be alone in three years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She described White House officials who finally transferred her
away from the president to the Pentagon as ``the meanies.'' ``I
don't think that my relationship hurt the job he was doing,'' she
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have warm feelings, sometimes I'm proud of him
still, and sometimes I hate his guts,'' she told Walters. ``And,
um, he makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, Ms. Lewinsky cried when she signed an
immunity deal to testify about her affair because she did not want
to hurt the president. But her feelings subsequently grew more
complicated and there were times she resented Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered how I could have ever cared about this man,'' Ms.
Lewinsky tells Morton. ``He was so self-righteous and
self-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   The book endeavors, in some fashion, to provide a psychological
deconstruction of Ms. Lewinsky and how she fell into an affair with
the president. As a child, it recounts, she sometimes wore a
T-shirt that said ``Daddy's Little Girl'' but was estranged from
her father after he and her mother divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The book's leitmotifs seem to be crying and dieting. Ms.
Lewinsky sheds tears just about every four paragraphs and filters
every episode through her weight at the moment. She even recalls
that the first time the president removed his shirt in front of
her, he sucked in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will you tell your children, when you have them?'' she
was asked at the end of the television interview. To which she
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy made a big mistake.''

MONICA LEWINSKY TELLS HER SIDE OF THE STORY, IN PRINT AND ON
TELEVISION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally free to seek self-justification and
personal profit, Monica Lewinsky opened a double-fronted campaign
on Wednesday to explain the sexual affair that triggered the
impeachment of President Clinton and put the nation through a
harrowing year of scandal tracking.
</P>
<P>
   By television interview and book publication, the former White
House intern sought to frame a different, more sympathetic image of
herself as a venturesome romantic who meant well but became
ensnared in the criminal investigation of the president's
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a pawn used to get the president,'' she said in the
book, ``Monica's Story'' (St. Martin's Press), written by Andrew
Morton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's sorry he got caught,'' Ms. Lewinsky said of the
president in the ABC-TV interview. But, ever hesitating to fully
renounce him, she added that ``when I think of the person I thought
Bill Clinton was, he had genuine remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview, with Barbara Walters on ``20-20,'' was one of the
first interrogations conducted without benefit of sworn oath by the
25-year-old California woman since she was confronted by

UMASS OVERCOMES DUQUESNE, 80-70 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The season of uncertainty marches on, but not
without another perplexing turn.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts shook off occasional
sluggishness and beat scrappy Duquesne, 80-70, Wednesday in the
first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament. The Minutemen played
some of their best ball in the second half with starting point
guard Charlton Clarke on the bench after he aggravated the stress
fracture in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   With the Minutemen (14-15) facing defending A-10 tournament
champ Xavier (20-9) in the quarterfinal round Thursday at 2:30
p.m., Clarke's status becomes crucial. After Wednesday's game,
Clarke said he would spend the night icing the foot and would play
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve point guard Rafael Cruz (5 points) overcame four
turnovers to help stabilize the UMass offense and the Minutemen got
quality outside shooting from Monty Mack (27 points) and a post
presence from Lari Ketner (18 points, 11 rebounds) to hold off the
Dukes (5-23). Duquesne outplayed the Minutemen through much of the
first half and led, 30-28, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the second season for them, so you knew (Duquesne) was
going to come out and play hard,'' said UMass coach Bruiser Flint.
``That's what playoff basketball is all about. They kept battling,
and we just pushed it up and made some big plays. In the second
half, we played to win. In the first half, we played not to lose
and we were tentative.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Courtney Wallace (27 points) and Wayne Smith (19 points,
9 rebounds), Duquesne rendered a gallant attempt to keep its season
alive. The Dukes withstood a 9-0 UMass run at the start of the
second half and trailed, 55-53, with 6:12 left.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when UMass' depth and size took over and the
Minutemen all but put the game away with a 16-5 run. Backup forward
Winston Smith keyed the surge, forcing a tie-up on a loose ball
after teammate Chris Kirkland missed the second of two free throws
with 4:31 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UMass got the ball back, and Kirkland sank two free throws with
4:09 left to give UMass a 63-54 lead. Then Smith sank a trey for a
66-56 lead with 3:05 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Said Duquesne coach Darrelle Porter: ``We played a great first
half, but in the second half they outplayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duquesne is no Xavier. The Musketeers, which earned a
first-round bye, feature arguably the league's best backcourt in
seniors Gary Lumpkin and Lenny Brown. Even with Clarke, the
Minutemen will need an exceptional effort to match its
double-overtime win over Xavier Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what his staus is,'' Flint said of Clarke.
``He said his foot was hurting so we didn't put him back in in the
second half. If he's hurt, we have to play without him. Whether he
plays is up to him, but we haven't addressed it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play him in the second half because he couldn't help
me. He couldn't guard anybody, so I said, `You might as well sit
down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's stress fracture, on his fourth metatarsil, was revealed
after an X-ray four weeks ago. He said he aggravated the injury in
the second half Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who said he has not taken any pain killers and
anti-inflammatories, said he does expect it to be a factor
Thursday. ``I have the whole night and day to ice it as much as I
can and we'll see what happens after that,'' he said. ``I will be
out there because this is do-or-die time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he considered asking Flint to put him back in
Wednesday, ``but Cruz was giving us good minutes and so was
Jonathan DePina, so I know that will boost their confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint seems prepared to go with Cruz, a sophomore known as much
for his turnovers as his outside shooting. Flint said that everyone
must help in the backcourt against Xavier's pressure. ``I thought
he did a good job and the thing he does is make fouls shots when he
gets fouled,'' Flint said of Cruz.

 WASHINGTON: her humanity.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In August of last year, when Ms. Lewinsky was still in the midst
of detailing her relationship with the president, Starr wanted to
videotape the session, held away from the grand jury, during which
Ms. Lewinsky recited all of her sexual encounters with the
president, the book reports. ``It would have been the complete and
utter destruction of my soul,'' Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton.

Lewinsky tells Morton. ``He was so self-righteous and
self-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   The book endeavors, in some fashion, to provide a psychological
deconstruction of Ms. Lewinsky and how she fell into an affair with
the president. As a child, it recounts, she sometimes wore a
T-shirt that said ``Daddy's Little Girl'' but was estranged from
her father after he and her mother divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The book's leitmotifs seem to be crying and dieting. Ms.
Lewinsky sheds tears just about every four paragraphs and filters
every episode through her weight at the moment. She even recalls
that the first time the president removed his shirt in front of
her, he sucked in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will you tell your children, when you have them?'' she
was asked at the end of the television interview. To which she
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy made a big mistake.''

MONICA LEWINSKY TELLS HER SIDE OF THE STORY, IN PRINT AND ON
TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
 (Also moved in `w' category; see also LEWINSKY-MEDIA)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally free to seek self-justification and
personal profit, Monica Lewinsky opened a double-fronted campaign
on Wednesday to explain the sexual affair that triggered the
impeachment of President Clinton and put the nation through a
harrowing year of scandal tracking.
</P>
<P>
   By television interview and book publication, the former White
House intern sought to frame a different, more sympathetic image of
herself as a venturesome romantic who meant well but became
ensnared in the criminal investigation of the president's
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a pawn used to get the president,'' she said in the
book, ``Monica's Story'' (St. Martin's Press), written by Andrew
Morton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's sorry he got caught,'' Ms. Lewinsky said of the
president in the ABC-TV interview. But, ever hesitating to fully
renounce him, she added that ``when I think of the person I thought
Bill Clinton was, he had genuine remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview, with Barbara Walters on ``20-20,'' was one of the
first interrogations conducted without benefit of sworn oath by the
25-year-old California woman since she was confronted by
prosecutors 13 months ago. Her revelations caused a presidential
crisis in which Clinton finally was acquitted by the Senate last
month of perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive
me, but I would ask them to know that I am very sorry for what
happened and for what they've been through,'' Ms. Lewinsky told
Walters in the first of a series of worldwide television and
magazine interviews that, in conjunction with her book, are
expected to garner multimillions of dollars, by the estimates of
her sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, for which ABC increased its commercial rates
for sponsors more than fourfold, Ms. Lewinsky could not discuss her
seven-month struggle to avoid prosecution in exchange for
testifying about the sexual affair. This stricture was made part of
her immunity deal by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who
investigated the president and recommended impeachment. The Justice
Department now is considering an investigation of the fairness of
Starr's methods _ whether he misled Ms. Lewinsky and the Justice
Department in claiming jurisdiction to branch into the president's
private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's book had no such stricture, however, and it
accuses Starr of ``a level of zealous malevolence.'' It endorses
Hillary Rodham Clinton's denouncement of Starr as a ``politically
motivated prosecutor,'' part of the ``vast right-wing conspiracy''
Mrs. Clinton has alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are sentiments with which Monica, in the front line of
the war, entirely agrees,'' Morton writes.
</P>
<P>
   The account that the book gives of her relationship with the
president dovetails almost precisely with the one given by the
Starr report, although there are a few new details.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking is Ms. Lewinsky's revelation that during a lull in
the affair, she briefly dated a Pentagon employee, became pregnant
and had an abortion, which plunged her into depression and, at her
mother's urgings, sent her into psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Starr report obviously did not cover, and the book
explores in bracing and precise detail, is Ms. Lewinsky's treatment
by Starr, his deputies and investigators _ and the feelings she now
holds toward the independent counsel, a man who could still subject
to her criminal prosecution under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ```During his investigation,'' the book declares, ``Kenneth
Starr had not once met Monica Lewinsky, and yet she felt that he
had defiled and molested her _ not physically, but by using his
legal and constitutional power to strip away every last vestige of
her dignity and her humanity.''

YOUNG BC TEAM TROUNCED BY SYRACUSE, 96-55 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It went down as the worst conference loss of the
worst season in the annals of Boston College basketball. And while
BC's 96-55 loss Wednesday in the first round of the Big East
tournmanent at Madison Square Garden was the kind of blowout
everyone initially feared would occur on a nightly basis for BC's
young and inexperienced squad, it only proved to be the case
against one conference team this year: The Syracuse Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite preseason prognostications that pegged them to finish
last in the league _ and maybe even as the worst team ever in
conference history _ the Eagles gave an honest acquittal of
themselves by playing all year with extraordinary heart,
scrappiness and fierce determination. Until, that is, the No. 13
seed Eagles (6-21) simply expired with a futile gasp in Wednesday's
41-point loss to the fourth-seeded Orangemen (20-10) that ranked as
the biggest rout in the history of the conference tourney.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the face of that, BC coach Al Skinner saw some
semblance of improvement in his team that all began after a
demoralizing 62-61 nonconference loss to Harvard Nov. 21. ``We went
from being a terrible team after that game, to being just a bad
team,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   BC's devastating loss to Syracuse was its worst since a 61-point
thrashing against Marshall, 130-69, in the 1955-56 season. It also
matched Providence College's 41-point setback to Georgetown, 85-44,
in 1985 as the league's most lopsided game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what I told the players after the loss this
afternoon is that, unfortunately, this game is not really
reflective on how we performed the last couple months of the
season,'' said Skinner, whose 1998-99 team wound up losing more
games than any other in BC history, but still managed to string
together three consecutive conference home victories over Notre
Dame, Seton Hall and West Virginia. ``So, it's very disappointing
from that standpoint that we really didn't show the way we've
played the last month. I think that's what hurts the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syracuse has played extremely well against us,'' he added.
``They have every time we've played against them and we knew that
we were going to be in for a long afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Eagles were unable to find a solution for the
problematic Etan Thomas, Syracuse's 6-foot-8-inch swatmeister who
was voted the conference's Defensive Player of the Year. Thomas who
led the Orangemen with 19 points on 8-for-13 shooting and helped
Syracuse dominate the boards, 52-23, by grabbing 9 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse's three convincing victories over BC this season _
all by a combined margin of 97 points _ Thomas scored 58 points,
grabbed 23 rebounds and blocked 9 shots in 65 minutes of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are just matchups with certain teams and Boston
College has just had trouble with us inside this year,'' said
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, whose team established a tourney record
not only for scoring margin (erasing the 33-point romp, 103-70, the
Orangemen suffered in the 1993 tourney final against Seton Hall)
but also for rebounding margin, surpassing its own mark (28, 54-26)
set against BC in 1986. ``With Etan Thomas, they really have nobody
that can stay with him. I thought today we came out focused. We did
a good job of getting the ball. Our defense was good and we didn't
let them get any open shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're just bigger and strong than them.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident by the way Syracuse went opened the game
with a 12-0 run, before allowing BC to get on the board on Michael
Cotton's 3-pointer with 16:48 to go. By the 8:27 mark, Syracuse
controlled a 25-8 lead. At that juncture, Jason Hart, who had 11 of
his 15 total points, and Thomas, who had 9,each had outscored the
Eagles, single-handedly. By halftime, the Orangemen led by 29,
47-18.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Eagles came out and scored 15 points in the first
4:43, they didn't surpass Syracuse's first-half total until 6:47
remained in the game when Willie Deane, who led BC with 14 points
off the bench, hit a 3-pointer. By then, Syracuse controlled a
whopping 37-point lead, 83-46, that wound up growing to 41 by
game's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give them credit for the exceptional game that
they played,'' Skinner said, saluting the Orangemen. ``But the good
thing is that, you know, all my guys are going to be coming back.
We're gong to be spending some time trying to improve ourselves.
But, like I said, the most disappointing thing is that this game
was not reflective on how we've played in the league this year.''

 WASHINGTON: her humanity.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In August of last year, when Ms. Lewinsky was still in the midst
of detailing her relationship with the president, Starr wanted to
videotape the session, held away from the grand jury, during which
Ms. Lewinsky recited all of her sexual encounters with the
president, the book reports. ``It would have been the complete and
utter destruction of my soul,'' Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton.
</P>
<P>
   But her lawyers quashed the idea, and Ms. Lewinsky instead
shared the information in a private interview with two female
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton that the release of the Starr
report, with its exacting sexual details, devastated her. ``I just
felt that the world looked at me as a whore,'' she tells him.
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that Starr cared not a whit about his impact on
her or her family's lives. Her first bitter sense of being his
``pawn'' came on the day when she was detained by Starr's
investigators for more than 10 hours in a hotel in nearby Virginia,
lured there by her erstwhile friend, Linda Tripp, and the book
provides fresh details about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Tripp handed her over to Starr's investigators ``like
a latter-day Judas,'' the book says, Ms. Lewinsky reeled with
terror and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if my stomach had been cut open and someone had
poured acid into my wound,'' Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton. She further
says that she looked at Ms. Tripp and ``wanted to hurt her. I felt
like an animal wanting to claw at her skin.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, when Ms. Lewinsky was finally allowed a
brief call to her mother, who had been paging her, an FBI agent sat
by her, his finger hovering above the phone, ready to sever the
connection if Ms. Lewinsky revealed where she was and what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   The book asserts that even as Ms. Lewinsky was being threatened
with decades of prison time if she did not cooperate and even as an
investigator was flashing her the handcuffs beneath his jacket, she
strived to warn the president about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when she was allowed to go into a bathroom in the
mall near the hotel, she contemplated giving Betty Currie's number
and a set of instructions to a young mother changing her baby's
diapers, but decided against it. Days later, she was still trying
unsuccessfully to get word to Ms. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   The book portrays her _ obviously, in a flattering fashion _ as
a loyal, steadfast protector of the president, who had to rebuff
some of the tactics suggested by one of her initial lawyers,
William H. Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the car,'' Morton writes, ``he announced that he was going
to state publicly that the president had sexually harassed Monica
and that he was nothing more than a child molester.'' Monica
forbade it and pleaded to be committed to a psychiatric hospital as
a way out of the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The interview and book gave Ms. Lewinsky, the face that launched
a thousand pundits, a long-awaited and oft-delayed opportunity to
vent some opinions of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Her assessments of Starr, Tripp and even Ginsburg, her lawyer
for several months after she was first approached by Starr's
deputies, are withering; her contempt for these players in her
personal melodrama is untempered and undisguised.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many respects, ``Monica's Story,'' although written
by Morton in the third person, represents Ms. Lewinsky's attempt to
get even with the people who did her wrong, at least in her
generously lashed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp is treated most harshly, and most snidely, making her
entrance into the narrative of ``Monica's Story'' as a ``lumpy
figure'' draped in a ``dun-brown business suit.'' The book says
that at one point, after being successfully coached through a diet
by Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Tripp could finally avail herself of some of
the larger dresses in what Ms. Lewinsky, whose own weight
fluctuated wildly, dubbed her ``fat closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg is portrayed as a glutton for attention who relished
hobnobbing with the media elite, spoke recklessly, sowed suspicion
and ill will among members of the Lewinsky family as a method for
controlling them and exaggerated his closeness with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV interview, Ms. Lewinsky said the ``most difficult''
and pointed question she faced in the long ordeal came from a grand
juror who asked why she has had affairs with married men. ``I know
I will never have an affair with a married man again,'' she
insisted. ``What I've come to see is that that happened because I
didn't have enough feelings of self worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters asked about Ms. Lewinsky's gambit in suddenly flashing
her thong underwear at the president. ``Where do you get that nerve
for that?'' she asked as Ms. Lewinsky laughed and described it as a
``small, subtle, flirtatious gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dance,'' she said. ``I think it was saying, I'm
interested, too. I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said her mother sought to break off the
relationship but she stubbornly resisted. ``From the time I was 2
years old,'' she smilingly recounted, ``one of my first phrases was
_ with my hands on my hips: `You are not the boss of me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Confirming she sometimes screamed at Clinton in frustration, she
explained, ``I didn't see him as the president of the United
States. I saw him as a man. And that was how I treated him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My breath was taken away,'' she said of her first sighting of
the president at a routine White House arrival ceremony. ``It was
this man who was full of energy and sensuality and
attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the president reacted when she inquired if the affair
was merely sexual, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``He started to, uh,
tear up and told me that he never wanted me to think that.'' He
said the president, when told of her love, declared, ``That means a
lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the president gave her hope he might some day
marry her, Ms. Lewinsky firmly responded, ``He did. He said, `Well,
I might be alone in three years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She described White House officials who finally transferred her
away from the president to the Pentagon as ``the meanies.'' ``I
don't think that my relationship hurt the job he was doing,'' she
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have warm feelings, sometimes I'm proud of him
still, and sometimes I hate his guts,'' she told Walters. ``And,
um, he makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, Ms. Lewinsky cried when she signed an
immunity deal to testify about her affair because she did not want
to hurt the president. But her feelings subsequently grew more
complicated and there were times she resented Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered how I could have ever cared about this man,'' Ms.
Lewinsky tells Morton. ``He was so self-righteous and
self-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   The book endeavors, in some fashion, to provide a psychological
deconstruction of Ms. Lewinsky and how she fell into an affair with
the president. As a child, it recounts, she sometimes wore a

that the first time the president removed his shirt in front of
her, he sucked in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will you tell your children, when you have them?'' she
was asked at the end of the television interview. To which she
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy made a big mistake.''

ISLAMIC TERRORIST IS SAID TO HAVE FALLING OUT WITH HIS AFGHAN
PROTECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By TIM WEINER 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist, and the
Taliban, his protectors in Afghanistan, have had a violent
falling-out, raising the possibility that his days of refuge may be
numbered, senior American officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three American officials and two representatives of the Taliban,
which is the armed religious movement that runs Afghanistan, said a
fight broke out three weeks ago in Kandahar among bin Laden's
bodyguards and a group of Taliban officials assigned to watch over
him.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, the officials said, bin Laden was expelled from
Kandahar, the Afghan city in which he had taken refuge with his
family; transported into isolation in the Afghan countryside, and
stripped of his satellite telephones, which American officials said
allowed him to plot with fellow radicals throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is friction between him and the Taliban,'' one senior
American official said. ``They have tried to constrain him for the
first time and tried to limit his communications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good sign,'' he said, and it indicates that bin Laden,
the Saudi exile indicted for masterminding the deadly bombings of
two American embassies in Africa in August, may have worn out his
welcome with the Taliban, which has sheltered him since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban has shown no sign that it is willing to deliver bin
Laden into the hands of the United States, senior American
officials said. But one senior official said the Taliban had sent a
clear signal that its desire to protect bin Laden was waning.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, a senior Taliban official, said the
fugitive had become a problem for his hosts. ``His presence is not
a benefit to the people of Afghanistan,'' he said, but ``a puzzle
for the Afghan leadership'' to solve.
</P>
<P>
   The senior American officials said they were not certain of bin
Laden's current location, only that he and his Taliban guards move
from place to place in the stony wilds of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Taliban also say they have no idea of bin
Laden's whereabouts. Privately, they are pondering what to do with
him, a second Taliban representative said.
</P>
<P>
   They have sent an emissary to the United States asking how to
deal with him without being seen to double-cross him, and they have
asked Saudi Arabia if it would take care of his wives and children,
said the Taliban representative, who demanded anonymity, as did the
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   All gave similar accounts of the breach between bin Laden and
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10, they said, bin Laden's bodyguards became furious
when a group of 10 or more Taliban officials moved to supplant
them. By one account, automatic weapons were fired.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, ``bin Laden found himself in a confined and
difficult situation,'' said Mujahid, the Taliban's permanent
representative-designate to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the Taliban leadership formally replaced bin
Laden's bodyguards with members of their intelligence service and
foreign ministry, instructing their men to make bin Laden disappear
from public view, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership decided to cut all communications from him, and
even his telephone set has been taken from him,'' Mujahid said.
``He has been told no foreigner can talk to him. Ten bodyguards
were provided for him. The duty of the bodyguards was to supervise
him and observe that he will not contact any foreigner or use any
communication system in Afghanistan. He is now isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight broke out over the degree of control the Taliban would
have over bin Laden, another Taliban representative said.
</P>
<P>
   It came a week after Karl F. Inderfurth, an assistant secretary
of state, met in Pakistan with Jalil Akhund, the Taliban's deputy
foreign minister, and repeated American demands to turn over bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, citing Islamic law and Afghan custom, have said
publicly that they cannot expel him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is a puzzle for the Afghan leadership,'' Mujahid
said. ``In World War II, we couldn't hand over German citizens
living in Afghanistan to the Allied forces. Regarding Osama bin
Laden, if we would do something in this regard, it is totally
against the Afghan character.'' Bin Laden is considered a hero in
Afghanistan for his financial and military support to the Afghan
rebels who defeated Soviet invaders in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side,'' said Mujahid, ``his presence is not a
benefit to the people of Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, a radical Islamic movement with few friends among
nations, desperately wants international recognition and foreign
aid. It will receive little while it shelters bin Laden. But it
cannot be seen to hand over bin Laden to the United States or do
him harm, a Taliban representative said. Though mutual mistrust
complicates any cooperation, the Taliban's leaders have at least
three ways to deal with bin Laden that would be acceptable to the
United States, senior American officials said:
</P>
<P>
   _ They could secretly arrange for members of another nation's
intelligence service to learn of his whereabouts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   _ They could deliver him discreetly to a former Soviet republic
on Afghanistan's northern borders, where American law-enforcement
and intelligence officers could try to apprehend him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Or they could keep bin Laden firmly under control,
incommunicado, in the hope that he might dwindle away as a source
of anti-American terror.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials think this last solution the best, since
it holds no risk of making bin Laden a martyr, which could inspire
fresh attacks against the United States from his followers. Others
want to see him apprehended, whatever the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afghanistan is the safest place in the world for me,'' bin
Laden said last year. If that is no longer true, he has very few
alternatives, American officials said. Somalia is one and Iraq is
another, they said, but it would be very difficult for him to
travel internationally undetected, and neither nation can guarantee
the protection he has enjoyed until now.

data networking business by forming a new American subsidiary,
acquiring two private companies in the United States, investing in
a third and hiring a senior executive from IBM, executives close to
the company's planning said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, one of Europe's biggest manufacturing companies, is
also in preliminary discussions with 3Com Corp. about paying $1.2
billion for the 3Com unit that sells networking equipment to
telephone companies, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens plans to announce on Monday that it has agreed to
acquire Castle Networks Inc., a private data networking company
based in Westford, Mass., for about $300 million in cash, and Argon
Networks Inc., a private data networking company based in
Littleton, Mass., for about $240 million in cash, the executives
said. Siemens will also announce an agreement to acquire a $30
million stake in Accelerated Networks Inc., a private company based
in Moorpark, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions will be folded into a new Siemens venture to be
based in Boston, the executives said. While the internal code name
of the project has been Siemens.com, the new unit may be the first
Siemens venture not to include the Siemens name.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens is close to a deal to hire Martin Clague, general
manager for global network computing solutions at IBM Corp., to
become chief executive of the new venture, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, Castle, Argon, Accelerated and Clague declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Siemens said the board of the new company
would include Clague; Fred Fromm, chief executive of Siemens'
American operations; Thomas Rambold, president of Siemens' current
data networking group; Dan Smith, chief executive of Sycamore
Networks Inc. and former chief executive of Cascade Communications,
and George Conrades, former chairman of BBN Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens is a big maker of traditional telephone equipment,
though its communications business is not as prominent in the
United States as in some other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   With its string of deals, Siemens is set to become the second
European maker of traditional telephone equipment this month to
make a big push into the data communications market, which is
booming as the Internet expands around the world. The volume of
data traffic may soon outstrip the volume of voice telephone
conversations on the world's communications networks. On Tuesday,
Alcatel of France said it would buy Xylan Corp., which makes
equipment for linking computers in corporate and institutional
networks, for almost $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The exploding popularity of the Internet and corporations'
voracious appetite for data have forced the big, old makers of
telephone equipment to expand their expertise and product lines.
Many of the big communications carriers that spend billions each
year to upgrade their systems want to stop operating separate voice
and data networks. Instead, they would like to run single networks
based in advanced data technologies, layering traditional voice
phone calls on top as just another function, like Web browsing or
the automated verification of credit card information.
</P>
<P>
   That has set off a frenzy among the telecommunications equipment
vendors to fulfill the desire. In January, Lucent Technologies
Inc., North America's biggest maker of phone equipment, agreed to
spend $20 billion to buy Ascend Communications Inc., a big data
networking player. And last year, Northern Telecom of Canada agreed
to acquire Bay Networks Inc. for $9.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to Siemens' plan, the company has
set aside about 3 billion marks, or $1.7 billion, to invest in its
new venture. The company is considering folding its existing
operations in the United States into the venture and selling stock
in the subsidiary later this year, the executives said, adding that
a final decision on those two possibilities had not been made. A
public stock offering could serve Siemens' interests by giving it a
currency, in the form of an American stock, to make more
acquisitions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any deal with 3Com, however, would probably be for cash. 3Com
has struggled recently as it tries to manage different businesses:
a unit that sells advanced equipment to phone companies, a unit
that sells network cards for personal computers to computer makers,
a unit that sells modems to consumers and a business selling the
popular Palm Pilot hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the talks, 3Com recently asked
Newbridge Networks of Canada, another company that makes data
networking equipment, if it would be interested in acquiring the
3Com unit that sells equipment to big phone companies. But
Newbridge declined.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge has its own alliance with Siemens, but executives
close to Siemens said the relationship was in tatters and that the
deals Siemens would announce Monday would make clear that the
partnership with Newbridge is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Castle manufactures equipment that makes it easier for
traditional telephone systems to communicate with newer products
based on Internet technology. Accelerated makes products that help
allow local phone companies to deploy new, advanced services to
their customers. And Argon makes equipment that switches digital
information among different points at high speeds. The deal for
Argon was first reported last month by The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Siemens and to Clague will be to integrate the
different technologies into a coherent product line and the
different companies into a coherent organization. Among the other
executives approached by Siemens for the new post were William
O'Shea and Gerald Butters, two senior Lucent executives, according
to executives close to Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   All of the wonders of digital technology, however, cannot add
more hours to the day. Siemens focused on East Coast companies,
executives close to Siemens said, because it wanted to minimize the
time difference between Germany and the new American operation. The
executives said that Siemens agreed to make a minority investment
in Accelerated rather than acquire the entire company partly
because Accelerated is based in California.

PEOPLE IN NEW YORK ARE AT GREATER RISK OF DYING OF HEART ATTACKS,
STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (sw) 
 By HOCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who live in New York City _ and even those who are just
visiting the city _ are more likely than other Americans to die of
heart attacks, according to researchers from California.
</P>
<P>
   And as soon as visitors leave, the researchers said, the chance
that their deaths will be caused by a heart attack declines.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not address whether the lives of New Yorkers or
visitors to the city are cut shorter than average, but rather
suggested that heart attack is the more common cause when death
occurs than it is elsewhere in the United States, said the
researchers, who are scheduled to discuss their findings at a
scientific meeting in San Diego on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They drew their conclusions from a computer analysis of data
from 20 million death certificates in New York and 10 other cities.
They could not explain the finding, but they and other experts in
heart disease listed a variety of possible factors, including
stress, overexcitement, heavy traffic that delays ambulances and
even inconsistencies in filling out death certificates. Some health
experts have long voiced doubts about the accuracy of death
certificates, saying that some doctors list heart attacks when the
actual cause may not have been found.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the University of California at San Diego,
compiled death certificate data from 1985 to 1994 and used
computers to determine the number of deaths by heart attacks. They
found that death rates from heart attacks among New York residents
were 55 percent higher than the American average. The rates among
visitors were 33 percent higher, and the number of people who died
of heart attacks after they left the city was 20 percent lower than
what they would have been in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The team then studied 10 other cities: Los Angeles, Chicago,
Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Diego, Phoenix, Detroit, San
Antonio and San Jose. Deaths from heart attacks in those cities did
not vary significantly from the national averages.
</P>
<P>
   The study accounted for differences in age, race and sex; for
example, the researchers compared death rates among people over 90
in New York City with those in the same age group in the other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Christenfeld, a professor of psychology who directed
the study, said he and his colleagues could not explain what set
New York City apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be stress,'' he said. ``It could be the thrill of
going into the Museum of Modern Art or despair of trying to hail a
taxi during a rainstorm. But what we do conclude is that there is
an acute effect of being in New York. And it is not an experience
other American cities can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Greenland, chairman of American Heart Association's
population science committee, said the findings on visitors were
particularly surprising, because ``these are presumably are mobile,
relatively healthy people.''

FIRST LADY'S VISIT TO NEW YORK HAS THE LOOK OF A CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a speech that many Democrats viewed as a strong
indication that Hillary Rodham Clinton would run for the Senate
from New York, the first lady Wednesday proclaimed her commitment
to government and politics before some of her most passionate
supporters, New York Democratic women, in a packed and enthusiastic
ballroom of the Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot drop out of the political process and leave the
arena to those with very specific agendas,'' Mrs. Clinton said in
remarks so rich with double meaning that some women wondered if the
first lady was referring to them, to herself or to both.
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``you can say all you want about the flaws of our
political system, but when it comes right down to it, somebody is
going to make the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton started her day in New York as a
traditional first lady with a visit to a Queens school and a speech
about the importance of arts education, by the time she arrived at
the Plaza she seemed transformed into a potential Senate candidate
at an exuberant political rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think it's time for a woman to represent New York in
the United States Senate?'' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer to cheers
as he introduced Mrs. Clinton to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Clinton's first visit to New York since announcing
two weeks ago that she was giving ``careful thought'' to a Senate
run in the state. She addressed the issue almost immediately when
she came to the podium. ``There was talk I might have an
announcement to make,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I do not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton seemed to tease the crowd, a Democratic Party
fund-raising group called the Women's Leadership Forum, as she
spoke about a woman's responsibility to participate in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say `I won't be involved in politics because I don't
like all of the negativity, I don't like all of the ads on
television,''' Mrs. Clinton said. She added to laughter that ``I
can certainly understand why someone might feel that way, but it is
not a feeling that you should act on.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York state
Democratic party and one of the most ardent supporters of a Hillary
Clinton candidacy, said in an interview that Mrs. Clinton was
``publicly sharing her thought process with us'' as she considers a
Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, one of the few men to attend
the lunch, went so far as to call Mrs. Clinton's speech ``very
close to an open declaration'' of candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But some women at the lunch for 900, who paid from $150 to
$10,000 per ticket, described the speech as nothing more than
``classic Hillary'' in its advocacy for women and children and its
view of politics as a higher calling. Some of it, in fact, was
recycled material from a speech Mrs. Clinton made at the 150th
anniversary of the first women's convention in Seneca Falls last
summer. At the Plaza, Mrs. Clinton spoke about what she considers
the obligations of this generation of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like those women in Seneca Falls, we are standing in for
countless other women who cannot be here, who couldn't afford the
ticket, wouldn't think they had anything to wear, or anything to
contribute, who wouldn't see themselves as a political person at
all,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``One of our great challenges in the next
years is to make sure that our society doesn't split apart along
income lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made no reference to her potential opponent, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who in a reversal of geography spent Wednesday in
Washington testifying about crime reduction and cutting welfare
roles before a congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after his testimony, Giuliani said that
Mrs. Clinton is ``acting like a Senatorial candidate, I'm acting
like a Mayor. That's not a bad comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani have announced plans to run
for the Senate seat to be vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Giuliani from pointing to a poll released
Wednesday by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion that showed
Mrs. Clinton in a statistical tie in a hypothetical race with the
mayor, 50 percent for Mrs. Clinton and 46 percent for the
mayor. &UR;  &LR; The poll was taken among New York registered voters and
showed a drop in her support in a Marist poll of two weeks ago,
when she was ahead, 49 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at today's Marist and see if she's crowned the
winner,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added that Mrs. Clinton's ``celebrity status is helping
her a great deal'' but ``when she becomes a candidate'' and ``maybe
even faster, it's coming down to more and more questions in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean she wouldn't be a strong candidate,'' he
added. ``But so will the Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani predicted a very close ``two to three point election.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's visit to New York, which coincided with ABC's
highly publicized ``20/20'' interview with Monica S. Lewinsky, drew
enormous media attention, rivaling that of a presidential visit.
There were 25 video cameras from the networks and foreign, local
and cable channels positioned in the auditorium of the Adrien Block
Intermediate School 25 in Flushing, Queens, where Mrs. Clinton did
nothing more political than release a national report about the
benefits of arts education.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, Mrs. Clinton stopped at the Manhattan home
of Lynn Forester, a longtime Democratic supporter and an owner of a
wireless communications company.
</P>
<P>
   Later she went to a dinner at the home of Jurate Kazickas and
Roger C. Altman, an investment banker who was President Clinton's
Deputy Treasury Secretary and whose firm bought The National
Enquirer and Star magazine two weeks ago. The dinner was described
as a gathering of 15 people, not a fund-raising event, that was to
include business executives and leaders of nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters who have talked to Mrs. Clinton in recent
days said she has not decided whether she will run, but that she is
continuing her methodical research into the race. They described
her in recent days as excited about the idea of serving in the
Senate both because of her idealism about government and the
enticement of at last having a political career independent of her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said he had spoken to Mrs. Clinton
for 20 minutes on the phone Tuesday night, and that the first lady
``asked me what I thought, if people really would welcome somebody
who wasn't a born and bred New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   After her remarks at the school, Mrs. Clinton was surrounded by
well-wishers and a mob of reporters, who were kept at a distance by
the Secret Service. Mrs. Clinton's staff said the first lady would
answer no questions from the press.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza Hotel was even more crowded. Guests at the lunch,
which raised $500,000 for the Democratic National Committee and
sold out two weeks ago, were split into two _ one group in the
ballroom where Mrs. Clinton spoke, and another in separate room to
watch Mrs. Clinton on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many citizens of New York who had opinions about the
first lady's visit Wednesday was Cathy Arevalo, 14, a ninth grader
at P.S. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a campaign appearance,'' she said.

GERM WARFARE ATROCITIES: JAPAN'S HALF-CENTURY OF STONEWALLING THE
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL with JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after the Japanese army attacked China with
germ weapons and conducted gruesome experiments on thousands of
human beings, Japan is resisting demands that it compensate the
victims or make records of the atrocities public.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has declined to cooperate with efforts
by the Justice Department to put the names of several hundred
surviving veterans of the germ warfare operations on a list of
suspected war criminals barred from entering the United States,
U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   It has also rebuffed researchers seeking access to a vast
archive of military documents in Tokyo that detail the World War II
activities of the Japanese Imperial Army, including its chief
biological warfare arm, known as Unit 731.
</P>
<P>
   The American authorities seized the archive after World War II
but returned it to Japan in 1958 after only a small number of
documents were copied.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's approach stands in contrast to that of Germany, which
has paid about $80 billion to war victims and their families.
Private industries and banks in Germany and Switzerland plan to pay
billions more.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the refusal of the Japanese government to release
information, new details are emerging about the scope of the
biological program. Research by scholars, campaigns by the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles and the Global Alliance for
Preserving the History of World War II in Asia, and a lawsuit in
Japan by Chinese plaintiffs have unleashed a flood of new accounts
that substantially expand the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts have heightened tensions between Japan and its
neighbors. They suggest that Japan's World War II germ attacks were
even more widespread than first thought, stretching from Burma (now
Myanmar), Thailand, Singapore and the Dutch East Indies (now
Indonesia) to Russia and Chinese cities and hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from Japan's biological warfare remains in
dispute. Some scholars assert that several hundred thousand people
died, mostly in China. Others say the casualties were far lower.
Scholars estimate that an additional 10,000 prisoners were killed
in experiments, perhaps a dozen times the number who died at the
hands of Dr. Josef Mengele and other Nazi scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Eli M. Rosenbaum, director of the Office of Special
Investigations in the Justice Department, said the dispute between
Tokyo and Washington over suspected war criminals has been quietly
building for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's worldwide list of war crimes suspects
now includes the names of about 60,000 Germans and other Europeans,
including Kurt Waldheim, the former U.N. secretary-general,
president of Austria and wartime intelligence officer in Hitler's
army.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Rosenbaum said the United States had dates of birth
and other identifying data on fewer than 100 suspected Japanese war
criminals. The Justice Department has hundreds of names to add to
the ``watch list,'' but it cannot do so until Japan confirms basic
information like dates of birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a friendly government to deny us access is astonishing,
beyond the pale,'' Rosenbaum said. ``Most outrageous of all is that
the Japanese government will not provide the dates of birth of war
crimes suspects identified by OSI so that they can be barred from
the United States. They won't even tell us if they will ever assist
us.''
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese Embassy press spokesman in Washington, Tsuyoshi
Yamamoto, said his government would have no comment because the
issue concerned ``the specifics of Japanese cooperation with the
United States, which are of a diplomatic nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Little was publicly known about Japan's germ operations until
the 1980s, when scholars published their first accounts. More
recently, veterans of Unit 731 have been speaking publicly in Japan
about their misdeeds, seeking expiation.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants, victims and records, the unit mounted
widespread germ attacks with anthrax, typhoid and other pathogens.
Among other experiments, its doctors infected prisoners with
disease germs, removed organs and blood and withheld water to
collect data on how the human body copes with illness and
deprivation. Many victims were then dissected alive.
</P>
<P>
   Only one former member of the unit was ever turned away from
entering the United States: Yushio Shinozuka, who arrived last
summer to join a forum and publicly express anguish over having
prepared victims for vivisection.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fading with time, diplomats and scholars say,
sensitivities over the issue are becoming sharper as new
generations re-examine wartime events, as they have with the
Holocaust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the issue is the complicity of American officials
in shielding from prosecution top Japanese scientists who turned
over their data to the United States, which was developing its own
germ warfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions that remain unresolved is whether doctors
working with Unit 731 experimented on American prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cover-up continues,'' said Sheldon H. Harris, emeritus
professor of history at California State University in Northridge
and the author of ``Factories of Death'' (Routledge, 1994), an
account of the Japanese germ warfare program and the American
hunger for its secrets. The book is scheduled for publication in
Japan this spring.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Harris said in an interview that while he had unearthed American
translations of three Japanese autopsy reports comprising nearly
1,000 pages recounting wartime medical experiments on dead and
living prisoners, 17 other reports were missing, along with some
8,000 photographic slides documenting the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of Unit 731 go back to 1930 and the Tokyo laboratory
of an ultranationalist surgeon and microbiologist, Shiro Ishii, who
was later made a general. Within two years, after Japanese troops
overran Manchuria in northeast China, Ishii, using the cover of a
sanitation unit, set up the first of several large biological
warfare and human research centers in Ping Fan and other areas
around Harbin, a heavily Russian city near the Soviet border.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, scholars and researchers say, the Japanese
attacked hundreds of heavily populated communities and remote
regions with germ bombs. Evidence of the attacks continues to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to have been a massive germ war campaign in
Yunnan Province bordering Burma,'' said Daniel Barenblatt, a
graduate psychologist and New York City researcher who has been
assembling material for five years for a documentary with the film
director David Irving, chairman of the undergraduate film and
television department at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to have been killing ethnic minorities in a jungle
campaign,'' Barenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions remain unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not established, for example, whether American
prisoners of war were among those experimented on. Some Americans
have said they were sickened by contaminated feathers in their
food, and Japanese accounts tell of jars containing body parts
labeled American among other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Frank James, 77, a survivor of the Bataan Death March, ended up
in 1942 at a Japanese prison camp in Mukden, Manchuria, where, he
said, he became a 70-pound living skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us shots, sprays in the face,'' he recounted in a
telephone interview from his home in Redwood City, Calif., where he
is confined with diabetes and lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of his jobs at Mukden was to retrieve for dissection
frozen corpses that he was certain were American. ``They opened
them up so they could look into the lining of the stomach,'' he
recalled. ``The light pink icicles in the stomach weren't thawed.''
</P>
<P>
   A new hourlong documentary to be broadcast on Sunday on the
History Channel, ``Unit 731: Nightmare in Manchuria,'' features
interviews with several other surviving American war prisoners who
say they were victimized by Japanese experiments.
</P>
<P>
   But records of their debriefings by American officials remain
unavailable. Harris, the author, said he applied for the records
under the Freedom of Information Act several years ago and was told
by the Veterans Administration that they had been destroyed in a
fire in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, American interest in prosecuting members of Unit
731 for war crimes faded fast. While Germany was split in a
four-power occupation, the United States had a largely free hand in
rebuilding Japan and was forging close ties to the new government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harris said, American scientists were
``salivating'' over the chance to obtain the forbidden secrets of
Japan's human experiments. The American authorities granted Ishii
and his associates immunity from prosecution and in exchange
received detailed information about the germ warfare program.
</P>
<P>
   The Allies did prosecute 5,570 Japanese, none for biological
warfare. Nine Japanese medical school professionals were convicted,
and some executed, for vivisecting eight captured American fliers
in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Toshimi Mizobuchi makes no secret of his years with Unit 731. A
vigorous 76-year-old real estate manager living outside the
Japanese city of Kobe, Mizobuchi is organizing this year's reunion
for the several hundred surviving veterans of Unit 731. He says he
did not take part in experiments on humans, though he knew of them
and argues that they were justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at home near Kobe with Rabbi Abraham
Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center that was recorded and
transcribed through an interpreter, Mizobuchi said he still
regarded the victims of the experiments as ``maruta,'' or logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were logs to me,'' said Mizobuchi, a training officer
with the unit. ``Logs were not considered to be human. They were
either spies or conspirators.'' As such, he said, ``they were
already dead. So now they die a second time. We just executed a
death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said about 30 other veterans of the unit were living near him
and that a reunion was held almost every year, drawing 40 or 50.
Mizobuchi said he had never visited the American mainland. But in
follow-up questions he said he had been to Hawaii twice for
sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stain on history,'' said Cooper, associate dean of the
Wiesenthal Center, founded in 1977 in the name of the Viennese
concentration camp survivor and Nazi-hunter to keep alive the
memory of the genocide of the Jews and to campaign for tolerance
and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he had interviewed former germ war soldiers and
others last month in Japan and planned to present Congress and the
White House with evidence he had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This blanket amnesty can't stand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years later, Ada Pivo of Los Angeles is still looking
for the truth about Unit 731's operations.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, she said in an interview, she lived with her
family in Harbin, where the unit made its headquarters. In 1940 her
17-year old sister, Leah, was one of two members of a Jewish youth
group who contracted typhoid and died after an outing. Mrs. Pivo
believes that her sister was infected by a bottle of lemonade
spiked with bacteria by Japanese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   It is known that food and drink and even children's sweets were
sometimes laced with pathogens. But without access to Japanese
wartime records, it may never be possible to establish the link to
a particular operation in Harbin.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has long restricted access to military records, which were
in the hands of the American authorities for nine years after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, first screened by the CIA, include hundreds of
thousands of pages of War Ministry records from 1868 to 1942, Naval
Ministry records from 1868 to 1939 and operational records of many
units throughout the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 the CIA turned over the records to the National
Archives, with no indication of what, if anything, had been
removed. In 1957 the collection was ordered returned to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned over the potential loss, a group of scholars including
Edwin O. Reischauer of Harvard University and John Young of
Georgetown University, obtained a Ford Foundation grant to
hurriedly microfilm what they could.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1958, after about 5 percent of the records were
copied, Young recalled in an interview, the documents were sent to
Baltimore and and loaded aboard a ship for Japan. ``There was no
way we could read them all,'' said Young, who deplored the loss.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Young, who assisted Allied war crimes investigators
in China after the war, compiled a 144-page index to the pages that
were microfilmed.
</P>
<P>
   A microfilm set was presented to the National Diet Library in
Tokyo, an irony, Young said, considering that Japan has now closed
off the collection. ``I can tell you frankly, the militarists felt
relieved,'' Young said. ``As a historian I couldn't stand it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a speech that many Democrats viewed as a strong
indication that Hillary Rodham Clinton would run for the Senate
from New York, the first lady Wednesday proclaimed her commitment
to government and politics before some of her most passionate
supporters, New York Democratic women, in a packed and enthusiastic
ballroom of the Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot drop out of the political process and leave the
arena to those with very specific agendas,'' Mrs. Clinton said in
remarks so rich with double meaning that some women wondered if the
first lady was referring to them, to herself or to both.
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``you can say all you want about the flaws of our
political system, but when it comes right down to it, somebody is
going to make the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton started her day in New York as a
traditional first lady with a visit to a Queens school and a speech
about the importance of arts education, by the time she arrived at
the Plaza she seemed transformed into a potential Senate candidate
at an exuberant political rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think it's time for a woman to represent New York in
the United States Senate?'' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer to cheers
as he introduced Mrs. Clinton to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Clinton's first visit to New York since announcing
two weeks ago that she was giving ``careful thought'' to a Senate
run in the state. She addressed the issue almost immediately when
she came to the podium. ``There was talk I might have an
announcement to make,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I do not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton seemed to tease the crowd, a Democratic Party
fund-raising group called the Women's Leadership Forum, as she
spoke about a woman's responsibility to participate in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say `I won't be involved in politics because I don't
like all of the negativity, I don't like all of the ads on
television,''' Mrs. Clinton said. She added to laughter that ``I
can certainly understand why someone might feel that way, but it is
not a feeling that you should act on.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York state
Democratic party and one of the most ardent supporters of a Hillary
Clinton candidacy, said in an interview that Mrs. Clinton was
``publicly sharing her thought process with us'' as she considers a
Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, one of the few men to attend
the lunch, went so far as to call Mrs. Clinton's speech ``very
close to an open declaration'' of candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But some women at the lunch for 900, who paid from $150 to
$10,000 per ticket, described the speech as nothing more than
``classic Hillary'' in its advocacy for women and children and its
view of politics as a higher calling. Some of it, in fact, was
recycled material from a speech Mrs. Clinton made at the 150th
anniversary of the first women's convention in Seneca Falls last
summer. At the Plaza, Mrs. Clinton spoke about what she considers
the obligations of this generation of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like those women in Seneca Falls, we are standing in for
countless other women who cannot be here, who couldn't afford the
ticket, wouldn't think they had anything to wear, or anything to
contribute, who wouldn't see themselves as a political person at
all,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``One of our great challenges in the next
years is to make sure that our society doesn't split apart along
income lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made no reference to her potential opponent, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who in a reversal of geography spent Wednesday in
Washington testifying about crime reduction and cutting welfare
roles before a congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after his testimony, Giuliani said that
Mrs. Clinton is ``acting like a Senatorial candidate, I'm acting
like a Mayor. That's not a bad comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani have announced plans to run
for the Senate seat to be vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Giuliani from pointing to a poll released
Wednesday by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion that showed
Mrs. Clinton in a statistical tie in a hypothetical race with the
mayor, 50 percent for Mrs. Clinton and 46 percent for the
mayor. &UR;  &LR; The poll was taken among New York registered voters and
showed a drop in her support in a Marist poll of two weeks ago,
when she was ahead, 49 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at today's Marist and see if she's crowned the
winner,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added that Mrs. Clinton's ``celebrity status is helping
her a great deal'' but ``when she becomes a candidate'' and ``maybe
even faster, it's coming down to more and more questions in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean she wouldn't be a strong candidate,'' he
added. ``But so will the Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani predicted a very close ``two to three point election.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's visit to New York, which coincided with ABC's
highly publicized ``20/20'' interview with Monica S. Lewinsky, drew
enormous media attention, rivaling that of a presidential visit.
There were 25 video cameras from the networks and foreign, local
and cable channels positioned in the auditorium of the Adrien Block
Intermediate School 25 in Flushing, Queens, where Mrs. Clinton did
nothing more political than release a national report about the
benefits of arts education.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, Mrs. Clinton stopped at the Manhattan home
of Lynn Forester, a longtime Democratic supporter and an owner of a
wireless communications company.
</P>
<P>
   Later she went to a dinner at the home of Jurate Kazickas and
Roger C. Altman, an investment banker who was President Clinton's
Deputy Treasury Secretary and whose firm bought The National
Enquirer and Star magazine two weeks ago. The dinner was described
as a gathering of 15 people, not a fund-raising event, that was to
include business executives and leaders of nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters who have talked to Mrs. Clinton in recent
days said she has not decided whether she will run, but that she is
continuing her methodical research into the race. They described
her in recent days as excited about the idea of serving in the
Senate both because of her idealism about government and the
enticement of at last having a political career independent of her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said he had spoken to Mrs. Clinton
for 20 minutes on the phone Tuesday night, and that the first lady
``asked me what I thought, if people really would welcome somebody
who wasn't a born and bred New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   After her remarks at the school, Mrs. Clinton was surrounded by
well-wishers and a mob of reporters, who were kept at a distance by
the Secret Service. Mrs. Clinton's staff said the first lady would
answer no questions from the press.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza Hotel was even more crowded. Guests at the lunch,
which raised $500,000 for the Democratic National Committee and
sold out two weeks ago, were split into two _ one group in the
ballroom where Mrs. Clinton spoke, and another in separate room to
watch Mrs. Clinton on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many citizens of New York who had opinions about the
first lady's visit Wednesday was Cathy Arevalo, 14, a ninth grader
at P.S. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a campaign appearance,'' she said.

STRAND OF HAIR MAY POINT TO WHO HAS BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   X-ray analysis of a single hair may lead to a simple test to
detect breast cancer, Australian researchers suggest in the current
issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In four small studies on hair from healthy subjects and patients
with breast cancer, scientists from the University of New South
Wales in Sydney, Australia, found that hair from the healthy women
had a different molecular structure than hair from the cancer
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Early tests on scalp hair showed some inconsistencies, which the
team attributed to chemical processes like hair coloring or
permanents. So the researchers decided to use pubic hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We correctly identified all the samples from women with breast
cancer, but further investigation into the sensitivity and
specificity of this test is necessary,'' concluded the researchers,
led by Veronica James at New South Wales. ``It is possible that
this may lead to a simple and reliable screening method for breast
cancer using a single pubic hair.''
</P>
<P>
   But cancer specialists not involved with the research noted the
small sample size of the study and said much more study was needed
before a simple hair analysis joined existing methods for detecting
cancer, like mammograms and blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of report that is important for generating a
hypothesis and thereafter generating other careful research, but
it's a long way from this to a clinically useful test,'' said Dr.
Larry Norton, chief of solid tumor oncology at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Using a technique called synchrotron X-ray scattering, the
researchers found that all samples from 23 breast cancer patients
showed the same change in scattering patterns. Among the 28 healthy
subjects, samples from 24 were considered normal.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also studied healthy women who had a family
history of breast cancer or who had earlier been found to have a
mutation of the BRCA1 gene that is associated with a higher risk of
breast cancer. Of the five women in that category, three had the
same pattern as breast cancer patients while the other two showed a
partial change.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that an analysis of hair could show whether a
healthy woman had the mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Norton described the research among this high-risk group as
``especially provocative'' and worthy of further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe the association between hair and cancer is not too
farfetched,'' Norton said in a telephone interview. ``Why should a
drug that kills cancer cells also make hair fall out? Maybe there
is a biochemical similarity.''

 &HT;    Texas comptroller's plan would save state $1.2 billion
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With less than 10 days left for legislators to
file proposed legislation, Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander on
Wednesday unveiled 199 ideas for saving more than $1.2 billion in
state money and operating government more efficiently. The single
largest proposal, worth $652.5 million, would be to sell state
bonds and use the proceeds to pay for infrastructure along the
border. The bonds would be paid off with federal highway dollars
expected to trickle in over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander also suggests teacher bonuses, tax incentives for Texas
businesses and housing vouchers for older Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report has a lot of options for Texas,'' Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Texas Performance Review normally comes out before
lawmakers begin their biennial session. This year, outgoing
Comptroller John Sharp, a Democrat, declined to release the report.
Rylander, a Republican, declined to put her name on it before
taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, a staff report that proposed savings of $626.4
million was released without support from either comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   When she took office, Rylander and her staff combed through that
report, deleting some recommendations and adding others. ``What
I've done is to combine some new ideas with some good old ideas and
some revised ideas,'' Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander, who took office earlier this year, acknowledged that
time is running short to get many of the proposals into shape for
legislative action. But she added that legislators already are
considering many of the ideas. Others might be accomplished without
legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when the real work starts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the staff report recommended, Rylander says the state payroll
should be trimmed by 3,039 full-time positions, all of which would
come from the Department of Human Services, which currently has
about 15,500 employees. Statewide, there are more than 220,000
employees working for Texas. According to the report, the number of
welfare cases has steadily declined in the past few years, but the
number or employees at DHS hasn't fallen proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Performance Review began in 1991 when lawmakers were
facing tough economic times. To stave off the need for more tax
dollars, lawmakers asked Sharp to come up with ways to trim
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, lawmakers have used the report during good and bad
times to keep tabs on government spending. Each report has had a
unique title, including the first,''Breaking the Mold: New Ways to
Govern Texas,'' and this year's ``Challenging the Status Quo:
Toward Smaller, Smarter Government.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was hardly a revelation to Wayne Geer when
his toddler son, Samuel, named Larry the Cucumber as his favorite
biblical character.
</P>
<P>
   Geer is youth minister at Christian Life Assembly in Carrollton,
Texas, and is well aware of the popularity of the evangelistic
VeggieTales characters.
</P>
<P>
   The Geers were among representatives of 28 churches who
congregated at the Living Vine Family Christian Store last week for
a vacation Bible school workshop, an event at which publishers of
Christian materials trotted out their latest wares with dazzle and
devotion.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop was a kind of God trade show, complete with soft
sell and hard numbers, video presentations and stuffed-animal
characters, costumes and colorful booth decorations, all wrapped up
with a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, if you don't have a catchy theme in the VBS universe,
then you are a really small voice crying in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But, isn't it a stretch to use something as secular as a
medieval castle motif to introduce Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole world is theme-y,'' said T.J. Thurman, a children's
minister with Metroplex Chapel in Euless. ``You go to a restaurant,
it's got a theme. That goes back to the X-Generation-type
philosophy: `If it's not fun, I don't want to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Churches should look for vacation Bible school themes that won't
become dated and that can be adapted to Sunday school or Wednesday
Bible study use, Thurman said. And, a good VBS plan can be used in
a daytime or an evening setting, because 50 percent of all Bible
schools are held at night.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Darrow of Plano, Texas, is typical of the publisher's
representatives who were on hand. A full-time educational director
at Preston Meadow Lutheran Church, she hawks Standard Publishing's
VBS program as a sideline. She works six or seven big showcases per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow had set up a radio station booth to tout a Station WSFJ
(We Shine For Jesus) theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want flexibility, age-appropriate crafts and activities,
and something that's easy to teach for novices,'' she said of the
typical VBS shopper.
</P>
<P>
   It's the appeal of drawing in a new, young flock that motivates
many VBS coordinators, some of the representatives said. ``Many
times, families who don't go to church will let their children come
to vacation Bible school, where they hear the message of Jesus
Christ for the first time,'' Darrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman touted the cost-effectiveness of Gospel Light's Son
Castle Faire box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use a lot of recyclable material for crafts,'' he said.
``We're kind of known as the king of toilet paper rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's VBS Superbox, with enough materials for 35 to 50
children, runs $129.95, complete with sheet music, videos,
reproducible handouts and a cardboard puppet stage.
</P>
<P>
   Other VBS boxes range from about $50 to $150 and more.
</P>
<P>
   The most elaborate plan was ``The Ultimate Adventure With
Jesus,'' a $159.99 box with a five-destination, extreme-sports
theme of rock climbing, wind surfing, mountain biking, white-water
rafting and snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   The box contains director and leader guides for pre-school and
youth levels, adventure destination booklets illustrated with
gorgeous scenery from around the world, promotional posters, mural
art transparencies, a reproducible music CD, scripts for skits, and
even optional Ultimate Adventure-themed Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his wife, Jamie, scouting out their first VBS program
for the 100 or so children in their ministry, were not that
concerned about cost-effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mostly looking for something we're going to enjoy
themewise and productionwise, so we're watching them all to
decide,'' Gree said. Like many participants, though, the Geers
found that VeggieTales' ``Veggie Town Values: Building Citizens for
God's Community'' had the advantage of familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Geer had been down a similar road on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, she came up with her own character when we
were at an inner-city church in another part of the country,''
Wayne Geer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was Gretchen, the Grape.''

 &HT;    Congress to take on tobacco allocations
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State Rep. Dianne Delisi, who will lead a House
Appropriations subcommittee charged with determining how the
state's first tobacco settlement payments will be spent, said
Wednesday that Congress will begin to consider the issue today of
how much Texas may get to keep of its $17.3 billion recovery. That
decision will determine the scope of her subcommittee's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is give as much structure as we can,''
said Delisi (R-Temple).
</P>
<P>
   A total of $1.7 billion could be available over the next two
years from tobacco proceeds. That money will be set aside from
other state spending plans under an agreement between former
Attorney General Dan Morales and key budget-writing lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   FATHERS COULD BE LIABLE SOONER
</P>
<P>
   Houston state Rep. Fred Bosse has filed the first of several
bills expected to deal with Sunset Advisory Commission
recommendations for Texas' beleaguered child-support enforcement
program.
</P>
<P>
   Bosse, a Democrat, incorporates a version of various proposals
to streamline the process by which fathers of children born to
unwed mothers can be identified and ordered to pay support. In his
bill, Bosse would have a man's signature on a birth certificate or
on a declaration given at the hospital as proof sufficient to allow
a temporary child support order to be issued without a judge's
involvement. Paternity itself could still be contested in court,
but a mother supposedly could get support faster than under
existing law.WILLIAMSON MAY GET NEW COURT
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County would get a third county court-at-law under a
bill heard by a Senate committee Wednesday. A separate bill up for
committee consideration next week would create a new district court
for a county that has nearly doubled in population since the last
new court started in 1991.DEREGULATION PLAN NEARS SENATE
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Sibley (R-Waco) announced Wednesday that he expects
to bring his massive electric utility deregulation bill to the full
Senate in two weeks, on March 17, and to vote it out of his Special
Senate Committee on Electric Utility Restructuring on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complexity of the issue, the Senate agreed, at
Sibley's request, to take the unusual step of requiring that all
amendments to the bill be filed with the secretary of the Senate at
least 48 hours before the Senate takes up the bill. Normally,
amendments can be offered at any time before the Senate votes on a
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said the bill is ``150 pages right now and rising'' and
he expects it to be close to 200 pages by the time it reaches the
full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL EXPULSION PLAN PASSES
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts would get the right to expel students who
assault school district employees or volunteers under a bill
approved by the Texas Senate on a 31-0 vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, author of the bill, said students
guilty of assault cannot under current law be expelled. Students
who assault others at school must be placed in an alternative
education program.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' bill originally would apply only to assaults that
occurred on school district property or at school-related events.
But Sen. Chris Harris, R-Arlington, won approval of an amendment to
allow a student to be expelled for an assault against a school
district employee or volunteers anywhere if it were retaliation for
a school-related matter.
</P>
<P>
   SUIT ALLEGES TXDOT USED QUOTAS
</P>
<P>
   A Houston contractor has filed a lawsuit against the Texas
Department of Transportation for allegedly using racial quotas to
award contracts. Robert Kossman, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, said
his erosion control firm lost business under such practices to
minority-owned businesses even when his firm submitted the low bid.
</P>
<P>
   Kossman, who is white, is asking a federal district judge to
declare the program unconstitutional. His lawsuit is being handled
by the Campaign for a Color-Blind America, Legal Defense and
Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes as TXDOT is transitioning to new federal
guidelines, which allow economically-disadvantaged businesses _
including those owned by whites _ to qualify for the disadvantaged
business program.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for a Color-Blind America was founded by Edward
Blum, who led a ballot-initiative in 1997 to eliminate the City of
Houston's affirmative action contracting and employment program.
Voters defeated the measure, but a court fight continues.
</P>
<P>
   UNCERTIFIED TEACHERS IDENTIFIED
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dawnna Dukes said Wednesday that parents have a right to
know when their children are in classrooms taught by teachers who
are not certified or who are improperly certified. She has filed
House Bill 618, which would require schools to notify parents
within 30 days if an uncertified teacher is still in the classroom
or teaching the course.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages of certified teachers have led to many subjects being
taught by underqualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 62 percent of teachers in bilingual classes were
not certified in that subject in the 1997-98 school year and more
than a quarter _ 27 percent _ of math teachers were improperly
certified.
</P>
<P>
   COMMITTEE OKS BUSH APPOINTEES
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Nominations Committee on Wednesday approved Gov.
George W. Bush's selection of six Texans to the embattled Board of
Pardons and Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last month replaced a third of the board in the largest
replacement sweep in years. The 18-member panel has faced harsh
criticism for the secrecy in which it considers clemency for death
row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Approved by the Nominations Committee were Paddy Lann Burwell,
of DeWitt County; LaFayette Collins, of Round Rock; Linda Garcia,
of La Porte; James Paul Kiel Jr., of Tyler; Filiberto ``Bert''
Reyna, of Waco; and Lucinda ``Cindy'' Simons, of Hereford.

BATTLE BETWEEN RUBIN, GREENSPAN COULD SCUTTLE MODERNIZATION OF
BANKING RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ A continuing spat between Treasury Secretary Robert E.
Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, over
modernizing bank regulations threatens to bury legislation that
comes before House and Senate committees Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that laws from the 1930s and 1950s that keep banks
out of the securities and insurance markets should be scrapped. But
they disagree how banks should be structured to handle their new
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, with the support of most economists, looks like he will
get most of what he wants from the House. Greenspan, drawing
powerful support from past and present Fed officials, may win in
the Senate. Indeed, the administration Wednesday threatened to veto
the proposal by Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate banking
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that Congress will be deadlocked, forcing the
economy to operate under Depression-era rules for at least a few
more years.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's laws prohibit commercial banks from underwriting
insurance and securities or engaging in most commercial activities.
Nearly everyone agrees that most of these prohibitions should be
scrapped. The idea is that banks could be allowed to offer
customers a single, convenient and low-cost place to bank, invest
and buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan would require banks to affiliate with securities and
insurance firms under the joint ownership of a bank holding
company. He would not allow banks to provide financial services
directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries. Under the Greenspan
plan, bank holding companies would rule the market. By the way,
Greenspan's Fed regulates bank holding companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin would allow banks to avoid the complicated and costly
burden of setting up holding companies and instead create wholly
owned, but separately incorporated, subsidiaries. In this
arrangement, banks could become financial giants. By the way,
Rubin's Treasury regulates banks.
</P>
<P>
   To almost anyone outside the Beltway, the distinction between
affiliates and subsidiaries appears arcane. Suspicions are
heightened by the strong aroma of a turf war. But there is more to
this dispute than petty jealously.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed points out that subsidiaries are dangerous because their
losses would directly eat into the financial reserves of the parent
bank. That leaves the bank financially vulnerable. The Fed worries
that transfers between parent banks and their subsidiaries could
grow excessively large because the money would still be owned by
the bank and would not, therefore, spook creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed is hard pressed to point to independent economists
who share its fears. George Benston of Emory University says that
the Rubin plan _ and the bipartisan bill proposed by James Leach
and John LaFalce, the chairman and ranking minority member,
respectively, of the House banking committee that embraces many of
Rubin's demands _ ``gives Greenspan all the protections that he
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, banks could offer securities underwriting
through a subsidiary. But participating banks would be required to
hold an extra layer of capital reserves. And none of the dollars
that the bank invests in its subsidiary could be counted toward its
capital requirement. In other words, if the subsidiary went
bankrupt and the parent bank lost its entire investment, the bank
would still be left with more capital than is normally required.
Second, the amount of money that the bank would be allowed to send
to its subsidiary would be limited to the amount the bank would be
allowed to send to an affiliate of a holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Benston's point, like Rubin's, is that affiliates and
subsidiaries are largely equivalent under the House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan makes a second criticism of the House plan. Banks,
he points out, can borrow money more cheaply than other firms
because of various government-provided favors. The government
insures money deposited by the bank's customers. The government
provides loans to banks in times of distress. And the government
guarantees the system that provides for rapid processing of
deposits and payments. Greenspan worries that banks will pass the
financial benefit of these implicit federal subsidies to their
subsidiaries, thereby distorting competition in the market for
financial services.
</P>
<P>
   But Benston dismisses these arguments, as well. ``The subsidy
Greenspan points to may not exist, but it is almost surely small.
Along with the federal insurance come layers of expensive
regulations. Besides, the benefit of the subsidy, if it exists, can
be passed along to affiliates about as easily as subsidiaries. And,
banks have little incentive to pass along subsidies to affiliates
or subsidiaries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Fed appears to fear that securities underwriting and other
financial services are so inherently nuclear that they can blow
open holes in the parent bank's capital before regulators have time
to react. But, Benston points out, ``Derivatives can blow up faster
than stock and bond purchases. Underwriting poses no special
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is another argument that may explain the Fed's animus
toward subsidiaries. If banks prefer Rubin's model to the Fed's,
bank holding companies will shrivel, leaving the Fed little to
regulate. Over time, Fed officials fear, their regulatory expertise
will also shrivel. Fed officials believe regulatory expertise is
integral to the Fed's ability to do its other job: setting monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   There are other contentious issues, including Gramm's threat to
undermine the rules that compel banks to lend in poor
neighborhoods. But the major dispute is over bank structure. It
might seem obvious that the impact on the economy of Depression-era
bank rules is large. But the presumption may well be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have chipped away at the regulatory shackles, finding
loopholes by which to approve, for example, a merger that brought
Citibank and Salomon Smith Barney together. A legislative fix may
not be all that important. Leach says his bill will deliver a
``psychological boost'' to the financial services sector,
especially to firms serving midsize business. Perhaps. But Leach
cites testimony that the economywide benefits might be only a few
billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always good reason to throw out silly rules,''
Benston said, ``but don't expect bank reform to pack much of a
wallop.''

CLINTON AIDE CRITICAL OF GOP SPENDING PLAN

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A top official in the Clinton administration
strongly objected Wednesday to a Republican plan that would allow
some money theoretically earmarked for Social Security to be spent
for other purposes over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hearing before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee
on Social Security, a senior Democratic congressman worried aloud
that President Clinton would lure Democratic lawmakers into taking
difficult stands on Social Security and then, as he has on occasion
in the past, reverse course and leave his legislative allies
stranded politically.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, the president's chief spokesman on Social Security, said a
plan announced on Tuesday by Republicans in the House would make it
more difficult to keep the retirement system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Under that plan, Congress could dip into the interest payments
the Treasury owes the Social Security reserves for the next two
years and use the money for tax cuts or spending on programs like
the military and education. After two years, when the operating
budget of the government is projected to start running a surplus,
no further money collected in Social Security taxes would be used
for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he had ``very considerable concern'' that the plan
would give Congress ``more room for dissipating the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   By the administration's calculations, the federal budget will
have a surplus next year of $117 billion. That will result from the
government's collecting $129 billion more in Social Security taxes
than it will spend in benefits and a deficit of $12 billion in the
operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's budget plan shows that Clinton would not
use any of the Social Security surplus for other programs. But he
manages this by proposing tax increases on cigarettes and other
budgetary manipulations that Congress has already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the budgetary dispute between the administration and
Congress over how to allocate the Social Security money is a smoke
screen to mask the serious political differences over how to
strengthen the public retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The president has proposed using 62 percent of the overall
budget surplus over the next 15 years _ approximately the portion
of the surplus attributable to an excess in payroll taxes over
retirement benefits _ to shore up Social Security. Most of this
money would be used to pay down the national debt and a small
portion would be used by the government to invest in financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have not adopted a specific plan, have agreed
that 62 percent of the surplus should be set aside for Social
Security. But they want to use the money to enable workers to
invest in the stock market in private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The budgetary arguments were briefly overshadowed at Wednesday's
hearing by a sharp statement by Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the
leading Democrat on the Social Security subcommittee, challenging
the president's resolve on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui, whose wife worked in the White House until recently and
who himself is one of the most loyal Clinton supporters in
Congress, became frustrated when he could not get Summers to
promise that the president would go beyond his general plan and
propose specific Social Security legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't be so supportive,'' Matsui snapped, ``lest you
pull the rug out from under me.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned later, Matsui refused to elaborate. But Democratic
representatives who spoke only on the condition that they not be
identified said Matsui's challenge reflected their concern that the
president would cut a deal with Republicans after Democrats had
stuck out their necks to support him.
</P>
<P>
   In his first budget fight in 1993, Clinton did just that on a
fuel tax. Later, in the Democrats' view, the president
double-crossed them on welfare changes and the 1997 balanced-budget
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all we talk about back there,'' one Democrat said,
motioning to a private cloakroom.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, said he had no
indication that Clinton would be less than firm on Social Security.
But he added, ``I agree there is a credibility problem given past
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, there was other wrangling over the
budget and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, renewed his
criticism of Clinton's proposal to allow the government to invest a
portion of Social Security's reserves in the stock market. Speaking
to a subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee, Greenspan argued
that state and local government pension funds, because of political
meddling, earned lower returns than corporate pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion was challenged Wednesday by the nation's largest
public pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement
System. The fund released a study it had commissioned by Wilshire
Associates, a pension-fund consultant, which found that corporate
and public pensions funds had earned almost identical rates of
return on equities over the past 5 and 10 years.

SCHOOLS CHIEF DRAWS A LINE OVER SCHOOL VOUCHERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Drawing an ideological line over an emotional issue
in public education, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has warned Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani that he will resign if the administration pushes
through an experimental voucher program to spend tax dollars for
children to attend private schools, a person close to the
chancellor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That message, which the person _ speaking on the condition of
anonymity _ said was unequivocal, threatens a relationship between
Giuliani and Crew that by many accounts has been both productive
and congenial. After a nationwide search, Crew was hired in October
1995 with Giuliani's blessing to replace Ramon C. Cortines, who had
been pressured by the mayor to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chancellor has been clear with his board, with the mayor
and with his staff that on principle he could never support
vouchers in the New York City public school system,'' the person
said. ``He feels that it is the beginning of the end of public
education, period, if you start funneling taxpayer dollars into
private education.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate between the mayor and the chancellor over school
vouchers was waged through surrogates Wednesday, in part because
both were out of town _ Giuliani in Washington, Crew in California.
But both administration and school officials acknowledged that the
conflict was intensifying and said that the two men had at least
two telephone conversations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made the issue a central theme of his State of the
City address in January by announcing that he hoped to establish a
pilot voucher program in one of the city's 32 community school
districts. To that end, his aides have been lobbying the school
board's seven board members to support his proposal. Three members
are said to be against the plan and three, including his two
appointees, are in favor; that has placed enormous pressure on the
one undecided member, Terri Thomson, who represents Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Given comments made Wednesday night by Joseph J. Lhota, the
deputy mayor for operations, the administration appears to have no
intention of relenting in pursuing its goal to have some form of a
voucher program in the city's school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good relationship with the chancellor,'' Lhota said.
``As with other new issues, the chancellor somewhat overreacts at
first _ he did with charter schools, he did with school safety. I
know the chancellor always holds the schoolchildren more important
than the system itself. He came around on both those issues, and at
the end of the day, reason will prevail on the issue of vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chiara Coletti, the public affairs director for the school
board, immediately took issue with Lhota's comments. She said that
Crew has never been opposed to charter schools _ tax-financed
public schools that are not controlled by local school boards _ but
rather to one legislative proposal. On the matter of school safety,
she said, ``the mayor and the chancellor negotiated a signed
compromise'' in allowing the Police Department to oversee security
in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just no comparison here,'' Ms. Coletti said. ``On the
issue of vouchers, within the public school system the chancellor
is unequivocal in his opposition, despite his respect for and
friendship with the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday night, neither official seemed prepared to back
down. Giuliani, who is in the midst of considering his political
future, has adopted the national Republican Party's enthusiasm for
school vouchers. On Sunday, while delivering a speech in Miami, for
example, he called it ``the most important thing that has to be
done with education in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has said that he hoped to mirror a program in
Milwaukee that uses tax dollars to pay the private school tuition
of children from low-income families. Among the restrictions of
that program _ whose constitutionality so far has been upheld by
the Wisconsin courts _ is one prohibiting the schools from having
the students participate in religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   In setting aside $12 million in his budget plan to entice school
districts to participate, Giuliani has defended his proposal as an
experiment that would create competition and therefore force the
public school system to improve. The mayor has also argued that
poor families should have the same choice in selecting schools for
their children as more affluent families have.
</P>
<P>
   But Crew expressed opposition to the mayor's proposal just hours
after Giuliani unveiled it in January. The argument that Crew makes
is simple: Public money should not be used to pay for private
education _ particularly when the city's public school system is
underfinanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very clear on this position'' in his discussions
with the mayor and his aides, said the person close to Crew.
``Basically, you're taking the money and energy out for a very,
very few.''

INCREASED BREAST FEEDING COULD SAVE LIVES, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Increased breast-feeding could save the lives
of up to 1.5 million of the roughly 12 million children under the
age of 5 who die every year around the world, according to initial
findings presented here this week by a group of women's
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations, which have been trying to measure the
economic benefits of breast-feeding, told the annual meeting of the
U.N. Commission on the Status of Women that they hope to counter
what they see as a worldwide decline in the practice by convincing
governments, health authorities and ordinary families that they
should do more to encourage mothers to breast-feed.
</P>
<P>
   Women are being pressured to give up breast-feeding too soon,
they say, by the need to earn a living, vigorous marketing by
manufacturers of breast-milk substitutes, lack of government
incentives and disdain for the work of breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   But children who are not breast-fed tend to have weaker immune
systems and are at greater risk from infectious diseases,
especially diarrhea and respiratory illnesses, they say. In Brazil,
the death rate for infants who are bottle-fed is 14 times higher
than for infants who are breast-fed. In Indonesia, the annual cost
of treating diarrhea caused by the decline in breast-feeding is
estimated at $40 million, or 20 percent of the country's health
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers also benefit from breast-feeding their babies, the
study's authors said, showing less risk of anemia, premenopausal
breast cancer and osteoporosis in old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to show what society loses in health and welfare
when breast-feeding is not properly valued and protected,'' said
Selma James of International Women Count. ``Uncovering the economic
value of breast-feeding will raise the social value of the woman
who does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her organization, along with the World Alliance for
Breast-Feeding Action and UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, is
among those supporting the study.
</P>
<P>
   Breast-feeding is also more protective of the environment and
encourages population control, the organizations say. For every 450
tons of infant formula, they said, 70,000 tons of scrap metal is
discarded. And breast-feeding provides ``more months of child
spacing than all technological contraceptive methods combined,''
the authors say.

   WASHINGTON _ Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist, and the
Taliban, his protectors in Afghanistan, have had a violent
falling-out, raising the possibility that his days of refuge may be
numbered, senior American officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three American officials and two representatives of the Taliban,
which is the armed religious movement that runs Afghanistan, said a
fight broke out three weeks ago in Kandahar among bin Laden's
bodyguards and a group of Taliban officials assigned to watch over
him.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, the officials said, bin Laden was expelled from
Kandahar, the Afghan city in which he had taken refuge with his
family; transported into isolation in the Afghan countryside, and
stripped of his satellite telephones, which American officials said
allowed him to plot with fellow radicals throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is friction between him and the Taliban,'' one senior
American official said. ``They have tried to constrain him for the
first time and tried to limit his communications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good sign,'' he said, and it indicates that bin Laden,
the Saudi exile indicted on charges of masterminding the deadly
bombings of two American embassies in Africa in August, may have
worn out his welcome with the Taliban, which has sheltered him
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban has shown no sign that it is willing to deliver bin
Laden into the hands of the United States, senior American
officials said. But one senior official said the Taliban had sent a
clear signal that its desire to protect bin Laden was waning.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, a senior Taliban official, said the
fugitive had become a problem for his hosts. ``His presence is not
a benefit to the people of Afghanistan,'' he said, but ``a puzzle
for the Afghan leadership'' to solve, he said, because the Islamic
Taliban cannot be seen to betray a fellow Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   The senior American officials said they were not certain of bin
Laden's current location, only that he and his Taliban guards move
from place to place in the stony wilds of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Taliban also say they have no idea of bin
Laden's whereabouts. Privately, they are pondering what to do with
him, a second Taliban representative said.
</P>
<P>
   They have sent an emissary to the United States asking how to
deal with him without being seen to double-cross him, and they have
asked Saudi Arabia if it would take care of his wives and children,
said the Taliban representative, who demanded anonymity, as did the
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   All gave similar accounts of the breach between bin Laden and
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10, they said, bin Laden's bodyguards became furious
when a group of 10 or more Taliban officials moved to supplant
them. By one account, automatic weapons were fired.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, ``bin Laden found himself in a confined and
difficult situation,'' said Mujahid, the Taliban's permanent
representative-designate at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the Taliban leadership formally replaced bin
Laden's bodyguards with members of their intelligence service and
foreign ministry, instructing their men to make bin Laden disappear
from public view, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership decided to cut all communications from him, and
even his telephone set has been taken from him,'' Mujahid said.
``He has been told no foreigner can talk to him. Ten bodyguards
were provided for him. The duty of the bodyguards was to supervise
him and observe that he will not contact any foreigner or use any
communication system in Afghanistan. He is now isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight broke out over the degree of control the Taliban would
have over bin Laden, another Taliban representative said.
</P>
<P>
   It came a week after Karl F. Inderfurth, an assistant secretary
of state, met in Pakistan with Jalil Akhund, the Taliban's deputy
foreign minister, and repeated American demands to turn over bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, citing Islamic law and Afghan custom, say they
cannot expel him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is a puzzle for the Afghan leadership,'' Mujahid
said. ``In World War II, we couldn't hand over German citizens
living in Afghanistan to the Allied forces. Regarding Osama bin
Laden, if we would do something in this regard, it is totally
against the Afghan character.'' Bin Laden is considered a hero in
Afghanistan for his financial and military support to the Afghan
rebels who defeated Soviet invaders in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side,'' said Mujahid, ``his presence is not a
benefit to the people of Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, a radical Islamic movement with few friends among
nations, desperately wants international recognition and foreign
aid. It will receive little while it shelters bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Though mutual mistrust complicates any cooperation, and some
senior American intelligence officials are not convinced the
Taliban will ever betray bin Laden, the Taliban's leaders have at
least three ways to deal with him that would be acceptable to the
United States, senior American officials said:
</P>
<P>
   _ They could secretly arrange for members of another nation's
intelligence service to learn of his whereabouts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   _ They could deliver him discreetly to a neighboring country,
where American law-enforcement and intelligence officers could try
to apprehend him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Or they could keep bin Laden firmly under control,
incommunicado, in the hope that he might dwindle away as a source
of anti-American terror.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials think this last solution the best, since
it holds no risk of making bin Laden a martyr, which could inspire
fresh attacks against the United States from his followers. Others
want to see him apprehended, whatever the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afghanistan is the safest place in the world for me,'' bin
Laden said last year. If that is no longer true, he has very few
alternatives, American officials said. Somalia is one and Iraq is
another, they said, but it would be very difficult for him to
travel internationally undetected, and neither nation can guarantee
the protection he has enjoyed until now.

 &HT;    With Williams at leadoff, Cox begins lineup testing
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The tinkering officially has begun.
While manager Bobby Cox is in no way setting a lineup this early,
some of the things he'll be thinking about this spring become more
evident with his announcement of the starting lineup for the
Braves' exhibition against Georgia Tech today.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup: 1) Gerald Williams in left; 2) Bret Boone at second;
3) Chipper Jones at third; 4) Brian Jordan in right; 5) Ryan Klesko
at first; 6) Andruw Jones in center; 7) Ozzie Guillen at shortstop;
8) Mike Mahoney at catcher; and (9) Jason Marquis on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was used in the No. 2 hole most during last season but
led off eight times. Jordan, as expected, will take some turns in
the cleanup spot. Cox will take a look at Boone, who batted fifth
and sixth most of last year for the Reds, in the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   But that's that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was serious about messing with the lineup, hitting guys in
different areas and setting on a lineup the last week or 10 days
(of spring training),'' Cox said. ``Right now, it's a matter of
getting guys at-bats and getting them out of the game. I might hit
Brian Jordan leadoff just to get him two at-bats and get him out of
some games.''
</P>
<P>
   WORKOUTS END
</P>
<P>
   The Braves begin their exhibition season today against Georgia
Tech. Rain Wednesday morning forced the Braves inside for much of
their workout. They did not get to work on cutoffs and relay
throws, so they will practice that before the Tech game today.
Earlier this week, the Braves worked on bunt plays and pickoff
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is known for having relatively short workouts in spring
training _ several hours at the longest _ which undoubtedly is
popular with the players.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who came from Tony La Russa's more rigorous St. Louis
camp, appreciates the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, compared to the Cardinals camp, is a breeze,'' Jordan
said. ``I like it because it shows how much Bobby Cox trusts you as
a player. He knows you know what you need to do to get ready. That
also prevents injury.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS AND THAT
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss is believed to have strep throat and was
not in camp for the second day in a row. Trainer Dave Pursley said
the Braves didn't actually take a strep culture, but began treating
him for it because he had all the symptoms. ... Minor-league third
baseman Wes Helms has been having pain in his throwing shoulder and
was scheduled to have it checked out with an MRI on Wednesday. ``I
think it took its toll from sliding and stuff,'' Helms said. ``I
felt a twinge. I don't think it's too serious.

a palm tree here. Roy Campanella rolled his wheelchair through
here. Above all, the Dodgers remain here, staging their 51st spring
camp, the blue ghosts just as touchable as Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dodgertown has a way of affecting you,'' said Kevin Malone,
the Dodgers' new general manager. ``It's all about baseball. It's
special. It's almost sacred ground.''
</P>
<P>
   So then, why would the Dodgers leave?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's what they call progress or something,'' first
baseman Eric Karros said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, a franchise transforming into something
different before our very eyes, continue to negotiate with the city
of Vero Beach and Indian River County over ownership of the
460-acre Dodgertown complex. With the club holding a sweet offer
from the Yavapi Indian tribe in Arizona for a new $30 million
training complex to be built at the Fort McDowell reservation
outside Scottsdale, the Dodgers are waiting for the local
authorities here to buy back Dodgertown _ approximate price: $8
million _ renovate the place and then beat the Yavapis at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers say they don't want to leave. The Arizona deal, with
a proposed $1 a year lease, makes it crazy for the Dodgers to stay.
No other team owns its own spring complex anymore, nor pays local
taxes, nor pays all operating costs. Even so, a decision to move,
seemingly unavoidable, would be another vile mark against Fox's new
ownership of one of American's sports most storied organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Dodgers remained the only West Coast team
training in Florida in part because the O'Malley family still felt
guilty about fleeing Brooklyn and wanted to keep a presence in the
East. Since Rupert Murdoch's acquisition, the club has decided to
cram more luxury suites into Dodger Stadium, has messed with
uniform design and now seeks a way out of Dodgertown. The loyalists
have gone from blue to bright red.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live in the past,'' Malone said, ``and so they want us to
stay in the past, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With new complexes sprouting almost annually, Dodgertown remains
as 1950s cool as Dean Martin's cocktail, not as grand as the new
places but twice as great. History blends with proximity to provide
the finest taste of the Grapefruit League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people come out here and feel a part of the atmosphere,''
said broadcaster Rick Monday, who felt like he had moved to ``the
Disneyland of baseball'' when the Dodgers signed him in 1977.
``They can hear the players mumbling as they're running sprints.
They can see the sweat. This has been a wonderful place over the
years for baseball to transfer to another generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona facility makes too much sense to a bottom-line
corporation. The Dodgers could train on its six fields next spring,
would assume no construction costs of a new stadium to be ready for
2001 and would split all parking, ticket and concession revenues.
Although the Dodgers generate an estimated $20 million to the Vero
Beach economy, the town in return can offer little beyond an
improved rent rate, a spruced-up stadium and the small-town appeal,
which still carries weight around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more partial to raccoons and water moccasins than I am to
gila monsters and cactus,'' incoming manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Detroit Tigers, training at Lakeland, Fla., since 1934,
and the Philadelphia Phillies, training in Clearwater since 1947,
have held the same winter homes longer. The Dodgers' decision is
not expected until late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a fans' standpoint,'' Karros said, ``I can see where this
is a very appealing place, and I'm sure a lot of fans will be
really upset. But from a players' standpoint, there are definitely
a few things this place lacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, history isn't one of them.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Antonio Levane immigrated to America from Naples
early in this century, he was 10 years old. To help out his family,
he played a mandolin for pennies on the streets of Brooklyn. He
went on to play the double bass in renowned orchestras, such as at
the Metropolitan Opera House, and for such classical luminaries as
Caruso and Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Antonio Levane wanted his six children to play
musical instruments. But some of his children, particularly the one
that the nation would come to know as Fuzzy, had other notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop first tried to teach me the cello,'' Levane said recently,
``and I'd practice for an hour or so _ I did learn some notes _ and
then duck out to play ball. But Pop was determined. He thought I'd
respond to a more modern instrument and tried to teach me the
saxophone. Same result. All the time my sisters were playing
instruments, and Lucille even became a concert pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Levane _ the nickname Fuzzy, which derived from Cuzzy
or ``cousin,'' was bestowed by neighborhood pals _ was a flop as a
symphonist. When Fuzzy departed the family's third-floor apartment
in Flatbush, he headed mainly to basketball courts, especially St.
Brendan's parish gymnasium, with a ceiling so low that by necessity
he developed a two-handed, over-the-head line-drive set shot. Fuzzy
mastered the shot in the way his father embraced Puccini.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father,'' Levane recalled, ``used to tell me, in his broken
English, `Andrew, if you don't learn something, you gonna be a bum.
Stop with the ball!''
</P>
<P>
   But Fuzzy had a mind of his own, and an uncommon skill with the
ball. He grew to 6 feet 2 inches, which appeared extraordinary when
he stood next to his father, who was 5 feet tall. (Fuzzy's mother
was 5-7. ``In those days,'' Levane said, ``marriages were arranged.
I had an uncle 4-11 and his wife was 5-8.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, as the star center of the undefeated city championship
James Madison High School team, Fuzzy was named the outstanding
prep player in New York City. He went to St. John's University and
in his senior year, 1943, led the team to the National Invitation
Tournament championship _ the NIT, not the NCAA, was then the
premier college post-season tournament in the nation. He won the
Haggerty Award as the best college player in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in the Army during World War II, he joined the
Rochester Royals in 1945 in the new National Basketball League
(soon to be the NBA). He was the starting forward on the league's
first championship team, and it was the start of a six-year N.B.A.
playing career. He then became a coach, first with the Milwaukee
Hawks, and then in New York, leading the Knicks to the playoffs in
1958-59.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the 1959-60 season began, he was fired. ``All I
know,'' Levane said, ``is that Wilt Chamberlain came into the
league, and I went out.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he remains in the league, and with the Knicks, as a
scout, primarily looking at Continental Basketball Association
players. He recommended, among others, a big, strong rebounder who
could dribble. His name was Anthony Mason.
</P>
<P>
   The white-haired Levane, now 78, will be honored at Madison
Square Garden on March 14 at halftime of the Public Schools
Athletic League basketball finals, whose playoffs are now getting
under way. It was 60 years ago that the dark-haired Levane led
James Madison to the title in the old Madison Square Garden.
``Playing there was as big a thrill as I've ever had,'' Levane
said.
</P>
<P>
   The team was called the Wonder Five because it won 39 straight
games. It dominated Jamaica in the final, 44-32, and all five of
its starters went on to play in the pros _ Stanley Waxman; Larry
Baxter; the Rader twins, Lennie and Howie, and Levane _ as well as
the sixth man, Freddie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``On its record,'' Levane said, ``we had to be the best high
school team ever.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his recognition at halftime, Levane said: ``People are
going to say, `What's that old guy doing out there?' And I can't
blame 'em. It's been a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Levane laughed. He is a man with an easy manner, and laughter is
an essential part of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father eventually took to basketball,'' Levane said.
``Especially after St. John's gave me a scholarship when I was a
junior in high school. It was the Depression, he was out of work,
and they paid our rent, $30 a month. And when I played ball for St.
John's my dad came to all the games. And you could hear him
cheering in the stands: `Let's-a-go, St. John's, let's-a-go!'''

 &HT;    Understanding self key for Greg Maddux
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ On the last day of workouts before the
Braves begin their exhibition season, Greg Maddux sat down and
shared some of his thoughts on spring training, the Braves and some
finer points of pitching. As always, some of his replies were
serious, some not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is spring training fun for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a blast. You get to get up early, and the first thing
you do is play baseball instead of the last thing. You get to get
up, play baseball, and there's usually a lot of sunlight left by
the time you're done. Your family's down here; you don't have to go
on any road trips; you can play golf, fish; you can take your kids
to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several days ago, while running in from the outfield to
pitch, you stopped at second to take a throw from Javy Lopez. You
looked like you were having fun with that. Do you secretly wish you
were a position player?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's fun, stuff like that. You can't do that during a game.
Nope. I'm very glad I'm pitching. I wouldn't want to play every
day. I got used to watching games and pitching every fifth day. I
watch these guys play every day; I don't know how they do it. I
really don't. I don't know how you foul a ball off your foot, which
is going to hurt for two weeks. You still got to play. Or watch a
guy slide into a base, rip his knee open, put a couple Band-Aids on
it, and you're sliding on it again the next night. Something
happens to me, I've got four days to get right.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you like watching Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa fight
it out for Roger Maris' record last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: I liked it. Come on _ it was the greatest record of all time,
gone. It was great to be a part of it. That's something I'll be
talking about, hopefully, 50 years from now. 'Course, then I might
be 90.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you contribute to it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sammy got me (in Atlanta) early, April or May. First inning,
fastball away, right down the middle. If Andruw (Jones) would have
jumped, he would have caught it. If he could jump about 50 feet in
the air, he would have caught it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you like this team, especially considering the loss of
Andres Galarraga?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we're all right. Obviously, we're going to miss Cat,
but we've still got some pretty good players left. It's going to be
hard. Obviously, you can't replace him; we know that. Each guy
needs to do what he's been doing, and we'll be all right. ... If we
get anything positive out of it, it will help us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you enjoy most about being a member of this pitching
staff?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you really enjoy is the days you're not pitching,
because you know you're going to get a good-pitched game. A
good-pitched game usually means a fast game. A good-pitched game
usually offers a few tips for down the road here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is it that the Cy Young has become somewhat of a Braves
team award?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the thing is we all want to win a ring. In order to
do that, you have to be consistent each month of the season, each
week of the season, and I think when you do that, you just kind of
back into a Cy Young. It just kind of happens. I've won a few that
way. I think that's how Glav, Smoltzie won, being consistent. Not
having seven or eight outstanding games but having 25 or 30 very
good games.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you like your year last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: I liked everything but the ending. Everything but the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of endings, which playoff loss this decade was the
toughest?
</P>
<P>
   A: Florida was hard; last year was hard; Philly was hard. It
might be just a hair easier to lose in the World Series than it is
the NLCS. At least you made it to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the years, does it get easier or harder to get outs in
the major leagues?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mentally it's easier; physically it's harder. Does that make
it harder or easier? I don't know. You know your own tendencies
better. When you understand yourself more as a pitcher, it's easier
to pitch. ... Hitters have been the same since I came up. You've
got some righties; you've got some lefties; you've got some
fastball hitters; you've got some guys that'll steal bases, guys
that hit homers. They just have a different name on their back.
That's why I think understanding yourself makes it easier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's been harder for you to do physically as you've gotten
older?
</P>
<P>
   A: You wake up in the morning and run the first sprint. The
first sprint now is a jog. A very light one. Rebound (between
starts) is a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At what point do you start to wonder if age is affecting your
pitching?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm on extra credit. I've been on extra credit for a couple
years now. I'm free-rolling right now. I'm enjoying it. I'm doing
my job. Pitching is fun, traveling is fun, hanging out with the
guys is fun, messing around when the games aren't going on is fun.

MARINE JURY WEIGHS FATE OF JET PILOT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ A jury of eight Marine officers began
deliberating Wednesday afternoon whether a pilot whose plane struck
ski-lift cables in the Italian Alps 13 months ago was guilty of a
crime, or whether the incident that killed all 20 people in a
gondola was simply an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, the pilot of the EA-6B Prowler, faces a
sentence of 200 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter if the
jury concludes that he was ``culpably negligent,'' which the judge
defined as acting with ``a gross, reckless, wanton or deliberate
disregard for the foreseeable results to others.''
</P>
<P>
   He could be convicted of a lesser crime, negligent homicide, if
the jury concludes his negligence was simple rather than culpable.
He also faces charges of dereliction of duty, failure to plan the
flight properly, destroying government property and destroying
private property.
</P>
<P>
   But he could be acquitted of all charges if the jury concludes,
as his lawyer argued Wednesday, that the incident was ``an accident
waiting to happen'' because the ski lift did not appear on charts
available to the jet's crew, among other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not acquit Captain Ashby because he's a fellow Marine
officer,'' the lawyer, Frank Spinner, said in closing arguments
this morning. ``Do not convict Captain Ashby because 20 people
died.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chief prosecutor, Maj. Daniel Daugherty, said, ``He put
himself in a situation he couldn't get out of, at maximum speed and
minimum height.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane's target altitude was 1,000 feet above the ground, but
it struck the cables at about 360 feet. The plane was at maximum
thrust at the time, said Daugherty, so ``there's nothing left in
that aircraft to give; he is on a rocket sled going right through
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial has run through hours of complicated detail about
various flaws that led up to the accident. In addition to the fact
that the cable was not on American charts, a crucial argument for
the defense is that the radar altimeter, which measures distance
above the ground, may not have worked because of the way the plane
was banking sharply, pointing its belly at distant mountains
instead of the nearby ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 1,000-foot rule is now etched in the blood of 20
civilians,'' Daugherty told the jurors. ``There is no good reason
to be down that low, no good reason to be maneuvering with that
population right there, all those houses, all those people, all
that humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintained that the accident occurred because instead of
following the rules, Ashby was ``down where he wants to be, making
the decisions he wants to make, flying the aircraft the way he
wants to fly it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spinner argued that Ashby had no reason to skirt the rules.
Among other factors, Spinner said, Ashby was at the end of a
six-month deployment in Aviano, Italy, a few days from rotating
back to his home base at Cherry Point, N.C., a few miles from here,
and had been selected to switch to flying F-18's, a higher-status
job.

HIGH COURT RULES PUBLIC MUST PAY FOR IN-SCHOOL CARE FOR DISABLED
STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds.: Subs 7th graf to give boy's name as Garret Frey, sted of
Garret F.)  (fe) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Students with disabilities who require special care
during the school day are entitled to that care at public expense,
the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday, as long as the services can
be provided by someone other than a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision upheld lower court rulings that required an
Iowa school district to provide a trained aide to monitor the needs
of a quadriplegic boy who was dependent on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   It was a substantial victory for families of children with
disabilities, who have become increasingly assertive about their
rights under federal law and who in many cases have met resistance
from school districts burdened by the mounting costs of special
education.
</P>
<P>
   Without someone available at all times, the boy, a bright
student who was injured in a childhood accident, would not have
been able to attend school. The question was whether the parents
had to pay for the full-time aide or whether the school district
had that obligation under a federal law, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act, which guarantees a ``free appropriate
public education'' to students with disabilities. The law provides
that in addition to special education, school districts must pay
for ``related services'' but need not pay for ``medical services.''
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for the family, the court adhered to its view in a
1984 case that as long as a student's physical needs can be met by
someone who is not a doctor, the required services do not fall
within the excluded ``medical services'' category. ``A rule that
limits the medical services exemption to physician services is
unquestionably a reasonable and generally workable interpretation
of the statute,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said in the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cedar Rapids Community School District had argued that the
question should be not whether a doctor or someone else provided
the services, but rather how complex, continuous and expensive the
services were, a ``multifactor test'' requiring a detailed analysis
of each case. But ``the district's multifactor test is not
supported by any recognized source of legal authority,'' Stevens
said. ``The district may have legitimate financial concerns, but
our role in this dispute is to interpret existing law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the district argued that the cost would be more than
$20,000 a year, the majority opinion disputed this, noting that the
boy, Garret Frey, was already entitled to an aide who turned pages
for him and kept his desk in order. The district could hire an aide
who could both perform those tasks and be trained to attend to the
ventilator and other physical needs, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that without the services Garret could not stay in
school, Stevens said, ``This case is about whether meaningful
access to the public schools will be assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion in the case,
Cedar Rapids vs. Garret F., No. 96-1793, which Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy joined. Congress passed the law ``to increase the
educational opportunities available to disabled children, not to
provide medical care for them,'' they said, adding that the law as
interpreted by the court ``blindsides unwary states with fiscal
obligations that they could not have anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The National School Boards Association, which joined the case on
the district's side, said in its brief that providing the services
would be particularly burdensome to small school districts. The
association estimated that 17,000 children would be affected
nationwide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a second decision on Wednesday, the court ruled that private
insurance companies that administer part of a state's workers'
compensation program do not thereby become agents of the state for
constitutional purposes. The distinction matters because only state
officials or ``state actors'' can be sued for deprivations of
constitutional rights. The allegation in this case was that
insurers in Pennsylvania deprived injured workers of due process by
suspending payment during disputes over the necessity of particular
medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
which was 7-2 on the state action question, overturned a ruling by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action taken by private entities with the mere approval or
acquiescence of the state is not state action,'' the chief justice
said. Stevens and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not join this
portion of the ruling, arguing that the state action analysis was
unnecessary because the court then went on to decide that the due
process claim lacked merit even against the state officials who
also were defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. vs.
Sullivan, No. 97-2000, was closely watched for its broader
implications in an era when public functions are increasingly being
turned over to private entities. One immediate impact is likely to
be a victory for the federal government in a long-running dispute
over whether the Department of Health and Human Services must hold
private health maintenance organizations, which enroll Medicare
recipients, to various due process requirements in handling
disputes with their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Clinton administration filed a Supreme Court
appeal of an injunction, issued by a federal court in Tucson,
Ariz., in a nationwide class action lawsuit, that required HMOs to
meet various requirements for notice and hearings. In the appeal,
Shalala vs. Grijalva, No. 98-1284, the administration is arguing
that the HMOs are not state actors. On the basis of Wednesday's
ruling, the court is likely to agree and to vacate the injunction.

SPORTS COLUMN: HARD WORK TRANSFORMS A PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You don't see Leonard Hamilton relax that often. On
the sidelines, during practices, watching film, Hamilton, the coach
of the University of Miami's surging basketball team, moves with a
never-ending sense of urgency. He lives in a world where the
mission is never complete, the deed never done.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton smiled Tuesday and perhaps briefly allowed himself
to absorb the moment. This was at the announcement of the Big East
Conference's individual honors. Hamilton's Miami Hurricane program
received three awards: Johnny Hemsley was voted the most improved
player; Tim James shared most valuable player with Richard Hamilton
of Connecticut, and Leonard Hamilton, in his ninth season, was
voted the league's coach of the year for the second time in three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't what made him smile. Etan Thomas, the Syracuse
junior center, did. As Thomas accepted his defensive player of the
year award, he hesitated and looked over at James. ``I know this is
unusual,'' he said ``but I'd like to congratulate Tim James. He's
really someone I look up to and respect. The thing I really admire
about him is he's understated and humble. So, my hat's off to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' impromptu tribute spoke volumes about James and
illuminated a Miami program that has come from extinction to having
a defining presence at a cozy private school that has searched for
an alternative to the bruising national reputation of its football
team.
</P>
<P>
   What it has is Hamilton, a 50-year-old coaching alchemist who
has taken the best elements of his most ferocious Big East rivals,
combined them and produced a formula that has become daunting: a
cup of Georgetown's unyielding toughness, a tablespoon of
Syracuse's elan, a pinch of Connecticut's precision and a heavy
dose of the sleeves-rolled-up, dusk-to-dawn hard work Hamilton
learned growing up in Gastonia, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Miami finished second in the Big East with a school-record 15
conference victories and, at 21-5, had 20 victories for the first
time in a season since 1965. The Hurricanes, at No. 9, enjoy their
highest ranking since 1965, the last year they were ranked. Last
month Miami handed Connecticut a stunning defeat in Storrs.
Thursday it is the second-seeded team in a Big East tournament
quarterfinal against the winner of Wednesday night's
Georgetown-Providence game. ``We're a team that's trying to build a
tradition,'' he said. ``Once we get there, I hope we'll stay
there.''
</P>
<P>
   A slide is unlikely. Hamilton's upbringing won't let him stop.
He was formed by the discipline of parents who sometimes gave him
whippings in front of friends; his father woke Hamilton and his
brothers at midnight to make them cut the grass they had neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's basketball tradition fits in a thimble. The 1959-60 team
earned its first NCAA tournament berth. Rick Barry played there
from 1962 to 1965. In 1971, Miami dropped the sport. Even when
Miami brought basketball back as an independent in 1985, the
program, with no arena, had to schedule around everything from the
circus to conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no arena, no conference affiliation and no program for
14 years _ that was the most attractive part of the job for me,''
Hamilton said. ``So many coaches look for a job where the streets
are already paved with gold. That's easy. I've always been
motivated by challenges: this was a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton attended junior college, then transferred to
Tennessee-Martin on a basketball scholarship. After graduation he
took a coaching job at Austin Peay, where he was a graduate
assistant, newly married with a son and working on his master's
degree. Hamilton ordered his younger brother, who was struggling
with high school academics, to leave Gastonia and move in, adopting
him. After his brother left for college, Hamilton ordered his next
youngest brother to move in, then, after he advanced to the
University of Kentucky, his sister and then his nephew. He adopted
each one.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton deals in hard work and transformation. He remembers
riding on the back of buses, getting food from the rear of
segregated restaurants. He was the first black assistant at
Kentucky, where he spent 12 years, then the head coach at Oklahoma
State, where he spent four seasons, and now is rebuilding at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've ever said in my life is `Why not?''' he said. `` `Why
not me,' or `Why not us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's success is about strategy and guile but also about
fundamental issues of discipline, persistence, toughness and
restraint. The Hurricanes were 0-18 in the Big East in 1993-94, and
now they're breathing down the necks of the contenders. Etan Thomas
picked up on a subtlety Tuesday, and Leonard Hamilton smiled.

 &HT;    Auburn, Florida building powers
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Outside Humphrey Coliseum, Starkville, Miss., loomed
like the end of the world, even more than usual. Thunder roared.
The heavens burst, and rain gusted across the Mississippi State
campus. Lightning crackled and lit the landscape like
hell-or-come-high-water noon. Yet the most otherworldly phenomenon
was happening inside The Hump.
</P>
<P>
   In a hallway outside the visitors' locker room, a splendid point
guard named Doc Robinson was autographing a poster and T-shirt
heralding the 1999 SEC regular-season champions. Ladies and
gentlemen, your _ Auburn Tigers? What in the name of Babe McCarthy
is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of our goals to come in and win the (SEC) West,''
Robinson said Saturday after Auburn punctuated the most remarkable
regular season in school history with its 26th win, surviving State
76-73. ``Now that we've won both the West and the regular season,
we want to move on to bigger and better things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win the SEC Tournament, and we want to make a real
strong statement in the NCAA Tournament,'' said Scott Pohlman,
Auburn's skinny sophomore shooting guard from Roswell. ``The sky's
the limit for this team. It's been a dream of mine forever to go to
the Final Four. I think we have a team that can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman is neither alone nor a loon. As the SEC Tournament opens
today in the Georgia Dome, the consensus favorite isn't perennial
pick Kentucky, but Auburn. Since the Tigers last danced in the NCAA
Tournament in 1988, every other SEC team has been to the NCAA's at
least twice. Now Auburn arrives with a 26-2 record, a No. 4
national ranking and a likely No. 1 seed in an NCAA regional in its
hip pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can do it at South Alabama, you can do it anywhere,''
said Tigers coach Cliff Ellis, who wrought similar miracles in
Mobile and later Clemson before coming to Auburn in 1994. ``That's
South Alabama, with no _ nada _ tradition. And Clemson was the
doormat of the ACC.''
</P>
<P>
   And Auburn basketball was an after-football afterthought at a
football-mad school in a pigskin-crazed conference. Look now. Ellis
has made hoops matter in the land of King Football. He, too, is not
alone. The SEC East titleist? Tennessee, which dethroned Kentucky
on Sunday for its first championship since 1982 and its first
season sweep of the 'Cats since '79. And if Florida hadn't stumbled
in overtime at Vanderbilt on Saturday, Kentucky would have finished
third in the SEC East behind Billy Donovan's kids from Steve
Spurrier's school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that one-point loss, Florida (19-7, 10-6 SEC) is the
second-most improved team in the SEC. The Gators were 14-15 last
year, 6-10 in the SEC. Auburn, of course, made a quantum leap of
Chris Porter proportions: from 16-14 (7-9) to 26-2 (14-2) and the
school's only SEC title since 1960. ``It's a league that, because
of its football success, has a chance to be successful in
anything,'' Florida The trick, though, is sustaining it.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn went to five NCAA tournaments in a row, 1984-88, but
never before and not since. Florida reached its first Final Four in
1994 and returned to the NCAA Tournament in '95. But the Gators
then suffered three losing seasons in a row and have experienced
what Donovan and Foley call ``pockets of success.'' Until Norm
Sloan took Florida to three consecutive NCAA tourneys, 1987-89, and
won the school's lone SEC title in 1989, the Gators had never made
the national tournament. Foley did what Auburn did: hired the right
man for the job. Ellis, now 53 and 20 years older than Donovan, was
48 when Auburn hired him. The school initially wanted a young Duke
assistant named Mike Brey. When Brey went to Delaware, Auburn
turned to Ellis, with his sweater vests and a penchant for
developing big men and singing beach music. Ellis first recorded
while a student at Florida State, as the lead singer for a group
called ''The Villagers.'' He later sang with Roy Orbison, Charlie
Rich, Delbert McClinton and Etta James and cut two CDs while
coaching at Clemson, where he won the school's lone ACC
regular-season title in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Until this season, the only Big Dance at Auburn was the shag
Ellis loves so dearly. But Ellis has been implementing the
five-year plan that came to fruition at South Alabama and Clemson.
Auburn's football heritage never daunted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can cut a record at 17,'' Ellis said, ``write a book at
29 (on basketball coaching), go from junior high to Cumberland
College, you never doubt yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The zone press featured in the book helps Auburn wear down
opponents and features Porter frenetically guarding the inbounds
passer. Porter is the 6-foot-7 junior power forward who couldn't
qualify for Auburn out of high school, attended Chipola Junior
College in Marianna, Fla., and now is the SEC Player of the Year.
But it's Robinson, the son of Selma whose signing Ellis calls the
key to Auburn's success, who is largely responsible for Auburn's
SEC-best turnover margin of plus 7.5. ``If there's a better college
point guard ...,'' Ellis says about Robinson, ``he's the college
point guard.'' The result: a 17-0 start before a 72-62 loss at
Kentucky, where three Tigers played with the flu, most notably
Robinson, and eight more wins before a 104-88 loss at Arkansas on
Senior Night. That dropped Auburn from No. 2 _ its highest ranking
since reaching No. 2 for a week in 1959 _ to No. 4. Auburn has
embraced these Tigers with such fervor that home games sell out and
afterwards fans roll Toomer's Corner with toilet paper. Just like
after football games. ``This sounds cheesy and corny, but watching
them, they motivate me,'' said Amy Bryant, an Auburn senior. ``With
all the, you know, stuff that's been going on with the athletic
department, I think the basketball team has shown how we can rise
above the bad situations with (football). The basketball team is a
good metaphor for what this university is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gainesville, meanwhile, that basketball team also is proving
that basketball can co-exist with football. Not that Donovan ever
doubted that, or himself. ``The one thing about the University of
Florida is people love the Gators,'' he said. ``All the sports here
have competed on a national level. I'm not coming in here with the
attitude I'm going to make this a basketball school. It's a
national sports school.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also Billy the Kid's school, at least to basketball
recruits. ``Recruiting's the name of the game here,'' Foley said.
``And the key component there is Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   That was quickly apparent to Foley when he interviewed Donovan
immediately after Kruger bolted for Champaign in March '96. Donovan
had just completed his second successful season at Marshall,
employing the same run-and-gun-the-three, full-pressure style he
had learned under Rick Pitino as the star of Providence's unlikely
1987 Final Four team and then had coached while an assistant to
Pitino at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick told me (that), of all the people he'd coached and had
coached with him, Billy knew his style of play best,'' Foley said,
``because he'd played and coached in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley also was taken by Donovan's personality, youthful
exuberance and straightforwardness. ``I felt comfortable with him,
and I thought parents and recruits would feel comfortable with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was mutual. ``I trusted Jeremy,'' Donovan said. ``I
was talking to a straight-shooter. ... The big thing here was the
lack of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   That was symbolized by the O-Dome _ O'Connell Center, the
12,000-seat, Teflon-roof dome that was rarely filled and seldom
daunting for opponents. ``When I first got this job, people told
me, 'You've gotta get a new building.' I think this building has
been pretty good to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That building was deafening the night of Feb. 4, soliciting this
critique from Kentucky coach Tubby Smith after Florida's 75-68
upset: ``We've never played in a tougher arena.'' Indeed,
basketball has become a game of hoarse in the O-Dome, where the
Gators were 14-1 this season and where Florida fans are now as
vocal, and vulgar, as their football counterparts. The reason is
three-fold: three-pointers galore, including 17 in last week's
89-61 annihilation of South Carolina; the kids who fire 'em up; and
Donovan, whose slicked-back black hair renders him Eddie Munster
reincarnate. And Eddie Munster, who knows he's recruiting
teenagers, not traditionalists, is creating a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key is recruiting,'' Donovan said. ``You want to
put up borders around the state.'' Unlike Kruger, who was crushed
when Vince Carter of Daytona Beach chose North Carolina over
Florida, Donovan has managed to keep much homegrown talent at home.
First, sophomore forwards Brent Wright and Major Parker. Then, this
year's celebrated freshman class that includes three Floridians:
center Udonis Haslem, shooting guard LaDarius Halton and Teddy
Dupay, who alternates at point guard and is the poster boy for
Donovan's in-state allure. Dupay committed to Florida after his
sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good reputation in the state, so if I committed maybe
(other Floridians) would come,'' said Dupay, who loved Donovan's
style of play. ``Being (that it was) a football school, it took
some guts. I broke the ice. Other players didn't have to do that. I
did it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Donovan to achieve his goal _ ``to win a national
championship'' _- he also has to venture afar. ``You've got to get
some guys that are strong enough to leave their home state and not
feel any pressure about doing it,'' he said. He first found one in
6-8 swingman Mike Miller, the McDonald's All-American from South
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's aggressive recruiting of Miller caused Kansas coach
Roy Williams to complain _unsuccessfully _ to the NCAA. Now Donovan
has signed West Virginia guard Brett Nelson, the state's best
prospect since Jerry West; and Matt Bonner, a coveted 6-9 forward
from New Hampshire. Their recruitment prompted South Carolina coach
Eddie Fogler to complain _ unsuccessfully _ to the SEC and led to
an ugly, preseason feud in which Fogler questioned Donovan's
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem was I never got a phone call from either
coach,'' Donovan said. ``That definitely bothered me. The NCAA's
looked into it. The SEC's looked into it. Nothing came out. We
didn't do anything (illegal).'' Just as Auburn has done, the Gators
have spawned a cultural revolution in a stronghold of King
Football. ``The fans have really responded,'' Foley said. ``And if
Billy can deliver the kind of product he can, that culture will
change. Hopefully, forever.''

 Web Makes It Easy to Get Tax Software, Send Forms to IRS  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
You can shop on the Internet, chat on the Internet, get your news
on the Internet, even apply for a job on the Internet. So it stands
to reason that you also can use the Internet at tax time.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you need an obscure IRS form or complete tax preparation
software, it can be downloaded from the Web to your personal
computer. And you can even do your taxes right on the Internet,
without any packaged software at all.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, whether you prepare your taxes using commercial
software or a Web-based program, you can file your return
electronically _ a move that can halve the time it takes to get a
refund.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the IRS is pushing heavily for people to file
their taxes electronically. It helps the agency cut costs and
reduces the number of errors made in processing returns.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet, though, that taxpayers are more motivated by
the prospect of a quick refund than by making life easier for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to the IRS, 24.6 million taxpayers filed
electronically. The majority went to professional tax preparers who
created and filed returns for them.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing number of individuals are taking tax matters
into their own hands. Some 8 million taxpayers last year used their
computers to prepare and file their taxes, and the number is
expected to rise substantially this year.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of electronic filing suggests that consumers
aren't worried about possible security dangers involved in sending
sensitive tax information across cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing electronic filing go up every year because it's
getting easier and less costly,'' said Gina Rodriquez, an editor
with Spidell Publishing, which publishes a newsletter for
California tax professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be reason for concern, especially since you
can't electronically file directly to the IRS. Instead, you must
send your return to a third-party ``transmitter,'' who then sends
it into the IRS computer system. Leading transmitters include
Intuit, the maker of TurboTax software, and Nelco, which processes
returns for Kiplinger TaxCut and many professional tax preparers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the IRS can't accept returns directly is that its
computers aren't capable of guaranteeing security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a 1960s computer system that still uses
tape drives,'' said IRS spokesman Larry Wright. ``Third-party
transmitters are equipped to handle security, and the IRS isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little threat to information as it's being sent over
the Internet, because it's scrambled prior to transmission with a
state-of-the-art encryption code. It's when a return is sitting in
a transmitter's computer that it's at the highest risk of being
hacked. And it can sit there for up to three years to satisfy
government record-keeping regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more steps you have between the consumer and the IRS, the
more likelihood you have for vulnerabilities,'' says Internet
privacy expert Ira Winkler.
</P>
<P>
   Security aside, the Internet really takes the pain out of
dealing with Uncle Sam in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Tax software: &LR;  Basic versions of TurboTax and TaxCut, the
leading tax preparation programs, can be purchased and downloaded
online. TaxCut is available for $19.95 at  &LR; www.taxcut.com. &LR; 
TurboTax, at $29.95, can be downloaded from  &LR; www.turbotax.com. &LR; 
Those versions are for federal returns. State versions also can be
downloaded for an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The programs also are available in CD form at retail stores. And
you can buy deluxe multimedia versions of the federal programs that
boast extra help with tax planning.
</P>
<P>
   TaxCut and TurboTax offer similar features. They both walk you
through an interview to determine your tax status, number of
dependents, etc., and they both calculate your taxes as you enter
financial information. In addition, you can override the automatic
controls and fill in forms directly.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs produce crisp, clean printouts that can be mailed
directly to the IRS. Or you can file electronically, either over
the Internet or by taking your completed return on a disk to a
professional tax preparer. Filing electronically typically costs
around $10 if you do it yourself, and more if you go to someone
else. TaxCut is offering a rebate to cover its $9.95 online filing
fee.
</P>
<P>
   This year TaxCut may be a better value than TurboTax. Not only
is it less expensive, but if you buy the deluxe version, you can
download the software for your state return for free. With
TurboTax, you have to buy the state program in addition to the
federal program.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Web-based programs:  &LR; The Web-based version of TurboTax, which
you'll find at  &LR; www.webturbotax.com,  &LR; is the leading
tax-preparation site online. It gives you most of the features of
the TurboTax CD program, without the hassle of having to install
any software.
</P>
<P>
   WebTurboTax's major competitor is SecureTax.com from Universal
Tax Systems &LR;  (www.securetax.com). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Both WebTurboTax and SecureTax.com let you try before you buy.
That means you can create your return for free _ you only pay if
you decide to print or electronically file it. WebTurboTax charges
$19.95 for a regular 1040, while SecureTax charges $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Free filing:  &LR; If your adjusted gross income is under $20,000 a
year, you can use the Web version of TurboTax for free (including
filing). Similarly, TaxCut , which doesn't have a full-fledged
Web-based program, offers a 1040EZ form on its Web site that's free
to anyone who qualifies to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Free tax information and advice is plentiful on the Net. The IRS
maintains an extensive Web site  &LR; (www.irs.gov),  &LR; which includes all
forms, regulations and publications for the current tax year.
Materials can be downloaded for free, although you'll probably need
Adobe's Acrobat Reader software to view and print them. (You can
download that program at no charge from Adobe at  &LR; www.adobe.com &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Other good destinations for tax information include Yahoo's Tax
Center ( &LR; biz.yahoo.com/taxes &LR; ), and the tax planning area in
America Online's Personal Finance channel.

 Column: Ins, Outs of ADSL Technology  &HT;

_ is a technology that lets you access the Internet at speeds at
least 50 times greater than you get with a 28.8 Kbps modem. It's
always on, so you don't have to dial each time you want to surf the
Web. And you can use the phone at the same time you're online. ADSL
currently is available from local phone companies in many
communities across the country, including most areas of California.
</P>
<P>
   Any new PC is capable of using ADSL, but you will need some
extra equipment, to wit: an ADSL modem, a network card to connect
the modem to the PC and a device called a splitter that connects
the modem to your telephone line. The easiest way to get this stuff
is to buy it from the phone firm that provides the ADSL service.
Pacific Bell, for instance, offers installation plus hardware for
under $200.
</P>
<P>
   As for the service itself, Pac Bell recently lowered the price
of ADSL with Internet access to $49 a month.

   Color Me Confused
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain in easy-to-understand language the difference
between 16 color, 256 color, 16-bit color and 24-bit color? These
are all options for my Windows video display. I'm currently using
256 color. Would one of the other settings be better?
</P>
<P>
   A: The number of colors displayed on your monitor depends on the
number of bits used to represent each pixel. A bit is the smallest
piece of data used by a computer. A pixel (a contraction of
``picture element'') is the smallest element on a video-display
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The more bits used to represent a pixel, the more colors can be
generated. The standard these days is 256 color, which uses eight
bits. If you go to 16-bit color, also known as High Color, you'll
have 65,536 colors. And 24-bit color, also known as True Color,
gives you up to 16.8 million hues. Why anyone would need that many
is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   How many colors you can display depends on a number of factors,
including your monitor, the amount of video memory in your PC and
the screen resolution you're using. If you want more colors, you
may have to settle for lower resolution, and vice versa. To get
16.8 million colors at a high resolution like 1,024 by 768 pixels,
you'd need 4 megabytes of video memory. But even if you only have 1
Mbyte, you can have a sharp picture by choosing High Color and 800
by 600 resolution.
</P>
<P>
   E-Mail From Abroad
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm going to Greece and Italy for five months, and I need to
be able to send and receive e-mail from my laptop while I'm abroad.
I also need to be able to connect to my e-mail account with my
employers. What are the options?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COMPUTE0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  A: Here's what I'd do if were lucky enough to spend a few months
near the Mediterranean. As soon as I got settled in, I'd get an
Internet account from a local access provider. Then, I'd create a
free e-mail account for myself using Hotmail  &LR; (www.hotmail.com)  &LR; or
any of the big portals _ Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, etc. _ all of
which offer it. I'd then configure my free e-mail so that I could
check my office mail. (To do that, you must know the name of your
company's incoming mail server, plus your log-on ID and password.)
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of other options, both of which are too
expensive to warrant much consideration. One is international
roaming, which your current Internet service provider may offer. It
lets you sign onto your Internet account using the phone number of
a local ISP in a foreign country. But it costs extra _ around 10
cents a minute. Roaming really is good only for business travelers
who are constantly hopping around.
</P>
<P>
   The other alternative is to get an America Online account (if
you don't already have one) before you leave the States and dial
into your account through a local AOL number in Greece or Italy.
But this also will cost you 10 cents a minute, on top of your
regular AOL rate. Like roaming, this solution is best for visiting
a foreign country, not living in it.

 Microsoft to Unveil Strategy to Best Rivals in E-Commerce  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. has been an also-ran in the fast-growing field of
electronic commerce, but the company's top two executives, Chairman
Bill Gates and President Steve Ballmer are coming to town today to
try to leapfrog the competition.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning briefing at the Argent Hotel for analysts and
reporters, Gates and Ballmer will unveil Microsoft's new
``electronic commerce strategy'' to help companies do business on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the Redmond, Wash., software giant expect
the strategy to include a new plan to offer tools and services to
help small businesses set up e-commerce sites on the Web through
Microsoft's MSN.com ``portal'' site, which was originally intended
as a consumer-oriented site competing with the likes of America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also expected to announce e-commerce alliances with
companies like MasterCard International and to highlight business
services that will come with the new Windows 2000 operating system
upgrade to Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Microsoft wasn't going to break new ground but was
rather repackaging itself for the expanding world of Internet
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge market: E-commerce sales are expected to hit $133
billion in 2000 and $202 billion in 2001, according to Zona
Research of Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has uncharacteristically been slow to articulate and
develop a cohesive strategy on how it's going to play in the
e-commerce space,'' said Dwight Davis, an analyst who tracks
Microsoft for Summit Strategies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would only say that Gates and Ballmer will brief
analysts and reporters about the company's new strategy, ``new
technologies and initiatives'' and Gates' ``vision for the future
of the digital marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM has been more successful in marketing its image as a company
that provides business-to-consumer services, said Jack Staff, chief
economist for Zona Research, which was briefed on Microsoft's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MICROSOF () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Microsoft offered similar services through its consumer and
server software but has not done a good job making that known to
businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web services aimed toward small- and medium-size businesses
will be another attempt to ``make Microsoft more visible as an
e-commerce power,'' said Rob Enderle, analyst at Giga Information
Group in Santa Clara.

 Bill to Build the Internet Focuses on Speed, Spam  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A sweeping bill to accelerate Internet growth without regulating
the fledgling market is expected to be introduced in Congress this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan legislation would encourage large-scale
availability of high-speed Internet connections for consumers,
place a lid on spam and require the use of ``digital signatures''
for all online commercial transactions. It also may place strict
limits on how Web vendors collect personal information from their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a regulatory measure. It is a a measure to foster
Internet development,'' said Representative Rick Boucher, D-Va.,
who is co-chairman of the House Internet Caucus and co-author of
the bill with Representative Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The far-ranging bill addresses several hot-button issues for the
Internet, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Bandwidth. &LR;  The cornerstone of the bill would push for
deployment of blur-fast broadband networks to Internet service
providers and, consequently, to consumers, businesses and
educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Internet to achieve its potential as a multimedia
platform for voice, video and data, the connection speeds have to
increase,'' Boucher said. ``Unfortunately, most people still rely
on dial-up modems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bandwidth is a topic of fierce debate in the Internet industry,
where America Online and Yahoo are lobbying cable companies to sell
room on their broadband networks _ which are up to 100 times faster
than standard telephone-line connections _ to ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission indicated this year that
it won't require cable operators to share high-speed Internet
access with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Spam.  &LR; Based loosely on a new California law that levies daily
fines of up to $25,000 against junk e-mailers, the
Boucher-Goodlatte bill would establish the first national law to
curb unsolicited commercial e-mail. Internet users have
consistently listed spam as one of their biggest headaches, yet
only a handful of states have bills outlawing the marketing
practice.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Digital signatures.  &LR; This virtual verification system makes it
nearly impossible for individuals to pose as someone else while
making a purchase via the Internet. The added layer of privacy is
likely to assuage the fears of consumers who have doubts about the
security of online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the Internet community will examine this and
agree it is an important step for federal policy,'' said Boucher,
who has discussed details of the bill with Internet service
providers, telephone and cable companies, telecommunications
suppliers and consumer organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those companies like what they have heard so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boucher and Goodlatte are friends of the Net,'' said Jill
Lesser, director of domestic public policy at AOL in Dulles, Va.
``They understand the importance of the industry self-policing
itself and, hopefully, will strike the right balance between
regulation and legislation that either prohibits online abuses like
spam or encourages the wide use of broadband services.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some _ like Alex Fowler, director of public affairs at
the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco _ are skeptical
about how the bill can satisfy the wishes of so many competing
companies in the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative marks a major shift for the 100-member Internet
Caucus, which was formed in 1996 at the height of debate over the
anti-cyberporn Communications Decency Act but has operated almost
exclusively as an ad hoc group where Senate and House members
discuss high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher _ who co-founded the caucus with Senator Conrad Burns,
R-Mt., Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and former Representative Rick
White, R-Wash. _ predicted that it will become a leading source of
Internet legislation on Capitol Hill.

 Montgomery Sales Up 80% in January  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Despite the loss of key personnel and speculation that its business
was eroding, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities' revenue in January
soared 80 percent above the previous year's level, according to
people close to the San Francisco investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, a unit of North Carolina's BankAmerica, booked
income of approximately $75 million during the month, with
brokerage revenue rocketing 146 percent and investment banking
income edging up 1 percent, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended in December, Montgomery's revenue
fell 13 percent from the year before to a little over $175 million.
The drop reflected the stock market meltdown in October, which
brought capital-raising activity nearly to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, for the four months ended in January, Montgomery's
revenue rose 3 percent to a little over $250 million, with
brokerage income up 89 percent and investment banking income down
38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The firm doesn't release specific revenue figures, but a
spokeswoman confirmed the general accuracy of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Montgomery chief executive Thomas Weisel quit
the firm he helped found nearly three decades before in a dispute
with the parent company, then known as NationsBank, over control of
key business lines.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 employees, including several senior partners, joined
him in starting a new investment bank, prompting speculation that
Montgomery's business had been crippled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery is doing much better than expected,'' said Michael
Flanagan, an independent securities industry analyst based in the
Philadelphia area. ``The numbers don't suggest the diminution of
franchise value.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan said Montgomery's brokerage operations, buying and
selling securities for institutional investors, is going
gangbusters, reflecting recent sharp gains in stock market volume.
Meanwhile, its business of raising capital and providing merger
advice to corporations is just holding its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've maintained market share in all key products,''
Montgomery chief executive Lewis Coleman said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONTGOME () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The firm's ability to hold its investment banking practice
together is due in part to business it has won from BankAmerica
clients. For example, last month, it helped manage the $300 million
public stock offering of San Francisco's Del Monte Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals said Montgomery has lost business in such traditional
areas of strength as technology and health care because of the
resignations of senior investment bankers and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery is fighting to recoup traditional business by
recruiting high-profile staff members. On Tuesday, it announced it
had hired Deutsche Bank Securities star Internet analyst Alan
Braverman, filling a vacuum left by the defection of David
Readerman to Weisel's new firm.

 Column: Cnet Tiptoes Into E-Commerce, But Can It Avoid
Amazonian  Mistakes?  By Dan Fost  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Memo to Cnet: Step carefully into e-commerce. It's a minefield for
a media company.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Amazon.com, which was roasted for putting its book
reviews up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Amazon is primarily an online store, so its ``ethical
lapse'' is forgivable, or at least understandable.
</P>
<P>
   But Cnet holds itself up as a &UR;  &LR; media company providing news and
reviews, even as it aggressively adds e-commerce elements. Cnet
actively posts links to sites selling products that Cnet reviews,
taking a commission on each referral (but not the actual sale).
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cnet ponied up $5.8 million for AuctionGate
Interactive, sort of a small-scale eBay for consumer-to-consumer
auctions of computer products. And in February, Cnet paid $12.1
million for NetVentures, an e-commerce software firm. Last year,
Cnet launched its own e-commerce site, Shopper.com, and it also
owns 16 percent of e-tailer BuyDirect.com.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of toes dipping into the e-commerce waters. How can
a company high on its first profitable year resist the urge to
Amazon-ize?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a media company, we've been, from day one, very aware of
... what the church and state line is,'' said Matthew Barzun, 28,
senior vice president of Cnet Online. (How can a 28-year-old be
senior anything? Easy _ Barzun was the company's third employee
five years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Barzun conceded that the line between church (editorial) and
state (advertising/e-commerce) is thin in the online world, but he
asserted that ``it's a bright shining line. You cannot buy
editorial influence.''
</P>
<P>
   That's important because as e-commerce grows, it threatens to
overtake advertising as the Web's main economic engine. Cnet draws
most of its revenue by selling ads on its site, but most Internet
companies now seek their bread-and-butter through direct online
sales to consumers or other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Cnet is not immune to the siren song of e-commerce. ``I doubt
Cnet could sustain its stock price based on advertising revenues
alone,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst with IDC (and a former Cnet
executive).
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDIA04 (98635 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Cnet's new front page, launched Monday, steers readers of its
high-tech reviews to links to purchase the gadgets and gizmos. From
Cnet.com, a user can click to see reviews of digital cameras and
then click on ``latest prices'' for the Kodak DC 200. That leads to
a chart with links to 21 online retailers. The first three on the
list _ NECX, HardwareStreet.com and Egghead.com _ have little
colored ads, and the next two, Virtual World and Computers4Sure,
are in bold. Ads for the rest, presumably companies that didn't pay
extra, are in a regular typeface.
</P>
<P>
   Gasp! That sounds like priority listings! But is it a conflict
of Amazonian proportions?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a media company, all you do is stand between buyers and
sellers,'' Barzun said. ``It doesn't mean that to say where to buy
something is dirty. That's what people want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the chart can be sorted by price, so the paying
advertisers could land much lower on the list.
</P>
<P>
   When Amazon.com's review policy was discovered, it landed on the
front page of newspapers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Cnet betrays its trust, you'll hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN'T STOP THE PRESSES &LR; : When mistakes happen, online media
have an edge over publications printed on dead trees: They can wipe
the story out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Or can they? Even though Cnet's News.com pulled an inaccurate
story within an hour of its posting last week, someone else had
already snagged the story _ and posted it on his own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened: First, News.com reported on a dispute
between Apple Computer and a Canadian teenager who had registered
the domain name  &LR; www.appleimac.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then in a follow-up piece, the site erroneously reported that
Apple apparently had registered the domain name  &LR; www.traya.net &LR;  _ a
name similar to the teen's tiny consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Apple, which had declined comment on the follow-up story,
had not registered  &LR; www.traya.net &LR; . Instead, it was Ben Reser, a
21-year-old software author in Issaquah, Wash. Reser, who had
followed news of the teenager's dispute with Apple, said he was
only joking when he registered the domain name with Network
Solutions, falsely claiming that he was a representative of Apple
Computer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MEDIA04 (98635 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  News.com fell for the joke. Then it acted responsibly, yanked the
erroneous story and posted a correction on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   End of story _ except that Reser had already made a copy and
posted it at  &LR; www.traya.net &LR; . He accused Cnet of erasing the error
the way Soviet bureaucrats rewrote history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once they publish something, it should stay. It makes
them responsible for what they publish,'' Reser said.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail, Beth Lipton, an editor at News.com, wrote, ``We
removed the story because it was written on a premise that turned
out to be false. For Apple's sake and to avoid confusion, we did
not want to perpetuate the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ICONOCAST &LR; : With five employees and 36,000 subscribers to
his free e-mail newsletter, Iconocast, serial entrepreneur Michael
Tchong launches his fourth startup with an invitation-only South of
Market party tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Tchong, whose most notable achievement was the founding of the
late, lamented MacWeek, says his new venture, also called
Iconocast, will offer contrarian thinking on the links between
advertising and Web publishing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He won't say what the new venture will be, exactly; he's
saving that for tonight. But you can bet its home will be in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOURNALISM PAYS &LR; : Journalism is not a career that typically
pays big bucks, but James Cramer is not a typical journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, the hedge fund guru who is a co-founder and columnist at
TheStreet.com, will earn $250,000 a year in salary, according to
TheStreet's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't even count his 400,000 stock options, which should
dwarf the salary.
</P>
<P>
   Time for all ink-stained wretches to ask for a raise.

<P>
   LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. _ The residents of the Leisure World
retirement community here voted on Tuesday to transform their gated
patch of ``God's country'' into California's newest city, with
surely one of its oldest populations.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the 18,000 residents of the city, to be
called Laguna Woods, is 77. Laguna Woods, encompassing the
retirement community and some surrounding businesses, will be one
of the few towns in the United States where more than 90 percent of
the population is over 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the election tells us something about what local
government will look like in the 21st century,'' said Mark
Baldassare, a professor of urban and regional planning at the
University of California at Irvine. ``Leisure World gives us a view
into the future of California. As the state ages and more and more
of the population is 65 and older, government will increasingly be
influenced by older voters, and older voters will increasingly be
elected to office.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's election, which followed a state certification
process that took more than a year, Leisure World not only opted to
become a city but also chose a five-member City Council that was
sworn in Wednesday and will now get down to work on tasks like
selecting a mayor and hiring a city manager.
</P>
<P>
   One of those elected was Victor Kay, a 79-year-old retired
accountant who grew up in New York City. Kay said he was excited
about his new city, although he regretted that his wife of nearly
40 years was not alive to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved here 12 years ago, my wife called this an
Eden,'' Kay said. ``She said she came here to die, and that's what
she did in 1993. She loved it here, and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Leisure World has been part of an unincorporated area
of Orange County _ the mailing address is Laguna Hills _ and the
county has administered most services. Now the brand-new City
Council will itself have to tend to contracting for police and fire
services.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said he had nonetheless supported cityhood, partly in the
name of local control and the chance to keep more tax dollars in
the area. But a bigger reason was to give Leisure World's residents
greater say in the heated battle to stop a proposed commercial
airport on the site of the 4,700-acre El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station, which will soon be closed. Now, Kay said, Laguna Woods
will be able to join seven other cities in a united front against
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the vote,'' he said, ``we didn't really have a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   But while opposition to the airport and its accompanying noise
is widespread among the people of Leisure World, there was also
significant opposition to becoming a city. Critics of the idea,
arguing that Leisure World had been running smoothly for 35 years,
saw no need for a change, and worried that the costs of running a
city would increase taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't need it,'' said Harold Woods, who has lived at
Leisure World since retiring nine years ago from his job as a union
official in Los Angeles. ``Now we're going to have five City
Council people, and that's just another layer of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Tuesday was close. The polls closed at 8 p.m., and
90 minutes later the count was dead even. ``If cityhood failed, it
would have been because of a bunch of old fogies,'' Gloria
Marienthal, 73, said Wednesday before getting into a pool to work
out with her synchronized swimming team. ``Many people are just
simply afraid of change.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 10:30 p.m., Mrs. Marienthal felt like celebrating. With
all 32 precincts counted, 51.7 percent of the 10,000 or so voters
were in favor of incorporation, and 48.3 percent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Laguna Woods will become a city on March 24, with nearly all its
residents living behind the gates of Leisure World, which will
retain its name. But the city itself will not be gated. About 60
businesses that make up the bulk of the new city's tax base, from
fast-food restaurants to a home repair warehouse store, lie outside
the gates.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there are swimming pools, tennis courts, riding stables
and comfortable homes that rest on rolling green hills and range in
price from $60,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful place to live,'' Mrs. Marienthal said. ``This
is God's country. And I want to keep it that way. That's why I
voted for change.''

 You Still Can Buy Weapons On eBay  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Despite its recent ban on firearms sales, online auctioneer eBay
yesterday had a missile, a bazooka, a rocket launcher and other
military weapons up for bid.
</P>
<P>
   The auctions raise the question of how much control, if any,
eBay has over its site.
</P>
<P>
   On February 19, the San Jose auctioneer announced that it would
no longer allow the sale of guns or ammunition. The company said it
would no longer take such listings starting February 26, and that
all existing auctions for firearms must be complete by March 5.
</P>
<P>
   However, an auction for a ``live new military tear gas grenade
... that will stop anything that breathes'' began Sunday. (High bid
last night, $202.)
</P>
<P>
   And an auction for a World War II bazooka rocket launcher
started Tuesday. (Current high bid, $175).
</P>
<P>
   Both auctions are advertised to end on Sunday, after tomorrow's
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   When told about the auctions by The Chronicle yesterday, an eBay
spokesman said his company ``will take them down immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The items listed are ``solely the responsibility of the
lister,'' said eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that eBay, the leading online auction house, has no
prior notice or control over what individuals put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, eBay has relied on its users to police its site
and notify eBay when they spot contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Also up for sale yesterday: a ``Classic Nike Ajax surface-to-air
guided missile'' that is 32 feet long and weighs about a ton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great yard ornament,'' the sellers advertises. ``Beats the
pink flamingos any day.''
</P>
<P>
   This auction has welcomed more than 8,000 visitors, but only
three bidders, including one who has offered $2,400 for the
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of these items are advertised as disarmed,
firearms experts said weapons that have been deactivated or
dismantled can often be rearmed or reconfigured so they will fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just astounding to me,'' said Representative Anna
Eshoo, D-Atherton, when she saw the missile and bazooka for sale on
the Web site. ``It takes your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said she is no expert on weaponry, but she was concerned
that some of the items advertised might be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the responsibility of the DOD (Department of Defense),
FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and ATF (Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms) to be on this,'' she said. ``I'm going to get
on them (these agencies).''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers aren't supposed to own most military weapons in the
first place, according to a spokesman for the Department of
Defense. Although restrictions were looser during World War II and
soldiers may have carried guns home with them, sales of military
surplus have been strictly controlled since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never sell these things to private citizens. Either
somebody stole them or brought them back from overseas or just
found them and kept them,'' said DOD spokesman Glenn Flood. ``The
Department of Defense does not sell items like that to individual
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dodd, founder of auctionwatch.com, who spotted the bazooka
for sale, said he was surprised to see the weapon because of eBay's
recent and well-publicized firearms ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all boils down to whether eBay is going to take
responsibility for the auctions that occur on its site.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, eBay disclosed that it is being investigated by a
federal agency for sales that occurred on its Web site. Published
reports have said the probe involves the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, but neither eBay nor the ATF would comment
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, government authorities in New York City,
Pennsylvania, Florida and Oklahoma have investigated alleged fraud
by buyers and sellers on eBay. In some cases sellers have
advertised items falsely or failed to deliver paid-for merchandise.

BAY STATE OFFICIAL TO CHALLENGE HMOS' NONPROFIT STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Responding to a growing outcry from elderly HMO
subscribers who can't afford to pay for prescription drugs,
Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin said Wednesday
he will challenge the right of Massachusetts health maintenance
organizations to keep their tax-exempt, non-profit status.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said in an interview the HMOs' decision last year to
terminate 50,000 elderly Medicare subscribers' unlimited
pharmaceutical benefits was ``the flag that suggested to me they
are not existing as a nonprofit might for the benefit of its
members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to behave like businesses, perhaps they
should be treated as businesses,'' said Galvin, whose office
registers corporations. ``They have made the decision that they
want to behave more like for-profits, and the prescription drug
issue is just one example.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin, state legislators, and advocates for the elderly said
they have been flooded recently with calls from desperate elders
who are reaching the limits of the substitute drug benefits the
HMOs provided. ``We're being deluged,'' said Rep. Harriette
Chandler, a Worcester Democrat who cochairs the Joint Health Care
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The key problem is that some elders have catastrophic drug costs
that are no longer covered by any program. The average outpatient
drug cost for the 21,382 Medicare recipients enrolled in Harvard
Pilgrim's First Seniority plan last year was $1,153, according to
an article published in the current New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   However, 10 percent of the First Seniority enrollees had average
medication costs of $3,953. Various studies have shown that capping
drug coverage ends up costing far more in avoidable hospital and
nursing home stays, noted Stephen B. Soumerai and Dennis
Ross-Degnan, two Harvard Pilgrim researchers who wrote the article.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of tradeoff that Kathy McFarland is currently
weighing. McFarland, a 67-year-old woman who lives with her
diabetic 76-year-old husband in subsidized housing in Marlborough,
has stopped taking an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection
because ``it's not life-threatening.'' She may decide to stop
taking her costly osteoporosis medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I fall and break my hip, I'm not going to die from
osteoporosis,'' McFarland said. ``But I have to take my heart
medication. My husband has to take his diabetes medication and he
has to take his medication for an esophagus condition. And compared
to us, there are people who are really bad off.''
</P>
<P>
   One Central Massachusetts woman reportedly threatened suicide
because she couldn't get needed medications. ``An HMO
representative, who finds it very difficult to keep saying `no, no,
no,' told me he had to keep this woman on the phone until he could
get suicide intervention,'' said Janice Long of the Marlborough
Council on Elder Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Long told of a couple on Medicare who have prescription drug
costs of $2,146.61 per quarter-year, far beyond the $200 per
quarter that the First Seniority program now allows. They do not
qualify for a ``transitional aid'' program that HMOs have made
available to pay drug costs beyond that because their income is
$28,000, above the $21,700 eligibility limit for a married couple
under the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gentleman was in my office the other day and he was all
swollen because he had stopped taking his blood pressure
medication,'' Long said. ``He said, `I'll give my drug allowance to
my wife to keep her alive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has just about exploded,'' Galvin said of the
calls to his office in response to a consumer fact sheet on
Medicare HMO drug coverage published by his office. ``I don't think
it's an exaggeration to say the situation has become
life-threatening for many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state's decision stunned HMO representatives.
``We have not been notified, which we find to be amazing, given the
importance of this discussion,'' said Patti Embry-Tautenhan of
Harvard Pilgrim, the state's largest HMO. Tufts Health Plan and
Fallon Health Plan, the state's other large non-profit HMOs,
declined to comment or did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Blue Cross-Blue Shield operates under a unique
statute that grants it non-profit status. But Galvin claims the
Massachusetts statute that governs HMOs does not necessarily
entitle any of them to claim non-profit, tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said he will call a hearing in the next few weeks at
which Massachusetts HMOs can argue to retain their non-profit
status. Calling himself the ``chief corporate law enforcement
officer,'' he said the secretary of state has the legal authority
to determine if corporations can be registered as nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   If Galvin remains unpersuaded by the HMOs' arguments, he said he
will ask Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly to bring an action in
Superior Court ``to restrain them from conducting business not
authorized by the commonwealth, which would force them to
reorganize.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers said that, whatever the legal basis of Galvin's
challenge, Massachusetts HMOs are in a politically precarious state
because of public reaction to the elder drug benefit decision on
top of more general disaffection with managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the HMOs are very vulnerable to this kind of
question,'' said Geoff Wilkinson, executive director of
Massachusetts Senior Action Council, an advocacy group that is
leading consumer groups' efforts to pass remedial legislation.
``There's a lot of public anguish and outrage at what they've done
and what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts HMOs had been required by a nationally unique
state law to provide an unlimited prescription drug benefit to
Medicare beneficiaries. But Federal District Court Judge Richard H.
Stearns ruled last October that federal Medicare law, which does
not require such coverage, trumped the Bay State law.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently Massachusetts HMOs decided not to extend the
unlimited drug program voluntarily, as a chorus of state officials
and consumer groups had pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs replaced the popular unlimited-drug benefit with a
no-premium program of coverage capped at $125 to $200 per quarter,
depending on the health plan. Elders with incomes below $16,000 for
an individual and $21,700 for a couple qualify for additional
coverage, but they must first spend $300 per quarter and pay out of
their own pockets for prescription drugs and get reimbursed later _
a requirement that advocates say puts medication out of reach for
such low-income elders.
</P>
<P>
   Early reaction to the gauntlet flung by Galvin was decidedly
mixed, even among those critical of HMOs. ``They're painting the
HMOs as the bad guys, and I'm not sure I agree with that, even
though I'm not their greatest friend,'' said one legislator,
requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, the Health Care Committee co-chairwoman, said: ``I
think it will be an interesting debate, but I don't think it's
going to solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bullen, the state's commissioner of medical assistance
defended Massachusetts' non-profit HMOs. ``I think we should think
twice before we go after them on this issue,'' Bullen said.
``Certainly there is a difference between our not-for-profit HMOs
and the national for-profits, with their quarterly reports and
their stockholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullen also took issue with Galvin's statement that the
situation of elders' prescription drug coverage amounts to a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see an immediate crisis,'' Bullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Most elders' medication needs can be met, he said, by the $500
to $800 yearly benefit HMOs are currently offering for free, plus
an additional $1,000 out of their own pockets that elders used to
pay for the now-defunct unlimited drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question becomes how do we make a catastrophic drug
benefit available for those with quite expensive drug needs,''
Bullen said.

BUBBLE, BUBBLE, SELECTION TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In recent weeks, Pac-10 coaches and officials have
proclaimed the league worthy of five NCAA Tournament bids. ``Either
Cal or Oregon should make it, because the league deserves five
bids,'' they say. Or: ``If the Big Ten is getting seven, we deserve
at least five.''
</P>
<P>
   Phooey.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 deserves nothing, just like the Big Ten and ACC and
Southeastern Conference deserve nothing. The Pac-10's stellar
performance in recent NCAA Tournaments _ national titles in 1995
and 97, four Sweet 16 participants in '97 and '98 _ has no bearing
on its potential at-large bids this year.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee, which picks,
seeds and places the 64 teams, has two goals: to pick the best
field and balance the four regions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime Saturday night or Sunday morning _ after seeding and
placing the conference champs like Stanford and obvious at-large
entries like Arizona and UCLA _ the selection committee will
evaluate the so-called ``bubble teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington probably has secured a bid despite two losses in Los
Angeles, but Oregon and Cal are in tenuous positions. They'll be
compared to other bubble teams, like Minnesota, Nebraska and
Rutgers, and current credentials _ not past performance _ are the
only criteria: power ratings, good wins, bad losses, strong
finishes. On Selection Sunday, everything is earned.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Oregon has better power ratings, while Cal has better
wins (North Carolina, Arizona, UCLA). Both teams are 7-9 in
conference and probably need to finish 9-9 for an at-large berth.
They meet Saturday in Eugene, with space on the dance floor at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   How will the field look? Nineteen conferences will get one bid:
America East, Big Sky, Big South (Winthrop), Big West, Colonial
(George Mason), Ivy (Penn), Metro Atlantic (Siena), Mid-Continent
(Valparaiso), Mid-Eastern Athletic, Midwestern Collegiate
(Detroit), Northeast (Mt. St. Mary's), Ohio Valley (Murray State),
Patriot, Southern (Charleston), Southland (Texas-San Antonio),
Southwestern Athletic, Sun Belt (Arkansas State), Trans-America
(Samford) and West Coast (Gonzaga).
</P>
<P>
   The 45 remaining slots will be divided among the power
conferences and several middle-tier leagues, like the Missouri
Valley and Mid-American, that might get multiple bids.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Coast: The nation's best conference has one team for
the ages (Duke), one team for today (Maryland), one team for
tomorrow (baby-faced North Carolina), and a bunch of mush.
Brilliant at the top, mediocre in the middle, bad at the bottom,
the ACC gets three bids unless N.C. State or Wake Forest win two in
the league tourney.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic-10: With that suffocating zone, Temple once again tops
the list of ``teams you don't want to play in the first weekend.''
Otherwise, there's not much to fear here. Xavier and George
Washington will get at-large spots, while Jim Harrick and Rhode
Island must win the A-10 tourney.
</P>
<P>
   Big East: Connecticut, Miami and St. John's will be high seeds
regardless of league-tournament results. Villanova's in, but
Rutgers _ yes, Rutgers _ needs a tourney win to secure an at-large
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten: The possibility of eight entries collapsed with
Northwestern, leaving the Big Ten with seven bids and a bunch of
first-round losses. There is no greatness here, just ubiquitous
mediocrity. Wisconsin, Purdue and Minnesota have played poorly of
late, but their lofty power ratings _ generated by the conference's
overall power rating _ indicate they'll dance anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12: The poor man's Big Ten, bland as can be, yet watch for
the Big 12 to get five or six bids. Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas,
Oklahoma State and Missouri are in. Let's hope Nebraska is not.
Next.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA: Two locks (Cincinnati, Louisville), one probable
(DePaul) and one bubble (UNC-Charlotte). C-USA could have had a
fifth entry, except Alabama-Birmingham imploded in February. At
least there's some spice here, with DePaul's wondrous freshmen,
Cincinnati's strongmen and Louisville's great escape from
postseason probation.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-American: This league is dominated by Captain Consonant,
Miami-Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak, but Kent should get an at-large bid.
Combined, they'll win at least one game in the tournament, perhaps
two.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Valley: The rise of the mid majors continues here, with
Evansville and Southwest Missouri State joining tourney champ
Creighton in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10: If Auburn or Michigan State lose in their conference
tournaments, Stanford might return to a No. 1 seed. A fourth seed
might be on the line Saturday in Tucson when Arizona and UCLA
clash, with the loser getting a No. 5. Washington has slipped to an
eight or nine after its dreadful showing in L.A. And give Cal a
bid: Its seniors will be the difference on the Oregon Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern: If you could attend one conference tournament,
this would be it: Arkansas, Florida and Tennessee have proven they
can beat the heavyweights. Auburn has a No. 1 seed at stake.
Mississippi is in, but Mississippi State has faltered and needs two
tourney wins. Watch for Kentucky to play its first-round games in
New Orleans (Midwest Region) because ticket sales are slow.
</P>
<P>
   Western Athletic: Reputation and glib coaches mask the truth:
This is a one-team league (Utah), no better than the Mid-American
Conference. Texas Christian played its way out of the NCAAs with a
horrible loss to BYU on Tuesday night. Fresno State blew its chance
when it lost at home to Utah. And let's hope the NCAA has more
sense than those inept Associated Press voters who keep putting New
Mexico in the top 25. The only thing the No. 89 (Sagarin) Lobos
deserve is to spend next weekend at home. &QL;

GO WILD FOR PRIDE OF PLACE SETTINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tree frogs on the dinner table? Crouton-size diamonds scattered
across a salad plate? Why not? Set an outrageous table, and your
dinner guests will remember the evening forever.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with such strategy, the legion of designers who
participated in the recent sixth annual Fort Worth Design
Inspirations turned three rooms at Shady Oaks Country Club into a
55-table showplace.
</P>
<P>
   No concept was over-the-top. No idea was considered too
outlandish. Take ``Frog Frenzy,'' the table fashioned by Fort Worth
designers Holly Lydick and Monique McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Their jungle-ish creation offered a towering centerpiece with
stalks of fresh, green reeds reaching nearly 3 feet high with
asparaguslike tops. On intermittent plates were pairs of tiny live,
chirping tree frogs beneath bronze-colored dome screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veranda'' was the name given to the table crafted by Molly
Moon Ogden Interior Design. Around a rambling, hodgepodge
arrangement of fine leather volumes and polished, dark wood boxes _
providing the feel of a richly hued study _ were formal place
settings. Each contained a stack of delicate, floral-patterned
china, an extensive arrangement of antique silver flatware and a
mix of crystal stemware and shining pewter goblets.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy K. Taylor, a designer for Pacetti de Medici Precious
Jewels of Dallas, called her table ``Playing Dress Up.'' Four
pieces of crystal stemware graced each setting, as did antique
Tiffany flatware bearing a fancy Audubon design. A tumble of a
dozen or so faux diamonds as big as dimes and quarters flowed
across each plate.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as centerpiece was a 2-foot-by-3-foot stick-figure
mannequin, wrapped in black tulle and draped in about a million
dollars' worth of shimmering bracelets and necklaces. (Not that
this is recommended at home, unless you don't mind an armed guard
standing duty while you entertain _ as this jeweler did at Design
Inspirations.)
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   It's an overused film gimmick: the rube who breaks into a sweat
looking at all the forks at his place setting. Flatware shouldn't
be a threat, especially because you need plenty of it to live in a
civilized fashion.
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING IT:
</P>
<P>
   Flatware and silverware mean essentially the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting your pattern or style of sterling or silverplate,
be sure it's something you'll love for years and years. Sterling is
what becomes heirloom and has better endurance than silverplate.
</P>
<P>
   Stainless is the most affordable choice; 18/8 is the quality you
need, meaning it has 18 percent chrome and 8 percent nickel.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want a look that blends with or complements your china
and crystal.
</P>
<P>
   The basic setting includes salad and dinner forks, dinner knife
and teaspoon. The next additions are tablespoon, butter/pastry
knife and tall drink (also called iced tea) spoon, followed by
demitasse spoon and appetizer fork for a more formal setting.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the serving pieces: cake server, gravy ladle,
serving fork, pierced spoon, salad servers, sugar spoon and various
serving spoons.
</P>
<P>
   USING IT
</P>
<P>
   If you received all that marvelous flatware for wedding gifts
(or were blessed with an inheritance), you need to quit being
intimidated by it. The surest way to do that is to plan a lovely
dinner, invite people whose company you really enjoy, and put that
beautiful silverware to use.

GO WILD FOR PRIDE OF PLACE SETTINGS

<P>
   Tree frogs on the dinner table? Crouton-size diamonds scattered
across a salad plate? Why not? Set an outrageous table, and your
dinner guests will remember the evening forever.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with such strategy, the legion of designers who
participated in the recent sixth annual Fort Worth Design
Inspirations turned three rooms at Shady Oaks Country Club into a
55-table showplace.
</P>
<P>
   No concept was over-the-top. No idea was considered too
outlandish. Take ``Frog Frenzy,'' the table fashioned by Fort Worth
designers Holly Lydick and Monique McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Their jungle-ish creation offered a towering centerpiece with
stalks of fresh, green reeds reaching nearly 3 feet high with
asparaguslike tops. On intermittent plates were pairs of tiny live,
chirping tree frogs beneath bronze-colored dome screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veranda'' was the name given to the table crafted by Molly
Moon Ogden Interior Design. Around a rambling, hodgepodge
arrangement of fine leather volumes and polished, dark wood boxes _
providing the feel of a richly hued study _ were formal place
settings. Each contained a stack of delicate, floral-patterned
china, an extensive arrangement of antique silver flatware and a
mix of crystal stemware and shining pewter goblets.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy K. Taylor, a designer for Pacetti de Medici Precious
Jewels of Dallas, called her table ``Playing Dress Up.'' Four
pieces of crystal stemware graced each setting, as did antique
Tiffany flatware bearing a fancy Audubon design. A tumble of a
dozen or so faux diamonds as big as dimes and quarters flowed
across each plate.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as centerpiece was a 2-foot-by-3-foot stick-figure
mannequin, wrapped in black tulle and draped in about a million
dollars' worth of shimmering bracelets and necklaces. (Not that
this is recommended at home, unless you don't mind an armed guard
standing duty while you entertain _ as this jeweler did at Design
Inspirations.)
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   It's an overused film gimmick: the rube who breaks into a sweat
looking at all the forks at his place setting. Flatware shouldn't
be a threat, especially because you need plenty of it to live in a
civilized fashion.
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING IT:
</P>
<P>
   Flatware and silverware mean essentially the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting your pattern or style of sterling or silverplate,
be sure it's something you'll love for years and years. Sterling is
what becomes heirloom and has better endurance than silverplate.
</P>
<P>
   Stainless is the most affordable choice; 18/8 is the quality you
need, meaning it has 18 percent chrome and 8 percent nickel.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want a look that blends with or complements your china
and crystal.
</P>
<P>
   The basic setting includes salad and dinner forks, dinner knife
and teaspoon. The next additions are tablespoon, butter/pastry
knife and tall drink (also called iced tea) spoon, followed by
demitasse spoon and appetizer fork for a more formal setting.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the serving pieces: cake server, gravy ladle,
serving fork, pierced spoon, salad servers, sugar spoon and various
serving spoons.
</P>
<P>
   USING IT
</P>
<P>
   If you received all that marvelous flatware for wedding gifts
(or were blessed with an inheritance), you need to quit being
intimidated by it. The surest way to do that is to plan a lovely
dinner, invite people whose company you really enjoy, and put that
beautiful silverware to use.
</P>
<P>
   Forks go on the left, knives and spoons on the right. Work from
the outside in, in the order they will be used. Shrimp forks will
be used before salad forks, which are used before dinner forks, and
a butter knife will be used before a dinner knife. Get it?
</P>
<P>
   Each place gets its own butter knife, and a master butter knife
is used, as well. Guests use the master butter knife as it is
passed with the butter, then their own knives when buttering their
own bread.
</P>
<P>
   Center the dessert forks or spoons above the dinner plates so
they won't be used until later and won't be confused with the other
utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the cutting edge of the knife toward the plate. Don't
question this, just do it.

COACHES DESERVING OF COMBAT PAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Discontent is spreading like a virus. At this rate
it won't be long before the blue flu replaces groin pulls or
concussions as the pox of professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   From North Carolina to Southern California the duped, the
defenseless and the down-and-out are sick, they're leery, they're
growing weary of their lot.
</P>
<P>
   In Charlotte, Dave Cowens calls himself underappreciated and
underpaid. ``I don't need millions and millions of dollars,'' he
says. ``I just want to be paid fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray fires Dirk
Graham less than one season into his first head-coaching stint,
then says, ``We set him up to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Jimmy Johnson is riled by the firing in one day of
five of his NFL head-coaching peers. ``It's a shame,'' he says,
``when coaches' jobs are dependent on injuries, skyboxes, people in
the stands and officiating calls. It doesn't give me a good feeling
about our profession.''
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., Del Harris loses his job despite drawing the Lakers
ever near to NBA championship contenders each of his first four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Kurt Rambis, doesn't need his old, thick,
black-rimmed glasses to see the writing between the lines of his
contract. ``I'm the next Laker coach to be fired,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are now, a player can get caught buying drugs in
the shadows of Disneyland and, backed by his union, keep his job
through at least the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A coach, on the other hand, can't even buy time if his team is
decimated by injuries or wallowing in youth.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's as inevitable as the next pink slip; one day
coaches of professional sports teams will rise like a Ruslan Salei
slapshot, a Roger Clemens fastball, a Rex Chapman 3-pointer.
They're going to get ornery as Bill Romanowski and spit at the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, bless their stingy, idiosyncratic, insensitive
souls, won't know what's hit them when the coaches band together to
form The Instructional Workers' Union.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having to dig to the root of a team's failings instead
of simply sawing off the weakest branch.
</P>
<P>
   Consider not being able to fire a coach simply because he can't
fashion a champion out of chintz. Or because he's prone to
long-winded lectures that settle in his players' ears like wax. Or
because he's just not hip or (fill in the blank) enough.
</P>
<P>
   If physicians are finding unions to be the right prescription
for workplace indignities, why not coaches? Just as managed care
has a lot of doctors questioning their calling, coaches at the pro
level find themselves grappling with issues of autonomy and dignity
and diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   No one is immune.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson has won five Stanley Cup rings as a player and a
sixth as an assistant coach. Still, he definitely could use a shot
in the arm about right now. His Kings have lost 248 man-games to
injury _ compared to 89 at this time last season _ and are fighting
to stave off a premature death.
</P>
<P>
   They entered Wednesday's game against the Ducks at the Pond five
points out of the eighth and final playoff spot. Some days Robinson
has reason to wonder whom exactly his players are battling,
seventh-place Edmonton, eighth-place San Jose, ninth-place Calgary
or themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One King recently suggested there are people in the room who
have tuned Robinson out. Say this about the Lakers' Kobe Bryant; he
at least had the good grace to wait until after Harris was fired to
admit as much.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, in his fourth year with the Kings, recognizes when
players ``aren't looking at you, they're looking through you.'' The
day he feels like Casper the Ghost in front of his players is the
day he'll slip out the back door and get on with the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt my message wasn't getting across,'' Robinson said,
``I'm a strong enough person to say they don't appreciate what I'm
doing anymore. I have too much respect for (general manager) Dave
Taylor and (president) Tim Leiweke and (owners) Philip Anschutz and
Ed Roski just to stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson realizes there's a reason he currently has the
third-longest coaching tenure in the NHL, behind Scotty Bowman (six
seasons in Detroit) and Ron Low (five seasons in Edmonton).
</P>
<P>
   ``In hockey there's only so many ways you can teach, only so
many drills you can do,'' Robinson said. ``When some guy's
constantly saying the same things it becomes very, very repetitive.
Players do turn you off after a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the best coaching aid is to have someone, maybe
three or four guys, lead from within. You can get more done from
peer pressure than from the coach barking every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't have the leadership in the locker room to save
Harris' voice or his job. Robinson will find out in the next 20
games whether or not he has any co-pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were flying high after making the playoffs last year.
This year, with so many key players in a holding pattern because of
injuries, the front office has gotten a truer reading of the team's
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of guys who had career years in 1997-98 lost their way at
the first jolt of heavy turbulence this season. To Yanic Perreault,
Craig Johnson, Vladimir Tsyplakov, et al: Mayday! Mayday!
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday there'll be a safe harbor for Robinson. But for
now, the distress he feels is his alone to bear. &QL;

GARRISON KEILLOR PUMMELS JESSE VENTURA WITH LOW BLOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a point in some books when satire gives way to outright
meanness. Maybe, like the Supreme Court justice trying to define
pornography, readers can't quite explain why they know something.
They just do.
</P>
<P>
   Which means readers will recognize that ``Me: By Jimmy (Big Boy)
Valente,'' Garrison Keillor's supposed ``just having a little fun''
mock-book about Jesse Ventura, the pro-wrestler-turned-governor of
Keillor's beloved home state of Minnesota, is, frankly, nasty.
Maybe Keillor didn't intend it that way. Maybe he thought that he
and Gov. Jesse could laugh about it later over a few dozen mugs of
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``Me,'' like that of most exercises in negative
innuendo, is deceptively simple. Former wrestler Jimmy (Big Boy)
Valente has been elected governor of Minnesota. Eager to cash in on
his political success, he negotiates a book contract that includes
the whiny services of ghost writer Garrison Keillor. Much of the
book consists of Jimmy insulting Keillor, all the while spinning
ever-wilder yarns about his childhood, military experiences and
wrestling career, in which he pretended to fight other behemoths
for the entertainment of intellectually challenged wrestling fans.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Keillor does some fictional stretching meant,
perhaps, to be lighthearted. Ventura's service in the Navy SEALS is
transformed into Jimmy's leadership of the top-secret WALRUSES
(Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly). In Vietnam, Jimmy befriends a
turncoat Viet Cong with whom he eventually ends up on the Alaskan
wrestling circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Keillor mostly confines himself to one-liners (the
Walruses, for instance, are taught ``how to avoid venereal disease
by using raspberry jam and sauerkraut juice''). These offer the
author the advantage of creating certain visual images without
having to explain anything further. Writers do this kind of thing
when they really have nothing to say but want to get enough words
into print to fill up a book.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Keillor exactly extends himself in that direction,
either. The miniature ``Me'' clocks in at 152 pages, and most of
those pages are filled as much with cartoonish illustrations as
printed paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   Keillor didn't have to wonder long whether Jesse Ventura would
like ``Me.'' The Grappling Governor wondered publicly if he could
sue, arguing that Keillor's book infringed on the ring character
Ventura had created. Learning that he couldn't _ governors are
classified as public figures, fair game for any writer who wants to
take a cheap shot _ Ventura grumbled and went back to working on
his own book, which industry scuttlebutt has coming out next year,
although no contract has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, let's ask ourselves a few basic questions about
``Me.''
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Does it humorously point out any truths about modern
American politics?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Does it offer any sense of affection for its real-life
subject?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, again.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Is it at least fun to read?''
</P>
<P>
   Odd thing, that; with ``Me,'' Keillor proves it is possible to
spend 45 minutes reading a very short book cover-to-cover and still
end up thinking you wasted too much of your life in the effort.

TWO TOP EXECUTIVES LEAVING MATTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two top executives, including the chief operating
officer, are leaving Mattel Inc. as part of a sweeping management
reorganization announced Wednesday by the struggling toy maker.
</P>
<P>
   The company's second-ranking executive post _ that of chief
operating officer, which is now held by Bruce Stein _ will be
eliminated. Instead, the company said it would have five
business-products units headed by presidents who will report
directly to Jill Barad, Mattel's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The other executive leaving is Gary Baughman, president of the
company's Fisher-Price subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, the world's largest toy maker, based in El Segundo,
Calif., near Los Angeles, is trying to retool itself as a broader
children's products concern. The reorganization comes as Mattel
tries to recover from a series of disappointing earnings reports
and a decline in sales in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While a big part of the problem stemmed from cutbacks in
inventory by Toys ``R'' Us and other retailers, some analysts said
that Barbie, the 40-year-old core product, is showing signs of age.
Mattel's wholesale shipments of the doll were down 14 percent last
year, although the company says that retail sales increased.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel is in the process of buying Learning Co., a software
manufacturer, for $3.8 billion, a transaction that would make
Mattel the second-largest consumer software company behind
Microsoft. It is also broadening its distribution beyond stores to
catalogs and the Internet, helped by the acquisition last year of
Pleasant Co., a mail-order doll business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of transforming Mattel from a
traditional toy company with four core brands to a children's
products company,'' Ms. Barad said in a statement explaining the
reason for the management changes. The new structure, she said,
would have fewer layers of management and allow for faster
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The departure of Bruce and Gary is most painful for me, as I
have great respect for both of these men,'' Ms. Barad's statement
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Stein, a seasoned toy-industry strategist, was
greeted warily by investors. Mattel's shares, which have been
tumbling, fell 75 cents Wednesday, to $24.75, well below their
12-month high above $46.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Stein, 44, said that ``at this point in my
career, I felt I needed a new challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Stein could be taking the blame for Mattel's
recent problems, including the earnings disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that he was leaving because of disputes with
Ms. Barad, whose assertive management style is said to have
contributed to the departures of several other high-level
executives in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad takes great interest in product planning and
marketing, even though those activities were officially Stein's
province.
</P>
<P>
   It was she who spearheaded the acquisition of Learning Co., said
Michael Perik, the software company's chief executive, who said he
had never even met Stein. Perik said the acquisition was still on
track and would not be affected by the changes at Mattel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stein was recruited by Ms. Barad in 1996 to help bolster the
boys' toy business at Mattel, a company that has traditionally been
strongest in girls' toys. He earned credit for integrating Tyco
Toys, which was purchased in 1997, but under his watch, Mattel lost
out to Hasbro in the battle over the license for Star Wars toys.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who is also resigning from Mattel's board, has been both
friend and rival to Ms. Barad for two decades. In the early 1980s,
he was in charge of the Mattel account at the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
advertising agency. He joined Mattel in 1985 and ran boys' toys
when Ms. Barad was in charge of girls' toys. It was her success in
building the Barbie line that led to her being named chief
executive in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, in the meantime, left Mattel and became head of the
Kenner Products subsidiary of Hasbro, where he introduced hit
products based on such movies as ``Batman'' and ``Jurassic Park.''
He became president and chief operating officer of Marvel
Entertainment Group in 1994 but left after four months. He was then
a consultant to Dreamworks SKG, the film studio, and president of a
Sony Corp. division in charge of the American marketing of the
Playstation video game.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman, 52, came to Mattel as part of the company's 1997
merger with Tyco Toys. Mattel took a $27 million charge against
1998 earnings to cover a recall of the Fisher-Price Power Wheels
cars, which were catching on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fisher-Price remains the company's best known brand name
for the preschool market. So in the reorganization announced
Wednesday, all preschool toys will be sold under the Fisher-Price
brand. The expanded Fisher-Price division will now be headed by
Neil Friedman, who had been president of the Tyco Preschool
division.
</P>
<P>
   The other four units created by the reorganization are
Boys/Entertainment, to be run by Matt Bousquette, which includes
various toy cars as well as toys based on Disney and Nickelodeon
characters; Girls/Barbie, to be headed by Adrienne Fontanella;
Mattel Media, which will include software and the interactive toys
made in partnership with Intel Corp., to be be run by David Haddad,
and Pleasant Co., which will continue to be run by its founder,
Pleasant Rowland, who will also help with direct sales of other
Mattel products.

CHATCOM ALMOST BROKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest in a series of grim financial
statements, ChatCom Inc. officials say the company faces bankruptcy
unless it can quickly come up with some cash.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter sales were down 61 percent from a year ago and the
company, which makes computer network servers, lost more than
$600,000 on sales of $594,000.
</P>
<P>
   ChatCom has developed what its officials say is an innovative
new computer server, called BriteStar, that can readily connect
machines operating on different software platforms with one
another. But the company has been unable to finish the work and get
BriteStar into production because revenue has been dwindling along
with sales of its other products.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to find business partners willing to shoulder some of
the financial burden have been unsuccessful, as have attempts to
find a buyer for ChatCom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company anticipates that it will be forced to seek relief
in the bankruptcy courts this month if it is unable to immediately
secure short-term financing,'' ChatCom officials said Wednesday in
a joint statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   E. Carey Walters, the chief executive brought in last year to
try to sell ChatCom, said he has downsized the staff from about 50
employees to 21 in an attempt to cut costs. ChatCom also moved to
smaller offices when its lease expired last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But without a cash infusion soon, Walters said, the firm will
have to turn to bankruptcy court. And still more money will be
needed to market BriteStar, the one jewel in the company's crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could basically ship (BriteStar) in 90 to 100 days,''
Walters said. ``We have a prototype which we're reworking. ... We
just need some fuel to get it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ChatCom shares closed down 1.3 cents, or 17.33 percent, to 6.25
cents on volume of 500 shares traded Wednesday.

   Furby, we hardly knew ye. And now we're on the hunt again,
looking for the hottest, newest, most sensational toy. At New
York's American International Toy Fair, we joined toy buyers on the
quest to uncover this year's
stand-in-line-and-then-shell-out-the-cash toy wonder. We previewed

want for 1999? Here are our top three picks.
</P>
<P>
   CHAT PALS
</P>
<P>
   Using cutting-edge technology (and, of course, lotsa batteries),
Winnie the Pooh and Tigger (too) come to life as never before. Kids
activate the plush toy by squeezing its paw. The Chat Pal responds
by telling jokes, playing games, asking questions and singing
songs. Thanks to a combination of microphone and radio-frequency
technology, the Silly Old Bear and his friend ``hear'' your child's
patter and turn their little fuzzy heads in response. Rumor has it
that Piglet will be the next character in the line, which is
expected to expand next year.
</P>
<P>
   For ages 4 and up. Mattel, $40. Available in October.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM PLAY SETS
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the popularity of last year's Tonka and Star Wars
Playsets, Hasbro is adding four kinds of CD-ROM play sets this
fall. The plastic play sets strap onto most standard computer
keyboards to combine hands-on play with the effects of multimedia
software.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the most curious is the Easy-Bake Oven play set.
Little bakers create virtual cakes and cookies with the help of the
play set's toy appliances, including a mixer, measuring cup,
rolling pin, cookie cutter and more. Kids learn to follow a recipe
without making a mess. Of course, no mess also means none of those
odd-tasting little treats loved by those of us raised with the
old-school Easy-Bake.
</P>
<P>
   Look also for the Playskool Store play set, featuring a cash
register, virtual cash (couldn't we all use some?) and other store
items, and for the Nerf Jr. play sets, which use a new light-pen
technology. A hand-held interactive toy connects to the PC's
gameport to simulate an arcade experience.
</P>
<P>
   Age 3 and up. Hasbro Interactive, $30-$40. Compatible with
Windows 95/98. Available this fall.
</P>
<P>
   TECH DECK FINGERBOARDS
</P>
<P>
   Created by a 12-year-old California boy (and already at the
fingertips of all of the cool kids in Manhattan Beach),
fingerboards are miniature skateboards, complete with real grip
tape, adjustable trucks, axle nuts and replaceable wheels. In a
word, fingerboards rock. Easy to pocket, the miniature boards can
be manipulated with fingers on a desktop, driveway, tray table or
anywhere else. Kids can buy or make their own accessories, such as
a half pipe. The boards are relatively cheap (in the ballpark of
the dusty old Beanie Babies), which means that kids will probably
want to trade and collect them.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 8 and up. XConcepts, $6. Available now.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Furby? The interactive plush Pooh Chat Pals are
expected to be one of this year's top Christmas toys. Look, Mom, no
mess! With the Easy-Bake Oven CD-ROM play set, kids create virtual
treats.

VALENZUELA'S ARREST `A SHAME'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ News of Pat Valenzuela's arrest on suspicion of armed
robbery left the jockey's old Santa Anita friends surprised _
though hardly shocked _ and nostalgic for the days before drugs
dimmed the teen-age star.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame for such a talent to fall so far,'' said trainer
Ted West, for whom Valenzuela rode Interco to victory in the 1984
Santa Anita Handicap. ``Pat was a natural. Horses just ran for him.
He was one of the top five riders in the country when he was riding
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he threw it all away.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 36, who won the Santa Anita Handicap aboard Sir
Beaufort in 1993, probably will be in the Los Angeles men's central
jail when the historic race is run Saturday. He was held on $75,000
bail Wednesday after being arrested Friday and identified by a taxi
driver as the man who robbed him at gunpoint of $150 two days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela pleaded not guilty in a court appearance Tuesday. A
March 15 preliminary hearing is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   According to Deputy District Attorney Leonard J. Torrealba, the
cab driver said he was picking up a passenger Friday at a Rosemead
bar called Spike's, in the area where the crime occurred, when he
spotted Valenzuela wearing the same jacket and hat as the robber.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did what they say he did, that's the drugs,'' said
trainer Bob Baffert, who called Valenzuela so personable, ``he was
his own best agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, born in Colorado to a family of jockeys and
trainers, recorded his first victory at 16 and won the 1980 Santa
Anita Derby aboard Codex at 17. After his first bout with cocaine
addiction, he won the 1989 Kentucky Derby aboard Sunday Silence,
and promoted the ``Just Say No'' campaign in a post-race press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But his career was to be marked by his drug problems as much as
his accomplishments _ six Breeders' Cup victories, six winners in a
day at Santa Anita in 1988, riding titles at all three major
Southern California tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-related absences led to suspensions as long as nine months,
and then an arrest on spousal-abuse charges in 1997 prompted
California racing officials to ban him indefinitely. Valenzuela
hasn't competed since October 1997 at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit rock bottom three times,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced three times, he has been living in El Monte, apart from
his four children.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela's charisma earned him live mounts in each of his
comebacks. And racetrack associates said Wednesday they'd heard he
planned to seek yet another chance.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also rumblings that Valenzuela, who once signed a
$1 million contract to ride for owner Allen Paulson, had sold his
Kentucky Derby trophy and other mementos, and was asking former
rivals for loans.
</P>
<P>
   Don Murray, director of a racetrack support program for
substance abusers, said he last spoke with Valenzuela when the
jockey phoned in January, ``asking how other people were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's got a great heart,'' Murray said. ``He's just got a
problem.''

`HUMILIATED' LEWINSKY BREAKS SILENCE ON ORDEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abandoning the last vestiges of her privacy, Monica
S. Lewinsky has now told all in a new book and a teary television
interview as she launches an international quest to reverse the
personal and financial damage of her affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wrathful one moment, rueful the next, the former White House
intern opened the post-impeachment chapter of the saga by assailing
the ``dubious methods'' of the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, asserting his deputies drove her to the brink of suicide,
and disclosing a startling twist in her tumultuous story: that she
obtained an abortion after she became pregnant by an unidentified
Pentagon offical in 1996 during the final months of her
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, 25, who stands to make several million dollars in her
marketing effort, unleashed a flood of additional information of
varying significance in a two-hour interview Wednesday night on
ABC's ``20/20'' and in a 288-page book, ``Monica's Story.'' The
book, released to the news media Wednesday, goes on sale Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After watching in virtual silence for more than a year as her
affair with Clinton burst from secrecy to the threshold of a
constitutional crisis, Lewinsky spared little emotion as she
unfolded her version of events.
</P>
<P>
   She described her former friend, Linda R. Tripp, as a
``treacherous bitch'' for telling Starr about Lewinsky's affair
with Clinton and then acting as an informant for the independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hurt her,'' Lewinsky said of Tripp. ``I felt like
an animal wanting to claw at her skin.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, Lewinsky said she still wakes some mornings and
misses him ``with every ounce of my being, my head, heart, and
body.''
</P>
<P>
   But she told Barbara Walters, her interviewer on ABC, that she
no longer loves Clinton, and she made no secret that she despises
him for abandoning her after the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million viewers were expected to watch the Lewinsky
interview on ABC, and bookstores were stocking 400,000 copies of
``Monica's Story,'' which retails for $24.95. Lewinsky was given a
$750,000 advance for the book and will receive 10 percent of the
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was not paid for the ABC interview, Lewinksy will
receive $600,000 for an interview with a British television station
this weekend. She also stands to make about $500,000 for photo
spreads in several European magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew he wasn't a very truthful person,'' Lewinsky
said about Clinton in the book, written by Princess Diana's
biographer, Andrew Morton. ``But the events of the last year have
showm him to be a much bigger liar than I ever thought. Now I see
him as a selfish man who lies all the time. That makes me very
angry and resentful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lewinsky, who apologized on ABC to the country and Clinton's
family for the ordeal, blamed Starr most of all for the fallout
from the affair. She lashed out at the salacious nature of Starr's
eight-month investigation of the affair and the shocking details in
his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying herself as ``probably the most humiliated woman in
the world,'' Lewinsky said she ``really felt raped and physically
ill with myself'' because of Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   She took special exception to her initital contact with Starr's
deputies, who questioned her for more than 10 hours at a
Ritz-Carlton hotel in suburban Washington when they first
confronted her in January 1998 about her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky unloaded her anger in chapters of the book titled,
``The Starr Chamber,'' and ``Terror in Room 1012,'' which refers to
the hotel room where she was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is investigating whether Starr's staff
improperly discussed a possible immunity deal with Lewinsky that
day and whether Starr wrongfully failed to tell the department
about his contacts with lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones, who was
suing Clinton at the time for alleged sexual harassment. She later
settled the suit for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understandably, Starr's tactics have been a matter for grave
public concern,'' Lewinsky's book states. ``The whole exchange
about immunity was a waste of time except insofar as it exposed the
dubious methods employed by Starr's investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lewinsky's book alleges, ``the nearest comparison to
the relationship between Starr and Lewinsky is the reaction of an
abused child in the presence of the abuser, or that of a
badly-beaten animal to its bullying owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office declined to comment Wednesday on Lewinsky's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, one of Starr's deputies, Michael Emmick, whom the
book describes as ``a revolting specimen of humanity,'' warned
Lewinsky she could face up to 27 years in prison for possible
crimes related to Clinton's alleged attempt to cover up their
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if my stomach had been cut open and someone had
poured acid into my wound,'' Lewinsky said. ``I just felt an
intense stinging pain and overriding terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of prison apparently terrified her. ``I couldn't
bear to go to jail,'' she said in the book. ``I would come out an
old lady and no one would ever want to marry me.''
</P>
<P>
   In despair, she said, she considered hurling herself out the
10th-floor window, ``to crash to her death through the glass canopy
below.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky later was released and relied briefly for her defense
on William Ginsburg, a California lawyer and family friend who
specialized in medical malpractice cases. But soon she was unhappy
with Ginsburg too.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said Ginsburg became too enamored of the spotlight.
``Unfortunately, I think he could bitten by the bug,'' she told
Walters, ``and it became more about Bill Ginsburg than it did about
my well-being and my welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinksy's book asserts that her anger is mixed with an
``overwhelming feeling of guilt and shame for the anguish she has
caused not only her family and friends, but the president, his
family, and particulary Chelsea.''
</P>
<P>
   In her television interview, Lewinsky said Clinton sometimes
smiled at her even when he was with his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever think about Hillary Clinton?'' Walters asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about her a lot,'' Lewinsky said. ``But I never
thought she would find out.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she also thought about Chelsea because ``she means the
world to him, I mean, she is the most precious thing to him. I had
a very strong affinity for her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lewinksy's abortion, she did not mention her pregnancy in
the television interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she describes the man as a senior Defense
Department official who was single, a ``charming, craggy-faced
older man'' named Thomas. She said they had an affair for three
months but it ended after she discovered she was pregnant in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She reluctantly decided to have an abortion, the book states,
``but she and Thomas fell out over the costs of the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she told Clinton she was dating other men, but
never told him about her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   With all that has happened since the scandal erupted, Lewinsky
said her personal goals of finding a husband and having children
remain far from fulfilled. ``This essentially traditional,
middle-class American girl is today reduced to hiding in the
shadows, a fugitive in her own land,'' her book states. ``She
exists in a modern-day Orwellian nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lewinsky recently has ``enjoyed the companionship of a
young, single man,'' according to her book. The relationship is
significant, Lewinsky believes, because she has always been drawn
to married men, largely out of her insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For her, the relationship has been both a revelation and a
reassurance, a first step into the real world of male-female
relationship,'' her book says. The relationship is described as
``her first faltering steps on a very long road to recovery.''

LEGISLATURE IN ALABAMA IS DISSOLVING IN TUG OF WAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., S.C., Texas, N.C., Va., Tenn.)   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Alabama Legislature dissolved into chaos and
paralysis this week as the state's newly elected lieutenant
governor, a Republican, used a quick gavel on Tuesday to snatch
power from the Democratic majority in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The coup in Montgomery incited such ear-splitting animus on the
Senate floor that a 5-year-old visitor was reduced to tears. It led
a Democratic leader to call the lieutenant governor, Steve Windom,
``a madman'' and to talk of impeaching him before the close of his
first day as presiding officer of the Senate. In protest, the
Democratic majority boycotted Wednesday's session, which adjourned
for want of a quorum, and then filed a lawsuit against Windom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been different,'' said McDowell Lee, who has watched all
manner of political wrangling during his 36 years as secretary of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The discord in Alabama reflects the growing pains of two-party
politics in southern legislatures, which until recently have been
Democratic preserves where Republicans could only carp from the
backbenches. But Republicans now control at least one legislative
chamber in Florida, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia and they are
close enough in North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama to wield
significant influence.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democrats hold a 23-to-12 margin in the Senate. But
five Democrats elected with heavy support from business interests
have allied with the Republicans, giving the Democrats an actual
majority of only 18 to 17. In addition, Alabama voters elected
Windom last November as the first Republican lieutenant governor
this century.
</P>
<P>
   The state Constitution gives the lieutenant governor the
authority to preside over the Senate and to break ties. In decades
of Democratic control, senators have enacted rules that also gave
the lieutenant governor substantial power to make committee
assignments, appoint committee chairs, and direct the flow of
legislation. But in January, before Windom took office, the newly
elected Senate met in an organizational session and the Democratic
majority adopted new rules that stripped the lieutenant governor of
those powers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that authority was then vested in the president pro tem,
who happens to be a Democrat. The rules changes were supported by
Don Siegelman, a Democrat who was lieutenant governor but was sworn
in as governor six days later.
</P>
<P>
   Windom made it clear in an interview Wednesday that he was
outraged by the rules changes. Several of his allies cast the
dispute as an effort by trial lawyers to maintain their traditional
influence in the Senate after the election of a lieutenant governor
who strongly supports tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   Windom said that he had been left ``little choice but to take
action and restore democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   So shortly after he called the Senate into session for the first
time on Tuesday, one of his Democratic allies proposed rules to
restore the lieutenant governor's power. Windom declined to allow a
debate or to recognize his opponents and then quickly called for a
voice vote. As the Senate floor broke into pandemonium, Windom
declared that the measure had passed and then gaveled the session
into adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   How did Windom know the new rules had gained a majority?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I heard,'' he said. ``You obviously do it on what
the chair hears and sees and I heard a majority. The prevailing
side voted loudest.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he simply had followed the procedure set by
Siegelman and his supporters in the organizational session and that
he was ``not going to let the governor destroy a constitutional
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never dreamed that a madman would just begin gaveling
through laws by himself with 18 of us voting no,'' said Sen. Lowell
Barron, a Democrat and the president pro tem. ``I reckon he's like
the rest of the Republicans. He wants to shut down the state
government like Newt did with the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron said his Democratic coalition would continue to boycott
Senate sessions this week. But each day that the Senate fails to
gain a quorum counts against the maximum of 30 working days that
the Legislature can meet this year. Before long, the impasse could
threaten the timely passage of the state budget and consideration
of Siegelman's first-year agenda, including his call for a
referendum on a state lottery to benefit education.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen Democratic senators filed a lawsuit Wednesday asking a
judge to invalidate the rules enacted on Tuesday. A hearing is set
for Monday in Circuit Court in Montgomery.

   BOSTON _ Great swaths of the Maine woods with a combined land
area bigger than Rhode Island would be protected forever from
development under a $28 million plan announced Wednesday and
thought to encompass more territory than any other such deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Angus King of Maine said in Augusta that the plan would
include more than 2,000 miles of shoreline on streams and rivers,
more than 85 lakes or ponds, and nesting areas for bald eagles and
peregrine falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the biggest day for Maine out-of-doors since
Gov. Baxter first saw Mount Katahdin,'' King said, referring to the
1920s governor, Percival Baxter, who personally bought and donated
Baxter State Park, a widely beloved wilderness area crowned by
Mount Katahdin in northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, a family of longtime Maine landowners, the
Pingrees, would provide a conservation easement on the land by
selling the development rights on 754,673 acres to a private
nonprofit group, the New England Forestry Foundation. The family
can continue limited industrial logging and the public will still
have recreational access, although there are no plans to transform
the land into a park.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old foundation, which promotes sustainable forestry,
is still raising the money for the purchase, and has two years to
amass it.
</P>
<P>
   King, who announced the agreement, said it was probably the
largest conservation easement deal on private forest land.
</P>
<P>
   On a roll of recent victories in their efforts to preserve
Northeastern forest land, environmentalists praised the Pingree
agreement as a significant step toward saving more of the Northern
Forest, the 26 million acres of woods from Maine to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the soul-satisfying sound of another big piece of the
Northern Forest puzzle clicking into place,'' said Bob Perschel,
chairman of the Northern Forest Alliance, a coalition of 35 groups.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came at a moment of exceptionally hot debate over what
Maine should do about its 17 million acres of woods, a discussion
prompted by land sales last year of giant paper company holdings
that amounted to about 15 percent of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists scored their most recent Maine triumph in
mid-December, when the Nature Conservancy, an international group,
announced that it would pay $35 million to buy 185,000 acres of
International Paper Co. land in northern Maine. Not far away, a
week earlier, conservationists cheered an even bigger landmark
preservation purchase: 300,000 acres of forest land in New York,
Vermont and New Hampshire from the Champion International paper
company for $76 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But at the same time, Maine environmentalists have complained
loudly that the state is not prepared to protect more of the
millions of acres coming up for sale as global economic forces lead
paper companies to shift their assets. They called for the state to
find the money and the will to buy more land to protect it, and
warned that at least one big land purchaser was known for
sub-dividing and building on wilderness parcels.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where love for the forest gets as prosaic as moose
meat in the freezer and as poetic as Henry David Thoreau's paeans
to the Maine Woods, the heightened discussion has been enough to
move the state legislature to put the issue on the front burner in
its current session.
</P>
<P>
   It is considering a variety of proposals, including one from
King for a $50-million bond issue for land purchases and ranging to
more than $100 million. Any such bond issue would have to come
before voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders say there seems to be enough consensus that
at least a $50-million bond issue has a good chance of passing. In
public debate, however, contention remains on issues ranging from
just how much land should be bought to whether it should remain
working forest or be protected from logging. But today's
announcement seemed to please virtually all camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win,'' said Abby Holman, executive director of the
Maine Forest Products Council, a trade association for the wood and
paper industry. ``You're actually able to provide for a
conservation easement and reduce the threat of development in
pristine areas, and secure the future of the timber industry.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the forest spectrum, Jonathan Carter,
executive director of the Forest Ecology Network and an advocate of
maximizing wilderness areas, also praised the deal as a great step,
though he added, ``It's important that we realize that conservation
easements are not wilderness restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Carter said, ``Now we've got it out of
development's hands, we can now move forward and create a
wilderness park.''
</P>
<P>
   That _ creation of a wilderness park _ was the kind of total
stop to logging achieved this week by defenders of Headwaters, the
old-growth redwood forest owned by a lumber company in Northern
California. But in the East, where most forests are privately
owned, unlike their publicly owned Western counterparts, just
reducing logging and stopping development can seem to
environmentalists like progress.
</P>
<P>
   Injecting a note of skepticism into all the celebration, Carter
pointed out that the Pingrees, who are known as the most
environmentally punctilious of Maine's large landowners, would
receive $30 million for abstaining from developing land that they
may have had no intention of developing anyway. ``If you can
continue to do what you've always done and someone will give you
$30 million, who will say no?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But King countered that the Pingrees, who are now in their
seventh generation of holding land first assembled in 1840, were
showing unusual vision in putting a permanent ban on developing
their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is forever,'' he said.

 &HT;    Austin police lodge third shooting this year
 &HT;    By Bob Banta
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A policeman seriously wounded a man who he said
charged him with a pointed tree branch late Tuesday _ the third
time since January that Austin officers have shot someone.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Vences, 33, a Mexican citizen, was in critical condition
late Wednesday with bullet wounds of the chest and stomach, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot by Officer Troy Brown, a seven-year veteran,
according to Austin Deputy Police Chief Bruce Mills.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of Vences, and two other men in East Austin earlier
this year, has prompted concern from some residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is still simmering is the distrust,'' said the Rev. Rick
Randall, pastor of Austin Cornerstone Church ``Every time one of
these incidents happens, it's like someone takes a stick and they
stir up the coals.''
</P>
<P>
   The community remains concerned about the number of shootings
recently but needs to give police time to sort out the facts in
Tuesday's case, said Randall, a supporter of Mayor Kirk Watson's
recently announced program to promote racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about the level of seeming increase in
violence in the city, but we also know the chief of police is
deeply commited to this racial reconciliation effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two previous shootings, one man was African American and
the other was Hispanic. Chief Stan Knee said Wednesday he could not
comment on the shooting of Vences because investigators are trying
to determine whether the shooting was necessary. ``It is
unfortunate any time an officer has to use deadly force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said events that led to the wounding began at 11:30 p.m.
Tuesday. Officer Ross Arnold was working radar in the 2500 block of
East William Cannon Drive, when a motorist stopped and told him
that a man down the street was ``lunging'' at passing motorists.
</P>
<P>
   In the 4500 block of William Cannon Drive, Arnold was joined by
Brown. The officers spotted Vences in the parking lot of J&AMP;M Auto
Repair and tried to arrest him, but Vences ran into a wooded
drainage ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Brown walked up to Vences with his gun drawn and ordered him to
lie on the ground, according to Deputy Police Chief Bruce Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the blue, the suspect grabbed the limb of a tree above
him and swung his legs toward Officer Brown,'' said Mills. ``When
he did that, the tree limb broke, and the suspect takes a broken
piece of the limb -- about 14 inches long and 3/4 of an inch in
diamater -- and raised it like a spear over the officer's face.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said Brown was three to four feet from Vences when he
fired two shots, hitting Vences in the chest and stomach. EMS
paramedics treated Arnold for minor wounds and took Vences to
Brackenridge Hopital.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Wednesday they had not determined why Vences
was lunging at cars.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the auto repair shop described Vences as someone
who occasionally stopped by to smoke cigarettes, drink beer and
chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was no troublemaker,'' said Ausencio Martinez, who drives
the tow truck for J &AMP; M Auto Repair.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garcia, who runs Genesis Auto Sales out of the same shop
at 4500 E. William Cannon Drive, said Vences talked with him around
7 p.m. Tuesday about buying a car. Vences said he had a job
possibility, doing contract work for the construction of a new
school, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Mariles, an official with the Mexican consulate, said he
contacted Vences' family in Amatebec, about three hours west of
Mexico City on Wednesday. One of Vences' brothers, Jorge, was
expected to arrive in Austin Thursday, Mariles said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariles said he didn't know how long Vences had been in the U.S.
or where he worked. He has no relatives in the U.S., Mariles said.
</P>
<P>
   Vences' shooting is the third in the past three months involving
city patrolmen.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 23, Officers Billie Hancock and Duane Williams shot and
killed Albert Juarez Jr., 37, when he charged them with a
box-cutter knife near the intersection of East 7th Street and
Pleasant Valley Road.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, Johnny Cornell was shot to death by Officer Stan
Farris after Cornell allegedly ran at Farris with a knife at East
12th and Hargrave streets. Grand juries cleared the officers in
both cases.
</P>
<P>
   Most of about a dozen neighborhood residents interviewed last
week were still upset about Cornell's death.
</P>
<P>
   Idalia Criado lives around the corner from the store where the
shooting of Cornell happened. Cornell used to speak to her and try
to sell her items, and he was never violent, she said. ``Take his
license away,'' said Criado, 19, referring to Farris. ``He can't be
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knee said Wednesday that while the shootings of Cornell and
Juarez were regrettable ``it was clear that the officers were at
great risk and were required to use deadly force.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings also have raised questions about police training.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the last time Brown had training in use of force was
Oct. 13 of last year. The deputy chief said that Brown had trained
others on when to shoot at someone while serving in the U.S. Coast
Guard just before joining the Austin Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Austin cadets receive six months of training, including weapons
and defense courses. Officers in the field must take 40 hours of
training every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Police training officials say that at a distance of 15 feet, a
man with a knife can stab an officer in a little over a second.
Officers are trained to aim at the torso, because it is a large
target and there is often no time to aim for a leg or other part of
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said Brown has been placed on administrative duty pending
the completion of the investigation, which is routine in instances
in which officers fire their weapons. Details of the shooting will
be reviewed by the Travis County District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has had no disciplinary actions filed against him in his
seven years with the department, according to Civil Service
records.

USOC MOVES TO CLEAN UP THE MISTAKES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ U.S. Olympic Committee officials acknowledged
Wednesday that the committee's oversight of Salt Lake City's
scandal-ridden bid for the 2002 Winter Games was ``abysmal'' and
vowed to strictly monitor the host-city selection process in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure our rules go beyond reproach,'' Dick
Schultz, the USOC's executive director, said at a news conference.
``We're embarrassed by the whole thing. But we can't be defensive.
We have to assume responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials were responding to a report released Tuesday by
an independent USOC commission that accused the International
Olympic Committee of fostering a ``culture of improper
gift-giving'' that Salt Lake City bid officials continued in their
effort to win the Games. The commission, chaired by the former Sen.
George Mitchell, made four recommendations for reform to the USOC,
and Wednesday the USOC executive committee adopted all of them, a
move that seemed to be daring the IOC into making dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also suggested that the White House be asked for
help in curbing the excesses in the bidding process, and Bill Hybl,
the USOC president, sent a letter Wednesday to President Clinton
asking him to designate the IOC a ``public international
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   That would make illicit gifts to IOC members by the U.S. bid and
organizing committees punishable under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigations by the IOC and a Salt Lake
Organizing Committee ethics panel, Salt Lake City's top officials
engaged in an aggressive program of cash payments and gift-giving _
totaling more than $1 million _ to IOC members and their families.
Nine IOC officials have either resigned or been expelled, and as
many as 20 other remain under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hybl did not criticize the IOC, or describe what pressure, if
any, the USOC could exert on the IOC to enact serious reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to find the flaws, correct the mistakes, and to
create a system that will ensure these mistakes do not occur
again,'' Hybl said, speaking generally.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, USOC officials endorsed possible congressional
action against the IOC _ including stripping it of its tax-free
status in the United States _ if the IOC does not demonstrate a
stern resolve for significant reform at a special session scheduled
for March 17-18 at its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the IOC acts cavalierly we'll make it clear in hearings
what they will face,'' said Mark Buse, staff director of the Senate
Commerce Committee, which is to hold a hearing April 14. ``We want
them to understand that Senators McCain and Stevens are serious.''
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, R-Ariz., is the committee chairman; Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, wrote the Amateur Sports Act.
</P>
<P>
   The law, said Buse, could be redrawn to make the IOC pay taxes
on global sponsorships and television deals paid by U.S. companies.
Buse said the law could also be changed to put control of that
money in the hands of the USOC, which now receives 10 percent of
the money from U.S. Olympic television rights. NBC is committed to
pay the IOC $3.5 billion for the Olympics from 2000 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could dramatically alter the balance of Olympic
power because nearly all IOC sponsors are based in the United
States, and NBC's rights fees dwarf any other country's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather avoid ultra-dramatic steps,'' Buse said. ``So we'd
hope that the IOC bows to public pressure and the pressure by the
USOC to reform their rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In adopting the other recommended reforms, the USOC said it
would open an independent office of bid compliance; bar bid cities
and organizing committees from offering assistance to IOC members
or international organizations, and prohibit those cities from
making grants to IOC member countries from the USOC's international
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC will also make public all meetings, except for
executive sessions; require board of directors and executive
committee members to attend 75 percent of all meetings; and
maintain a permanent presence in the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee's offices.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp., which on Wednesday reported
higher February sales, finally appears to be rebounding from last
summer's strike and joining its rivals in the robust automarket.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing January for which GM was one of the only
automakers to report sales that were lower than in the previous
year, GM joined its competitors in posting a healthy gain in
February. The company reported total car and light-truck sales of
385,318 for the month, an increase of 17 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   GM's sales in February 1998 were extremely poor, however,
lowering the automaker's share of the car and light-truck market to
below 30 percent. The sales slump spurred the automaker to begin a
huge incentive campaign aimed at loyal GM owners.
</P>
<P>
   The successful promotion kept GM sales rolling until workers at
two parts plants in Flint, Mich., went on strike, closing nearly
all of GM's assembly plants for most of the summer. Since then, the
automaker has struggled to catch up to its pre-strike sales
momentum and inventory levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The month of February was a fantastic month for GM,'' said
Darwin Clark, GM vice president for field sales, service and parts.
``Our business was strong all across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   David Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham Securities in New York,
said the stronger-than-expected sales were largely because of an
end-of-the-month promotion for GM and dealership employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call that momentum,'' he added, noting that the
company's market share remained under 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company's higher February sales came with inventories at
only 60 percent of 1998 levels for its critical pickup trucks and
without huge customer incentives.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case with other automakers, GM's February sales rose
largely on the strength of its trucks. Sales of its light trucks
totaled 177,328 in February, a 16 percent rise from a year earlier
and the best February in history for GM truck sales. GM's
redesigned and all-important full-size pickups, the Chevrolet
Silverado and the GMC Sierra, are apparently catching on with
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Combined sales of the two trucks rose 18 percent from a year
earlier for their best February in 21 years. Minivan sales were
also strong, up 40 percent for all models combined, a record
February for GM van sales. Sales of GM's large sport-utility
vehicles also rose significantly.
</P>
<P>
   GM reported car sales of 207,990 vehicles, up 19 percent from a
year earlier. That was largely due to sales of its midsize cars,
which rose 43 percent from the comparable 1998 period. The line
includes GM's newest models, the Oldsmobile Alero and the Pontiac
Grand Am. Sales of its Saturn models dipped overall, but the new
three-door Saturn coupe, introduced in November, sold well, up 39
percent. Saab, which is 50 percent owned by GM and which has two
new models, the 9-3 and 9-5, saw sales rise 36 percent, its best
February in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Cadillac division, which had put on huge dealer
and customer incentives late last year to prevent Ford Motor Co.'s
Lincoln from stealing its long-held title of luxury vehicle leader,
continued to pay for those sales. After dropping in January,
Cadillac's sales fell again in February, down 28 percent from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every automaker reported higher February sales, many of
them posting records for the month. U.S. vehicle sales for February
totaled 1,287,634 cars and light trucks, a 13 percent increase over
February 1998. Car sales totaled 670,676, up 9 percent; light-truck
sales increased 17 percent, to 616,958 vehicles. That put the
seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles at a
hefty 17 million cars and light trucks for the month.
</P>
<P>
   The continued strong auto sales keep surprising auto executives
and analysts, who keep increasing their forecasts for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This month came in stronger than we or the auto analysts
expected by orders of magnitude,'' said Clark of GM. He said that
at the start of the year, GM's forecast for 1999 total car and
truck sales was 15 million to 15.5 million vehicles. It is now
estimating that sales could be close to 15.8 million.

2 MORE ARE ARRESTED IN STATE TREASURY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A former high-ranking manager in the treasurer's office
and an outside ``heir finder'' were arrested Wednesday on charges
of stealing $2.4 million from a state account that has become the
focus of one of the biggest public corruption investigations in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   State Police apprehended former deputy treasurer Robert E. Foley
at a friend's house in Norwood Wednesday afternoon while Rhode
Island police later arrested Thomas Ciliberto in his hometown of
Woonsocket.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly portrayed Foley, 39, as the
mastermind of the complicated scheme to steal millions of dollars
from the Unpaid Check Fund, an account that holds unclaimed state
payments for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Foley _ among four people arrested since Reilly's investigation
began three weeks ago _ was the boss of John Trischitta, who was
arrested last month for his part in the alleged theft of $6.5
million from the treasury fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is almost beyond belief,'' Reilly, surrounded by a team
of investigators, said in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is charged with larceny of $2.4 million, as well as
bribery. The Lexington resident will be arraigned in Boston
Municipal Court Thursday. Ciliberto, 51, faces charges of larceny
and bribery in the alleged theft of $812,000 of the $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the ongoing investigation said the two
latest suspects had funneled money to Rhode Island corporations
they had created; some were ``dummy'' companies while others were
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Former Treasurer Joseph Malone hired Foley in 1991 as director
of cash management. Sometime after, Foley cooked up a complicated
plot to siphon money out of the Unpaid Check Fund, which fell under
his aegis, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say there is evidence that by 1993, Foley stole
$1.6 million in one transaction, apparently on his own, with a
phony claim to an unpaid check. And, sometime between 1994 and
1995, he stole another $812,000 with the help of Ciliberto, who
allegedly paid Foley for information related to stealing the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they do not know if the money can be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was one of five deputies in the office under Malone; the
recently elected treasurer, Shannon P. O'Brien, wanted her own hire
to supplant Foley long before the investigation came to light. His
last day was Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A professional accountant, Foley was partner in a Norwood
accounting firm, D'Ambra &AMP; Associates, before joining Malone's
office, and, according to his state ethics statement retained a 50
percent interest in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Records at the Secretary of State's office in Rhode Island show
that Ciliberto was president of Reinke Group Inc., a so-called
heir-finding business that helped clients track down money owed to
them. The company was dissolved in 1997. Investigators believe
Foley had a hidden stake in Reinke and would receive payments for
directing claims to it.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate and real estate records show that Foley's partner in
the accounting firm, Craig S. D'Ambra of Warwick, R.I., was also
involved in several real estate transactions with Ciliberto. Until
it went out of business, Reinke Group was listed in the Warwick
telephone directory at the same address as D'Ambra's home. D'Ambra
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who was in 1993 promoted to deputy treasurer in charge of
the cash management division, oversaw the work of Trischitta, who
supervised the Unpaid Check Fund. Foley was responsible for signing
the millions of dollars in checks that Trischitta approved for
issuance to heir finders who had located individuals or firms to
which the state owed money.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent ripples of disbelief through the former treasury
administration. The case has turned into the largest theft of state
money in the commonwealth's history as well as the one of the most
damning indictments of state government since the corruption
scandals of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's top aide, Thomas Trimarco, said he was stunned that
someone from the office's inner circle had been implicted in a
scandle that otherwise had been blamed on ``one bad apple'' _
Trischitta, also known as ``Trixie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We put complete trust in him and to learn this is just
sickening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Squillace, former assistant treasurer in charge of the
Abandoned Property Division, which is where money from the Unpaid
Check Fund is transferred after 13 months, was also shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have believed that this could have involved
Foley,'' Squillace said. ''
</P>
<P>
   But Tonia Duchano, whom Malone appointed to watch over the
Abondoned Property Divison _ which Foley also controlled at one
point _ had many conflicts with him before she left recently to
take a job in another state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie couldn't have figured out anything,'' Duchano said.
``And Bob Foley, he's very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta, 47, of Stoneham, was arrested two weeks ago along
with Martin Robbins, 51, an heir finder from Peabody and New
Hampshire. Trischitta allegedly directed Robbins to $6.5 million in
uncashed checks in exchange for $50,000 in bribes and one-third of
the money. The $6.5 million, which Robbins deposited into a
BankBoston escrow account in November, has been returned to the
state, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly would not say whether Foley knew about Trischitta's
alleged theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a more sophisticated scheme,'' Reilly said. ``It
involved in- and out-of-state companies. This has been ongoing for
the better part of eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Treasurer O'Brien moved to reassure the state that
the Unpaid Check Fund _ now frozen with $13 million in it _ is
safe, along with other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put bluntly, the holes have been plugged,'' O'Brien said in a
press conference at her State House office. ``I'm standing in the
middle of it and I can't believe it.''

CLANCY IS USC'S QUIET MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's nearly impossible to find someone who has
seen USC forward Sam Clancy lose his temper. His high school coach
hasn't. Neither has his roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy is so quiet, most find it difficult to gauge his
emotions. He's even-keeled to the point Trojans coach Henry Bibby
has tried to get Clancy to become more demonstrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way I am,'' Clancy said. ``I've always been
quiet. I'm not really a person who tries to pump a team up. I'm
laid back and I don't have too many worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's stoic demeanor has probably saved him from a stressful
first year at USC. If most true freshmen had gone through what
Clancy has, they probably never would have been able to recover and
start in 19 of the Trojans' first 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's college career got off to a controversial start before
he enrolled at USC. Last spring, the Pacific-10 Conference
conducted an investigation into allegations that the prep star was
paid $25,000 to attend USC.
</P>
<P>
   The news shocked Clancy and those who knew him at St. Edward's
High in Lakewood, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought him behind closed doors and said, `What happened?'
He looked in my eyes and said, `Nothing happened,' '' said Eric
Flannery, Clancy's high school coach. ``It's upsetting how a rumor
can go that far.''
</P>
<P>
   After a six-week investigation, the conference found no evidence
that Clancy received any cash payments. But the damage had already
been done to Clancy's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hope people treat him OK and don't have doubts,''
Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   A more emotional player might be dogged by the allegations, and
let the situation ruin his season. But Clancy's ``What, me worry?''
attitude proved to be a perfect antidote for the stress of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't worry about it too much. I knew it wasn't true,''
Clancy said. ``I worried less because I knew everything was just a
lie. We just had to answer questions truthfully. I thought it was a
joke at first. I got over it. I know I didn't do anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Flannery was hardly stunned by Clancy's relaxed nature during
the heat of the charges, even after an investigator visited his
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even chuckled about it,'' Flannery said. ``He thought it
was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy (6-foot-6, 235 pounds) has averaged six points and 5.7
rebounds, and has gotten better as the season has progressed. In
Pac-10 play, he leads the conference in blocked shots (1.6 per
game) and has recorded three double-doubles. He is a strong
candidate for the Pac-10's All-Freshmen team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been tremendous,'' Bibby said. ``Again, he's had his ups
and downs. We're working with him about being more excited for
games and more upbeat. We want him to be more emotionally
aggressive for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy gives himself a B-minus for his performance this season
but admits he sewed up a starting job faster than even he
anticipated. Junior Jarvis Turner started the season at power
forward and was expected to be the Trojans' go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   But Bibby liked Clancy and his rebounding skills, and soon
replaced Turner with the husky freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I didn't think I would start this year,'' Clancy
said. ``It came a little fast. I think once the Pac-10 started, I
think I did pretty well. I think I will be a four-year starter.''
</P>
<P>
   His roommate at USC, center Brian Scalabrine, labels Clancy the
player who has ``improved the most on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine believes the only thing holding Clancy back is his
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as showing emotions on the court, I've got to work with
him,'' Scalabrine said. ``Because when he shows emotions, he plays
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's quiet nature doesn't hurt as a roommate, however,
according to Scalabrine: ``I think Sam is a perfect roommate. If he
doesn't play or has a bad practice, he doesn't bring it home with
him.''

MODEST FRESHMAN LEADS SETON HALL TO MODEST UPSET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They lost twice to the Irish in the regular season,
and needed a victory to stay in contention for the National
Invitation Tournament. Seton Hall's crafty point guard, Shaheen
Holloway, was battered. His backup, Ty Shine, was a freshman. Quite
talented, but still only a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But Shine responded with a career performance Wednesday _ 17
points, 6 assists and 3 steals _ to help the Pirates eliminate
Notre Dame from the Big East tournament, 79-69, before a sleepy
morning crowd at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the day session of the tournament ended up being a
three-game, ho-hum affair.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4-seeded Syracuse routed No. 13 Boston College by the widest
margin in the tournament's 20-year history, 96-55, and No. 5-seeded
Villanova waited 34 minutes to finally wrestle the lead from No. 12
West Virginia before snuffing the Mountaineers' upset bid by 73-61.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall Coach Tommy Amaker decided that Holloway, the junior
from Queens, hadn't been himself since a shoulder injury last
month; and a stomach virus had limited him to just 23 minutes in
the past two games. So Amaker told Shine he was starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited,'' Shine said with a wide smile. ``I just wanted
to lead the team.''
</P>
<P>
   He did that by running the Pirates' halfcourt offense precisely,
propelling Seton Hall past the first round for the first time since
1996. The Hall plays top-seeded Connecticut (the nation's No. 3
team) Thursday at noon. Seton Hall (15-13) led the Huskies in both
games at halftime earlier this season before losing _ a fact not
lost on Amaker or his seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks that we played them tough, but we lost to them
twice,'' Amaker said. ``They'll be better. This is the showcase for
our league, and they're the best in our league. It will be an
unbelievable battle just to stay on the court with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shine had help Wednesday as Duane Jordan, a 6-foot-6-inch
senior, banged the Irish's towering frontcourt of 6-11 Phil Hickey
and 6-9 Troy Murphy for 18 points and 13 rebounds. He, too, is
looking forward to a potential NIT berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our good defense came good offense,'' Jordan said. ``They
were looking for me today, and the shots were falling. This is my
senior year, and we needed to win this one because we didn't want
fate to control the destiny of our NIT chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish (14-16) kept alive their streak of never winning a Big
East tournament game (0-4) by turning the ball over 23 times and
barely getting close enough to threaten. Led by the conference's
rookie of the year, Troy Murphy, the Irish closed within 69-64 with
2 minutes 5 seconds left, but Seton Hall went 10 for 10 from the
foul line down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing for the season to end today; we were hoping
to make a run in the tournament and probably earn an NIT bid,''
said Murphy, who scored 28 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. ``I
learned a lot this year and had a lot of fun, but it's still
disappointing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Syracuse stretched a 12-0 opening run into a
47-18 halftime lead and never looked back as four Orangemen _ led
by Etan Thomas' 19 points _ put up double figures against hapless
Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (6-21) shot 34.7 percent from the field, 61.9 percent
from the free-throw line and turned the ball over 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought today we came out focused,'' Syracuse Coach Jim
Boeheim said. ``Defense was good, and we didn't let them get any
open shots. But we're just bigger and stronger than them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen (20-10) now face Villanova (20-9) in perhaps the
most competitive matchup of the quarterfinals. The Wildcats needed
21 second-half points from John Celestand _ including a 30-foot
3-pointer to finally get the lead with 5:52 left in the game _ to
repel a pesky, upset-minded Mountaineer team.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia (10-19) bloodied Villanova on the boards, 46-32,
and Elton Scott riddled them for 26 points _ including 12 points
from behind the 3-point arc _ until Celestand and the Wildcats
turned to pressure defense. They forced 13 second-half turnovers
and converted them into 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Celestand and Brown, who had 16 points, are both seniors.
``There's nothing can take the place of experience,'' Villanova
Coach Steve Lappas said. ``And these guys have played a lot of
games for us.''

EDITORIAL: IRAN'S IMPULSE FOR CHANGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 4: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The power of democracy is altering Iran. Unofficial results from
municipal elections show that Iranians overwhelmingly supported
moderate politicians associated with President Mohammad Khatami.
The voting mirrored the presidential election that swept Khatami to
power two years ago. Though conservative clerics remain the
paramount rulers of Iran, Iranians clearly are impatient to lift
religious repression and transform their country.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Constitution, adopted after Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979
Islamic revolution, provides for local elections, but none were
held for two decades. Khatami called last Friday's vote hoping to
create a more decentralized civil society that could support his
agenda of political and social change. His gamble apparently paid
off.
</P>
<P>
   The winners included liberal clerics like Abdollah Nouri, a
Khatami ally who was forced out of the national Cabinet last year
by clerical conservatives and who has now been elected to the
Tehran city council. The high turnout that carried many moderate
candidates to victory may now embolden Khatami to take further
conciliatory steps toward America.
</P>
<P>
   Washington would benefit greatly from the development of a more
moderate and internationally responsible Iran, and should do what
it can to encourage change. While continuing to support exchanges
by sports teams and cultural groups, the Clinton administration
should begin to ease trade restrictions against Iran in ways that
would have the most impact on ordinary Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   The White House rightly insists that normal relations cannot be
completely restored until Iran stops trying to build nuclear and
other unconventional weapons, severs its links with terrorism and
accepts peacemaking efforts between Israeli and Arab leaders. Iran
has distanced itself from terror and now concedes the Palestinians'
right to make peace with Israel. If further steps can be taken, the
Mideast will be a safer place and Iran may resume its traditional
role as a regional counterweight to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the White House should approve a request by an
American trading company, pending since last year, to sell three
million tons of grain and 400,000 tons of sugar requested by the
Iranian government. President Clinton also ought to ease
restrictions on American imports of Iranian carpets, leaving in
place only measures to discourage the exploitation of child labor.
Neither step requires Congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   American food sales would make it easier for the Khatami
government to subsidize the diet of families hurt by collapsed
world oil prices. Permitting carpet imports would allow the
creation of many new Iranian jobs. Iran's people have once again
voted for change. America should welcome their democratic choice
and extend new opportunities for friendship.

EDITORIAL: THE REDWOODS DEAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 4: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is much to celebrate in Tuesday's historic agreement under
which the federal and California governments will pay the Pacific
Lumber Company $480 million for 10,000 acres of redwood forests
along the northern California coast. Saving the largest privately
owned grove of ancient redwood trees in the world for future
generations is a tribute to the public officials and tireless
private citizens who made it happen. The deal is also a vindication
of the much-maligned Endangered Species Act, without which the
trees would surely have been doomed.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much more to this deal than the redwoods, and
despite all the celebratory noises in Washington and Sacramento, it
is far too early to claim victory. Under a so-called habitat
conservation plan, the company also has agreed to restrictions on
how and where it will harvest timber on the 200,000 acres it owns
outside the redwood groves. The purpose of these rules is to save
the habitat and improve the prospects of several endangered
species, notably California's coho salmon and a seabird called the
marbled murrelet.
</P>
<P>
   To many environmentalists and to Secretary of the Interior Bruce
Babbitt, this part of the deal is as important as the redwoods. If
the conservation plan works, it will greatly strengthen Babbitt's
argument that forging negotiated settlements with private
landowners covering entire ecosystems is a more secure way to
protect threatened wildlife than the litigious species-by-species
approach that has been the hallmark of the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it works will depend heavily on the willingness of
this administration and its successors to monitor the compliance of
Pacific Lumber, a company with a sorry environmental record and a
reputation for aggressive logging.
</P>
<P>
   The company pledges cooperation, but its history dictates
vigilance. Acquired in a leveraged buyout by a Texas businessman,
Charles Hurwitz, in 1985, Pacific Lumber more than doubled its
logging output to finance the purchase. In 1995 a federal judge
ruled that the company had violated the Endangered Species Act by
destroying the habitat of the murrelet. The company's operations
were further threatened when the California coho salmon, which
spawns in streams on Pacific Lumber property, joined the murrelet
on the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   Hurwitz countersued in 1996, arguing that the government was
required under the Fifth Amendment to compensate him for land it
had prevented him from using. Rather than engage in a long and
problematical court battle, the White House decided to strike a
deal involving a buyout of several redwood groves and a
conservation plan covering the rest of the property. Congress
appropriated $250 million for the federal share, with California
paying the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement nearly fell apart last Friday night, when the
company rebelled against new restrictions that had been urged upon
the government by its own scientists, including wider ``no cut''
zones bordering certain streams important to the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, John Campbell, said the rules would cut
its harvest below what it needed to remain profitable. The
government got the deal back on track with an exchange of vague
letters that Washington described as minor ``clarifications'' and
that the company described as a promise of more ``flexibility'' in
its logging operations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of language that makes environmentalists
nervous. But what really ought to concern them is whether the
government will stick to the agreement and devote the time and
talent to police it, stream by stream, watershed by watershed.
Clinton and Vice President Gore will have every right to claim
credit for saving the redwoods. But history will also ask whether
they did anything for the birds and fish.

COMMENTARY: HILLARY IN NEW YORK: RETURN OF THE NEO-NATIVE?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 4: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memo to future presidential spouses: If you're feeling
overlooked, float a rumor that you might run for the Senate. So
many people were dying to pay $150 to hear Hillary Rodham Clinton's
luncheon address at the Plaza Wednesday that hundreds were exiled
from the main dining room, eating lunch with a public address
system. The place was abubble with incipient feminist triumphalism
and plain old Democratic opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   The press corps trailing Mrs. Clinton was perhaps not as large
as the 22-camera contingent that turned up when the former
vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro announced she was
running for the Senate in 1992. But it was big considering that
Mrs. Clinton was not announcing anything more earth-shaking than
her belief that ``this is a great time to be a woman in America.''
It is not every day you see men from the British tabloids virtually
weeping in frustration at their inability to get a good position to
cover an address about the importance of public commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Within all her pleasant generalities, of course, Mrs. Clinton
had enough positive things to say about running for office to
encourage the local Democrats who are yearning for someone to save
them from His Fearsome Rudyness. She managed to lace her remarks
with a notable number of references to places she has been in New
York state _ that marvelous bus trip from Newburgh to Seneca Falls,
the inspiring gathering at the YWCA in Brooklyn. If she shied away
from political specifics, the same could not be said of her
less-than-subtle string of warm-up speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If California can send two women to the Senate, can't New York
do one?'' demanded Judith Hope, the head of the state Democratic
Party. Ms. Hope told the crowd that it was the least one could
expect from a state ``that gave the world'' a list of political
women that began with Eleanor Roosevelt and dwindled down rather
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Plaza consisted of about 1,000 women and a
handful of men, virtually all of whom were elected officials hoping
to be asked to give the first lady more advice about her Senate
prospects. ``She's very thorough, but don't quote me,'' said one.
Mrs. Clinton is famous for her dislike of the media, and local
politicians have figured out that if they want to be confidants,
they had better be confidential. As much as it kills them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually more interesting than this,'' protested New York
City's public advocate, Mark Green, after he had most
uncharacteristically declined to say anything about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ubiquitous junior senator, Charles Schumer, who
lost his wife, Iris, in the press of the crowd, promised to ``be
there'' for the first lady if she runs. He also urged Mrs. Clinton
to wait and make her decision ``in a non-frenzied atmosphere,'' a
term that most definitely did not apply to the Plaza ballroom. ``I
say to the first lady, take a little time and think this through,''
said Schumer, as Mrs. Clinton stood next to him, her hands folded
demurely in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been the only controversial statement of the day,
since virtually all the state's Democratic politicians have been
urging Mrs. Clinton to make up her mind quickly. The first lady
could easily wait until the fall and still raise plenty of money
for the race, but if she chooses not to run, another candidate
could have a tougher time. ``She'll kill the Democratic chances if
she waits and then doesn't run,'' said one of her many
off-the-record advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said later that his own experience made him feel
strongly about the virtue of taking some time. Not only did he
devote months to mulling the pros and cons of a Senate run, he
said. ``I brushed my teeth with it. I went to the park with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Schumer has his way, Mrs. Clinton will go back and brush her
teeth with the Senate option for some time, leaving the rest of New
York to wonder whether her contention that ``politics is really the
lifeblood of democracy'' was a secret signal of something big, and
whether she should be worried about the fact that her poll ratings
have dropped since she was first mentioned as a candidate. Perhaps
the public is beginning to feel that instead of a village, it takes
a resident.

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The Walt Disney Co. has confirmed it is in
talks to build a Hong Kong theme park but tossed cold water on
reports that the project is a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no definitive agreement,'' spokesman Ken Green said
Wednesday. ``We are holding preliminary discussions about building
a theme park and destination resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's finance secretary, Donald Tsang, announced a
preliminary deal had been struck when he presented his annual
budget speech late Tuesday. He said the park would be built on
reclaimed land near Lantau Island, where the new international
airport was built, with a target opening of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang said a final decision will be made by June 30 with
construction starting a year later but Disney declined to confirm
if those targets exist.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked the first time that Disney _ often the subject
of speculation about proposed projects _ had admitted it is
exploring a Hong Kong project. ``I would say there's a decent
probability that it's going to come to be,'' said analyst Linda
Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co. ``They see China as a place where
there's a lot of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney has declined to comment if it will take on
a partner, as it has with Tokyo Disneyland, or how much it will
spend. But one Chinese news agency reported recently the project
would cost $6.5 billion. An informed source said the figure would
be closer to $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they'll have a partner,'' Bannister said. ``It's
not that they couldn't fund it but there are a lot of benefits to
partner with someone who understands the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Spiegel, a veteran of consulting to overseas theme-park
operators, cautioned that supporters of the project may be far too
optimistic. ``It's typical for the Chinese to put out this kind of
announcement,'' he added. ``They tend to be a little bit
overzealous. I would be shocked if Disney signs an agreement to
build a theme park that would open before 2015 because the income
is just not there.''
</P>
<P>
   The sensible approach, Spiegel said, would be for Disney to
build resort hotels with a minor theme park element. He also
predicted the entertainment giant will be more cautious in Hong
Kong than it was with EuroDisney, which lost $900million in its
first year after opening in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But momentum is moving toward a major Disney presence in China,
triggered by comments earlier this year by Chairman Michael Eisner
that ``we could be getting close to a time for a major Disney
attraction in the world's most populous nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign came recently when the Chinese allowed Disney's
``Mulan'' screen in theaters a year after Disney's ``Kundun''
infuriated authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Stewart Halpern of ING Barings Furman Selz said he
believes the Chinese market will prove irresistible even though a
vast array of issues could delay or break up a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming that an acceptable agreement can be worked out,
building a park in that part of the world is a tremendous business
opportunity,'' he said. ``This would be a step that transcends the
addition of another theme park because it would be a major
introduction to the biggest untapped market for selling a whole
variety of entertainment and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is not just a great moneymaker, but a tremendous
vehicle for promotion of the brand.''

MAN CLAIMS `GHOST' DROVE HIM TO PUSH WOMAN TO HER DEATH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man accused of pushing a Buffalo woman to her death
in front of a subway train told the police in a signed statement
that a ``ghost or a spirit or something like that'' sparked an
``uncontrollable urge'' in him just before the attack, according to
court documents released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The accused man, Andrew Goldstein, said in three handwritten
statements that he watched in ``horror'' as a subway train ran over
the woman, Kendra Webdale, 32, after he pushed her to the tracks in
a Manhattan station just after 5 p.m. on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, according to the court papers, said he then turned to
the man next to him, raised his arms in the air and said, ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, 29, who has a long history of schizophrenia, waited
for the police to come and told arriving officers that he was a
``psychotic patient'' who had suffered a ``psychotic attack'' and
asked them to take him to a hospital, the court documents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a sensation like something was entering me like a ghost
or a spirit or something like that,'' Goldstein wrote in looping
cursive handwriting that shifted from illegible to neat in the
three statements. ``When I have the sensation that something is
entering me, I get the urge to push, shove, or sidekick.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's statements were released Wednesday at his
arraignment in state Supreme Court in Manhattan on second-degree
murder charges in the killing of Ms. Webdale, a crime that
rekindled many fears among many riders of random attacks on city
subways despite the plunging crime rate. Goldstein's lawyer, Harvey
Fischbein, entered a plea of not guilty Wednesday and requested a
hearing to challenge the results of an examination by court
psychiatrists that concluded Goldstein was fit for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph T. Webdale Jr. and Kim Webdale, the victim's brother and
sister, attended the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, a resident of Howard Beach, Queens, wrote in his
statements about the incident that his mother and his brother live
in the city and that his father is a radiologist in Delaware. He
said he did not know Ms. Webdale and did not even get a good look
at her, simply saying that ``the woman had blond hair.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The statements added tragic new details to the attack.
Goldstein, who had stopped taking his schizophrenia medication
according to law enforcement officials, visited Jamaica Hospital
Medical Center's emergency room in Queens the day before the attack
for treatment of a sprained ankle. But no one apparently noticed
him acting strangely.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hinck, a spokesman for Jamaica Hospital, said Goldstein
did not exhibit any behavior that merited a psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein also said in his statement that he had carried out
other violent attacks before the subway incident. In those cases,
he described the same sensation of ``a force'' taking over his body
that he said caused him to become violent.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein wrote that in December 1992, he ran into a doctor's
office, ``punched a nurse'' and was institutionalized. In April
1997, he wrote, he felt ``a force like something overtaking me and
I have no control.'' He reacted by punching in his roommate's
bedroom door, he said. Goldstein said he was hospitalized for a
month after that incident.
</P>
<P>
   His statements also detailed his movements on the day he was
said to have attacked Ms. Webdale. There was little hint of the
random attack that was to come, and he made no reference to anyone
questioning his behavior earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said he ate breakfast at a McDonald's near his home in
Queens that morning, then stopped by a supermarket to say hello to
a friend's girlfriend. Taking a bus and a subway to Times Square,
he wrote, he went to the Virgin Records store and listened to
Natalie Imbruglia and Madonna on compact disks. While listening to
music, he created pictures in his mind, and mentions in his
statement that he would ``like to direct someday.''
</P>
<P>
   After eating at another McDonald's, he wrote, he set out to
visit his brother at work and bumped into a woman he met while
institutionalized. With his brother not at work, Goldstein walked
to the Virgin record store in Union Square, where he said he again
listened to Madonna and to some classical music.
</P>
<P>
   He said he then ate at a nearby Wendy's restaurant and walked
around a department store for five minutes. Deciding to head home,
he walked to the subway station where the attack on Ms. Webdale
occurred.

NEW PROGRAM IS INTRODUCED TO EASE USE OF LINUX SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.) (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The free software movement Wednesday took its
most significant step yet toward a direct confrontation with the
Microsoft Corp. by introducing software that gives the powerful and
free Linux operating system the ease-of-use found on Windows and
Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is known as Gnome, for GNU Network Object
Model Environment, was introduced here at the first Linux World
computer exhibition. Its designers said that Gnome would make it
possible for people who are not programmers or technicians to use
Linux and the software that runs on it comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, which was developed over the last 15 years by a loosely
organized movement of programmers known as GNU (the name is a
Mobius strip-like acronym that stands for ``GNU's not Unix'') has
been rapidly gaining ground among corporate and technical users of
server computers and workstations because of its power and
stability.
</P>
<P>
   But as a member of the Unix family of operating systems, it is
manipulated by esoteric commands, not with the point-and-click
graphical interfaces to which mouse-wielding consumers have grown
accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Gnome puts a friendly face on Linux by inserting a graphical
interface between the operating system and the user, in much the
way that Windows was originally an interface between users and
MS-DOS.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the corporate world has begun to take Linux
seriously, and its prospects brightened considerably with the
announcement that IBM would begin shipping it on some powerful
server computers that manage large networks.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the free software movement have said, however,
that they do not intend to limit Linux to corporate systems
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is aimed directly at the Windows desktop dominance,''
said Jean Bozeman, a research manager at the International Data
Corp., a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Gnome offers a set of ``themes'' that imitate the appearance of
various operating systems, including Windows and Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Gnome's development has been led by Miguel de Icaza, a
26-year-old Mexican programmer and systems administrator for the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the program would attract a strong
international backing, noting for example that the Mexican
government was planning to distribute a million copies to schools
as part of a system known as Scholarnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gnome is not just a pretty face,'' he said. It adds to Linux a
number of sophisticated and attractive technical features.
</P>
<P>
   Gnome is distributed with a word processor, spreadsheet, data
base, presentation manager, Web browser and e-mail. The program's
designers said they were hoping to persuade commercial software
developers to convert their Windows programs to take advantage of
Gnome's features.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement, which was made by the Free Software
Foundation and Red Hat Software Inc., a Linux developer, served as
evidence of progress for the Linux movement. But it also hinted at
internal tensions that have been building within GNU.
</P>
<P>
   That is because while Gnome is the most ambitious effort yet to
put a simplified face on Linux, it is by no means the only effort.
There are already several user interfaces available for Linux, and
there has been growing concern that incompatibilities between them
could handicap an operating system known for its integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Windows nor the Macintosh operating system is as stable
as Linux, but they are attractive to software developers because
each offers a single set of rules that programmers follow when
writing code. That is possible because the graphical interfaces are
built in to those operating systems. Forcing programmers to write
different code for each Linux interface would undermine efforts to
attract third-party development for it.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it was notable that Wednesday's announcement
received the blessing of Richard Stallman, the iconoclastic founder
of the GNU movement and a Cambridge, Mass., programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman told reporters that the free software movement had now
achieved much of what he set out to do in the 1970s, when he began
trying to liberate software programs from proprietary control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago they said this was impossible,'' he said.
``They said this was too large a task.''

ADVERTISING: BLOOMBERG STEPS FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bloomberg Personal Finance, the monthly magazine for private
investors, is running its first major ad campaign to increase its
visibility among both the advertising community and the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, published by Bloomberg LP, the financial
information empire started by Michael Bloomberg, recently began a
$500,000 campaign in an eclectic mix of magazines _ including
advertising trade magazines, Time Out New York, Brill's Content and
Playboy _ that is intended to illustrate what it terms its ``secret
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomberg officials, Bloomberg Personal Finance,
which started as a bimonthly in November 1996 and became a monthly
a year later, provides two distinct ``secret advantages'': It gives
subscribers investment intelligence, while it gives advertisers a
readership that is predominantly male, relatively young (more than
half its readers are under 55), well educated and highly affluent.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent research by MRI Custom Research, the mean
net worth of readers' households is $1.4 million, while the mean
value of their investment portfolios is $900,000. The magazine's
circulation is now 215,000, double what it started with.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, by Doremus, a unit of Omnicom Group, are in black and
white except for a red Bloomberg logo and web site address. This
creates the feeling of reportage, said Rebecca Tudor-Foley,
executive vice president and creative director worldwide of
Doremus. ``We want to show people caught in the act, with the
secret advantage uncovered _ paparazzi shots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four striking ads depicts a different situation that
illustrates the magazine's ``secret advantage''; most were
photographed by Robert Whitman, who has worked on advertising for
Dewar's. The first ad zooms in on a raincoat-clad young man,
reading a copy of Bloomberg Personal, whose logo peeks out from
above a copy of Playboy. In the trade version of the ad, the copy
says, ``Our readers enjoy a full hour with every issue,'' while the
consumer version says, ``Satisfy your second most basic instinct,''
and lists a toll-free subscription telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Another ad has a simulated image from an airport X-ray machine,
with one briefcase holding a passport, cell phone, change purse and
a copy of Bloomberg Personal. One ad shows a bride climbing out of
a limousine, clutching her bouquet and revealing a garter belt
decorated with the Bloomberg logo. And another ad shows a couple
kissing on a park bench; the woman has one hand reaching into her
boot, pulling out a copy of the magazine. Besides carrying the
Bloomberg logo, every ad also has the tag line ``the secret
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tudor-Foley said the campaign deliberately avoided the tone
traditionally set in personal finance magazines. ``There are
usually pictures of upscale readers, statistics for media buyers,
or exploitative headlines about the issue of the magazine,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   One major goal is to raise the profile of the magazine among
media buyers, Bloomberg said. ``A lot of them don't know who we are
or how important our brand name is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our second year as a monthly, and it's time to lift our
visibility with the ad agency community,'' added David Wachtel,
publisher of Bloomberg Personal Finance.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Bloomberg's campaign is running through July in
Advertising Age and the Adweek trade publications, in the February
and March issues of Time Out New York, in the March issue of
Brill's Content, and in the April issue of Playboy. In addition,
copies of each ad are being reproduced on postcards, which are
being mailed to more than 10,000 media planners, buyers and
supervisors around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Time Out ads are largely geared toward young media planners,
who Doremus believes read the publication during leisure time. ``We
want to complement what they see in the trade publications,'' Ms.
Tudor-Foley said. The ad in Brill's Content is intended to reach
``senior people in the media business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To reproduce the Playboy logo, Doremus approached Playboy
executives for their permission. Playboy complied, and also made a
deal with Bloomberg to run the ad in the April issue of Playboy,
whose circulation is more than 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, and Hef loves the parody,'' said Playboy's
publisher, Richard Kinsler, referring to Hugh Hefner, the
magazine's founder. ``Because we're an icon, it gives us exposure.
It's a nice tie-in. Bloomberg is well known and respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both publications declined to specify what
Bloomberg paid for its ad in Playboy, though Wachtel said it was
not ``regular rates.''

JONES APPAREL GROUP'S STOCK FALLS ON NEWS OF NINE WEST
ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock of Jones Apparel Group Inc. declined 12.2
percent Wednesday, as the market frowned on the company's planned
acquisition of Nine West Group, the shoe retailer and manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Apparel, which sells women's clothing under the
Evan-Picone and Jones New York labels among others, announced late
Tuesday that it would buy Nine West for $885 million in stock and
cash and would assume $515 million of Nine West's debt. With Jones
Apparel's share price falling $3.19 Wednesday, to $22.75, the
deal's value was reduced by nearly $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, each of Nine West's 34 million common
shares outstanding will be exchanged for 0.5011 share of common
stock in Jones Apparel and $13 in cash. Partly on merger hopes,
Nine West's stock has risen 47 percent this year, including a gain
of 6.25 cents a share Wednesday, to $22.875.
</P>
<P>
   Investors expressed displeasure with several aspects of the
deal. For one, Nine West has had some big problems, including a
sudden slowdown in sales and an investigation by the Federal Trade
Commission into allegations of price fixing. Stock analysts doubt
that the company, which already accounts for roughly one out of
every five pairs of women's shoes sold in the United States, will
be the kind of turnaround and growth vehicle that Jones executives
predicted in announcing the combination.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Pope Murray, a footwear and apparel analyst for JP Morgan,
said, ``The market is not convinced that Nine West is additive'' to
earnings. Ms. Murray said she saw, ``a lower growth component with
a higher degree of risk'' than Jones did.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West needs to fix itself up and jump start sales again. But
investors are questioning whether Mark Schwartz, who is
chairman-designate of the new company, has the experience to do it.
Schwartz is president of Palladin Capital Group, a leveraged buyout
firm that advised Jones in the deal. As an investment banker at
Merrill Lynch, Schwartz worked with both Jones and Nine West on
their initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Britt, director of investor relations and financial
planning for Jones Apparel, noted that at Palladin Schwartz had
served as chairman of several companies, including retailers,
manufacturers and distributors in which it had a stake.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call with analysts Wednesday, Schwartz said a
``turnabout is already under way.'' The company, which closed 100
stores last year, plans to close 60 more underperforming stores
this year. It now operates 1,095 outlets and sells its products
widely in department stores.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The major credit rating agencies Wednesday put Jones Apparel on
their watch lists with a negative outlook, but indicated a positive
outlook for Nine West.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts remained unconvinced that Jones Apparel
would find success in the shoe business, which is commonly thought
to be even more complicated to manage than apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find it to be a very strategic move,'' said Josie
Esquivel, a stock analyst who tracks apparel and footwear companies
for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and was one of a half dozen analysts
who downgraded the stock this morning. ``I don't see a lot of
synergies between the footwear and apparel businesses. They will
still need two design staffs, two sales forces and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Faye Landes, who tracks retailers' stocks for Thomas Weisel
Partners, agreed. ``If there are synergies, they aren't readily
apparent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy M. Ghriskey, portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp.,
which owned 970,200 Jones shares at the end of the year, said he
was concerned that Jones was entering unfamiliar territory. ``This
is a fairly radical departure from their traditional strategy,'' he
said. ``This takes them into manufacturing and retail in a much
bigger way.'' &QL;

`HUMILIATED' LEWINSKY BREAKS SILENCE ON ORDEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies Lewinsky did not mention her abortion during the TV
interview.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abandoning the last vestiges of her privacy, Monica
S. Lewinsky has now told all in a new book and a teary television
interview as she launches an international quest to reverse the
personal and financial damage of her affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wrathful one moment, rueful the next, the former White House
intern opened the post-impeachment chapter of the saga by assailing
the ``dubious methods'' of the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, asserting his deputies drove her to the brink of suicide,
and disclosing a startling twist in her tumultuous story: that she
obtained an abortion after she became pregnant by an unidentified
Pentagon offical in 1996 during the final months of her
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, 25, who stands to make several million dollars in her
marketing effort, unleashed a flood of additional information of
varying significance in a two-hour interview Wednesday night on
ABC's ``20/20'' and in a 288-page book, ``Monica's Story.'' The
book, released to the news media Wednesday, goes on sale Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After watching in virtual silence for more than a year as her
affair with Clinton burst from secrecy to the threshold of a
constitutional crisis, Lewinsky spared little emotion as she
unfolded her version of events.
</P>
<P>
   She described her former friend, Linda R. Tripp, as a
``treacherous bitch'' for telling Starr about Lewinsky's affair
with Clinton and then acting as an informant for the independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hurt her,'' Lewinsky said of Tripp. ``I felt like
an animal wanting to claw at her skin.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, Lewinsky said she still wakes some mornings and
misses him ``with every ounce of my being, my head, heart, and
body.''
</P>
<P>
   But she told Barbara Walters, her interviewer on ABC, that she
no longer loves Clinton, and she made no secret that she despises
him for abandoning her after the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million viewers were expected to watch the Lewinsky
interview on ABC, and bookstores were stocking 400,000 copies of
``Monica's Story,'' which retails for $24.95. Lewinsky was given a
$750,000 advance for the book and will receive 10 percent of the
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was not paid for the ABC interview, Lewinksy will
receive $600,000 for an interview with a British television station
this weekend. She also stands to make about $500,000 for photo
spreads in several European magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew he wasn't a very truthful person,'' Lewinsky
said about Clinton in the book, written by Princess Diana's
biographer, Andrew Morton. ``But the events of the last year have
showm him to be a much bigger liar than I ever thought. Now I see
him as a selfish man who lies all the time. That makes me very
angry and resentful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lewinsky, who apologized on ABC to the country and Clinton's
family for the ordeal, blamed Starr most of all for the fallout
from the affair. She lashed out at the salacious nature of Starr's
eight-month investigation of the affair and the shocking details in
his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying herself as ``probably the most humiliated woman in
the world,'' Lewinsky said she ``really felt raped and physically
ill with myself'' because of Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   She took special exception to her initital contact with Starr's
deputies, who questioned her for more than 10 hours at a
Ritz-Carlton hotel in suburban Washington when they first
confronted her in January 1998 about her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky unloaded her anger in chapters of the book titled,
``The Starr Chamber,'' and ``Terror in Room 1012,'' which refers to
the hotel room where she was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is investigating whether Starr's staff
improperly discussed a possible immunity deal with Lewinsky that
day and whether Starr wrongfully failed to tell the department
about his contacts with lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones, who was
suing Clinton at the time for alleged sexual harassment. She later
settled the suit for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understandably, Starr's tactics have been a matter for grave
public concern,'' Lewinsky's book states. ``The whole exchange
about immunity was a waste of time except insofar as it exposed the
dubious methods employed by Starr's investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lewinsky's book alleges, ``the nearest comparison to
the relationship between Starr and Lewinsky is the reaction of an
abused child in the presence of the abuser, or that of a
badly-beaten animal to its bullying owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office declined to comment Wednesday on Lewinsky's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, one of Starr's deputies, Michael Emmick, whom the
book describes as ``a revolting specimen of humanity,'' warned
Lewinsky she could face up to 27 years in prison for possible
crimes related to Clinton's alleged attempt to cover up their
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if my stomach had been cut open and someone had
poured acid into my wound,'' Lewinsky said. ``I just felt an
intense stinging pain and overriding terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of prison apparently terrified her. ``I couldn't
bear to go to jail,'' she said in the book. ``I would come out an
old lady and no one would ever want to marry me.''
</P>
<P>
   In despair, she said, she considered hurling herself out the
10th-floor window, ``to crash to her death through the glass canopy
below.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky later was released and relied briefly for her defense
on William Ginsburg, a California lawyer and family friend who
specialized in medical malpractice cases. But soon she was unhappy
with Ginsburg too.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said Ginsburg became too enamored of the spotlight.
``Unfortunately, I think he could bitten by the bug,'' she told
Walters, ``and it became more about Bill Ginsburg than it did about
my well-being and my welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinksy's book asserts that her anger is mixed with an
``overwhelming feeling of guilt and shame for the anguish she has
caused not only her family and friends, but the president, his
family, and particulary Chelsea.''
</P>
<P>
   In her television interview, Lewinsky said Clinton sometimes
smiled at her even when he was with his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever think about Hillary Clinton?'' Walters asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about her a lot,'' Lewinsky said. ``But I never
thought she would find out.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she also thought about Chelsea because ``she means the
world to him, I mean, she is the most precious thing to him. I had
a very strong affinity for her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lewinksy's abortion, she did not mention it in the
television interview, although she answered in the affirmative when
asked if she had become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she describes the man as a senior Defense
Department official who was single, a ``charming, craggy-faced
older man'' named Thomas. She said they had an affair for three
months but it ended after she discovered she was pregnant in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She reluctantly decided to have an abortion, the book states,
``but she and Thomas fell out over the costs of the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she told Clinton she was dating other men, but
never told him about her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   With all that has happened since the scandal erupted, Lewinsky
said her personal goals of finding a husband and having children
remain far from fulfilled. ``This essentially traditional,
middle-class American girl is today reduced to hiding in the
shadows, a fugitive in her own land,'' her book states. ``She
exists in a modern-day Orwellian nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lewinsky recently has ``enjoyed the companionship of a
young, single man,'' according to her book. The relationship is
significant, Lewinsky believes, because she has always been drawn
to married men, largely out of her insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For her, the relationship has been both a revelation and a
reassurance, a first step into the real world of male-female
relationship,'' her book says. The relationship is described as
``her first faltering steps on a very long road to recovery.''

taken off in recent years, making St. Vincent the second largest

SHAW'S SHARP IN SPRING DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Jeff Shaw wanted to be at Dodgertown for two
weeks, and now that he's here, most of his thoughts are in
Washington Court House, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Funny what having an expectant wife, and training for a World
Series contender, will do to your mind. And your insides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be both places,'' said Shaw, the Dodgers' closer.
``It's been stressful. Stressful on her (Julie) because she's
pregnant and she knew I wanted to be here. She knew I wanted to be
here and she knew I wanted to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw arrived in Dodgertown near noon Wednesday, two weeks after
pitchers and catchers reported. He will be on his way home the
moment Julie begins labor, and the Dodgers said they could charter
a plane for Shaw if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, who knows when that will happen? Originally, the due
date was Feb. 15. It was changed to Feb. 25, and now it's been
pushed to mid-March, which is why Shaw is here. But the instant his
cell phone rings, Shaw will be gone for a few days. He approximates
it will take him five hours to get home, which should give him
enough time to witness the birth of the couple's third child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be there for (Julie), and your kid's birth only
happens once,'' Shaw said. ``But I also needed to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the latter isn't all that true. Not after manager Davey
Johnson and pitching coach Charlie Hough saw Shaw throw for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may get his program and institute that next season for my
pitchers,'' Johnson said. ``It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, Shaw's been weight training, running and
pitching near his home. He's even thrown a few simulated innings,
something he wanted to do so he could prove to the Dodgers he's
been working hard. It paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd be as sharp as he was,'' Hough said. ``He
had outstanding command. For the first day, it was excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who saved 48 games for the Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds
last season, isn't expected to pitch in a spring training game
until he returns from Ohio. Whenever that is.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it slow: Johnson said he'll keep Todd Hundley, and his
right elbow, away from the catcher's position for the first week of
spring training games, electing to err on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley isn't the only player who will sit in Friday's
Grapefruit League opener against St. Louis. Second baseman Eric
Young will be held out to give his ailing back time to rest. Young
said he's been experiencing soreness in his lower back the past few
days. It's bothered his hitting and fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stiffness,'' Young said. ``The fact that it's been
happening for a few days and hasn't improved, that concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he also anticipates holding center fielder Devon
White and left fielder Gary Sheffield out of the first few games.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Pitcher Mel Rojas returned to Dodgertown
after spending a few days in his native Dominican Republic
attending the funeral of his father-in-law. . . Much of the work
day was confined to the batting cages after rain halted an
intrasquad game. . . Tommy Lasorda is due into Dodgertown today and
former Dodgers president and CEO Peter O'Malley is expected to
arrive Friday. . . Tickets for individual games, and the April 3-4
exhibition games against the Yankees, go on sale today at 8:30 a.m.
at the Dodger Stadium advance ticket windows and at ETM Ticket
Machines. Tickets can also be purchased by calling 323-224-1HIT.
The team will host a season ticket open house at Dodger Stadium on
March 7 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

PIRRO PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FEDERAL TAX FRAUD CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind. )  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Albert Pirro, the powerful real estate
lawyer and husband of the Westchester County district attorney,
pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges of tax fraud and
accused prosecutors of trying to short-circuit his wife's political
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters after his arraignment at the federal
courthouse here, Pirro suggested that the ``pattern'' of state and
federal investigations into his business dealings seemed to
coincide with periodic attempts by Mrs. Pirro to seek higher
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have been at this a long time,'' he told reporters.
``I'm sure you can draw your own conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Connelly, a spokesman for Pirro, was more blunt, saying
that because of the indictment against Pirro, Mrs. Pirro has been
``sidelined as a potential senatorial candidate'' in next year's
election to fill the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, Pirro's associates have been reminding
reporters privately that the Pirro indictment helped force out a
strong Republican contender from a race in which Hillary Rodham
Clinton is being touted as the most fearsome Democratic prospect.
Although U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, whose office brought the tax
fraud prosecution, lists herself as an independent, Pirro's allies
have noted that she was appointed by a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Ms. White, declined to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro also said Wednesday that he had passed a privately
administered lie-detector test when he amended his tax returns last
year and paid $957,000 in additional taxes and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, 51, and his brother and accountant, Anthony, 43, were
indicted by a federal grand jury last week on charges of failing to
report $1 million in income between 1988 and 1997 by listing
personal purchases as the expenses of Pirro-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   The expenditures included a $123,000 Ferrari sports car,
Mercedes-Benzes for his wife and mother-in-law, a $40,000 gate and
a $3,700 awning for the Pirros' house in Harrison, N.Y, and the
legal bills for a paternity suit in which an Indiana woman proved
that Pirro was the father of her teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
   With several of the expenditures directly benefiting Mrs. Pirro,
she let it be known the day after he was indicted that she was no
longer considering a Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Pirro, with his lawyer, Roger L. Stavis, at his side,
also pleaded not guilty Wednesday.

WHITMAN SAYS N.Y. VOTERS WOULD REJECT MRS. CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While studiously avoiding the word, Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey suggested Wednesday that Hillary Rodham
Clinton was too liberal to prevail in New York's Senate race should
the first lady decide to enter that campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, responding to questions during a visit to Washington to
make speeches and meet with Republican congressional leaders, said
that Mrs. Clinton would be a formidable candidate should she decide
to seek the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a
Democrat who is retiring. But Whitman added that she felt a race
between Mrs. Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York would
expose the first lady as a proponent of big government and that
voters would reject her based on that philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, particularly, if she was running against Rudy
Giuliani, he would be successful,'' Whitman told a group of
reporters standing outside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``She starts with a great deal of sympathy,'' Whitman said.
``She starts with great name ID, obviously, and she'd be a very
tough campaigner and candidate. But her philosophy is pretty
strong. She showed us with the one policy issue for which she was
given responsibility at the beginning of the president's first
term, health care. Her proposal would have yielded one of the
largest federal bureaucracies that we've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's prediction came even as Mrs. Clinton was in New York
doing nothing to tamp down the speculation that she would run for
the Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey governor is also the object of speculation about
a possible run for the Senate seat held by Frank Lautenberg, a
Democrat who, like Moynihan, has announced his intention to retire.
After a speech at the National Press Club, Whitman said she was
``going to think about that long and hard,'' but that she would
make up her mind soon. ``I'm not going to leave it for a long time.
I've given myself 30 to 60 days,'' she said, adding, ``I'm not
going to drag it on for months and months.''

NEW YORK'S JOB GROWTH IN '98 WAS BEST SINCE '84, STATE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Companies in New York state added jobs in 1998 at the
fastest pace since 1984, and the number of jobs in the private
sector continued to grow in January, the state Department of Labor
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Private sector jobs grew by 2.3 percent last year, to 6.8
million, and 1,000 more jobs were added in January, according to
the Labor Department's newly revised figures. The figures are
adjusted for seasonal factors; without such adjustments, the number
of jobs would have fallen in January, as they do every year after
the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state fell to 5.2 percent in January from
5.4 percent in December, mostly because the jobless rate in New
York City fell to 7.6 percent from 8 percent, adjusted for seasonal
factors. In the rest of the state, unemployment remained flat at
3.8 percent, compared with a national average of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration used Wednesday's news to argue that
the upstate economy was pulling out of the long slump that began in
the early 1990s. Growth upstate has lagged that in New York City,
where a booming securities market has helped spark an economic
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the rate of growth downstate has been higher, the number
of jobs upstate is now at a record high,'' said Stephen Kagann,
chief economist to Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in manufacturing continued to fall in the year ended
January, but the declines were relatively minimal in industries
that make things like industrial equipment and other so-called
durable goods. The biggest drops in manufacturing were in
businesses that are concentrated downstate, like the printing and
garment industries, which lost 6,900 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Service industries continued to boom, adding more than 100,000
jobs. Growth was especially strong in motion pictures, business
services and engineering, according to the Labor Department
figures. Jobs in retailing and construction also jumped in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of jobs grew in the state by 1.9 percent; in the
city, the figure was 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New York now ranks about 20th among the states in terms of job
growth, Kagann said. In 1992 and 1993, the state hovered in last
place among the states, because it was still losing jobs while
other states were growing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the unemployment rate in the city's five boroughs remains
high. The jobless rate in the Bronx is 9.7 percent; in Brooklyn,
9.6 percent; in Queens, 7.1 percent; in Manhattan, 6.9 percent, and
in Staten Island, 7.1 percent.

JUDGE SEES GOOD-FAITH EFFORT TO INTEGRATE HARTFORD SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. _ A Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that
Connecticut had made a good-faith effort to desegregate the
Hartford schools after a landmark state Supreme Court ruling two
years ago, and ordered a group pushing for speedier progress to be
more patient.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, the latest in a suit first filed in 1989,
disappointed the families who brought the case. They point to the
racial isolation of black and Hispanic children, who were 93
percent of the city's student body at the time of the 1996 ruling
and today are 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 ruling , Sheff vs. O'Neill, the Connecticut Supreme
Court became the first state court in the nation to find that the
concentration of black and Hispanic students in an urban school
district could amount to a denial of equal educational opportunity
and a violation of segregation laws. Last year, the families went
back to Superior Court to argue that the state had not done enough
to remedy this segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the percentage of black and Hispanic students in
Hartford schools has actually increased since the Supreme Court
acted, Judge Julia L. Aurigemma found Wednesday that state
officials had responded ``expeditiously and in good faith'' to the
ruling by promoting interdistrict programs that allow urban and
suburban children to learn together, and by creating magnet and
charter schools to give parents a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislative and executive branches should have a realistic
opportunity to implement their remedial programs before further
court intervention,'' Aurigemma wrote. ``The best way to achieve
popular support is not to impose a judicially mandated remedial
plan, but to encourage Connecticut's populace as a whole, both
directly and through their elected representatives, to solve the
problems facing the state's schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Horton Sheff, whose son Milo became the lead plantiff
when he was a pupil in the Hartford schools, said after the ruling
that ``nothing substantial has changed'' in the Hartford schools.
Milo was in fourth grade in 1989 when the case was brought against
the governor at the time, William A. O'Neill, a Democrat who served
from 1980 to 1991. Milo Sheff, now 19, and studying business at a
community college.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheff said that the legislature was more concerned about
luring the New England Patriots to Hartford than in improving the
schools there. ``I think the state has gotten its priorities mixed
up,'' she said. ``It seems like stadium, yes, schools, no.''

NORTHRIDGE MAY GET SHORTCHANGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Picture this:
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team is in first place
in the Big Sky Conference and driving for a regular-season
championship. The community starts to get behind the team;
attendance at North Campus Gym goes up and the crowds get a little
livelier.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the public relations nightmare for the cash-strapped
CSUN athletic department. Because of a lack of finances, the
university announces it is forfeiting the right, as regular-season
champion, to host the postseason tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A likely scenario?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legitimate question,'' CSUN head basketball coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``If we won our conference this year, would we have
the ability to host the tournament?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most disappointing things would be these players
worked so hard to get that homecourt advantage and then have that
advantage taken away for various reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Big Sky Conference isn't satisfied CSUN would be ready
to host next year's tournament should the Matadors win the
regular-season title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never pull a tournament from somebody because of
their site,'' said Big Sky assistant commissioner Ron Loghry.
``(But) if it doesn't go off well, maybe that spurs CSUN to go in a
different direction. Maybe getting a new arena becomes an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't an issue the athletic department had to face this
year. The tournament starts tonight at Weber State in Ogden, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Collins, CSUN's associate athletic director for business
affairs, is worried about how the school might pay for the right to
host the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN would have to pay a $160,000 guarantee to host the
tournament. The money is distributed to the six qualifying schools
for expenses such as hotel accommodations, airfare and per diem.
CSUN would also have to spend a portion of the guarantee on
promotions, officials and trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Gate revenue is how conference schools cover the cost of the
guarantee. But since North Campus Gym only seats 1,600, and because
1,200 tickets are supposed to be given to the competing teams and
media, that would leave CSUN 400 tickets to recoup more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says not to worry about $100 ticket prices. She wants
the department to take an active role in acquiring corporate
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge we would love to meet,'' she said. ``If we
came up short . . . I would say `Let's try harder to fill in the
blank.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A larger arena is what Braswell and the players would like to
see.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my very first year, people were asking me about a new
arena,'' he said. ``I said `Hopefully we'll drive the university by
our success.' I'm not sure we're there yet, but we are headed in
that direction.''

PRIVACY CONCERNS RAISED OVER PLAN FOR BANK SCRUTINY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The federal agencies that govern the nation's
banks and thrifts have proposed regulations that, if approved,
would force financial institutions to report to police any
suspicious _ but perfectly legal _ activity in their customers'
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the rules will hamper money launderers such as
drug traffickers and weapons smugglers. Opponents of the
regulations say that if the rules are adopted, someone depositing
an unexpectedly generous bonus check from their boss could be
inviting the scrutiny of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks have a private relationship with their customers. This
has the potential to undermine that,'' said Janet Eissenstat, a
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association in Washington.
``You want to prevent fraud, but not at the expense of law-abiding
citizens, which are the majority of the banks' customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Know Your Customer'' program, as it is called by the four
federal agencies that proposed it last winter, will force banks and
thrifts to monitor their customers' transactions and financial
patterns. If a transaction deviates from that pattern _ such as a
large deposit or withdrawal _ the financial institutions will be
required to alert federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to help the nation's law enforcement agencies stop
money laundering and other illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are being considered by the Federal Reserve
System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision.
They are accepting public comments until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies, which collectively regulate all of the nation's
banks and thrifts, haven't said when a decision is due, although
officials with the FDIC say it could come by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   There's already been a backlash against the measure, chiefly
because of its Orwellian overtones that suggest an invasion of
privacy. Cries of outrage have been heard from coast to coast, from
boardroom to chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbi Fernandez, a retiree from Granada Hills, said her first
reaction was, ``What nerve! How dare they invade my privacy. It's
very frightening to think that they would even consider something
like this _ going over people's accounts and seeing how they go
about their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has even reached the highest levels of government.
Ironically enough, John D. Hawke Jr., the comptroller of the
currency who came in shortly after the regulation was proposed, is
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has very serious doubts whether this regulation will go,''
said OCC spokesman Robert Garsson. ``The banks won't be employed as
cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers have pointed out they already file reports for cash
transactions of more than $10,000 in accordance with the Bank
Secrecy Act of 1974. They feel the current proposal will be far
more invasive because it will require them to look for patterns in
the way customers handle financial transactions and report activity
that deviates from the norm.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal does pass, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, has
introduced legislation that would kill it. Paul, a medical doctor,
was the Libertarian Party's 1988 presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The FDIC has received a record 130,000 comments about the
proposal, most of which are opposed to the measure. The other
agencies report getting several thousand of overwhelmingly negative
comments.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has made an unlikely alliance of both liberals and
conservatives, as the nation's two main trade groups representing
banks and thrifts have come out on the side of consumer groups
against the proposal as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Golinger, consumer program director for the California
Public Interest Group, a consumer watchdog, said the privacy breach
built into the proposed regulations is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is an unnecessary invasion of consumers'
privacy,'' he said. ``Banks will be coerced into looking into your
records whether you're a criminal or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks also are concerned because they'll be at a competitive
disadvantage since credit unions and brokerage firms won't have the
same restriction.
</P>
<P>
   America's Community Bankers, the Washington trade group
representing thrifts, said the policy would ``seriously breach
customer privacy rights, damage bank-customer relationships and
unnecessarily burden community banks.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrift group had a counterproposal: Instead, agencies should
target financial institutions that engage in riskier deposit
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Jim Eberle said law enforcement should look more
closely at the larger banks with international operations or
private banking practices for wealthy clients. He said it's more
likely that illegal activities such as money laundering will go
through them than the small thrift around the corner.

SHARPTON AND 27 OTHERS ARRESTED IN PROTEST OF THE DIALLO SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty-eight people, including the Rev. Al Sharpton,
were arrested Wednesday when a noon rally by more than a thousand
people against the police shooting of Amadou Diallo blocked traffic
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, which came almost a month after the Feb. 4
shooting, showed that public anger over Diallo's killing has not
dissipated and that the case has begun to attract a more varied
group of participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first protest I've ever been to because this has
gone on for far too long,'' said Carolyn Cooper, 45, a Citibank
employee who said she took the day off. ``It shouldn't be illegal
to be out on the street if you're a black man or a black woman.
We're here on Wall Street because, unfortunately, you have to hurt
people in their pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said during the rally that he was planning to get
arrested and called for others to commit acts of civil
disobedience. He and 10 protesters then sat in the intersection of
Broadway and Wall Street and blocked traffic. Seventeen others
blocked the doors and marched inside the offices of Merrill Lynch
in the World Financial Center.
</P>
<P>
   All 28 were arrested because they refused to move, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said at police headquarters. All were
given summonses for criminal trespass or disorderly conduct and
released, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of Sharpton's call for civil disobedience,
Safir replied, ``The Rev. Sharpton apparently just wants to get his
picture in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests of the shooting have occurred almost daily since
Diallo, an unarmed street peddler and immigrant from Guinea, in
West Africa, was killed by four plainclothes officers in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   And at least once, protesters have driven past the officers'
homes in a silent procession.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury is now considering whether to indict the officers.
Police officials have said the officers thought Diallo was reaching
for a gun. They fired 41 shots, 19 of which hit him.
</P>
<P>
   If indicted, they could face charges ranging from criminally
negligent homicide to second-degree murder.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The four officers are: Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard
Murphy and Kenneth Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the demonstration got under way on Wall Street, a
52-year-old employee of Fordham University was arrested for making
threatening phone calls to Carroll's home in Suffolk County, on
Long Island. The suspect, Eric J. Johnson, of Brooklyn, was charged
with two counts of aggravated harassment and was released on bail,
police said.

struggling with a left shoulder injury that required surgery last
April. Seven months of recovery followed, and today Norman's
shoulder is sound and he has returned to the game with a more
appreciative perspective.
</P>
<P>
   So as he prepared for the Doral-Ryder Open, which begins
Thursday at Doral Golf Resort &AMP; Spa here, Norman insisted that no
matter how he performs this year, he will enjoy the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am under zero pressure,'' said Norman, who has won at Doral
three times, most recently in 1996. ``I can stop right now and
everything I have done in the game of golf, good or bad, has been
great. Yes, I haven't achieved everything that I wanted to achieve.
But I gather 99.9 percent in the world feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I play now, I don't go back to prove that this guy was
wrong, because he wrote this about me,'' Norman said. ``I am not
going to do that anymore. I just want to do the things I do and
enjoy them. I have a totally unfiltered approach toward my game and
toward my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it will be interesting to see if Norman, a two-time winner
of the British Open, can at age 44 return to the pinnacle of his
profession. Because of last year's inactivity, Norman has dropped
to 31st in the world golf ranking. And 1998 was his first year
without a victory on the PGA Tour since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   However, Norman has fond memories of Doral and he will be one of
the marquee names at this week's tournament, where Michael Bradley
is the defending champion. Four of the top 10 players in the world
will play here this week: Ernie Els, Vijay Singh, Nick Price and
Justin Leonard. Still, several of the world's best are taking this
week off after competing at last week's Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship. Tiger Woods is not playing this week, nor is
David Duval, Davis Love III or Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Els was also going to skip Doral, but after losing in the first
round last week to Paul Azinger, Els changed his mind. ``I decided
early Friday that I was going to come down here and play,'' said
Els, a South African who has a home in Orlando, Fla. ``It is only a
two or three hour drive down here, so actually it worked out
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman is hoping for a perfect weekend, which would mean winning
again. He survived one round of match play last week, taking his
opening-round match against John Cook. But Norman was defeated in
the second round by Eduardo Romero of Argentina after squandering a
3-up lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the players' perspective, we enjoyed the match play
format,'' Norman said. ``The TV ratings were high as well, which
goes to show that you don't need the name players in a final to
stir up interest.''
</P>
<P>
   While Norman said his swing is pain free, it takes extra time
for him to warm up and to prevent stiffness after a round. ``It
takes a good 50 minutes,'' said Norman of his preround warm-up. ``I
need somebody else to grab hold of my shoulder and move it around.
I can't do that myself. As long as I'm playing, somebody has to be
there in the morning.''

50 YEARS OF PERPS, WITH SPEED AND FLASH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just a sampling of the ``perp walks'' that Marty
Lederhandler has known and loved as The Associated Press'
longest-working photographer:
</P>
<P>
   Willie Sutton, the notoriously slippery bank robber, 1952.
Lederhandler snapped his picture at a Brooklyn precinct house after
he was arrested for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, 1951. They were being moved from the
federal courthouse at Foley Square to the old Federal House of
Detention. (``There wasn't much of a crowd around,'' he said.
``Isn't that strange?'')
</P>
<P>
   Col. Rudolf I. Abel, the Soviet spy released from prison in the
United States and swapped in 1962 for Francis Gary Powers, the
American pilot shot down over the Soviet Union. (``It was in
Brooklyn. I can't even remember the year of that one.'')
</P>
<P>
   David R. Berkowitz, arrested and later convicted of being the
Son of Sam night-stalker, 1977. (``That was a mob scene.'')
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if there is any working photographer in New York
qualified to wax nostalgic for the ``perp walk'' _ the hallowed,
and now heavily litigated, police rite in which a ``perpetrator''
is walked past waiting news cameras _ it is Lederhandler, 81 and
still working full time.
</P>
<P>
   He has been at the job for 63 years, since Fiorello H. La
Guardia was mayor and film came on plates, not rolls.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers when the gantlet of lenses outside a station house
was _ he swears _ almost dignified. No jostling television cameras
or jousting microphone booms. No one shouting, ``Did you really do
it?'' or ``Give us a smile,'' or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he said Wednesday, pausing between jobs over a
stack of buttermilk pancakes, ``every once in a while some guy they
were leading out would try to kick at you or spit.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly it was a cooperative prisoner and a stony-faced row
of newspaper photographers, with ``suits and hats and shirts and
ties'' and boxy Speed Graphic cameras. ``We all had the same lenses
those days,'' he said, ``and everybody would stand 8 or 10 feet
back, and nobody was pushing or shoving.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, depending on the notoriety of the suspect, perp
walks can resemble riots with lots of expensive electronic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a U.S. District judge in Manhattan issued a ruling
that caused the police to put them at least temporarily on hold.
The judge, Allen G. Schwartz, said they were a violation of privacy
rights, and he allowed a Manhattan doorman to sue the city for
embarrassment he suffered because of a televised perp walk after
his arrest on larceny charges. The charges were later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In one form or another, the ritual had been around since before
Theodore Roosevelt was the city's police commissioner. But if it is
the end of an era for Lederhandler, he does not seem to mourn it.
</P>
<P>
   He spends no time chewing over the implication for the freedom
of the press or the rights of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, you're supposed to try to get the picture. So
you're fighting to try to get him in a car window or someplace.
You're stalking him, if he's available for stalking.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the perp walk, it's, `He'll be out in 10 minutes.' You
line up. He comes out and into the car, and you've got your
picture. Nice. As far as the civil rights go, well, I don't know
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lederhandler and his late brother, Harry Leder, who was the
chief photographer for United Press International for more than
three decades, grew up in Brooklyn in the Depression and fell in
love with old folding cameras
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Simon, a Romanian immigrant, worked for an
auctioneer who sold off bankrupt properties. As a teen-ager,
Lederhandler helped out by working at a pharmacy, but he and his
brother spent more time in the pharmacy's basement, which they made
into a darkroom.
</P>
<P>
   They both longed to break into the fast, smoke-clouded world of
New York news photographers, so they got jobs as film messengers
and then photographers' assistants, carrying the bulky film plates
to theater doors or ringsides or station houses. ``Even that was a
glamorous thing, being down ringside at a Joe Louis fight or
Marciano. Or getting to see Maurice Chevalier.''
</P>
<P>
   As a messenger, Lederhandler quickly displayed the kind of wits
that landed him a job as a photographer after World War II:
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to take film by taxi from Associated Press
headquarters in Rockefeller Center to the Daily News Building on
East 42d Street. Instead, he ran. ``Forty-sixth and Madison, I run
into the Roosevelt Hotel, take the tunnel into Grand Central,
across the terminal to Lexington and Forty-Third, and make a right
toward the building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was faster,'' he said, and then smiled slightly: ``And they
still paid me a dollar for the fare. I was making $12 a week at the
time. Some weeks, I doubled my salary.''
</P>

NEW YORK CITY EXPANDING CAMPAIGN AGAINST OWNERS OF UNLEASHED DOGS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 9 a.m., give or take a minute or two, and a
dozen dog owners at 91st Street in Riverside Park grimly snapped
leashes in place Wednesday, remembering the scene the morning
before, when mounted officers had given chase and apprehended those
who had missed the on-the-leash deadline.
</P>
<P>
   One dog owner, Judith Schwarz, spotted two mounted Parks
Department rangers waiting just outside the park and loudly
imitated a trumpet heralding a cavalry charge. ``They're keeping
the park safe from dog terrorists!'' she shouted, referring to the
term used by the parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern, for those who
flout leash laws.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rangers, J.D. Cohen, reminded Ms. Schwarz that dogs
are allowed to run free _ in certain areas of the park _ only
between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m., and informed her that she had not made
it under the 9 a.m. wire.
</P>
<P>
   Grudgingly, Ms. Schwarz gave her name and address, then
gratuitously volunteered her Social Security number, blood type and
the names of her pooches, Roxanne and Blue. Not to mention a
pointed comment or two about arbitrary abuses of power in a city
she called Giulianiville. Cohen responded by handing over a summons
that fined her $100 for each dog.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth day in the city's campaign to bring errant
hounds, poodles and spaniels to heel. The city is increasing
enforcement, raising fines and creating a corps of civilian
informers who will carry portable phones to report violations of
the leash law. While neighboring police precincts may soon become
involved, the initial crackdown is concentrating on Central and
Riverside Parks, where, the Parks Department estimates, dogs cause
$250,000 in damage annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is directed against a small minority of willful,
arrogant dog owners,'' Stern said. ``They're like die-hard National
Rifle Association members.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA comment almost seemed calculated to infuriate the dog
folks, who like to portray themselves as embattled civil
libertarians with furry best friends. ``They're acting like the
Gestapo,'' said a man who said he feared municipal retribution and
would identify himself only as Lou. He did, however, reveal the
full name of his beagle: Wonder Dog.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say the crackdown appears to be succeeding. A
survey by Parks Department workers in Riverside Park found that on
the first three Saturdays of February combined, about 200 of the
300 dogs in the park were off leash.
</P>
<P>
   But last Saturday just 13 of 97 were, said Ed Skylar, a Parks
Department spokesman. The department said that more than 200
summonses had been issued since the effort began Friday, compared
with 1,005 in all of last year. ``People obey the law when they
have to,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the commissioner said, the crackdown was drawing
support, with mail running 3-to-1 in favor of the tougher
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage of the campaign will be to pass out portable
phones to volunteers, who will be instructed to try to persuade
people to leash their dogs before tattling on them. Other parks,
the first of which will probably be Prospect Park in Brooklyn, will
also be concentrated on, Stern said.

GADGETS, GIZMOS AND GEAR: NEW SNOW STUFF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Wyo. , Calif.)  (nk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flashy new shaped skis or lightweight snowboard boots can add
pizzazz to a trip to the slopes. But other innovations _ ones you
may not know to look for _ can be as enticing as a fast chairlift
on a slow day.
</P>
<P>
   SEE AND SKI: Following in your own footsteps on the snow may be
one way to try something new. Maptrek, a fledgling computer map
company in Vail, Colo., has been testing a new satellite-based
topographic system this winter. It enables resort guests to see
their route over hill and dale, see how many vertical feet they
skied, how fast and how many miles.
</P>
<P>
   For $20 a day, a skier attaches a small, coin-sized antenna to a
jacket collar. A wire leads to a pocket transmitter about the size
of a pager, which logs personal tracking information. At the end of
the day, the unit is taken back to Maptrek's ski area office and
downloaded into a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The resort customer receives a color-coded, three-dimensional
topographic map with individualized pacing information. But the
setup may not be for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for the additional information it gives you,'' said
Rene Lemble, a ski instructor at Vail. ``We find that people who
come here do it once or twice to see how they did. But it's mostly
for intermediate and advanced skiers. Beginner skiers usually don't
travel more than 200 yards in a day, so it's not that helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   By mounting an antenna at the 10,000-foot peak of Vail Mountain,
the company is able to use the worldwide global positioning system.
Sailors and hikers already are using the tracking system, which was
developed for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Hoot Gibson, president of Maptrek, said recently that his
company plans to make the system available next season at five
other mountain resorts: Northstar at Tahoe, and at Heavenly in
California; Copper Mountain and Beaver Creek, Colo., and at Grand
Targhee, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, the company's Internet site is:
www.maptrek.com.
</P>
<P>
   IN YOUR FACE: A sub-zero day on a mountain can drain the body of
warmth faster than most clothes can keep it warm. But Bruce
McCormick, an inventor from Houston, has come up with a face mask
that works like steam heat in a duct system.
</P>
<P>
   Referred to as the Polar Wrap Exchanger, the head gear looks
like a standard face warmer. But the design is deceiving. Inside
the mask is a patented system of copper coils that its manufacturer
calls a thermal exchange device. A series of tiny inner chambers
regulate the flow and velocity of air breathed in and then exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanger collects the warm, moist exhaled air, then
recycles it. The reused portion, about 8 percent of the previous
air intake, warms and adds moisture to the next cold breath of dry
air that is inhaled. ``It works best when you're sitting in a cold
chairlift,'' McCormick said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you're really exposed to the cold,'' he said.
``You have a high exposure to body heat loss until you get off, and
start creating body warmth by propelling yourself down the
mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Miracle, new products editor for Skiing magazine, said
recently that he had tested the Polar Wrap Exchanger hood this past
January at Loveland, Colo., ski area. ``It definitely does what
it's supposed to,'' Miracle said. ``It certainly is the most
effective warming gear I've ever worn. But its ability to eliminate
a skier from getting cold may be far-fetched.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two models available and the price ranges from about
$60 to $67.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, or to order, call (800) 967-WRAP.
</P>
<P>
   STONE THERAPY: There's also a way to combat apres-ski shivers. A
new kind of massage, LaStone Therapy, is appearing at spas in many
mountain resort towns. Developed in large part by Mary Hannigan, a
massage therapist in Tucson, Ariz., the technique uses heated
stones to treat tense, overworked muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the spa, therapists use as many as 50 stones heated
to a temperature of about 140 degrees. About 20 other stones,
usually made of rounded and polished marble, are cooled to the
point of freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered from river beds and quarries, the mostly basalt stones
are smooth and flat so they do not irritate the skin. Therapists
use body oil to move individual hot rocks over various muscle
groups. A final touch with cold marble at the neck and spine often
finishes the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat opens the circulatory system, and the cold
constricts, keeping everything flexible,'' said Lisa DeKoster, spa
director at the Vail Athletic Club in Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The LaStone Internet site is: www.lastonetherapy.com.

WANDERING WITH TAKEMITSU IN HIS GARDENS OF THE MIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, who died three years ago,
often likened his pieces to gardens: specifically Japanese gardens,
made to be admired at a strolling pace, with frequent stops to
enjoy, perhaps, the foliage of a tree, or a flower, or a spider's
web, or a distant view.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the analogy fits almost everything he wrote, whatever
the style (and there were many), but his music's customary slow
andante may have come from a deeper inkling into how we listen.
</P>
<P>
   The irregular amble is the tempo of one thought supplanting
another, each lasting for the normal extent of time we think of as
the present, which is about two or three seconds. Music behaving
this way can seem to go at its own pace, because it is going at
ours.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing hurries it on from loitering at the speed of our
unfocused expectation. There are no commanding rhythms, no
structural requirements to be met. We hear this, then something
like this, then something like the last this. By comparison with
Takemitsu's music, Debussy's sounds fiercely directed.
</P>
<P>
   Takemitsu produced a large output, especially of orchestral
scores; in his last 10 years alone he wrote 14 pieces for large
orchestra and others for smaller groupings. Since his death, CDs
have made most of these works available, though his last orchestral
piece, ``Spectral Canticle,'' with violin and guitar soloists, has
yet to be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are also gaps where the works of the 1960s
and early 70s are concerned, and it is often among these that the
best of Takemitsu is to be found.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, in the 50s, Takemitsu became an admirer of
Debussy and Messiaen, who were the main influences on his
compositions of that decade (including the 1957 Requiem for
strings, with which he made his name), and who returned to guide
much of the music he wrote from the mid-70s on.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he drew on more recent composers, especially John
Cage (in a couple of graphic scores of 1962) and Pierre Boulez, and
contributed a lot himself to the exploration of new orchestral
sonorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter'' (1971) is a wonderful example: a skein of frosty
sounds _ sustained string harmonics, percussion spangles, echoes
across the orchestra _ that gets right away from the
Debussy-Messiaen sound world that Takemitsu loved so much to
re-enter.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the pieces unavailable at present, though a 1981
recording by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony under the direction of
Hiroyuki Iwaki turns up in secondhand stores. Of other works from
the middle period, a new release by the same orchestra (Denon CO
18073), with Yuzo Toyama conducting, offers two: ``Coral Island''
(1962), a beautiful if over-Boulezian cycle of orchestral images
and interleaved songs with high soprano (the excellent Rie Hamada),
and ``The Dorian Horizon'' (1966), a striking set of glassy
surfaces created by two groups of strings playing without vibrato.
</P>
<P>
   Also on this CD are a sumptuous recording of ``A Flock Descends
Into the Pentagonal Garden'' (1977), which is the richest piece
Takemitsu produced as he was going back into his French-Japanese
garden of choice, and a fine performance of ``Archipelago S.''
(1993), for a chamber orchestra in separated groups. If you want
only one Takemitsu CD, this, of those in print, is the one to get.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth in a Takemitsu series on Denon, all with the
Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony, and all with excellent notes, by the
composer and by Japanese scholars. Another (Denon CO 79441)
contains what is probably still Takemitsu's most famous piece _
``November Steps,'' with shakuhachi (recorder) and biwa (lute),
written for the New York Philharmonic in 1967 _ though by no means
his best.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are Requiem and two works from the 80s: the violin
concerto ``Far Calls, Coming, Far!'' (one of several quotes from
Joyce's ``Finnegans Wake'' the composer used as titles) and
``Visions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Archipelago S.'' is included on a second new CD, from Oliver
Knussen and the London Sinfonietta (Deutsche Grammophon 453 495-2),
where it is accompanied by other works from Takemitsu's final
decade or so. During this period, the Debussy-Messiaen mixture
thinned out in favor of Debussy, and the biggest work on Knussen's
album, ``Quotation of Dream,'' for large orchestra with two solo
pianos (here played by Paul Crossley and Peter Serkin), has
figments from ``La Mer'' enveloped in luxurious swathes of original
music.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the piece sounds like Debussy being composed and
taken apart again, but generally the effect is to make one wish one
were listening to Debussy uninterruptedly, preferably with Knussen
conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces on this disk, especially ``Archipelago S.'' and the
related ``How Slow the Wind,'' are the better for making their
Debussy references more subtly and maybe unintentionally: the music
just seems to be bobbing in the wavelets around the edges of
Debussy's sea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Archipelago S.'' is the strongest work here, partly because of
its sparer textures and the return of unusual instrumental effects,
which Takemitsu had mostly avoided since the mid-70s. The recording
captures its spatial layout better than the Denon, but the Japanese
orchestra's performance is equally fine, and its mixed program
clinches the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the top Takemitsu CD are more likely to be fueled
by a glorious and highly musical release featuring the clarinetist
Richard Stoltzman (RCA 09026-62537-2). Stoltzman is the soloist in
another orchestral work from Takemitsu's final few years,
``Fantasma/Cantos,'' and he performs with New York colleagues in
various chamber pieces: the trickling ``Waterways'' (1977), with
harps, vibraphones, piano and strings; the inward ``Quatrain II''
(1976), played here by the musicians for whom it was written
(Stoltzmann, Serkin, Ida Kavafian and Fred Sherry), and one of this
gentle composer's more robust compositions, ``Waves'' (1976), for
clarinet, horn, trombones and bass drum.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber pieces for more traditional combinations come on a new
CD featuring splendid young Japanese performers, the Ensemble Kai
(Bis 920). Here Takemitsu's two string quartets make a sharp
contrast: ``Landscape I'' (1961) is in the taut, vibrato-free style
of ``The Dorian Horizon,'' and ``A Way a Lone'' (1980) unfolds in
generous modal phrases, warmly supported.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rocking Mirror Daybreak'' (1983), for two violins, shows
that Takemitsu did not entirely abandon his taste for the nervy
sounds of harmonics and nonvibrato playing, and this pleasant
compilation covers almost the composer's entire career, from 1951
(``Distance de Fee'' for violin and piano) to 1993 (the piano trio
``Between Tides'').
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the gap between these works is not so wide, for
Takemitsu's life had looped back, and the most extraordinary pieces
were all in the interim. (Even at his most extraordinary, though,
he was capable of a much more conventional style, notably in his
choral music, a disappointing segment of his output, and his film
scores, of which he wrote nearly 100, many of them recorded on
Japanese labels.)
</P>
<P>
   The piano music tells the same story, of a journey from close to
Messiaen (``Litany'' and ``Uninterrupted Rest,'' both essentially
works of the 50s) through fresh, vivid directions (``Piano
Distance'' of 1961, ``For Away'' of 1973) back to the
Messiaen-Debussy neighborhood (especially in ``Les Yeux Clos'').
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Piano Distance'' _ full of textural contrasts and
breathtaking pedal effects _ is by far the most exciting piece in
this repertory, ``For Away'' is fine, too, and there are a couple
of gems among the late pieces in ``Rain Tree Sketch'' and ``Rain
Tree Sketch II.''
</P>
<P>
   At least six pianists have made all-Takemitsu disks, but only
three are serious contenders: Kazuoki Fujii (Fontec FOCD 3109),
Roger Woodward (Etcetera KTC 1103) and Peter Serkin (RCA
09026-68595-2). Fujii adds an attractive harpsichord piece, ``Rain
Dreaming,'' and Woodward offers a big improvisation based on two
graphic scores.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are worth hearing; both have a keen sense of the
abrupt, though Fujii is all lightness and brightness, where
Woodward tends to be heavy and, at times, melodramatic. There are
also notable disagreements as to tempo: Fujii plays ``Rain Tree
Sketch'' almost twice as fast as Mr. Woodward, and it works both
ways.
</P>
<P>
   But not only is Serkin's collection more complete (``Rain Tree
Sketch II'' was composed after the other musicians made their
recordings), his playing is more thorough, more considered and more
nuanced. New listeners could also start here.

HE'S RUDE, HE LIES, HE'S A LOT LIKE BASIL FAWLTY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CHARLES STRUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Larroquette has found a fresh host body for his patented
brand of blowhard. In the 1980s, Larroquette won four Emmys for his
portrayal of the pompous, philandering assistant prosecutor Dan
Fielding in ``Night Court.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, in the new CBS sitcom ``Payne,'' he is an innkeeper
in northern California who views his wife, his employees and his
guests as impediments to his ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the ultimate guest,'' Larroquette explained.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to be. Why should Larroquette's character, Royal
Payne, be any more comfortable than the demanding lodgers he is
forced to tolerate, the wife he sometimes fears and the staff that
either outsmarts him or inadvertently provokes his anger?
</P>
<P>
   Larroquette, whose most recent run was as the sensitive St.
Louis bus station manager of ``The John Larroquette Show'' on NBC,
has transformed himself into a fashion plate with silk pocket
square and wavy silver hair whose false sincerity helps to keep his
middle-age rage in check. That and his ability to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Royal will lie to cover up almost anything: from health-code
infractions to the sudden death of his chef to the origin of the
diamond lapel pin he gives his wife, Constance (JoBeth Williams), a
gift that proves almost as much a surprise to Royal as it does to
her.
</P>
<P>
   The pin, it turns out, belongs to a guest, who explains that her
grandfather received it as a gift from J. Edgar Hoover. Returning
it, rather than appropriating it, would seem to be the better
course. But Royal is desperate to find a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more convenient for him to continue to lie,''
Larroquette said pleasantly at a midtown Manhattan hotel last week
during a promotional tour for the new show, which evolved directly
from ``Fawlty Towers,'' the BBC series starring John Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   The first two episodes will be broadcast next Monday at 9:30 and
on March 17 at 8:30 p.m. The season's seven remaining episodes will
settle into their regular time slot on Wednesday, March 24 at 8
p.m., just before ``The Nanny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but when we started `Night Court' someone asked me
to describe Dan Fielding,'' Larroquette recalled. ``I told him he
was a cross between Barney Fife and Basil Fawlty. So this character
has been in my head for 16 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Cleese's Basil was manic in the extreme _ the epitome of
British aplomb one moment, the epitome of vicious British put-down
the next _ Larroquette's Royal is unctuous, libidinous and hapless
in a somewhat more relaxed West Coast way.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he and his co-executive producers, John Peaslee
and Judd Pillot, are conscious of the inevitable comparison with
the British version, which was an icon of British television and a
popular rerun on public broadcasting stations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be afraid of it,'' Larroquette said. ``I don't have
the time. I can't possibly imitate them. I've taken the template,
but I inhabit a wholly different part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fawlty Towers,'' he pointed out, was originally only six
episodes of about 35 minutes each, without commercial interruption.
The Cleese model was more like French farce, and it was exhausting.
But the clamor to extend the show was so great that Cleese made six
more, then stopped, having run out of steam. ``Payne'' is a
standard American half-hour: about 21 minutes plus commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be overwhelming on a weekly basis to see that kind of
maniacal freneticism in every episode over a whole season,''
Larroquette said. ``We can't be doing full-out farce every week.
What we have to do is explore the family stuff'' _ meaning the
Paynes' marriage and their relationship to the staff _ ``to keep
the audience interested.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, besides the Paynes, the regular cast consists of a
virginal blond chambermaid called Breeze (Julie Benz) and a bellhop
of uncertain nationality named Mo (Rick Batalla). ``Fawlty Towers''
aficionados will recognize parallels to Polly, the desk clerk, and
Manuel, the jittery bellhop from Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, British series adapted for American audiences
have had mixed success. ``Sanford and Son,'' ``All in the Family''
and ``Three's Company'' were among the long-running favorites. More
recently, though, the transplanted crime series ``Cracker'' failed
to survive, as did the sophomoric high jinks of ``Men Behaving
Badly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fawlty Towers'' was reincarnated twice before on American
television, the producers said, but met with failure. The first
series, ``Amanda's,'' with Bea Arthur, went down after a few months
in 1983. ``Snavely Manor'' with Harvey Korman never got beyond the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time when the networks were less willing to take a
chance,'' Pillot said. ``They pulled way back. After every line,
Harvey would say, `Just kidding.' It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne,'' he said, was intended to be a ``darker, edgier''
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Cleese as Basil Fawlty was clownish, manic, flailing,''
Pillot said. ``John Larroquette as Royal Payne is more tortured,
more annoyed, more put upon. He's more 90s in a way. More demons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the challenge of this creatively is taking a classic,
bowing to it and giving it the honor it deserves, but then going
our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps with one more nod to Basil Fawlty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our show is successful,'' Larroquette said, ``we've set up
a situation that will be ideal. In the town there is a rival hotel
called the Sand Dune, which is the `perfect' hotel. And if we get
established, I want John Cleese to come and be the owner of the
Sand Dune. And be'' _ here Larroquette draws out his words very
slowly _ ``the nicest man in the world.''

WHERE FILMS CAN REST EASY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't your typical Al Pacino movie, this small film about a
celebrity-obsessed thug that the box-office heavyweight had
lovingly acted in and dug deep into his pockets to produce.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``The Local Stigmatic'' never enjoyed financial
success, period, having landed on a dusty shelf after Pacino, who
spent four years editing and re-editing the film after it was shot
in 1985, failed to find a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino was loath to abandon the work he considers his ``calling
card.'' So he did what a top-flight filmmaker might have done: he
donated it to the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film would not have had a home otherwise,'' Pacino said.
``It meant that a movie that I believed in could be viewed without
the burden of commercial success.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacino, although known as an actor, understood what a generation
of filmmakers are only too aware of: that their fragile life's work
could deteriorate unchecked _ and maybe not even be missed _ in a
dank corner of some movie studio storage closet.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Museum of Modern Art comes in. Since 1996, the
museum has campaigned to rescue contemporary works foundering in
back rooms and warehouses, and to fill in a gap in their collection
in the process. ``200 for 2000'' is exactly what it sounds like:
the museum's goal of adding to its collection 200 films by worthy
filmmakers by the end of the year 2000. With less than two more
years to go, the museum is not quite to the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   That the most esteemed directors are often the most generous is
something that museum officials have counted on _ since the film
department was formed in the golden age of the silver screen in
1935.
</P>
<P>
   John Hay Whitney, who produced ``Gone With the Wind'' with David
O. Selznick, served as the first chairman of the museum's film
library, and in 1936, he sent the curator Iris Barry to Hollywood
to urge industry leaders to donate prints _ a radical concept at
the time but one to which the likes of Harold Lloyd, D.W.
Griffiths, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Walt Disney and Mary Pickford
hearkened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good friends to the department, and that is a
tradition we have continued ever since,'' said Mary Lea Bandy, the
museum's chief film curator. ``Because, after all, our collection
is part of a much larger art collection that is trying to represent
the finest works of art of the 20th century in a very broad and
deep way.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 16,000 titles spanning the century of cinema, the
museum boasts one of the finest collections in the world. It is up
there with the Pacific Film Archives in Berkeley, Calif., the UCLA
Film and Television Archives in Los Angeles, the George Eastman
House in Rochester, the Library of Congress and the American Film
Institute, which houses its collection at the library but which
will occasionally pass along a film to another archive.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern's collection ranges from the kinetoscope subjects of
Thomas Edison and D.W. Griffiths to recent films like ``Fargo'' and
``The Bridges of Madison County,'' from the mainstream to the
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1996, these films have been housed in the museum's
state-of-the-art, 36,000-sqare-foot Celeste Bartos Film
Preservation Center in Hamlin, Pa., with storage for the next 30
years, and 38 acres on which to build.
</P>
<P>
   What the museum doesn't have, however, is a comprehensive
collection representing the best of post-World War II American
cinema. ``It takes a long time to acquire quality prints that
interest us, simply because of availability, rights and the cost of
making the print,'' Ms. Bandy said. ``So you have to be extremely
patient, which we think we are, because we're acquiring for the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   In the best possible scenario, the museum receives a completely
new or mint-condition print, struck directly from the negative. But
the museum is often presented with a print in good condition that
has been shown before, or a worn print that is valuable to the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some acquisitions are badly deteriorated _ especially in the
case of certain films made before the 1950s and shot on
nitrate-based stock, which is so flammable it can no longer be
projected. (Movies today are filmed on stock called, appropriately,
``safety acetate,'' or on polyester.) Archivists then copy
nitrate-based films onto acetate stock or preserve the original
color separation to make a print that the museum can project.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of who actually owns the print.
Usually it's the studio, which typically has a contract stating
that it owns the rights to the film, in perpetuity, on all current
media and any media yet to be developed. Depending on his clout, a
director may negotiate ownership of the negative or the right to
dispose of prints at will.
</P>
<P>
   Independent films are in a more precarious position, with
production companies often set up as a one-shot entity for a film.
The company owns the rights to the film, but doesn't necessarily
have the funding _ or the staying power _ to pay for storage fees
years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   And because an independent company will strike fewer prints than
a major studio, which may strike thousands, their cost per film is
higher _ somewhere in the tens of thousands of dollars for a single
print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that studios don't care,'' said Leonard Maltin, the
film critic and historian. ``Rather, the number of films being
produced on a monthly basis that would have to be archived is
overwhelming, both financially and in terms of manpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the idea that there ought to be independent
institutions who serve as caretakers comes in,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For MOMA's ``200 for 2000,'' directors have rallied to the task.
Martin Scorsese, a proponent of restoration and preservation who
mounted a campaign for better film stock after he saw his 1980
``Raging Bull'' wither, has donated most of his works.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he also sponsored the restoration of Jean-Luc Godard's
1963 masterpiece, ``Le Mepris'' (``Contempt''), a film that
inspired Scorsese's own career and that was acquired by the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen has donated most of his oeuvre, as have Clint
Eastwood and Oliver Stone. Pacino went back to the museum with
``Looking for Richard,'' his 1996 directorial debut. The estate of
Andy Warhol donated his films for safekeeping. The Rainer Werner
Fassbinder Foundation made a gift of some 20 features. And
independents like John Sayles, Hal Hartley and Joel and Ethan Coen
have welcomed the chance to have their works preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Directors may mourn their films. Ask Stone and he'll tally off
``The Doors,'' ``Talk Radio,'' ``Platoon'' and ``Salvador'' _ works
lost to either poor preservation or to bankruptcy proceedings,
where creditors are given license to dispose of a studio's
libraries by selling the films or even junking them.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly cautious, Stone has been contributing his work
since 1989. ``Every time there's a film, I've been trying to give a
mint-condition print to the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   That a director might not have a copy of his own film is often
unbelievable to the public, Maltin said. ``I think people believe
that the crisis of film preservation deals exclusively with films
of the past, and this is not so. The ultimate example is that when
they reissued `Grease' theatrically, they discovered that the
original negative was in appalling condition and was in need of
major rescue work, including the sound track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `But I just saw it on TV or on video,''' he added.
``What they don't really understand is that unless you can project
that film on a movie screen in a theater the way it was first
shown, it doesn't really exist in its original form. You can have a
perfectly wonderful video copy, but it's a derivative.''

 `NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES': SPECTACULARLY REALIZED TENNESSEE WILLIAMS

   NEW YORK _ ``My next play will be simple, direct and terrible _
a picture of my own heart. There will be no artifice in it. I will
speak the truth as I see it ... It will be myself without
concealment or evasion and with a fearless unashamed frontal
assault upon life that will leave no room for trepidation ... (It
will be) a passionate denial of sham and a cry for beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams wrote these lines in his journal in a mood of
``manic elation'' on Easter Sunday 1939. Having recently won a
special Group Theater award of $100 for three sketches titled
``American Blues,'' he suddenly felt certified as a playwright. He
was reborn, as he seems to have been periodically throughout his
life as well as after.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was 28 and, in truth, his life of obscurity was about
to end. A year later he received his first major production with
the Theater Guild's staging of ``Battle of Angels.'' It was a
failure, but ``The Glass Menagerie'' followed in 1945, the first of
the succession of remarkable works that would secure his position
today as one of America's three greatest dramatists, with Eugene
O'Neill and Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tom: The Unknown Tennessee Williams,'' Lyle Leverich
describes the playwright's Easter message as ``a manifesto for all
the plays and stories to come.'' Yet the later work did not emerge
from a vacuum. It was preceded by a number of earlier plays, some
of which were produced by groups in and around St. Louis; others
were left unproduced and more or less forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of these unproduced ``lost'' plays, ``Not About
Nightingales,'' written in 1938 and rescued from the archives by
Vanessa Redgrave, that is now at Circle in the Square on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   As staged by Trevor Nunn, the artistic director of the Royal
National Theater in London, the production is so spectacularly
realized that it both serves the play and celebrates the Williams
career, for which it can be seen as a kind of gaudy preface.
</P>
<P>
   The New York production also represents an Anglo-American
collaboration of an especially rich kind. It is a joint venture of
the Royal National, where it was first seen last spring, the Alley
Theater in Houston, where it played in June, and the Moving
Theater, also based in London. The latter is the company founded by
Ms. Redgrave, her brother, Corin, and Kika Markham (who is married
to Redgrave) to produce plays that, among other things, ``reflect
the contradictions and the problems of the times we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not About Nightingales'' is not characteristic Tennessee
Williams. It wears its social-political concerns openly. Like the
Federal Theater Project's Living Newspapers of the time, it was
inspired by a true story: the scandal about the Philadelphia
County, Pa., prison where four inmates were murdered _ cooked alive
_ after being locked in a room lined with radiators turned up to
produce maximum heat.
</P>
<P>
   The play is so brutal that it occasionally appears to be an
over-the-top mega-``Big House'' movie, the sort that in the 1930s
could be made cheaply and fast and give studios like Warner
Brothers the reputation of being socially relevant.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``Not About Nightingales'' is also ``simple, direct and
terrible.'' Though its artifice is apparent, the ``cry for beauty''
is genuine and moving, expressed in characters and events made
familiar by the ``Big House'' genre. Had the play not been written
by the man who became Tennessee Williams, I'm not at all sure that
it would ever have received the attention that is currently being
lavished on it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Not About Nightingales'' is very much a Williams play. The
splendid production not only finds the work's theatrically vivid
life, it also deepens our appreciation of the playwright: how he
saw himself and how he dueled with his demons. In none of the great
plays that followed is there a graphic evocation of hell-on-earth
to match the one in ``Not About Nightingales,'' particularly as
staged by Nunn. The play's metaphors are not subtle, and neither is
the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the drama are early versions of two archetypal
Williams characters. Tom, the narrator and surrogate Williams
figure in ``The Glass Menagerie,'' appears here as Canary Jim
(Finbar Lynch), the trusty who pretty much runs the warden's office
and, as a result, is thought to be a stool pigeon by the other
inmates. Jim is a self-taught intellectual who reads Keats and
Spengler, lives uncaged in his mind, and survives by maintaining a
tight, humiliating control over his impulse to rebel.
</P>
<P>
   There also are the seeds of Big Daddy (``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof'') and Boss Finley (``Sweet Bird of Youth'') in Boss Whalen
(Corin Redgrave), the prison warden. He is a big, shrewd,
mean-tempered man, a bully, possibly psychotic, whose omnipotent
authority has a way of neutralizing and bewitching everyone around
him. This would include Eva (Sherri Parker Lee), the young woman
who, desperate for work, takes a job as his secretary. Though she
falls in love with Jim, she remains quite helpless when the often
sozzled warden directs his attentions toward her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not About Nightingales'' is heavy on narrative (never a
Williams specialty), being about the events leading up to an
explosion of primal forces when Boss Whalen tries to put down a
hunger strike by packing off a small group of ringleaders and
innocents to what is called ``the Klondike.'' This is a room,
specially fitted with steam radiators, where the temperature can be
raised to 150 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The time of the play remains fixed in 1938. The location of the
island prison is not identified, but it would seem to be the Deep
South. The fact that the inmates are not racially segregated has
less to do with reality than with nontraditional casting.
</P>
<P>
   There are several four-letter words in the dialogue (nothing by
today's standards of street talk), possibly added by Williams long
after completing the first draft. Certainly he could never have
expected to hear such words spoken from any stage in 1938. The
production's comparative purity of language and the nontraditional
casting set the play outside of time, giving perspective to the
playwright's vision: For all of its stereotypical characters and
manners borrowed from 1930s movies, ``Not About Nightingales'' is
announcing the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Elia Kazan's productions of ``A Streetcar Named
Desire,'' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ``Sweet Bird of Youth'' has
Williams been as well served by a director as he is here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nunn has so beautifully integrated the British and American
actors that you have to check the program to figure out their
nationalities. Redgrave, not seen on a New York stage in years, is
a riveting, almost charming redneck madman. Lynch, Redgrave's Irish
co-star, plays the seething poet Canary Jim with a quiet power that
has the effect of disciplining and making comprehensible the wildly
grotesque melodrama. He is the production's humane focal point.
</P>
<P>
   James Black, an American actor who has long been associated with
the Alley Theater, is very fine in what could have been an early
Jimmy Cagney role, that of Butch O'Fallon, the fast-talking con who
initially organizes the hunger strike. He even looks a bit like
Cagney. The role of Eva, the warden's secretary, is more a function
of the plot than a character, though Ms. Lee, an American actress,
lends her an urgently dramatic authority.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway's Circle in the Square is still the most awkward major
theater space in New York, the stage being long and narrow with the
audience placed around its three sides. There does not seem to be a
seat in the house for which some part of the stage isn't hidden, or
so far away that the action becomes unnecessarily obscure. If you
are sitting in the best seats, facing stage-center, with the two
other playing areas of the long rectangle on your left and right,
you watch what is going on as if at a tennis match.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn can't change the shape of the house. Yet he fills the stage
(sometimes allowing the action to spill over into the aisles) so
efficiently that the play remains coherent, while moving with the
speed of light, even when the sightlines are not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Salute Tennessee. Salute everyone responsible for this latest
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   `The Hothouse'
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hothouse,'' now being given a first-rate revival by the
Atlantic Theater Company, was never actually lost, but Harold
Pinter, who wrote it in 1958, put it aside to mull over and went on
to write ``The Caretaker.'' He didn't get back to ``The Hothouse''
until 1979, and directed its first London production himself in
1980. It was first seen in New York in 1982 in the Trinity Square
Repertory Theater production directed by Adrian Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the to-ing and fro-ing? I'm not sure. As is demonstrated
in the Atlantic Theater production directed by Karen Kohlhaas,
``The Hothouse'' is clearly vintage Pinter. It is not in the league
with such later meditative full-length plays as ``The Homecoming,''
``Old Times'' and ``No Man's Land,'' but it is close to being as
substantially eerie, disorienting and witty as anything he wrote
earlier, excepting ``The Birthday Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting: a government institution, which could be some kind
of sanitarium or maybe a place where a fascist government
discreetly hides enemies of the state. We never meet the
``patients'' (who have numbers instead of names), only the members
of the staff headed by Roote (Larry Bryggman), a beady-eyed,
magnificently pompous bureaucrat with an extremely short attention

   The others include Miss Cutts (Kate Blumberg), Roote's mistress;
Gibbs (Jordan Lage), the institution's all-too-efficient No. 2 man;
Lush (Patrick Breen), who seems to be an almost normal fellow,
maybe because he drinks, and Lamb (Liam Christopher O'Brien), the
eager young newcomer to the staff. Poor kid. You know where lambs
are led.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of this one Christmas Day, everything goes wrong
for Roote: He learns that a male patient has been dead for some
time without his knowledge and that a female patient has had a
baby. He will not have it! Order is necessary if society is to
survive! He says that changes must be made, and then declaims at
length on why the rules should remain inviolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hothouse'' is classified as one of Pinter's political
plays, which it is. It is also very funny. Bryggman and his
associates are close to perfect. Note also Walt Spangler's severely
impersonal set, so brightly lighted by Robert Perry that we know
we're in a world that has lost its soul. It's a place without
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   `Bright Lights Big City'
</P>
<P>
   A lot of fine young talent is going nowhere in New York Theater
Workshop's attempt to make a ``Rent''-like musical out of ``Bright
Lights Big City,'' Jay McInerney's best-selling seminal novel on
his booze-swilling, drug-sniffing 1980s generation.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Michael Greif, who staged ``Rent.'' The cast is
eager to make good, and the music, by Paul Scott Goodman, has a
number of attractive things in it. Yet Goodman's book and lyrics,
as well as his own uneasy performance as the show's singing
narrator, keep getting in the way. His failure is not a surprise.
Even the movie adaptation couldn't make it, and it was written by
McInerney.
</P>
<P>
   A superficial read of the novel could spot the difficulty. What
happens to the story's unnamed hero as he goes from bad to worse,
attempting to manage life in Manhattan's fast lane, isn't as
important as how it is told. The distinctive voice, which speaks to
the reader in the second person, is full of hilarious, poignant
asides, digressions, opinions and apercus. These do not easily
translate into a musical in which most of the dialogue is sung.
</P>
<P>
   The accent and stage personality of the Scottish-born Goodman
are as alien to ``Bright Lights Big City'' as Steven Spielberg's
E.T. would be. Though his melodies often work, his lyrics assault
you with banalities. The sad thing: If, somehow, the book and
lyrics could be upgraded, the actors would certainly be able to
carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the noteworthy: Patrick Wilson, who plays the unstrung
hero, now named Jamie; Napiera Daniele Groves as his estranged
wife; Jerry Dixon as his wayward best friend, and Natascia Diaz as
the new woman in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it opened too soon.

OTUMFUO OPOKU WARE II, KING OF THE ASANTE, IS DEAD AT 89

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Otumfuo Opoku Ware II, the traditional king of the Asante
people, has died in his palace in Kumasi, Ghana, the ancient
capital of the Asante, who once ruled a powerful and complex
political confederation in West Africa. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Officials confirmed his death but did not give a date. Agence
France-Presse reported that an official announcement was being
withheld pending consultations on burial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deep veneration in which the king was held by millions
of Asante (also called Ashantis), the funeral is expected to draw
enormous crowds. In August 1995, when the king celebrated the 25th
anniversary of his reign, he was carried on a platform of gold
ornaments through a crowd of 70,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
   During his 29-year reign the king, a former lawyer, was the
spiritual and cultural leader of his people, and his power extended
into every-day life, particularly in the southern half of Ghana,
where Asante influence remains paramount.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled on land disputes, and judges whom he appointed settle
civil suits and imprison criminals. He received rents on royal
lands, and it was understood that no major development in Asante
lands could be undertaken without his approval. Most Ghanaian gold
mines are in these lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of earlier Asante rulers, who were uncles chosen
in a matrilineal system, he rarely appeared in public, and when he
did it was with mannered regal austerity. Decked in gold and
wrapped in the intricately woven kente cloth for which his people
are famous, he walked beneath a parasol held by aides to maintain a
``spiritual equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke mainly through a royal spokesman. As Adum Bawuah, an
Asante translator in New York, noted: ``The Asante don't respect
you if you speak too literally. In Twi, if you don't know how to
speak in parables, you're a nobody.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The king was very much a somebody, and was expert in drawing
allusions as required.
</P>
<P>
   The king was born into the royal family in Kumasi in 1910, and
attended an Anglican mission elementary school. After secondary
school he trained as a surveyor. In 1951 he left the country, then
still called the Gold Coast, for London, where he studied law. In
1962 he returned to an independent Ghana, where he practiced law
and served as commissioner of communications.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he was designated ambassador to Italy, but renounced the
post when the former king, Prempeh II, died in 1970 and he was
chosen to succeed him as Asantehene, the paramount leader. He
regarded his duties as Asantehene more demanding than those of
ambassador and at least equally important for the progress of
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   The king ascended not to a throne but to the Golden Stool of the
Asante. According to Asante lore, the stool had been plucked from
the sky by the first Asante king, Osei Tutu, who built a
confederation of village leaders that in the 18th century extended
from Ghana to Togo. The confederation traded gold, cloth, and
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 19th century, Britain and the Asante drifted into
hostility, and the confederation weakened. In 1896 the British
seized King Prempeh I and escorted him eastward across Africa to
exile in the Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean. The stool was hidden,
and four years later, on a visit to Kumasi, the British governor
general of the Gold Coast Colony, Sir Frederic Hodgson, became
outraged when the tribal elders did not allow him to sit on it as
the representative of Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Word of this incident aroused Asante to a bitterly fought
uprising that lasted nine months before the British suppressed it.
In 1902 Asante lands were formally incorporated into the Gold
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   When the Gold Coast began to move toward direct rule in the
1920s, the stool was recovered. Prempeh I was brought back from the
Seychelles in 1925 and given limited powers as a figurehead. When
he died in 1935, Prempeh II was crowned as Asantehene in a
traditional ceremony in which he was held aloft, hovering over the
golden stool, but not touching it.
</P>
<P>
   Ghana became independent in 1960, but the office of Asantehene
and the Asante institutions have outlasted the centralized,
pan-Africanist policies that the leader, Kwame Nkrumah, promoted.

BOSTON LET MO VAUGHN GO, BUT WHO WILL REPLACE HIM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Mo Vaughn wasn't in the Boston Red Sox spring
training camp Wednesday. Roger Clemens wasn't there, either. But
then neither was Ted Williams, nor Babe Ruth for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Let it be said that the Red Sox, even without each of the last
three players, did finish first in their league or division. And
someday maybe they will finish first again without Vaughn. But this
year is not likely to be that day.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Red Sox miss Mo Vaughn? Does the Green Monster live at
Fenway Park?
</P>
<P>
   ``We all loved him in here,'' said Mike Stanley, one of three
players who may replace Vaughn at first base, though not in the
lineup or in the hearts and minds of his former teammates. ``There
isn't a guy in here who would say a bad thing about him. He's a
gamer, somebody who pumped you up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many guys that when they yell at you in the
dugout and the clubhouse you listen to. He's one of them. Other
guys you kind of just say sit down and be quiet. If this was
hockey, he'd be the one with the `C' on his chest. We all listened
to what he had to say. His clubhouse presence will be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the 158 home runs and 480 RBIs that he produced
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is not in the Red Sox camp because he's in Tempe, Ariz.,
with the Anaheim Angels, the team that gave him $80 million for six
years after the Red Sox did everything they had to in order not to
sign him. And he left two years after the Red Sox let Clemens
leave, with General Manager Dan Duquette declaring that the
three-time Cy Young award winner was in the twilight of his career.
Now Clemens has five Cy Young awards and is pitching for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox eventually replaced Clemens with an expensive Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   And they wouldn't mind replacing Vaughn with Frank Thomas, but
the Chicago White Sox say they are not trading their first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Without Vaughn or a suitable successor, the Red Sox seem to have
virtually no chance to reach the playoffs, which means they would
end the 1900s with the one World Series championship they have had
since the 19th year of the 1900s. Meanwhile, Vaughn's absence has
already been noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot quieter camp than it's been in the past,'' said
John Valentin, Vaughn's former teammate with Boston and Seton Hall.
``He's a guy who talks a lot. He's vocal. He's a presence in the
clubhouse as well as on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The silence created by Vaughn's departure has generated spring
training talk that has focused on his absence and speculation about
how bad the Red Sox _ who made it to the post-season last year as
the American League wild-card team and then lost in the first round
_ will be without him. Bret Saberhagen, for one, has grown weary of
the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of hearing about Mo,'' the pitcher said. ``I really
am. Mo's with the Angels. There's nothing we can do. I think the
thing that will stop everyone from talking about Mo is if we go out
and start playing and winning. So I can't wait for the season to
get going and us winning games. Then we won't have to hear about Mo
anymore. I'm just worn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman could be excused if he has grown tired of being
asked about Vaughn. Accepting an inflated contract of $26 million
for four years, Offerman represents the only splash the Red Sox
made in the free-agent market this winter. His .315 batting average
last season, the best of his career, has had some people mistakenly
looking to him to help fill the hitting void.
</P>
<P>
   But Offerman said: ``I wasn't brought here to replace him.
People have to understand that. There's no way you can replace that
guy. We're two different players.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman will play first or second base or both, depending on
other players, such as Jeff Frye, who could play second if he's
healthy, and Stanley and Reggie Jefferson, who are prepared to play
first or serve as designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   By shuffling Offerman on the right side of the infield, the Red
Sox could be taking a chance on rendering him less productive on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say at this point if that would happen,''
Offerman said. ``At this point I don't think it will affect me
mentally. If it doesn't affect me mentally, I don't think I'd have
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams said it's too early for him to make out a
batting order, but he said he plans to open the season with a set
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to let these players know maybe what their role is to
start the season,'' he said. ``Those things can change, but you
have to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Red Sox have to begin life without Mo and the
offense he produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to replace the numbers,'' Valentin said. ``You can't
just replace 35 to 40 home runs and 100-some RBIs. But more
important, it's the presence in the lineup, too. Who he protects,
who he hits behind and in front of is very important, The opposing
teams are probably going to look at us a little differently without
him around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, Valentin added and others concurred, will have to
generate runs in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be a team that pitches well and plays good
defense,'' he said. ``We may not have the luxury of the three-run
homer at times. We may need to manufacture runs more. Not may. We
probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   But some baseball people aren't convinced that the Red Sox will
be able to do that. One veteran scout from another American League
team studied the Red Sox roster that adorned the wall of his
general manager's spring training office and said, ``That's the
weakest outfield I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the collection of Troy O'Leary, Darren Lewis,
Damon Buford, Trot Nixon and Midre Cummings. The group doesn't seem
to offer much potential for the kind of productive hitting the Red
Sox will need to overcome the loss of Vaughn's punch.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Nomar Garciaparra, their remarkable shortstop, on
his own. Thirty-five home runs and 122 RBIs is terrific production
from a shortstop, but that could become meaningless if Garciaparra
doesn't have support in the lineup.

INDIGNATION IN GERMANY OVER ARIZONA DEATH SENTENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY BETH WARNER  
 and JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Ilona Vogt was adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen years on death row is enough punishment,'' said the
50-year-old office manager and firm opponent of the death penalty.
``There are other ways to punish people besides killing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Arizona death row inmate and German citizen Walter
LaGrand has been heavily covered by the German media, including
major articles in some of the country's largest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been little public protest, the story has
stirred widespread indignation, some indifference and criticism of
politicians in both countries _ especially Arizona Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reaction among German politicians and political
commentators has been outrage at the frequent practice of the death
penalty in the United States. Acutely ashamed of the murderous
history of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, Germany abolished the death
penalty shortly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On German television Tuesday, government officials were
lamenting the fact that the United States was about to conduct
another execution even as Secretary of State Madeline Albright was
in China, complaining of human rights violations there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Washington, a State Department spokeswoman
questioned Germany's decision to take the LaGrand case to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Germany complained to the court that the United States violated
international law by not notifying German consular officials about
the arrest of Walter and Karl LaGrand 17 years ago on charges that
they murdered Kenneth Hartsock during a bungled bank robbery near
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   German officials say they could have ensured that the LaGrands
received better legal representation than what public defenders
provided in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany has known about the consular notification issue for a
number of years but did not raise it with us until very recently,''
State Department spokeswoman Maria Rudenski said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenski noted that while the LaGrands were born in Germany,
they came to the United States as young boys, spoke English
fluently and were familiar with the U.S. legal system.
</P>
<P>
   According to human rights watchdog Amnesty International, 72
citizens of 26 foreign countries are occupants of American death
rows. There are seven such individuals in Arizona, not including
Walter LaGrand, and three other German citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenski said one American citizen is on the death row of a
foreign country. She said an American man has been condemned to
death for pushing his wife off a roof to her death in a Caribbean
country. She was unable to obtain the country's name Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility of a country to notify the appropriate
consulate when a foreign national is arrested is spelled out in the
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenski said the State Department has taken steps to ensure
that the 50 states are aware of the Vienna Convention. She said,
for example, that in 1996 an assistant secretary for consular
affairs wrote to the governor of each state ``to remind them of
consular notification.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona officials have conceded that they did not follow the
Vienna Convention, but they said the LaGrands received all the
legal protections that are normally provided to U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of executions in the United States has stunned
many German observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes America, which regards itself as God's own country,
so devilishly fanatic about the death penalty?'' the influential
German magazine ``Der Spiegel'' asked last week.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine continued, ``Why are over 70 percent of all
Americans, including deeply religious fundamentalist Christians who
regard abortion as murder, in favor of government-sanctioned
killing? What draws politicians of every stripe to the death
penalty, although the rest of the civilized world has long turned
away from it?''
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans were offended at the decision this week of Gov.
Jane Hull to reject not only the German plea to spare LaGrand's
life but also to reject the recommendation of the state's own
clemency board that the execution be delayed 60 days so that
Germany could take the case to the International Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``What difference would it make to her if they waited for two
months?'' asked Sofia Fielhauer, a reporter for
``Berlinerzeitung,'' a Berlin daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it seems that she was acting for purely political
motives, to show how tough she is.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of Berlin, some Germans were critical of
their own politicians' intervention in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two aren't really even Germans,'' said house painter
Axel Heinisch, 38. ``I think that (German) politicians just wanted
to find something to make a stink about.''
</P>
<P>
   High school student Dario Goetzke was equally unmoved by the
fate of the LaGrands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They committed a crime in the United States, and I think they
should be punished there, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Dietmar Herz, a political science professor at the
University of Bonn, noted, most Germans are against the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is a major execution in the United States, the
issue of the death penalty will be discussed here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged by the failure of German political pressure to move
Gov. Hull, some Germans this week were suggesting an economic
boycott of the state that has long been a favorite vacation
destination.
</P>
<P>
   The current edition of Berlin's popular ``Tip'' magazine is
calling for a letter-writing campaign to pressure Hull to grant a
new trial to another German on death row. The object of the
magazine's concern is Berlin-born Debbie Milke, who is on death row
in the state prison in Perryville for the murder of her 4-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine wants its readers to sign a letter to Hull that
reads, ``Arizona is a beautiful state. You once said, `The people
here live from tourism.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But one does not like to vacation in a state of murderers.'' &QL;

BROADWAY'S `TITANIC' TO CLOSE AFTER FAILING TO TURN A PROFIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The producers of the musical ``Titanic'' announced
Wednesday that they would close the $10 million production, one of
the most expensive in Broadway history, on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Michael David, one of the lead producers, would not say what the
show's exact loss was, but he said the musical had earned back more
than half of its initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of the musical was informed of the decision after
Wednesday's matinee performance. After its final performance,
``Titanic'' will have played 804 performances and 28 previews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined a dignified leave-taking was better than staying
too long,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened in April 1997 amid a spate of reports of
technical problems with the mechanized set, which simulates the
musical's central dramatic event, the sinking of the luxury cruiser
in 1912. The reviews were mixed to poor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the musical seemed to gain strength after winning
five Tony Awards in June 1997, including Best Musical. By the fall
of that year, ``Titanic'' was the top-grossing show on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The musical's fortunes were also buoyed by a renewed interest in
the disaster spurred by the blockbuster film of the same name,
which swept last year's Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the show's steam appeared to be running
out. It has been steadily losing money since early January.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the closing in New York, David tried to put a positive
spin on the occasion, saying that ``Titanic'' would continue to
tour in the United States and abroad well through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one feels really bad because of its history, and how we
fought for it,'' he said. ``But these days, New York is really just
the first chapter.''

 &HT;    Lewinsky interview reveals little of Big Picture
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barbara Walters' wonderfully horrible and horribly
wonderful interview with Monica Lewinsky on Wednesday night on ABC
was the moment the mainstream media quit pretending. No more
pretense about obstructing justice or suborning perjury. It was a
peep show, in the great tradition of peep shows.
</P>
<P>
   It was sad and it was irresistible, the two things TV puts
together best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You found yourself alone with Bill Clinton and you lifted the
back of your jacket and showed the president your thong
underwear,'' Walters said, as she did throughout the night, with
almost comic straight-forwardness. ``Where did you get the nerve?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was me,'' the 25-year-old answered, giggling, her
trademark helmet of hair slicked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you become intimate so quickly?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was my sexual soulmate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have said oral sex is not sex. You call it what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Messing around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know what phone sex is. As best you can,
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... It's fun!''
</P>
<P>
   We even got the famous interview tears, which have become our
kind of national stigmata, a dripping sign that we got from our
celebrity what we were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky admitted she'd had an abortion after becoming pregnant
by an older man at the Pentagon. She acknowledged that both her
parents considered suicide during the past year. ``People have no
idea what this has done,'' she sobbed. ``Behind the name Monica
Lewinsky there is a person and there is a family. There is so much
pain that has been caused by all this.''
</P>
<P>
   She then reached for a tissue from a box conveniently placed by
her chair.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time Lewinsky would roll her eyes after yet
another frank question from Walters, exclaim, ``This is so
embarrassing,'' giggle a bit, then blurt out something like, ``I
think I tried to get him to want to have sex with me.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing here that had anything to do with any Big
Picture. It was all about a woman who said she never intended to
say anything about her affair and then on ``20/20'' told maybe more
than 30 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Today Lewinsky tells even more people. Her book, ``Monica's
Story,'' arrives in bookstores today and is already No. 1 on
Amazon.com's Hot 100 Bestsellers list. An interview with Britain's
Channel 4 airs tonight in 32 foriegn countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Lewinsky says that Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's office ``was sick'' for asking so many detailed questions
about her sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   She said a first meeting with prosecutors made her so distraught
that she considered hurling herself from the 10th floor window of
the hotel room where they interviewed her.
</P>
<P>
   The book accuses the prosecutor of colluding with Paula Jones in
obtaining the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Walters' interview, Lewinsky said she's no
longer in love with Clinton (``Sometimes I have warm feelings for
him ... sometimes I hate his guts''), that she just wants to get on
with her life, get married, have kids.
</P>
<P>
   But not until after the book and the overseas interviews.
</P>
<P>
   As literary agent and provacateur Lucianne Goldberg said on
CNBC's ``Hardball with Chris Matthews'': ``It's her movie. Let her
live it.

JONES TRADE NEAR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ If the rumors are true, Eddie Jones has but four
games left in a Lakers uniform. And the ``if'' part of this
continuing saga of speculation will soon give way to facts, one way
or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's trade deadline is seven days away. But the
long-rumored swap of Jones and Elden Campbell for Charlotte's Glen
Rice, J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong could happen before 3 p.m. on
March 11 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston-Salem Journal reported this week that the trade will
be consummated once Rice is activated from the injured list,
possibly within days, and quoted one of the Hornets involved in the
deal as saying, ``I'm more positive that it is going to happen than
I have ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Portland coach Mike Dunleavy told reporters the
Trail Blazers wanted to trade for Rice but that their offer of
Isaiah Rider and Jermaine O'Neal couldn't beat the Lakers' offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West is tired of the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we do something, I refuse to talk about it or not talk
about it,'' he said. ``To me it's one of the things that's most
annoying; everyone speculating something certainly doesn't
necessarily mean it's going to happen. There may not be any
interest in doing anything here. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Eddie Jones right now. I feel terrible for him. I
do,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   But West wouldn't dismiss or confirm the rumor, leaving minds to
wander.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've told you before, if we think we can improve our team,
we'll try to improve our team,'' West said. ``But to say something
is imminent, that's absolutely 100 miles from home base.''
</P>
<P>
   New title, same guy: Kurt Rambis' ascension to head coach hasn't
changed his pregame routine. Despite the added responsibilities,
he's out on the court each night, working out the rookies and bench
players and working up a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he meets with the media in T-shirt and shorts, and
sometimes no shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Kurt, he's still gonna go out before the game and work
out with the rookies, still have on a wrinkly T-shirt and wrinkly
shorts,'' Derek Fisher said. ``Most head coaches, they've already
got their suit on at 10 o'clock in the morning. We're probably
going to have to do a pool and see if we can get Kurt some threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll change at all. I think he can do this for
20 years and still be the same guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's back: Former UCLA guard and Lakers draft pick Toby
Bailey was in uniform for the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, having
been activated off the injured list. Bailey, drafted in the second
round last June and promptly traded to the Suns, appeared in five
games earlier this season before going on the injured list with a
knee problem.

A PEACE PLAN TO CALM BARKS AND SHOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dog war rages on, and the stories from the front
line are not pretty. This week an elegant woman who lives on
Riverside Drive arrived half an hour late for a dinner party and
explained her tardiness in two words: ``Dog patrol.'' She grimly
displayed her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she said. ``I'm still shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   She told of walking her Labrador retriever _ on a leash, as
required by law _along the promenade in Riverside Park near West
86th Street. Suddenly a dog-patrol vehicle appeared, and a menacing
voice emanated from the window on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approach the truck,'' the voice commanded, and she knew enough
about the dog patrol not to resist. She approached. When she got to
the truck, the driver grudgingly conceded a mistake _ ``I couldn't
see your leash'' _ but then detected another violation: her leash
exceeded the legal limit of six feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let me off this time,'' she said. ``I couldn't believe it _
dog owners have become public enemies. Approach the truck!''
</P>
<P>
   She shuddered at the memory. ``You know, I'm beginning to
understand how Jews felt in Nazi Germany.'' Her companions, in
deference to her trembling hands, refrained from pointing out that,
you know, it wasn't quite the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning with either side in this war is becoming difficult. On
Wednesday, the anti-dog partisans cheered on the patrol divisions
of trucks and horses as they swept across Riverside Park, trapping
dog walkers in a ruthless pincers movement. The dog freedom
fighters were busy posting manifestoes on fences denouncing the
Parks Department. As they watched the horseback patrols go by, they
also bitterly wondered why the rangers weren't wielding
pooper-scoopers for their animals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, peace may not be an impossible dream. With a couple of
simple steps, the city might be able to address everyone's
grievances, leaving New York with freer dogs, happier humans and
greener parks.
</P>
<P>
   The first step would be to give the Parks Department and the
public a new incentive to appreciate dogs. As things stand,
officials understandably see dogs as a nuisance, because the
animals damage landscapes that have been expensively restored and
groomed. And the majority of New Yorkers who don't have pets
understandably resent the idea of surrendering parkland to the
minority of dog owners.
</P>
<P>
   But what if dogs started paying their own way? What if the city
charged owners an annual park-usage fee of, say, $50 per dog?
Assuming that there are 750,000 dogs in New York City (estimates
typically range from 500,000 to 1 million), the fees would total
nearly $40 million a year, which is roughly a quarter of the entire
annual operating budget of the Parks Department.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would suddenly begin seeing dogs not as pests but as
profit centers. The money, besides paying for damage caused by dogs
and for the maintenance of enclosed dog runs, could also finance
improvements benefiting all park users.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a mechanism for collecting this money, because
dog owners are required to spend about $10 apiece on dog licenses,
although most don't bother. If the city enforced the requirement
and raised the fee, the extra money could all go to the Parks
Department, with the revenue from each license specifically
designated for the park near the dog's home.
</P>
<P>
   The second step would be to relax the leash law for certain dogs
in certain areas of the parks. The dogs would have to wear a
special tag, which would be available only to well-behaved dogs. To
qualify for the freedom tag, an owner might have to buy liability
insurance and certify that the dog is well behaved (perhaps by
having the dog pass the ``canine good citizen test'' developed by
the American Kennel Club).
</P>
<P>
   Could these measures bring peace? A leader of the dog freedom
fighters was optimistic. ``The ideas sound OK to me,'' said Jeffrey
Zahn, an Upper West Sider who is president of a group of dog owners
called Floral. ``Some people might complain about paying the fee,
but we all know that having a pet costs something. I think the vast
majority of owners would support it if it was going to the parks.''
</P>
<P>
   The supreme commander of the dog patrol, though, was politely
noncommittal. ``They're interesting proposals,'' said the parks
commissioner, Henry J. Stern. ``We could certainly use the money,
but Mayor Giuliani doesn't believe in new taxes.'' So for now, at
least, shuttle diplomacy has failed. Somewhere in Riverside Park,
hands are still trembling.

TWO SCOOPS, HOLD THE CHITCHAT 
OVITZ ENCOUNTERS 
A STAR'S BAR WARS
</HEADLINE>

 By JAMES BARRON WITH COREY KILGANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The book party was for Peter G. Peterson _ a former
secretary of commerce and a founder of the Blackstone Group, a
merchant bank _ at the Council on Foreign Relations on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were funny speeches by Richard C. Holbrooke, President
Clinton's nominee to be chief delegate to the United Nations, and
Henry Grunwald, the former editor in chief of Time Inc., among
others. Holbrooke said that the title of Peterson's new book,
``Gray Dawn,'' which is about the aging of the population, made it
sound like a spy novel.
</P>
<P>
   The drama was near the door. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the chairman
and co-publisher of The Daily News, was standing there listening
when in walked Barbara Walters of ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The people between them tensed up, aware that The News had
scooped Ms. Walters' scoop that very morning. The News had printed
a two-page article with quotes from Ms. Walters' interview with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At first neither Ms. Walters nor Zuckerman made eye contact. But
when the speeches ended, they had a brief, polite conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Mort was a friend and will continue to be a
friend,'' she said Wednesday, ``but when he walked up to me, I
said, `Not today, Mort, not today.' He said, `This could have
helped promote the interview.' I said we could live without the
honor.'' Zuckerman did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz Encounters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actor Bill Murray told people at ``Saturday Night Live'' when he
was a host last month about an encounter with Michael Ovitz, the
former Walt Disney president who has been trying to corral clients
for his new talent agency.
</P>
<P>
   Murray asked what Ovitz, his former agent, had thought of his
performance as a steel tycoon in the Wes aNderson &UR;  &LR; film
``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said he had not seen the movie. Murray said something like
``Good luck,'' and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' a spokesman for Ovitz said Wednesday.
``They've been great friends for 20 years.'' Murray's agent,
Jessica Tuchinsky, said through a spokeswoman, ``This is the first
we have heard of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Star's Bar Wars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was there, she said, because a number of bars have moved
into the neighborhood around her loft on West Broadway near White
Street _ among them the Bubble Lounge and the Liquor Store.
</P>
<P>
   As if waiting for a cue, composer and performer Meredith Monk
sat quietly Tuesday at a meeting of the TriBeCa Committee of
Community Board 1, which covers lower Manhattan. She listened as
her neighbors objected to a request from one of the owners of the
Liquor Store, Marcello Maiorani, to expand the size and operating
hours of his sidewalk cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Ms. Monk piped up, describing ``drunken people throwing
bottles at 2 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sleep in the front of the loft anymore,'' she said.
``It's too noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maiorani responded: ``I'm not calling you a liar, but I've not
seen this.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange ended with a community board employee, Judy Duffy,
saying that she felt that Ms. Monk's claims were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lives on the top floor, and she's the only one who
complains,'' Ms. Duffy said, referring to Ms. Monk. ``She has her
assistant call the community board all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Ms. Monk said that despite the expensive air purifiers she
had installed, her loft ``still gets filled with smoke'' from the
Bubble Lounge, on the ground floor of her building. ``My vocal
cords are getting damaged, and I literally can't breathe.''

LOW-WAGE WORKERS TURN TO SHELTERS TO BRIDGE THE GAP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kenneth Lindo walks with bond traders and bankers
through the gleaming lobbies of Wall Street during the day, his
canvas messenger's bag heavy with checks and stock certificates
from the longest bull market in memory. But at night, he beds down
at the 30th Street Men's Shelter in Manhattan, rolling his winter
jacket in the sheet under his head.
</P>
<P>
   Until January, Lindo had a pillow to call his own, in a Harlem
room that cost $20 a day on his $5.50-an-hour pay _ almost 70
percent of his take-home income. At the shelter, he does without.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to get there earlier than 5 p.m. to get a pillow,''
explained Lindo, 44, as he loped through deliveries in the
financial district, where he has worked on and off for near the
minimum wage since he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Lindo's double life illustrates a larger paradox. The booming
economy has provided employment for more low-wage workers like him,
but by driving up rents, it has made it harder for them to cover
the cost of housing, sending some to the city shelter system to
bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   And the system they encounter is in the midst of re-evaluating
the role work should have for its shelter residents.
</P>
<P>
   Recent court rulings cleared the way for the city to require
parents in family shelters to work for the city in exchange for
their beds, and the Giuliani administration is arguing for the same
authority in shelters for single adults. But how such a system
would work remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Would residents with pay from private-sector jobs still qualify
for shelter beds? Might they, like shelter residents in
Philadelphia, have to turn over a percentage of their earnings to
sleep there?
</P>
<P>
   Simply getting a steady bed in a shelter has become more
difficult for many people who work but cannot find affordable
housing. More than 69 percent of the city's 7,570 shelter beds are
now operated under contracts by private, nonprofit agencies, many
in programs geared to substance abusers or the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the specialized beds have been developed with a
therapeutic or rehabilitation approach that there are very few beds
available for men who are working and simply need a roof over their
heads until they can get housing,'' said Steven Banks, director of
the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wiviott, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of
Homeless Services, said that the recent overflow was temporary,
caused mainly by seasonal demand. Like most cities, New York does
not compile statistics on the number of people who are employed
when they enter the shelter system, she said, but she estimated it
as ``very minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   But for these working homeless, the nightly routine of long
waits, broken sleep and early morning ouster from unfamiliar beds
can threaten their ability to keep a job.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Wall-Carty, who works a mix of day and evening shifts as a
cook for the Houlihan's restaurant chain in Garden City, on Long
Island, was on the overnight circuit last month, and described the
trial of keeping up private-sector work while depending on a
rotating shelter bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was six days of hell,'' Wall-Carty said, ``and for three of
them I didn't sleep at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While many people think of typical adult shelter users as
chronically homeless derelicts or the mentally ill, a majority of
those who entered the New York City system between 1988 and 1995 _
nearly 60,000 men out of a sample of 73,293 _ left within two
months and did not return, or came back only briefly, over the next
three years, according to an analysis by Dennis P. Culhane, an
associate professor of social welfare policy at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in this group were not without problems, Culhane's
analysis showed: About a third came with histories of substance
abuse. But many, he said, were working people coping with crises of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People for whom the economy has really made life good have
trouble understanding why these people can't make it,'' said Mary
Ann Gleason, the executive director of the National Coalition for
the Homeless in Washington. ``But there's an inverse relationship
between a strong economy and the affordability of housing. You have
this direct rise in housing cost in proportion to what the market
will bear, but we haven't increased the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Proscio, former deputy commissioner for the New York City
Department of Homeless Services and now a consultant on urban
development, said there was another reason why the current robust
economy might cause more of the working poor to end up in shelters:
Employers hard-pressed to fill jobs without swelling labor costs
have hired workers passed over in a weaker economy, including some
with criminal records or histories of substance abuse that put them
at greater risk of losing their housing.
</P>
<P>
   Lindo, a divorced Army veteran who graduated from high school in
1973, puts himself in that category. He spent six days in a
detoxification program in early January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your life catches up with you sometimes,'' he said, describing
a 1995 drug conviction for which he is still on probation, credit
card debt from Christmas three years ago, and traffic tickets from
a stint as a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is trying to pay off the fines so he can drive a cab
again. The Wall Street messenger service he works for runs a mail
room under contract to a prominent investment bank. Lindo asked
that the companies not be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might not like it,'' he said, ``that I'm living in a
shelter.''  &QL;
