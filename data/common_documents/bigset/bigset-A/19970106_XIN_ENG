<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in Clash in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
seriously injured in clashes with guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon today,
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Islamic Resistance, the
military wing of the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, announced
that one squad of its fighters launched an attack on an Israeli
post at Sojoud in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the buffer zone confirmed that three
Israeli soldiers were seriously injured in the attack and
they were transferred to hospital in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance stressed that this operation came in
response to the continuous Israeli aggression against south
Lebanese villagers and violations of a cease-fire understanding
reached in April.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-mediated understanding, which put an end to a 17-day
Israeli blitz in south Lebanon, bars both sides from targeting
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack this morning, Israeli artillery bombarded
Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a mountain area which is
often used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a springboard to launch
attacks against the Israeli occupation forces in the border strip.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said that more than 50 shells landed
on the heights in two hours, causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also carried out an air raid at suspected
guerrilla targets at Wadi Jebal Botn and Zibgin, and fired
two air-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a clash erupted around 12:15
a.m. (10:15 GMT) between one group of the guerrillas and an Israeli
force at Wadi NafKha, and no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides used heavy machine guns and mortar artilleries in
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardments by
the Israeli forces constitute a daily scene in south Lebanon,
where the Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 to protect northern Israeli from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Today's clashes came on the eve of a meeting in the south
Lebanese border town of Naqoura of a five-nation committee to
consider four complaints respectively filed by the Lebanese
government and Israel against each other over alleged violations
of the April understanding.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was set up in August
to oversee the implementation of the April understanding.

<HEADLINE> Imaging Method Results in Better Care for Hand Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Magnetic resonance images
(MRI) of abnormal vessels in the hand can help determine the best
treatment without invasive procedures or radiation, a new study
concludes.
</P>
<P>
"MRI were clearly effective in managing vascular
malformations," said Kyle Bickel, an assistant professor of
plastic and orthopedic surgery at Johns Hopkins University. The
abnormal clusters of arteries and veins can be painful and weaken
the hand as they enlarge over time.
</P>
<P>
Using a powerful magnetic field to provide images, the MRI
technique showed the inside of the growths, their connections to
surrounding tendons, bones and muscles, and blood flow through
arteries and veins in the growths.
</P>
<P>
"The results let us determine which growths could be surgically
removed and predict which patients would have long-term success,"
Bickel said.
</P>
<P>
In the 10-patient study, all patients previously had undergone
X-rays, bone scans, ultrasound and conventional angiography, in
which blood vessels are filled with dye injected through a
catheter and then X-rayed. With the help of MRI, four patients had
surgery and six were treated with special garments that compressed
the growths over a long period.
</P>
<P>
Results of the study are published in the January issue of The
Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

<HEADLINE> BIS: Credit Flows to Asia Reach New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Record credit flows of 34.7
billion U.S. dollars have gone to Asian economies in the first
half of 1996, accounting for about a half of the world's total,
the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) said today.
</P>
<P>
"The pace of new lending to Asian countries accelerated in the
first half of 1996, to a record 34.7 billion dollars," says a BIS
report issued today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, South Korea and Thailand take a share of 10.9
billion dollars and 8 billion dollars respectively, accounting for
more than a half, followed by Indonesia (5.1 billion dollars),
Malaysia (3.5 billion dollars), China (2.8 billion dollars) and
the Philippines (2.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the report says, the bulk of new funds has once again
been directly channeled to non-banks although there has been a
resumption of lending to local banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
The share of lending accounted for by the non-bank private
sector now stands at 48 percent of the total stock outstanding in
Asia, compared with 43 percent for banks and 10 percent for the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary and Economic Department of the Basle-based BIS
has made the comment on the maturity, sectoral and nationality
distribution of international bank lending in the first half of
1996 based on information submitted by reporting central banks to
the BIS on their domestically owned banks' consolidated claims on
individual countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The BIS's "reporting area" comprises the Group of Ten, Belgium,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden,
the United Kingdom and the United States, plus Austria, Denmark,
Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The "Outside-area" covers all countries and regions located in
Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America,
as well as a group of smaller developed economies.
</P>
<P>
Besides the record flows to Asian economies, other highlights
outlined in the BIS report include:
</P>
<P>
--Unprecedented volume of new bank credit to countries outside
the reporting area; Sustained lending to Latin America and Eastern
Europe and upsurge in the supply of funds to smaller developed
economies.
</P>
<P>
--Continuing focus on short-term financing and growing
importance of bank acquisitions of securities issued by entities
from the various regions.
</P>
<P>
--Greater emphasis on direct credit to the non-bank private
sector and further repayment of public sector debt, accentuating
an underlying shift in favor of the first group in countries'
external banking debt.
</P>
<P>
--Increasing predominance of European banking groups in
developing countries, with a strengthening of their lead over
their Japanese and North American counterparts not only in Latin
America but also in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Good Rains to Persist in Southern Africa: Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Regional weather experts predict
the seasonal rainfall outlook for the southern Africa will remain
favourable for January through to February.
</P>
<P>
In its latest food security update, the Southern African
Development Community's Regional Early Warning Unit said current
climatic indicators showed signs of a normal rainfall pattern in
the latter part of the season.
</P>
<P>
This contradicts pre-seasonal forecasts by several SADC weather
institutions which said unfavourable rainfall conditions were likely
to be experienced in the region during the latter part of the season.
</P>
<P>
They had also predicted a shorter rainfall season.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said there was cause for concern over the
depressed rainfall in the northern SADC areas affecting Tanzania,
northern and central Mozambique, eastern Zambia and northern
Malawi which had abnormally dry conditions in November and
December.
</P>
<P>
on Zimbabwe, it said good rains continued to be experienced in
most areas which received cumulative rainfall between 80 and 100
percent of normal. enditem

<HEADLINE> Report: Egypt Expects to Sell More Food to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expects to take a
considerable share of the Iraqi market during a six-month period
when Iraq is allowed to buy food with oil, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Esam al-Khashab, chairman of the Exports Department of the Arab
Company for Foreign Trade, was quoted as predicting today that his
country would garner 100-million-dollar worth of contracts during
the first six-month period of the implementation of the U.N.-Iraq
oil-for-food deal which started last month.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached a 20-million-dollar deal in Baghdad
Saturday, under which Egypt sells vegetable shortening and soap to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
More big deals with Iraq could be signed to export foodstuff,
medicines and other basic materials in the near future, Khashab
said.
</P>
<P>
Talks are underway to export to Iraq 10 million U.S. dollars of
medicines, seeds and detergents.
</P>
<P>
Khashab, now visiting Baghdad in a trade delegation, said Iraq
wants to import more food and medicine from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Several Iraqi trade delegations plan to visit Egypt shortly to
strike fresh deals, he said.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Iraqi Ministry of Health will arrive here
on January 12 to probe the possibility of concluding new deals
with the Egyptian pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
Another Egyptian team is due in Baghdad in the coming few days
to discuss potentials for exporting irrigation pumps to Iraq,
Khashab said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the two countries concluded a one-million-dollar
contract that allows Iraq to buy tranquilizers, antibiotics and
pain killers from Egypt starting this month.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 countries and regions have offered to sell food and
medicine to Iraq which suffers from the U.N. sanctions imposed
since its invasion upon Kuwait six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has struck 13 contracts with about 20 companies for
exporting oil under the U.N. arrangement, which allows Iraq to
export 2 billion dollars of oil every six months and buy food,
medicine and other daily necessities.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Attacks Condemned in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A South African top
official today strongly condemned the Rustenburg bomb blasts,
saying the "despicable acts" will never be allowed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Premier Popo Molefe of North-West Province said in a statement
that the bomb blasts, which occurred in his province early this
morning, was designed to upset peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government would take decisive measures "to
ensure that reconciliation and peace is the norm in the
North-West Province", Molefe said.
</P>
<P>
Three bombs went off in the small hours today in and nearby
Rustenburg. Two people were slightly injured and a considerable
damage was caused.
</P>
<P>
While Molefe's condemnation of the bomb attacks was being
made, Rustenburg's outraged Moslems were busy cleaning up rubble
and glass from the damaged mosque which was the first victim in a
sequence of bomb explosions in the town.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the mosque's library, ablutions and its
entrance were damaged in the blast. Damage to the mosque is
initially estimated at about 500,000 Rands (about 110,000 U.S.
dollarsess).
</P>
<P>
"This is intolerable," Mulana Mumtazul Haq, Principal of the
Islamic school at the mosque told reporters angrily.
</P>
<P>
Haq said although tolerance was needed as South Africa was a
multi-religious society, the bomb attack against Rustenburg's
mosque had told local Moslems that their mosque must be protected
by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Essop Saloojee, leader of Rustenburg Moslem Community was
quoted as saying by South African Press Association that the
entire Moslem community in Rustenburg was outraged and sentiment
was running very high.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Aziz Kathrada said the Moslem community in Rustenburg
would oppose any bail application of two suspects should they be
charged.
</P>
<P>
Two white men, suspected of involving in bomb explosions in
Rustenburg, were arrested for questioning hours after the blasts.
They appeared in a local court later today, but they had not been
formally charged, local police said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Team in Egypt for Investigation of Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean resort of
Alexandria Saturday to find clue to the letter bombs found in the
U.S. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian MENA news agency today reported that the U.S. State
Department had reguested Egypt and other Mideast countries that
may have information about those letters to cooperate with the FBI
team.
</P>
<P>
Eight letter bombs disguised as Christmas cards, carrying the
seal of Alexandria post, were dispatched to the London-based
newspaper "Al Hayat" Washington office and other places in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has categorically denied that the letter bombs were from
Egypt. It suggested that fake stamps can be made on letters to
confuse investigators.
</P>
<P>
However, Egypt has promised full cooperation in investigation.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the General Department of Transportation
Police said Saturday that the Egyptian security authorities were
holding high-level contacts with the U.S on the letter bombs that
were disabled before they could cause harm.
</P>
<P>
Security bodies in Egypt said today they had expertise in
detecting all kinds of letter bombs, however "minute or
sophisticated" the devices might be.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a spokesman of the Israeli Embassy here
denied any involvement of his country in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. State Department announced that most of the
letters were not sent from Egypt, as evidence suggests that they
were also sent from other Mideast countries, but it did not
specify.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Expresses Optimism After Secret Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- After an overnight secret
meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed optimism about reaching a
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to businessmen in Tel Aviv today, Netanyahu said that
some progress had been achieved at his meeting with Arafat which
was held at the Eretz checkpoint between Israel and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"We have made progress, but we still have not reached
agreement on all the issues. We will make sure that we will stand
firm on the principles of security and reciprocity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he was optimistic about reaching peace and
security, adding that such negotiation required "patience."
</P>
<P>
Today's surprise meeting lasted for over three hours and ended
at seven O'clock this morning in the presence of U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He said that positive results were achieved in the summit, but
there was still one major issue remaining unsettled -- the
timetable for further Israeli troop redeployment in rural areas
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat convened a meeting this afternoon of his senior
advisers and some members of the Palestinian negotiating team
to update his meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny
also took part in the meeting to learn about the latest
developments in the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been under fire recently from Israel, which alleged
that Cairo was using its influence to encourage the Palestinian
side to delay the Hebron deal so to extort more concessions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian sources all agreed that, with today's
summit, the difficult Hebron talks that have been lingering on
for three months seemed to have taken a positive turn.
</P>
<P>
The summit was the result of Ross' intensive mediation efforts
as the U.S. is increasing pressure on both sides to wrap up the
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords, Israel troops should complete
the pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank by September
1997 after the Hebron redeployment by last March. Israel has
delayed the Hebron pullback since the wave of Islamic suicide
bombing attacks from late February to early March last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron deal has virtually been completed, but due to lack
of trust between the two sides, the Palestinian Authority links
the signing of the deal with Israel's commitment to further
pullback. It wants the U.S. to guarantee in a written form of
Israel's commitment to the Oslo accords before it signs the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross is continuing his mediation efforts today to
bridge the remaining gap. He held a meeting with Arafat this
morning, and is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu late today.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma today blamed some donor countries for threatening
to stop disbursement of development funds earmarked for Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He said although the Zanzibar government appreaciated aid,
donors should not use cheap excuses to embarrass it.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Omar stated this when
opening a water well project at Kaburi Kikombe near the town of
Zanzibar as part of celebrations to mark the 33rd anniversary
of the Zanzibar January Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Zanzibar believe that Omar's remarks were in reaction
to the move by Finland to suspend development aid to Zanzibar's rural
water supply project.
</P>
<P>
Finland is reported to have pulled out of the multi-million
Shilling project because of the failure by the government to estblish
the water authority and introduce water service charges to meet
running costs and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zanzibaris are supplied with water free of charge. The
government foots the bill.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Omar insisted that it was only through self help
projects that the people could solve problems facing them and at the
same time save the government from embarrassments against donor
countries.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Zanzibar government for its efforts to solve water
problems for the people, saying it is encouraging the government
managed to accomplish the Kaburi Kikombe water project without
external support.
</P>
<P>
The Kaburi Kikombe water project can produce about 125 litres
of water per hour. It will serve about 100,000 residents in
Zanzibar Town.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Settlers Suspend Move on New Settlement Near Ramallah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers in Beit El,
who brought mobile homes just outside the settlement Thursday,
retreated today after a meeting between settlement leaders and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, reported Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
The settlement representatives said after the meeting this
afternoon that they expect to receive approval soon to expand
their settlement situated north of the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The settlers began to dismantle what would be a new settlement
near Beit El.
</P>
<P>
In the presence of army soldiers, the settlers disconnected
electricity and water lines, lowered national flags, and removed
most of the seven mobile homes they installed.
</P>
<P>
The action, which came as a protest against the delay in
expanding the Beit El settlement, led to an initial stand-off with
the security forces Friday.
</P>
<P>
But an agreement worked out just before Saturday called the
settlers to leave the site and remove the caravans Sunday in
exchange for a meeting with Mordechai Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under a cabinet decision, any settlement expansion ought to
be approved by the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Dore Gold, senior adviser to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu,
told reporters today that the government would not accept
unilateral acts on settlement not approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
The desire of the Beit El settlers to expand their community
was intensified last month following the killing by Palestinian
militants of a settler woman and her teenaged son.
</P>
<P>
But the settlers' move droved the government to an awkward
position at a time when the relations between Israelis and
Palestinians sank into a new low as a result of the shooting
incident in which an Israeli soldier fired his M-16 into the
vegetable market in Hebron wounding six Palestinians.

CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today the peace process in the Middle East is going
through a "critical" phase and it is important to see what happens
to the Hebron issue and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters here that some progress has been realized
in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on Hebron, but he said what
would happen next is very important.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to continuous contacts between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators on the proposed formulas about Israeli Pullback from
Hebron, Moussa said "let us wait and see what happens today."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu held six-hour secret
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat early this morning in
a bid to finalize the long-delayed Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that progress had been made over
clearing the last obstacles blocking the deal on Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that "the ongoing negotiations pertain only to
the Palestinian track. Although it is a main one, yet it is
necessary to activate the other tracks as well."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the continued Israeli raids over south Lebanon
for the last three days, Moussa said they are an encroachment on
a country's sovereignty and cannot be accepted.
</P>
<P>
"Such raids would negatively influence the general climate of
the Mideast peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is following all the "sensitive and negative"
developments of the peace drive on all tracks, he said.

Johannesburg, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A right-wing group called

for this morning's Rustenburg bomb attacks, which left two people
injured and caused a considerable property damage.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) said an

The unidentified man said the BAT was demanding that all Indians be
removed from Parliament because it did not recognize Indians as
indigenous people.

It saw Indians as anti-Christ because "they don't accept Jesus
Christ," the man said.
</P>

In addition to the Rustenburg blasts, the BAT has also

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash today accused Moscow of "displaying enmity towards Turks"
by selling missiles to Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted Denktash as saying that the
missiles will not deter northern Cyprus, which declared itself as
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983.
</P>
<P>
He accused Russia of preparing the Greek Cypriots for war,
saying the Turkish side can not accept any proposals concerning a
Cyprus settlement from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said the Greek Cypriot side is now "hiding behind Russian
missiles" and avoiding coming to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Turkish semi-official Anatolia News Agency Saturday quoted
Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan as saying that the Greek
Cypriots are continuously arming themselves and not displaying the
necessary maturity to secure peace in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Tayan added: "This situation will undermine peace in the
region. We have warned the countries that sell arms."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Cypriot ministers and representatives of the
Russian state-controlled Rosvoorouzhenie company concluded the
multi-million-dollar missile contract at a meeting on the island.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Greek Cyprus bought modern Russian
tanks T80-U and Russian-made BMP-3 armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both member states of the NATO, are at
odds over the divided strategic island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish troops
landed on the island and took control of its northern third
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the only country that has recognized the self-claimed
republic in northern Cyprus.

<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Peace-keeping force in the daytime, legionnaires at night
time: a punitive operation by French troops in the Central African
capital Bangui, Sunday morning, cost the lives of 10 mutinous
soldiers, Paris said. But the rebels claimed that 21 of their
soldiers and 11 civilians were killed during the attack, launched
after two French military men were killed the day before by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
-- The Belgian cartoonist, Andre Franquin, who created the
famous characters of Marsupilami and Gaston Lagaffe greatly
beloved by children and adults, died on Sunday at the age of 73. A
few weeks ago, Franquin published the 15th album of the Gaston
adventure series: "Gaffe a Lagaffe."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French troops killed 10 mutinous soldiers in the Central
African capital Bangui, in retaliation for the murder of Captain
Patrick-Rene Devos and Warrant Officer Gerard Giraldo by the
rebels on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the action as legitimate defense, the French
government said the action had not changed the non-intervention
policy of France in the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
-- One year after the death of President Francois Mitterrand,
stories about his two seven-year presidential terms were still
coming out, to cater for both the people who admire him and those
who detest him.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Mauroy, one of the closest friends of Mitterrand, told
the story about the cancer the former president had suffered since
1981. Marc Banamou published a book, "Le Dernier Mitterrand," in
which he said Mitterrand did not work for more than a couple of
hours a day during his presidencies.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Logging Export Ban Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Cambodian official
said here today that the enforcement of the government-imposed
total ban on logging and timber exports from Cambodia is effective.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Minister of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fishery Tao Seng Hour said as far as he knew there
had been no violation of the ban since it took effect on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring countries, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, had been
very cooperative in Cambodia's effort to enforce the ban, he added.
</P>
<P>
"All individuals and companies, whether they are Cambodian or
foreign, found to be engaged in illegal activity will be arrested
(charged in the case of companies), and all properties including
logs, sawn timber and equipment will be confiscated and destroyed
if necessary," Cambodian co-prime ministers announced on December
26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tao Seng Hour, who made a tour of the border forest area
recently, said that 99 percent of the nationals supported the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
International bodies such as the World Bank, The Food and
Agricultural Organization, the International Monetary Fund were
happy with the declaration and its enforcement, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the ban had little ill effect on state
revenue and cross-border trade.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Reiterates Adherence to UN Resolution 425 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
reiterated here today his country's adherence to Resolution 425
of the United Nations' Security Council, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi made the remarks in a meeting in the Presidential Palace
with foreign ambassadors and consuls for receiving New Year
greetings.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese President implied that his country would agree
to a deployment of international peacekeeping forces along the
border with Israel after a withdrawal of the Israeli forces
from the occupied Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the Lebanese government would also send an
army to south Lebanon in order to safeguard the security.
</P>
<P>
After a full Israeli withdrawal, the president said, "the
Lebanese Army is ready to maintain the security in cooperation
with international forces."
</P>
<P>
Alluding to a refusal of the so-called "Lebanon first"
proposal, Hrawi reasserted his country's commitment to the firm
solidarity with Syria in the peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In waiting for the Israeli withdrawal, the Lebanese president
said, "Lebanon will not retreat from an interlock of the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks."
</P>
<P>
After taking power last June, the Likud government of Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu put forward the "Lebanon
first" proposal in an apparent attempt to lure Lebanon to sign a
separate peace accord with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Beirut categorically rejected the proposal, saying that it
was aimed at "driving a wedge" between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"We and our brother Syria have chose the choice of just and
comprehensive peace based on international resolutions and the
principle of exchanging land for peace," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon will never be a victim for the peace settlement in
the region and it will never become again a combating field of
foreign interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the repeated Israeli air raid in south Lebanon,
as well as incidents disturbing security like the terror attack
at a bus carrying Syrian workers in north Lebanon last month
could not "shake the stability" in this country.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian driver was killed and a passenger injured when
unidentified gunmen sprayed machine gun fire at a van in Tabarja,
some 25 kilometers north of Beirut, on December 17.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials blamed Israel for the attack, and more
than two dozens of people were rounded up by the security forces
following the incident, but most of them were released later.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi urged the United States to lift an 11-year-old ban on
travel of American citizens to Lebanon, saying that taking this
step will reflect Washington's support for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban was imposed by the U.S. administration
followng a series of airplane hijackings to Beirut and
terrorist attacks targeting American interests in mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the "Friends of Lebanon" conference,
which was held in Washington on December 16, indicated an
"international concern over Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
In the one-day conference, West and oil-rich Arab countries
and international lending organizations promised to provide 3.2
billion U.S. dollars in grants and loans to Lebanon in the coming
years, including one billion dollars available in the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
The conference was called for by Washington as part of a
cease-fire arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, which put an
end to a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in April.

<HEADLINE> Writ Petition Against Speaker's Ruling Filed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A writ petition was filed here
today at Nepal's supreme court against a recent ruling by lower
house Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel on an opposition-tabled censure
motion.
</P>
<P>
Five lawyers, believed to be supporters of the Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), the major opposition
party, filed the joint petition challenging the speaker's ruling
that a CPN-UML sponsored no-confidence motion against Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his coalition government was
defeated in the house.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Poudel, who is from Deuba's Nepali Congress (NC) party,
made the ruling two weeks ago after the lower house of the Nepali
parliament held a voting over the no-confidence motion at a
special session.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and one MPs voted in favor of the motion and 84 MPs
against it in the voting. The 205-seat house currently has five
vacant seats.
</P>
<P>
According to the Speaker, such a no-confidence motion required
a majority of 103 votes to pass in the house under the
constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the petitioners argued that a majority in parliament means
the majority of the members present in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Deuba's three-party government at present has only minority
parliamentary support, which was proved by the house voting over
the no-confidence motion last month.

HONG KONG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Hong Kong
stock market rose sharply here today with Hang Seng Index (HSI)

</P>
<P>
HSI's sub-indices were also on the rise with finance jumping
201.98 points to 13,913.15, utilities 170.63 points to 9,938.45,
properties 494.58 points to 26,436.77 and the commercials and
industrials 151.06 points to 9,832.76.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the
performance of 23 state enterprises form China's inland areas
listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, rose 7.91 points to
1,066.96, the highest since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today's turnover reached 11.129 billion HK dollars (about 1.43
billion U.S. dollars), the highest in the three trading days in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said the major factor for today's hike on both
HSI and turnover is the rebounds on the New York Stock Exchange
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the general trend on the Hong Kong stock market
is upward despite the fact that HSI dropped sharply on the first
trading day this year.
</P>
<P>
They said that at present, favorable conditions in Hong Kong's
economy, including good economic prospects in the inland areas and in
Hong Kong, have laid a solid foundation for the growth of share
prices on the Hong Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
With confidence in Hong Kong's transition, more and more
investment is expected to flow into Hong Kong for stock business,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warship Expected Out of Water Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A warship that sank in the Yangtze
River during a Japanese bombing attack in 1938 is scheduled to be
raised from the water on February 24.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, named "Chungshan" after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
forerunner of China's democratic revolution, will then be taken to
a berth of the nearby Hubei Shipyard by the Chongqing Yangtze
River Rescue and Salvage Company, said Li Daqiang, executive
vice-governor of Hubei Province and head of a special leading
group for the salvage effort.
</P>
<P>
The restoration work, which is expected to take one year, will
be designed and done by units selected through public bidding, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the cruiser will be displayed at an
exhibition hall to be built in Wuhan's Jinkou Town, where the
warship sank nearly 60 years ago, and the site where more than 10
of the ship's crew members were buried.
</P>
<P>
Li Guanghui, manager of the rescue and salvage company, said
that the salvage operation has gone smoothly since it began on
November 12 of last year.
</P>
<P>
Removal of the 1,000 tons of mud and sand deposited in the
sunken ship over the past decades, deemed as one of the two most
troublesome tasks for the salvage, is finished, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Li's company is placing steel cables under the ship
-- the other major difficulty.
</P>
<P>
"If nothing unexpected happens, the warship will be brought out
of the water as scheduled," Li said.

Spokesman Mohamed Afrah, who is also the interior minister of
Hussein Aidid's self-styled government, said those found to have
attended the meeting will be charged for treason.
</P>
<P>
He characterized the meeting as a purely set up meant to
disintegrate Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The harsh words of Aidid are said to be affecting some of the
Sodare meeting participants who belong to the United Somali
Congress of Murusade clan whose base is in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The threat will also affect members from the minority
communities of the United Somali Roots and the Somali Salvation
Council factions.
</P>

The threat of Hussein Aidid came just three days after a
meeting by 26 Somali factions was concluded in Sodare of Ethiopia
where an 11-member National Salvation Council of Somalia was
formed.
</P>
<P>
Among the council are five co-chairmen including Osman Ali
Atto and Ali Mahdi Mohamed.

TUNIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The 14th session of the Arab
Interior Ministers Council concluded here today after approving
the Arab anti-terrorism strategy.
</P>
<P>
The final statement of the council said recommendations
relating to the security of the region, fighting against
terrorism, organized crime and illicit use of drugs were
discussed at the three-day meeting attended by 20 Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Arab anti-terrorism strategy is
based on principles that there must be clear distinction between
terrorism and the armed struggle of nations for liberation from
foreign occupation and for independence.

<P>
The strategy called on member states to "commit themselves to
take effective and firm measures to ban and fight whatever form
of terrorism" in their countries.
</P>

The ministers also decided to cooperate closely in
investigating and arresting suspects as well as the freezing of
all assets of those suspected of financing violent acts.

The Arab Interior Ministers Council charged its general
secretariat with constituting a committee to work out a
three-year plan for the execution of items of that strategy.

KUWAIT CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has reiterated
its support for Lebanon in its struggle against Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon and asserted that Israel must
unconditionally withdraw its troops from the area.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd expressed the stand during a meeting Sunday
night with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri who arrived to
Saudi Arabia the same day for an unannounced visit, Kuwait News
Agency reported from Riyadh today.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd told Hariri that Israel must unconditionally
pullout from south Lebanon according to U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, which was issued after Israel launched its first
incursion into south Lebanon in the 1970s.

<P>
Lebanon has been seeking to retake a border strip in south
Lebanon, occupied by Israel and patrolled by a joint force of
Israeli troops and local allied militiamen.

<P>
King Fahd and Hariri also discussed the Middle East peace
process, especially the tracks of negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon and the reconstruction process in Lebanon during their
talks, Kuwait News Agency said.

its infrastructure which was demolished in the 16-year civil war

<HEADLINE> CPC-led United Front, Multi-Party Cooperation Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- To further consolidate and
develop the United Front and Multi-Party Cooperation led by
Communist Party of China (CPC) is of great significance to the
current modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
It is also a long-term strategic issue for the country's
national vitalization and enduring social stability, Hu Jintao,
member of CPC Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee, said
today at the opening of a special research class on the United
Front and Multi-Party Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Held in Beijing, the class is jointly sponsored by the CPC
Central Committee's Organizational Department, the United Front
Work Department and the Central Party School. A total of 54 people
are participating in the study, including several non-communist
party leaders and a number of local officials in charge of the
United Front work.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hu recalled the history of the CPC-led United
Front and spoke highly of the new development and contribution of
the United Front since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh CPC
Central Committee in late 1978.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the CPC will adhere to and further develop
the strategic principle of the United Front, stressing that the
enormous achievements in the current reform, opening up and
modernization drive are inseparable from the Party's new United
Front efforts and the solidarity and cooperation with
non-communist parties.
</P>
<P>
The new situation has created new requirements for the United
Front and Multi-Party Cooperation, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
To build China into a prosperous, strong, democratic,
modernized socialist country calls for the solidarity of all the
Chinese people, including people of different ethnic groups and
different parties as well as compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Macao and overseas, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics are the ideological and theoretical basis for
various aspects of CPC's work, and also for the development of the
United Front and Multi-Party Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Non-communist parties should pass down both organizational and
political ideals from the older to the younger generations,
emphasizing the close cooperation between non-communist parties
and CPC, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He asked the non-communist parties to strengthen the building
of their new leadership and the training of their younger leading
figures.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Hits Hard at Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Five government soldiers
arrested by the Sierra Leone Naval Patrol Unit early November
last year have been jailed for 10 years each with hard labor,
Justice Ministry officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who were sentenced to jail on Saturday had
attacked a Spanish fishing boat offshore Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
"We are now determined to stamp out piracy and make the
country's territorial waters safe," one official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's statistics, piratical attacks for
the past three years on fishing boats plying the country's
coastal waters have increased five fold to about an average of
four a month, with the highest falling in the month of November
last year.
</P>
<P>
Naval Commander Alimamy Sesay in an interview said, "stiffer
penalties should be given to pirates as from now on."
</P>
<P>
Last September, Spanish and Canary Island boat owners
protested to Sierra Leone over what they called "the high
incidence of piracy and they threatened to withdraw their boats
from Sierra Leone if the government does not step up the battle
against piracy."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Defense Industry Exporting Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Small arms manufactured by
Nigeria's Defense industries Corporation (DIC) are currently
being exported to neighboring west African countries, despite
sanctions from the European Union and the U.S. and poor funding.
</P>
<P>
The arms include rifle, pistol and 7.62mm calibre ammunition
types, the Daily Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official 1997 diary of the Defense Ministry,
efforts are being made to ensure that the nation's military
requirements are met locally, especially under the sanctions of
the international community imposed at the end of 1995 following
the Nigerian government's execution of nine minority activities.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the problem of funding, which Defense Headquarters
said had bedeviled all federal agencies recently, the military
is still able to keep abreast of time and has demonstrated that
it is a force to reckon with not only in the west African
sub-region but in the entire continent," the publication said,
quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Most of Nigeria's military equipment comes from abroad. The
DIC, established in 1964, is reported to have so far met the
nation's defense needs, especially the production of small arms
and ammunition.

<HEADLINE> D-8 Sets Aside Politics, Ideology in Cooperation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today the Group of Eight Islamic
Developing Countries (D-8) would set aside questions of politics
and ideology in its efforts to ensure the success of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
The grouping would concentrate on economic cooperation which
would not only serve as an example for other Islamic countries in
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) but also for
developing countries outside of the OIC, he said on his return
from the D-8 inaugural ministerial meeting at Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The grouping agreed that cooperation will not encompass
politics or ideology but will concentrate on economic matters "for
our common good," he said at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport at Subang near here.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the grouping, with a total population of 650
million, would initially concentrate on investment, human
resources, transport and communication.
</P>
<P>
The D-8, whose formation was proposed by Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, groups Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran,
Turkey, Nigeria, Pakistan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said there were, no doubt, marked differences in the
level of economic development among the member nations such as
Bangladesh which was far behind others but noted that Bangladesh
was a big Islamic country and could benefit from its membership of
D-8.
</P>
<P>
He said all the countries present at the meeting agreed to
Malaysia's proposal that they reform their respective
bureaucracies as this often posed problems in economic development
and delayed trade and investment liberalization.

<P>
After the ministers' meeting, the summit of heads of state or
government of the participating nations will be held, also in
Istanbul, "within the first six months" of this year to further
discuss the establishment of the organization, according to the
final communique of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being an entity based on religion, the D-8 will be
an organization to boost economic and trade ties among the member
states, as well as South-to-South trade.

"The great potential of these countries, which altogether have
a population of Yrt%'e4{+kK

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Gears up Shanghai Suburban Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The increasing and rational use
of overseas investment in 1996 helped Shanghai suburbs score a 24
percent growth rate in industrial output value over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
By October 1996, nine industrial zones on the city's outskirts
had introduced more than 1,600 overseas-funded industrial and
service trade projects, with a total investment reaching 38
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
And more than 30 of the world's top 500 transnational giants
had injected nearly one billion US dollars into the zones.
</P>
<P>
Songjiang Industrial Zone, the largest of its kind in the
suburbs of Shanghai, so far has 155 overseas-funded projects, with
a combined investment surpassing 11 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The industrial zone added 49 new overseas-funded projects in
1996, involving more than 5.1 billion yuan in investment.
</P>
<P>
So far, five big industrial production bases have taken shape
in the city's suburban areas. They are a base for iron and steel
in Baoshan District, petrochemicals in the Jinshan area,
electronics and machinery in the Minhang Zone, automobiles in
Jiading County, and telecommunications in Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, establishment of large group companies has given
greater impetus to industrial development in the city's suburban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1996, more than 120 group enterprises accounted for
one-fifth of the industrial output value generated in the Shanghai
suburbs, with profits accounting for one-fourth of the total.

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Negotiations Begin in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government and the
Islamic opposition began their two-week negotiations here today,
focusing on creation of a reconciliation commission and
participation of the opposition group in the government.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government is represented by Foreign Minister Talbak
Nazarov while Akbar Turjanzadeh, Deputy Chairman of the League of
Tajik Opposition, is present on behalf of the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, U.N. special
envoy to Tajikistan Gerd Dietrich Merrem and Russian Ambassador
Sergei Tretyakov were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said at a press conference on the sideline of
the peace talks that the negotiations would have to decide on
the change and completion of the constitution, the elections,
the general amnesty and the percentage of the participation of
each party in the national reconciliation commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition group is asking for a share
of 40 percent first in the national reconciliation commission
and then in the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tajik government does not accept the demand.
Turjanzadeh said at the meeting that experts from the two
sides laid the foundations for peace in Tajikistan in the last
round of talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the reconciliation commission was envisaged
in a peace accord signed in Moscow on December 23 by Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Abdullah Nuri.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be charged with trying to end the
civil war raging in Tajikistan for the past four years. Both
sides agreed in Moscow that negotiations on setting up the
commission would be wound up by July 1.
</P>
<P>
The commission and Rakhmonov would then have up to 18
months to agree on post-war arrangements with the commission's
work leading to the formation of a new parliament through
elections.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Turjanzadeh urged the Tajik government to
free the prisoners of the opposition group and stop arrest
of their members in line with the resolution of the conference
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Velayati said that since the start of
the dispute in Tajikistan, Iran has been working actively for the
restoration of peace and tranquility in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. special envoy to Tajikistan Merrem said that
finalizing the procedure and program of the national
reconciliation commission top the agenda of the Tehran
meeting. The commission should play a dynamic role.
</P>
<P>
Finding a solution to the military issues and paving the way
for the return of the Tajik refugees will also be discussed in
Tehran meeting, Merrem stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Tajik nation will help
materialize peace and carry out the agreements reached between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, certain elements are trying to create
obstacles on the way of establishment of peace in Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Foreign Exchange Reserves Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves rose for a second straight month in December, 1996, to
33.24 billion U.S. dollars, but they still failed to meet an
international standard.
</P>
<P>
The December reserves were 920 million dollars more than in
November. The Bank of Korea said it was a remarkable recovery from
the four-month low of 32.23 billion dollars in October.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount still fell 2.76 billion dollars short of
the 36 billion dollars limit set by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), which requires a nation to maintain an adequate
foreign reserves level to be able to pay for its imports over
three months.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's average monthly imports were 12 billion dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the upswing in reserves to its
collection of part of the foreign exchange funds deposited at
commercial and development banks.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Peace Talks Still Face Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Differences still impeded the
Palestinians and Israelis from clinching a deal on Israeli troop
pullout from the West Bank town of Hebron, said the Minister of
Local Government of the Palestinian National Authority(PNA).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "Good Morning Egypt" T.V. program today,
Saeb Erekat singled out the joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols in
Hebron as a sticking point that Israel is trying to scrap from
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the main issue now is what comes after Hebron,
"especially as the Palestinian-Israeli peace accords stipulate a
full control by the Palestinian National Authority over the West
Bank with the exception of some regions to be negotiated." These
areas cover no more than 9 percent of the West Bank area, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We want from Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu a
written pledge on resuming the final stage negotiations at a
definite date," he announced.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also called on Israel to release Palestinian female
detainees in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on
September 28 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian minister said a final settlement for the
Palestinian cause will be the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
In a slap at the Israeli government's closure of West Bank and
Gaza Strip, he said the main challenges facing Palestinian
infrastructure construction lie in the low resources as a result
of Israel's collective punishment policy against the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
On accomplishment in the self-ruled areas, he said most of
them were in the infrastructure domain which had been completely
destroyed before their hand-over to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
A five-year reconstruction plan was worked out over the past
two years to develop health, education, local government and
other services for the Palestinian people, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest a total of
34.4 billion yuan to build railways this year, a rise from the 32
billion yuan spent in 1996, Chinese Railway Minister Han Zhubin
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at an annual national conference attended by
railway ministry authorities and leaders of all local railway
bureaus and sub-bureaus.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to lay tracks with a combined length of
1,270 km, and also to build 1,260 km of new rail lines, 440 km of
double-track rail, and 1,750 km of electrified railways, the
minister said at the start of the five-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The investment for key rail projects will be ensured, he said,
adding that track-laying work on the Nanning-Kunming line will be
completed in March, and the railway will open by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon railway should pass state assessment and
become a state-level model project, he added.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that in 1996, the Ministry of Railways
laid 1,300 km of track, including 436 km of double-track rail
lines, and built 1,980 km of new rail lines, 1,500 km of
double-track railways, and nearly 700 km of electrified railways.

HOHHOT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region plans to build more nature reserves to give
better protection to its rich plant and wild animal resources.
</P>
<P>
The number of nature reserves above regional-level will reach
35 by the year 2005, with their combined area accounting for 7.1
percent of the total area of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 21 nature reserves, with a total area of
over 35,000 square kilometers, or some three percent of the
region's territory.
</P>
<P>
Within the region are 2,500 higher plants, 112 kinds of
animals, 347 kinds of birds, and 40,000 to 50,000 invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the region has attached great importance to the
construction of nature reserves as an effective way of protecting
its endangered plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
More efforts have also been made in forest and grassland
protection, development of scientific research and building
of scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that preparations have now been started for the

<P>
HONG KONG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong share market is
expected to see a period of strong growth during the run-up to
Hong Kong's handover on June 30, according to today's South China
Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said that, based on an average of forecasts from 31
analysts, the Hang Seng Index will enjoy a growth of 9.5 percent
during the period to reach 14,482 points.
</P>
<P>
The handover was widely seen as having a positive impact on the
course of trading during the next six months, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Janice Wallace, the executive director of Asian investment
research at Goldman Sachs, said the handover should help the
market, as political uncertainty reduces and consumer spending
improves on the back of improved confidence.
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said the flow of funds from China's inland
which aided the 33 percent rise in the index last year was
expected to continue and help support the strength of the local
property market.
</P>
<P>
The stock market will also be bolstered by a strong improvement
in corporate earnings among Hong Kong companies during the second
half of the year which should underpin a continued recovery in
the Hong Kong economy, according to the majority of the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Many of the forecasts expressed concern about the affect that
an upturn in US interest rates might have on the local market, but
some said this would be offset by the "China factor" and improved
local economic conditions.

HANGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Three members of a family had
an amazing escape when their minibus crashed through railings on a
bridge and plunged into the West Lake in Hangzhou, capital of east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Courageous policemen jumped into the icy cold lake and quickly
located the submerged mini-bus in the deep lake. They managed to
smash the windscreen to rescue a couple and their son, all lying
unconscious in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The family were rushed to a nearby hospital and after
intensive medical treatment they were all revived, and there was
no more danger to their lives.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened on the evening of January 3 as a man
identified by the name of Lin, his wife and son, were driving
across the bridge over the famous tourist lake. Their minibus tore
a 5.5-meter hole in the railings after going out of control.
</P>
<P>
Immediately, passers-by dialed the police emergency "110" number,
and police were on the scene within three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Several of the policemen jumped into the icy water and saved
the lives of the family, entombed in the lake in their vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The police found the family' address and went to their house to
get some dry clothes. But the police car had a traffic accident due to
the slippery roads and two policemen were injured.
</P>
<P>
When the family later learned about all the injured police
officers, they were moved to tears.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Foreign Ministry Denies Reports About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Foreign Ministry
today vehemently denied reports alleging President Fidel Ramos had
talked to the Diplomatic Corps about the ongoing dispute between
the management and workers of the German-owned Telefunken
Microelectronics Inc. (TEMIC).
</P>
<P>
An information bulletin from the ministry said the reports
alleging that Ramos justified the recent dispersal of striking
TEMIC workers who had been occupying the premises of the
Department of Labor and Employment for more than two weeks are
"pure concoction by malicious minds and have no basis."
</P>
<P>
Local reports on Sunday quoted Ramos as having told the
diplomatic corps that "We should not allow any groups of persons
to illegally occupy offices of private enterprises especially
those by government...that's practically sedition."
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 workers of the German-owned manufacturing company,
who were demanding reinstatement and the release of their backpay
amounting to about 400 million pesos (15.2 million US dollars),
were dispersed by police last Friday, as Ramos held his annual Vin
d'Honneur in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The ministry emphasized that the yearly Vin d'Honneur is a
purely ceremonial affair during which the president greets foreign
heads of state through their diplomatic representatives in Manila.
It is also the time when the president summarizes foreign policy
highlights.
</P>
<P>
"It is never an occasion to mention, much less discuss,
particular issues that may interest a foreign country," the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said in a handwritten memorandum Sunday that "I did not
talk to the diplomatic corps -- not even to a single ambassador --
on this or related matters."
</P>
<P>
The ministry also pointed out that Ramos had instructed all
government agencies to handle disputes and complaints with maximum
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
The labor dispute of the TEMIC started when the workers went on
strike in September, 1995 after a deadlock in collective
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The management eventually reinstated 800 of the workers, but
refused to allow 98 union leaders and 1,600 others to return.

<HEADLINE> FM: Iran Ready to Launch Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today once again expressed Iran's readiness to
launch defense cooperation with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that "Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan made proposal on complete cooperation between
Iran and Turkey during his trip to Tehran."
</P>
<P>
"Iran expressed its readiness to have the cooperation. One of
the areas in which Iran has got very important experiences is in
the field of defense, both in regard to self-sufficiency and
organizing correct and effective defense capability," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that Iranian President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani also voiced Iran's readiness to transfer
the experience in self-sufficiency in defense to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Istanbul Sunday, Velayati said, "if Turkey
wants to benefit from our experience in this field, we won't
hesitate to transfer the results of our experience."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it would be hard for the two
neighbors to have military cooperation since the United States
and NATO have great influence in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
They noted that what the Iranian government intends to do is
trying to defuse the dangerous threat from his neighbor because
Turkey and Israel have already concluded a military accord,
under which Israeli air force can fly in the Turkish airspace.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Israel have warned that they would
launch military attacks against the Iranian targets if Iran is
involved in any terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Trade Balance Worsens in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Figures released by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics today found the current account
deficit widened to 1.923 billion Australian dollars (1.538 billion
U.S. dollars) in November, representing a 6.4-percent jump over
October.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the current account deficit was caused by a
389 million Australian dollars (311.2 million U.S. dollars)
increase in the merchandise trade deficit," Finance Minister John
Fahey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade balance deteriorated as exports fell 4.9
percent which reflects a decline in both rural and non-rural
exports and was coupled with a 1.2-percent rise in imports, Fahey
said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition treasury spokesman Mark Latham said the latest
balance of payments data suggested the federal government was
wrong to cut funding to export enhancement programs in the budget.
</P>
<P>
"The sluggish export performance shows that the government
pulled the wrong rein in cutting back export-related programs,"
Latham said.
</P>
<P>
In the August budget, the government restricted the
availability of Export Market Development Grant scheme to small
and medium-sized companies.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Currency Remains Stable in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A year-end report of the Central
Bank of the Philippines showed that the Philippine peso remained
remarkably stable against the U.S. dollar in 1996, the Philippine
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the peso-U.S. dollar exchange rate has
generally remained at 26.2:1 and fluctuated less than 0.5 percent
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The peso depreciated by 7.4 percent in 1995, appreciated by
11.8 percent in 1994, and depreciated by 10.4 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Bank governor Gabriel Singson attributed the peso's stability
in the year-end report to strong economic fundamentals and
unwavering commitment of the bank to its mandate: the maintenance
of price and monetary stability.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of 1996, the bank managed to keep the exchange
rate stable despite pressures for the peso to appreciate, which
were brought about by the continued strong influx of foreign
investments and remittances from overseas contract workers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the bank has already bought from the Philippine
Dealing System around 4.6 billion U.S. dollars, net of sales,
boosting the country's gross international reserves to an all-time
high of 11.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Remittances from overseas contract workers, strong exports
earnings as well as foreign investments have also boosted the
country's foreign currency deposits to a record high of 14.99
billion U.S dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Singson said it is likely that the peso will remain stable
against the dollar for 1997, although the peso is expected to
depreciate slightly because of the pressure of widening balance of
trade deficit which will reach 2.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Growth and Low Inflation for Shanghai's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is expecting a steady
economic growth this year based on its sound economic development
during 1996.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official said that the municipality's
gross domestic product (GDP) topped 289 billion yuan in 1996, up
13 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the retail sales price index was within five
percent, eight percent points less than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhenxin, an official at the Shanghai Price Bureau,
attributed the successful "soft-landing" to macro-economic
regulation measures.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai cut back the growth of investments to 36 percent in
1996, 70 percentage points and 33.6 percentage points down
respectively from 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The investment mainly went to major municipal operations and
new high-tech industries that make up the backbone of the city's
economy, helping advanced science and technology to contribute 38
percent of Shanghai's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li added that Shanghai's economy is now turning from extensive
development to intensive development.
</P>
<P>
The total demand and supply of the city were basically equal in
1996, making the price of cereals, edible oils and food increase
slower. That of food reached 11 percent, about 20 percentage
points lower than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai set forth regulations on price management and the
detailed rules for their implementation during 1996, to keep
prices under supervision. Those measures helped to control price
increases, while the economy developed rapidly.

Indonesia's foreign debt had reached 100 billion dollars at the
end of last year and debt servicing constituted 36 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM to Visit Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati will start his two-day official visit Tuesday to
Italy in a bid improve the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian foreign minister today declined to comment
on whether the thorny issue of the Salman Rushdie affairs will be
dealt with during his forthcoming trip to Italy.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on British
author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the
publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which was
accused of insulting Muslims, and exhorting all Muslims to carry
out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big
controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran
and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "the main purpose of this trip is to pay an
official visit to Rome and talk to the high-ranking officials of
that country about bilateral, regional and international
cooperation between Iran and Italy."
</P>
<P>
An Iranian source from the Foreign Ministry said that Velayati
will also call on Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
Ludovico Ortona, Italian Ambassador to Iran, has already left
for Rome to make preparations for the high-level bilateral
talks.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Iran-Italian economic relations will be
on the top of agenda between Velayati and his Italian counterpart
Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Iran signed an agreement in November for several
industrial projects totalling 561 million U.S. dollars, which
will be financed by the Italian Bank Medtocredito along with a
number of other banks from England, France, Japan, Netherlands
and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Introduced to Boost Building Materials Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China introduced 660 million US
dollars in foreign funds last year to boost its building materials
industry, bringing foreign investment in the sector over the
past six years to nearly five billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment has been involved in such fields as new
building materials, new and high technologies and intensive
processing of building materials, Lei Qianzhi, deputy director of
the State Administration of Building Materials Industry, told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
According to Lei, a large number of cement projects financed
with loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank went
into operation last year.
</P>
<P>
A gigantic technical transformation project involving sanitary
ceramic production, financed with a 100 million dollar loan from
Italy, has been going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The project includes eight sub-projects in Shaanxi, Shandong,
Guangdong, Jilin and Hunan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in 1996, China signed a number of
cooperation agreements with the Netherlands, Germany, Tailand,
Greece, Australia, Japan, France and Denmark, witnessing a growing
number of foreign partners in the building materials sector.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that China's exports of building materials products
exceeded 2.1 billion dollars and its cement exports amounted to a
record 12 million tons last year, up 46 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the country introduced advanced
precalcining kiln production lines from foreign countries in
recent years and built a number of large and modern cement plants,
adding an extra annual cement production capacity of 22 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of large-sized float glass production lines
co-funded with companies from Britain, the US and Japan, with a
daily melting capacity ranging from 500 tons to 700 tons, produced
good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the country's building materials
sector generated a total output value of 260 billion yuan last
year. Its cement and flat glass outputs reached 490 million tons
and 160 million cases in 1996, respectively, up 2.96 percent and
1.76 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> No Poverty in China By 2000: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China's premier Li Peng has
declared that the country could see an end to poverty in its rural
areas by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
It will mean lifting the country's remaining 65 million poor
people out of their poverty - but it is an entirely attainable
goal, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China, he has vowed, will allocate an additional 1.5 billion
yuan to help speed up economic development in poverty-stricken
areas in each of the next few years starting from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The promise was contained in a speech made on September 23,
1996, by Premier Li Peng at the Central Work Conference on
Poverty-Eradication. The full text of his speech was released
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Government loans to help the poor will be increased by three
billion yuan annually, which will be used to develop industries
linked to plantations and cultivation in poor areas, Li said in
his speech.
</P>
<P>
State-owned commercial banks will also provide funds for
help-the-poor program.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor people in rural China had decreased from 250
million in 1978 to 65 million by the end of 1995, Li said, hailing
it an enormous historic achievement.
</P>
<P>
Though the number of people living below the poverty line has
declined, it will be harder to accomplish the task of eradicating
poverty in coming years, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments should make concerted efforts to
fight poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from this year, the ratio of government funds used in
anti-poverty campaigns in various provinces should make up 30 or
50 percent of the amount earmarked by the central government, in
light of the economic conditions of specific provinces.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged all localities to work out measures in line
with local conditions. However, he stressed, all provinces should
carry forward the hard-working spirit, and follow the principle of
sustained development.
</P>
<P>
He promised that more large and key projects will be built in
the central and western parts of China in the country's Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000). Last year saw 44 percent of the
new projects started in the western areas.
</P>
<P>
An essential factor to retard economic growth in
poverty-stricken areas lies in the low quality of the population,
a poor educational background and inefficient management, Li
stated.
</P>
<P>
He called on poor areas to eradicate poverty by means of
science, technology and education, practise family planning and
raise the population quality.
</P>
<P>
It is entirely possible that China will attain the goal of
eliminating poverty in rural areas by the end of this century, Li
said with confidence.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Settlers: PM Will Approve Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has told Hebron settlers that, on the day the
Hebron agreement is signed, they will be given permission to
expand their community in the city, the Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Settlement spokesman David Wilder was quoted as saying Sunday
that they will build on a number of plots that belong to
Jews in the center of the Palestinian city. He added that
the plots in question include two in Tel Rumeida, a plot of
land in the Avraham Avinu complex.
</P>
<P>
One of the plots is located across the street from Beit
Hadassah and another near Beit Romano, where an Israeli army base
is currently situated.
</P>
<P>
Wilder said this promise was given within the last two
months and various plans for these plots have been drawn up
and now are in different stages of completion. All the plots are
in the area that is to remain under Israeli control after
the army redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that building on these plots will enable
the influx of an additional "couple hundred" Jewish families to
the city. Currently, there are some 35 Jewish families and close
to 200 Jewish students in Hebron amid a population of 200,000
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office Sunday night neither confirmed nor
denied the settlers' claims, and a spokesman only said that the
claim "is being looked into," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said last week that Israel will "redeploy in
Hebron, not from Hebron," and the settlers will remain in
Hebron for good.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians demand that the settlement in the city
will be uprooted under a final status agreement to be signed in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Maize Shortage Causes Flour Price Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The cost of maize flour has
gone up by 20 percent in the last three months and the flour
prices shot up steadily due to shortage of maize, the East
African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources from the agricultural sector as
saying that prices of maize meal are about to double what they
were in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Erratic rains in April last year at the start of the growing
season in Kenya adversely affected early planted crops, according
to a food situation report compiled by the Inter-governmental
Authority on Development.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the report added, low farm prices discouraged
farmers from expanding the production of maize, the main staple
food of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The long rains maize production for 1996 is estimated by
Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture at two million tons, 20 percent
decline compared with 1995, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The overall cereal production is estimated at 3.8 million tons
for the 1996/97 marketing year while the total consumption needs
4.5 million tons in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Kenya's cereal import requirements for
1996/97 are estimated at 674,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Following poor rains in the vulnerable areas of Eastern,
Northeastern and Rift Valley provinces, about 1.5 million Kenyans
may require relief food in the east African country which has a
population of 28 million.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi in a New Year address
declared that shortage of staple food is one of the major
challenges facing Kenya in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader noted that food shortages had been brought
about by mainly droughts in the eastern and northeastern
provinces as well as poor harvests of maize in the main producing
areas in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Customs Revenue Up 46 Percent in 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Customs Service
recorded a revenue of some 69.3 billion Naira (about 866 million
U.S. Dollars) in the first 11 months of last year, an increase of
46 percent over the same year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
According to the government-owned New Nigerian newspaper
today, the general increase in all customs houses across the
country was attributed to the resolve of the customs management
to ensure its revenue collection machinery is strengthened in
furtherance of the economic interests of the country.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Sole Administrator of the Customs, S.O.G.
Ango as saying that 48.4 billion Naira, or nearly 70 percent, of
the total revenue was credited into the federation account, which
represented total collections from imports, excise and fees.
</P>
<P>
The remainings were collected by the customs on behalf of some
other government agencies, including the Nigerian Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
To sanitize the industry in an image-building effort, the
customs service has recently carried out some reorganization with
dismissals and disciplinary measures.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 20 senior customs officers have been
fired for official misconduct ranging from illegal clearance of
containers, undervaluation of imported goods to collusion with
unscrupulous importers and clearing agents in evading duty.

<HEADLINE> Elections Law Disputed in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A dispute has surfaced again in
the kingdom over a temporary elections law, with some people
reiterating their committment to the "one-person, one-vote"
principle while others calling for its annulment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing political party members, deputies of the House of
Representatives and other officials at a workshop entitled "Civic
Society and the Elections Law" held here Sunday, Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti stressed that his government
"believes that the only principle which should be retained in any
new election law is that of one-person, one-vote."
</P>
<P>
This principle was stated by Kabariti as the basis of any
democratic parliamentary system throughout the world, Jordan Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
In view of the government's committment to retaining the
"one-person, one-vote" principle, opposition deputies called for
the annulment of the present temporary law and its replacement
with either a law based on votes equal to the number of seats in
every electoral district under the present system, or a law of
representation by party or bloc list.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers asserted that the present election law
violates a number of constitutional principles such as equality
among the voters, the principle of public elections and the
allocation of seats for religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
Wa'ad Party Secretary General Anis Muasher proposed that the
kingdom be divided into equally populated constituencies with
each presented by one deputy in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
An Al Ahd Party representative suggested that the country be
divided into 125 electoral constituencies with one representative
for every constituency. The representative also called for greater
government support for political parties with greater
parliamentary representation.

<P>
In response, Kabariti said that "with a new elections law we
aim to promote democracy benefiting from the previous experiences
and we intend to entrust a judicial committee with (the power of)
supervising the elections and guaranteeing government's
neutrality," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Because a draft election law is a national project, it should
involve all public sectors, political groups, professional
unions, popular organizations and other national groups," the
prime minister said, adding that "the government has already
started contacts with these organizations in order to arrive at a
common denominator that would serve as a broad basis for the new
law."
</P>
<P>
"But, to be honest, the government does not feel it can yet
submit a draft law that enjoys the minimum level of approval by
various sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he stressed, feels that the method used in
applying or implementing the present law is open to a number of
questions that justify the calls for its revision, especially
with regard to electoral constituencies and the method used in
granting quotas for minorities.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized by the Center for Jordanian
Studies at the Yarmouk University and the Al Riyadh and
Information Center.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reaffirms Commitment to Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan has
called for increased committment to achieving a just,
comprehensive and durable peace in the Middle East, warning that
violence would endanger the entire Arab-Israeli peace process,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Radio Israel Sunday, Hassan also
reaffirmed Jordan's total support for the Palestinian people's
rights, including the right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Referring the backdrop of serious difficulties encountered in
the implementation of the agreements signed between Israel and the
Palestinians, Hassan said that "at this critical stage, we should
be more committed to achieving a just and comprehensive peace" in
the Middle East, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The latest acts of violence and the escalation of unrest in
the region might affect the whole peace process," he said in an
implicit reference to a shooting incident by an Israeli soldier
against unarmed Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron and
the bombing of a bus in central Damascus last week.
</P>
<P>
At least seven Palestinians were wounded in the Hebron attack
while the Damascus bombing claimed 13 lives.
</P>
<P>
Hassan stressed that the Arab and Islamic identities had to be
protected and defended so as to secure a better life for the
future generations.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has played and will continue to play a significant role
in the regional and international arena, he said, referring to
the kingdom's participation in the Washington summit late last
year that produced an Israeli-Palestinian agreement to resume
stalled negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China has published a
"five-character-poem" to promote education in ethical and cultural
progress, mainly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The poem, each line with just five Chinese characters,
follows the form of ancient textbooks which were used by the
followers of Confucius to encourage ordinary people to do good.
</P>
<P>
The new publication has been updated with the addition of
contemporary concepts advocated by the Chinese Communist Party,
while preserving the fine traditional moral lessons.
</P>
<P>
It was originally written by Wu Shukuan, a 68-year-old farmer
in central China's Henan Province. The lengthy poem was then
revised with the help the of the Henan Daily.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese Communist Party members as well as ordinary
citizens have written letters praising the publication for its
simple form and explicit contents that can be understood by most
people.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Debt Crisis Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
facing an arduous task to vitalize the national economy as the
debt burden and cost of debt servicing keep on rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures available here, Pakistan's
accumulated foreign debts and loans have reached an astonishing 55
billion US dollar figure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the Pakistani government should give
the debt problem maximum attention and move for relief by debt
reduction, concessional interest rates and extended maturities.
</P>
<P>
And these objectives could be achieved by, among others,
cutting down the current expenditure, increasing tax revenue,
curbing the domestic demand, attracting foreign investment as well
as promoting export.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Pakistan's total foreign debt has risen to
28.60 billion dollars, an increase of 1.53 billion dollars within
a year, even after adjustment of debt service amounting to 2.10
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Because of the heavy debt service payments, the net gains or
transfer of foreign credit over the years have been declining
sharply, coming down from 1.36 billion dollars in 1988-89 to a
mere 388 million dollars in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
This means that most of what Pakistan borrows is used to
service its ever growing debt.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the debt service figure of 2.1 billion
dollars, which represents a quarter of the country's export
receipts and over 3.4 percent of the GDP, does not include
interest on short-term borrowing and charges of the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, while the long-term debts have been rising
slowly, the medium and short-term loans have grown fast, almost
three times the rate of growth in long-term debt both in 1995-96
and the five-year period ending June 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
The share of the long-term external loans declined last year to
80.7 percent of the total debt from 89.5 percent in 1990-91, while
the share of the medium and short-term debt rose from 10.5 percent
to 19.3 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Remittances from overseas Pakistanis, which once played a
significant role in bridging the balance of payments gap, are
shrinking fast, going down from three billion dollars a decade ago
to less than two billion dollars now.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has to pay almost half a billion
dollars at an annual interest rate of six percent on about eight
billion dollars deposited in their foreign exchange accounts by
resident and non-resident Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
It has also obtained about 1.5 billion dollars through foreign
banks functioning in Pakistan to enable them to enlarge their
business here and has now offered 17 percent interest to those
banks who rush in foreign exchange funds as the government
desperately needs them to service its debt.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Pakistan's debt servicing liability is
expected to increase further in the next few years, claiming
approximately 70 percent of the total revenue. Thus Pakistan will
have to borrow more to overcome the shortfall in budget, and meet
the requirement of development and current expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Some of the glaring weaknesses in the development process of
Pakistan are believed to include:
</P>
<P>
-- Too much dependence on the public sector and neglecting the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
-- Asymmetric reliance on foreign aid and lack of development
on the technological front.
</P>
<P>
-- Inadequate development of the needed infrastructure and
institutional structure.
</P>
<P>
-- Instability of political management of the country.
</P>
<P>
Although all these factors play their respective role in
obstructing the smooth growth of the economy, what seems to have
disturbed the economy most has been the asymmetric growth of the
public debt, especially the one owed to foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal policy has been one of the weakest areas of the
macro-economic management in this country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Persistent large deficits financed mainly by bank borrowings,
has created severe fiscal problems. An unremitting increase in the
current expenditure is a marked feature of the fiscal landscape,
mainly due to large outlays for debt servicing and defense
expenditure, which together account for 81.42 percent of the
current expenditure of the 1995-96 budget.
</P>
<P>
Another major weakness of the budgetary policy is the
inelasticity of the revenue and a narrow tax base.
</P>
<P>
Although the fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies are
the three policy instruments, the fiscal policy undoubtedly
occupies the central position, particularly in the developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Fight Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that his administration would intensify the fight
against poverty to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Development is meaningless if it does not benefit the bottom
third of our population who are still poor," the president said in
a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Development Bank of
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said the resources of the bank should be channeled to the
fight against poverty that is hindering the sustained economic
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The rich have less need of development because they can take
care of themselves but it is the poor that need more help to
develop", he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines enjoyed a robust economic growth of seven
percent last year and was commended as "a newest tiger" in Asian
economies. Its gross national product (GNP) per capita has already
exceeded 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, 35 percent of the country's population are still
living in poor conditions.
</P>
<P>
To face the challenge, Ramos has put poverty alleviation as one
of his top priorities for 1997 when he delivered an address to the
nation on the first workday after New year's day.

HOHHOT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The output value of rural
industrial firms in Inner Mongolia surged 80 percent to 111
billion yuan in the first 11 months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive year that the region's
township-run enterprises had maintained a rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises paid a total of 3.7 billion yuan in taxes to
the government during the first 11 months of 1996, up 83 percent

</P>
<P>
The region began to introduce funds, technology and technical
personnel from economically-developed coastal areas in east China,
sending delegations to learn advanced expertise.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials from the regional government visited Beijing and
Shanghai cities and Shandong and Liaoning provinces last

</P>
<P>
Officials from 12 leagues and cities in Inner Mongolia toured
29 provinces and autonomous regions to forge economic and
technological ties.
</P>
<P>
Local rural firms held a large trade fair last year in a bid to
promote inter-regional economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Carrying Out Reform on Water Conservancy Property Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Water has been turned into cash in
Northwest China's Shaanxi Province. The province has gained
lucrative profits from water conservancy projects by changing
its property right relationships.
</P>
<P>
The province has built a series of small-scale water
conservancy projects, including motor-pumped wells, small
reservoirs, pumping stations and irrigation canals over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the projects have not been fully used in recent
years. Half of the motor-pumped wells are at rest, and 30 percent
of pumping stations can not operate. These factors are seen as
potential threats to the ability to combat drought.
</P>
<P>
To change the situation, the provincial government has issued
regulations to reform the small water conservancy property rights
system.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 23 experimental counties, 9,200
projects have carried out property right reforms through auction,
contract, a shareholding system and by renting.
</P>
<P>
The reform has generated 11.25 million yuan (about 1.36 million
US dollars)in earnings, and about 25 million yuan (about 3.04
million US dollars) has been pumped into reforming old water
conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
After the reform, about 28,000 hectares of irrigation coverage
has been restored, together with a 9,000 hectare expansion of
irrigation coverage.

<HEADLINE> Merger of China's Grain Prices Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China should aim this year to
unify its price for purchasing grain under state-set quotas with
the market price, according to an article in the magazine
"Outlook" published today.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Wang Lingui, an official at the State Grain
Reserve Administration, as saying that the time was right for such
a move and that grain price rises had showed a marked decline last
year, providing a favourable climate for the reform.
</P>
<P>
China also has an ample supply of grain after achieving good
grain harvests for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing price of grain subject to the state quota rose
by 42 percent this year, while the price of marketable grain has
declined.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of grain sold on the market is similar to
that on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Wang stated that the annual state grain-collection quota of 50
billion kilograms will remain unchanged. This will enable the
state to guide grain production in a planned way, stabilize the
acreage sown to grain crops, and maintain a stable grain price.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing price will be determined by governments at
provincial levels on the basis of the market price. The price will
be allowed to fluctuate within set limits, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The market price forms a principal basis for setting a
purchasing price, but is not the only criteria for the definition
of the purchasing price. Therefore, the purchasing price should
not necessarily follow the market price, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the purchasing price should not be fixed on a once
and for all basis. It should fluctuate in accordance with the time
difference. In this way, farmers will become enthusiastic about
storing grain at home for a time, alleviating the pressure on the
state to pay cash to farmers during harvest periods, and providing
adequate space for newly-harvested grain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, building a protective price system, which will set a
ceiling on the market price and the bottom line of the purchasing
price, is a must, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the improvement of the grain reserve system and
the grain risk fund system constitutes the foundation for the
introduction of the protective price system.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Reschedule Its 1.3 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will seek to
obtain debt relief of up to 1,341.4 million U.S. Dollars at the
forthcoming Paris Club negotiations likely to be held this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner organized by the Confederation of
Tanzania Industries (CTI) at Sheraton Hotel here on Saturday
night, President Benjamin Mkapa said the amount was only
equivalent to 17 percent of the entire external debt commitments
of the country.
</P>
<P>
By October 31 last year the foreign debt incurred by Tanzania
have reached at 7,847.9 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said relief could come in two ways, first by
cancellation of debts, likely to affect commitments of about
221.3 million Dollars, and then by rescheduling debts, touching
on 1,130.1 million Dollars worth of commitments.
</P>
<P>
He said that the debt cancellation and rescheduling process
would give the country a breathing space of 16 years and
thereafter a repayment period of 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa pointed out that some people tended to ignore many
long-term benefits of continued reform and sound macro-economic
management and poured critizism on the government by "amplifying
the few short-term adverse effects of a tight fiscal policy."
</P>
<P>
"The debt relief we are talking about is quite substantial,"
he said, emphasizing that it will have a significant impact on
the country's capacity to invest in human resources development,
social sector development, law and order and the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The government spends about 40 percent of its collected
revenue to service debts, earning criticism from the opposition
and some economists that it ignored pressing problems especially
in social services.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The city of Daqing, well-known
for its oilfields in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, has
launched a program to make the city green.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at improving the quality of the city's
environment by planting trees along both sides of the roadways.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Jiexin, deputy mayor of the city, more trees
will be planted in and around the city, and the rate of green land
will be increased to 37.6 percent from the current 26.1 percent by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
This means that each local resident will have 11.9 sq meters of
public green space when the program is completed. A tree belt will
also be built, surrounding the city and all of its adjacent towns.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 8.5 million trees, as against the 600,000 in
1980, in addition to 2.19 million sq meters of grassland.

issued an ultimatum to the Philippine National Police and the
National Bureau of Investigation to arrest fugitive congressman
Romeo Jalosjos, who was charged with raping an 11-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
He issued the statement this morning after the agents of the
National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National
Police failed to arrest Jalosjos, a Representative from Zamboanga
Del Norte province.
</P>

Joint operatives from the Special Action Force and the Criminal
Investigation Group of the Philippine National Police have

Local reports said Jalosjos has already fled through the
southern Philippines but Bureau of Immigration officials insisted
he is still in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Makati Regional Trial Court in Manila has issued 14
warrants of arrest against Jalosjos since December 26 for two
counts of rape and 12 counts of acts of lasciviousness.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Investigation today offered a
50,000-peso (1,865 US dollar) reward for the capture of the

NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are
scheduled to meet in Kampala next February to harmonize their
labor laws, the newspaper East African reported today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 17,000 Polluting Enterprises Shut down in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has shut down 17,000 small enterprises which had been causing
serious environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the firms were mostly involved in
industries such as leather tanning, dyestuffs, paper making and
coking with outdated methods. Among the shutdown enterprises,
1,380 were paper-making mills.
</P>
<P>
Though the move may have some influence on the province's
economy, it was deemed a necessary measure to achieve sustainable
development, and a shift in economic growth modes from a long-term
point of view, and will produce good environmental benefit, local
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth implementation of the shut-down ruling,
relevant departments of the province sent two inspection teams to
check and monitor the closure work and solve any problems.
</P>
<P>
The province has already recorded a fall of 376 million tons in
the volume of industrial waste water discharged, greatly reducing
pollution and improving its environment, especially on the lower
reaches of the Yellow River that flows through it.

are for lower basic education, grades eight to nine for middle
basic education and grades 10 to 11 for higher education.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Association of Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) has urged the Zambian government
to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI Chairman George Chabwera also said the country's
agricultural policy must focus on food self-sufficiency and a
surplus for export.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted him as saying that in order to
promote economic growth, the government should first reduce its
borrowing by way of treasury bills and then broaden its tax base,
even if it means revising the poll tax, and cut public spending.
</P>
<P>
He said that many people feel frustrated at the poverty and
tragedies afflicting Africa in spite of the several billions of
Dollars poured on African economies since 1960s by donors.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Africans in sub-Saharan Africa are poorer now than
in 1960s. This need not be the case in Zambia," said the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We must provide extension and marketing and introduce new
export for such crops as beans, cassava and rubber, which can
easily be grown by small-scale farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for incentives to promote investment in
education to help parents to push their children to do well in
school.

FUZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province will seek more
overseas funding to boost its tourism industry by providing more
preferential terms to overseas investors, according to a senior

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation up in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation rate in the
Philippines moved up to 5.1 percent in December 1996 from 4.5
percent in the previous month, bringing the average inflation rate
for the year to 8.4 percent, 0.3 percent higher than that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here today, the National Statistics Office
attributed December's higher inflation rate to price increases of
most commodity groups in the month.
</P>
<P>
"Except for the miscellaneous items group where inflation
remained at 1.7 percent, all the other commodity groups had higher
rates in December," it said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the services index posted the highest rate
at 12.7 percent with an increment of 1.8 percentage points from
its previous month's level.
</P>
<P>
The food, beverages and tobacco rate increased by 2.5 percent
in December from 2 percent in November, clothing by 4 percent from
3.7 percent, housing and repairs 8.9 percent from 8.6 percent and
fuel, light and water 9.9 percent from 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though the 1996 inflation rate of 8.4 percent was a bit higher
than that of 1995, it was lower than the government's target of
8.7 percent for the year.

GUANGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A well-preserved 170-year-old
meal ticket has been found in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The brand new looking 16.7 cm-by-10 cm ticket was made with
high-quality paper in Xuancheng, in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Huang Runquan said he obtained the ticket at a market a few
years ago when he was on a business trip.

The ticket, with five rows of Chinese characters under four
bigger blue ones, is estimated to have been printed in 1827 in the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The find shows that there has been a long tradition of Chinese
people using meal tickets instead of cash.

<HEADLINE> IOC Split over World Youth Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) divided over a World Youth Games expected to be
held in Sydney in 1999 prior to the 2000 Olympics, an IOC
executive board member said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A World Youth Games is a distinct possibility," former IOC
vice-president and current executive board member Kevan Gosper
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
An informal working party was set up to examine its feasability
by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch during the Atlanta Games,
and will report its findings to the next executive board meeting
in the first week of March.
</P>
<P>
A final decision could be reached at the IOC general meeting in
Lausanne, Switzerland, in September.
</P>
<P>
"When Samaranch floats a new initiative you can be certain he
has given it a lot of thought and he is usually right," Gosper was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is very much a split in the IOC. Half of the members are
in favor, half not, and I'm one of those against it," said
Gosper. "I don't think it would add a new dimension to the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to be careful that we don't get so much
Olympic activity that it becomes just another competition."

<HEADLINE> "World's Roof" Rose to Present Height 800,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the
world's highest table - known as "the roof of the world" rose to
its present height 800,000 years ago, Chinese scientists have
revealed.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, overseas scientists have believed that the
Plateau elevated to its height of 3,000 meters above sea level
eight million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on the latest geological discoveries on
the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Professor Sun Honglie, the country's
top scientist in this field, and member of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said that a great amount of geological samples and
fossils of ancient life collected by Chinese scientists during
dozens of scientific expeditions over the past four years have
indicated that the plateau began to rise at an accelerating speed
3.4 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
"About 2.5 million years ago, the plateau rose to an elevation
of nearly 2,000 meters, prompting the appearance of monsoon, a
type of climate which is characteristic of southern and eastern
Asia, particularly India," Professor Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
"800,000 years ago, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau rose to an average
elevation of between 3,000 meters and 3,500 meters, with a large
part of the land freezing, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientists also used a high resolution drill to
obtain a sample of the plateau's core dating back to 125,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The core has indicated that the climate of the plateau is
sensitive and has changed a lot," Professor Sun noted, "the
plateau was fast in entering a glacial epoch, but slow in becoming
warmer."

<HEADLINE> China Reduces Traveling Hours to Dam Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Journeying between China's
capital Beijing and the famous Three Gorges Dam site was an
obstacle course until recently.
</P>
<P>
The most convenient trip from Beijing to the dam construction
site of the gigantic Three Gorges Project included a two-hour
flight to central China city Wuhan, and then a bus journey of more
than ten hours on bumpy roads.
</P>
<P>
Now people in Beijing can fly directly the Three Gorges Airport
in 100 minutes, and then drive to the Yichang-based dam site in 40
minutes along an expressway.
</P>
<P>
Since China embarked on the construction of the 17-year Three
Gorges Project, and started resettlement work for the world's
largest water-control scheme, governments at various levels have
made heavy investments in the development of high-speed
transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
The government of Hubei Province, in central China, has
invested over two billion yuan (about 24 million US dollars) in
completing an expressway from Huangshi to Yichang, shortening the
travelling time between Wuhan and Yichang from eight hours to
three. The state has also invested in the construction of a
special expressway from the center of Yichang to the dam
construction site. It shortened the travelling time between the
two spots from two hours to 30 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange to Revise Listing Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) will revise its listing requirements this year on company
track records and registered capital so as to increase the quality
of listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Under revised regulations the SET will recruit only qualified
companies into the exchange under new listing criteria, according
to SET Senior Vice President Patareeya Benjapholchai.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, applicants for listing in the SET must
record profits for five consecutive years, as compared with the
current requirement for a profitable track record for at least
three years.
</P>
<P>
As to registered capital, the applicants must be capitalized
with at least 200 million baht (8 million US dollars), doubling
the current requirement of 100 million baht (4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Minimum market capitalization will also be raised to 1.5
billion baht (60 million dollars), up from 750 million baht (30
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The revisions have been well studied and are waiting for board
approval, according to Patareeya.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the SET will launch a campaign to lure large companies
into the exchange, rather than waiting for companies to contact
it.
</P>
<P>
A large number of big companies will help attract both domestic
and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Among new entries will be companies which will be listed under
special requirements aimed at encouraging investments in basic
industries, such as steel and power.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Step In to Spur Property Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is expected
to put some financial measures into effect soon to aid the
country's ailing property sector as it is rolling out an action
plan to bail out the troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the central bank are ready to
implement low-interest loans for employees of state enterprises
and civil servants to buy houses immediately after the cabinet
approves the measure.
</P>
<P>
The measure is part of an 18-point action plan announced last
month by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan
as a concrete action to spur demand in the country's sluggish
property market.
</P>
<P>
The government housing bank will set aside 20 billion baht (800
million US dollars) to back the measure, which will allow state
enterprise employees and civil servants to borrow loans at an
interest rate of 8-9 percent for first-time house purchases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, under the measure, the government also plans to
cut house transaction fees for those state employees who need to
transfer houses.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the government will set up property funds and
relax rules concerned as long-term measures to increase demand in
the property market.
</P>
<P>
Reviving the ailing property sector is one of the main targets
set by the government led by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
to boost the country's economy in the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish property market in the country contributed
significantly to the country's economic slowdown last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets New Target for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has set a new
target of 12.5 million tourist arrivals by the year 2000 with
earnings of 15.7 billion Ringgit (about 6.28 billion US dollars),
making tourism one of the top foreign exchange earners for the
country.
</P>
<P>
The earlier target set in 1990 was 8.5 billion Ringgit (about
3.4 billion dollars), which was achieved in 1994, six years ahead
of time, Director-General of the Malaysian Tourism Promotion Board
Arshad Hashim said at a news briefing today for some 100
journalists covering the ASEAN Tourism Forum which opened here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism was one of the top contributors to the Malaysian
economy last year in terms of foreign exchange," he said
</P>
<P>
Asia remained as Malaysia's top tourist market and neighboring
Singapore was the main contributor in terms of revenue (4.9
billion Ringgit) (about 1.96 billion dollars) last year, followed
by Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the industry's market was highly competitive and
the country had to make concerted efforts to improve its products
and services to make inroads in the international tourism map.
</P>
<P>
Last year, domestic tourists accounted for 7.1 million compared
to 7.5 foreign visitors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourists played a vital role in keeping the local
tourism industry running, particularly during off peak season,
Arshad said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Invites Foreign Investments into Housing Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Ministry of
Construction released today an urban housing development program
worthy of 6.72 billion U.S. dollars, and invited foreign investors
to contribute.
</P>
<P>
The plan, set for the 1996-2000 period, aims at erecting
residential constructions of 54.6 million square meters so as to
increase the per capita household space from 5.8 square meters now
to 6.5 five years later.
</P>
<P>
About 5.25 billion dollars will be invested in the capital of
Hanoi and the city of Ho Chi Minh to construct 38.5 million square
meters of housing space in them.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the existing residential buildings of this
country needs to be repaired or demolished.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Planning and Investment has recently granted
licences for foreign investors to join in two major urban
residential development projects in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city
separately.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi's southern Thang Long urban development project,
estimated at 2.1 billion dollars, is the biggest foreigner-involved
0program ever approved after the Foreign Investment Law was issued
in late 1987.
</P>
<P>
The country's urban population is estimated to increase from 14
million at present to 32 million by the year 2010. To meet the
minimum demand of housing in the urban areas, residential space should
be 256 million square meters by then.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- About four million overseas
Filipinos will not be able to participate in the 1998 elections,
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon said last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted Siazon as saying that
"Logistically it will be a difficult exercise in 1998, and we also
have to work out the procedures," pointing out that there were
only 43 new foreign service personnel last year, but not all of
them were assigned to staff the country's embassies abroad.
</P>
<P>
He added the present setup for embassies abroad would render
Filipino voters there too unwieldy to handle in a single day of
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Even if you handle several batches at a time, you still will
not get the job done in a day," he said. Filipino voters in
various countries average in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the government may attract enough personnel abroad
to implement absentee voting by 2004, adding the demand for
absentee voting from overseas Filipinos has steadily grown in the
last few years.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Resigned Ministers Vow Support to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Five MPs of Nepal's second
ruling the National Democratic Party (RPP), who resigned from the
cabinet last month, have vowed their support to the coalition
government under Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepal Congress (NC)
party.
</P>
<P>
In a sudden change of their attitude to the present ruling
coalition, The five former ministers led by former local
development minister Kamal Thapa issued a joint statement on
Sunday evening, saying they will help give continuity to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The five RPP MPs, believed to be supporters of RPP
parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand, earlier had announced
to withdraw their support to the NC-led government and quit their
seats in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Chand faction of the RPP party voted in favor of a
no-confidence motion against the government tabled by main
opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) in the Parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
However, the censure motion was rejected by the 205-seat lower
house with a vote of 101 in favor and 84 against. It required a
majority of 103 votes to pass in the house.
</P>
<P>
Another RPP faction, led by party president Surya Bahadur
Thapa, chose to remain in the ruling coalition by voting against
the opposition motion.
</P>
<P>
The dispute within the RPP party over the no-confidence motion
has virtually split the party and party leaders are working to
reunite the party by forging a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba Sunday called for cooperation from all RPP
leaders to his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said in a statement that he is determined to implement
the understanding and agreement reached between ruling partners
when the coalition government was formed in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Following the prime minister's statement, the five resigned RPP
ministers said in their statement that they have decided to
support the present government in order to end the existing
political confusion and uncertainty in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 19 from 36 golf
courses in Thailand saw a decrease in membership fees, ranging
from two to 32 percent last year compared to 1995, said a golf
course center.
</P>
<P>
According to the golf course membership exchange center, only
two member courses witnessed an increase in fees, while the other
15 managed to keep their fees unchanged as the country suffered an
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The center said that the year of 1996 was the sixth consecutive
year when Thailand's golf course industry went downhill.
</P>
<P>
Among Thailand's existing 107 private-owned golf courses, the
highest membership fee charged was 900,000 Baht (36,000
U.S. dollars) last year, while the lowest registered 100,000 Baht
(4,000 U.S.dollars).

<HEADLINE> Thai Prisoners Take University Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A Thai university offering
education programs to prison inmates have produced about 100
graduates, with 39 of them still serving their sentences.
</P>
<P>
Since it started enrolling convicts in 1984, the Sukhothai Open
University has turned out about 100 prisoner graduates holding
undergraduate degrees in the fields of law, political science,
management sciences, communication arts, home economics, economics
and liberal arts.
</P>
<P>
A prisoner still in jail for complicity in murder has graduated
with a civil law degree and is now earning a few thousand baht
(one US dollar equals about 25.5 baht) per month in his cell
writing court petitions and doing free-lance accounting.
</P>
<P>
Convicts are hopeful that their newly-earned degrees will boost
their chances of starting new lives after release.
</P>
<P>
However, employers are often reluctant to employ them.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister Chaipak Siriwat said that inmates who
have completed their tertiary education while serving time are as
qualified as any university graduate.
</P>
<P>
He urged society to help them readjust to a normal life,
otherwise all efforts to reform them will be in vain.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, those with university degrees are likely to fare a bit
better in the employment market and certain professions and skills
can be utilized independently, according to a correctional
institute official.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Armed Forces will
re-configure its two major area commands to make them more
effective and efficient, the local newspaper Today reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Arnulfo
Acedera as saying the military will be restructured in preparation
for its ambitious modernization program, which has been endorsed
by both Congress and President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said he wanted to turn the Western Command, which is
based in Palawan island in the southwestern Philippines, into an
Air Force area, and the Visayas Command into a Navy area.
</P>
<P>
Because the Visayas Command has many ports and naval facilities
it should be placed under the command of the Navy, he said, adding
that the Southern Command in Mindanao will remain an Army area
because of the Muslim insurgency there.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said no major changes are expected in Northern and
Southern Luzon, besides the replacement of those commanders who
are set to retire in the next few months.

<HEADLINE> Star Diver from Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Ali Hasan of Kuwait believes he
can whip up a "Desert Storm" in the pool although the only diver
from West Asia finished last in the one-meter springboard
competition in the FINA Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Can he?
</P>
<P>
Even Xu Yiming, head coach of China's national diving team,
said highly of his talent. "With strong takeoff and good entry, a
diver of his quality can be rarely seen in the Chinese team," Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
Hasan was confident in himself. "If I dive the way they
(Chinese divers) do here, I'm sure I can catch up with them."
</P>
<P>
Since he went to Southern Methodist University in Texas of the
United States four years ago, Hasan has been coached by an
American.
</P>
<P>
Once he came home, he was under the charge of Yu Dengbo, a
Chinese coach sent to Kuwait by the Chinese swimming and diving
ruling body.
</P>
<P>
"I've improved tremendously with his help," Hasan said. "He is
a great coach."
</P>
<P>
Hasan, who celebrated his 24th birthday on Saturday, said he
could hardly leave the pool since he started to dive at 11.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait has few decent facilities with most of the pools
outdoor," Hasan said. "I trained in summer and had to stop in
winter."
</P>
<P>
"Only after I went to the United States could I dive all the
year round," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hasan's father, strict with his school study, urged him not to
spend too much time on diving.
</P>
<P>
"He is a good boy, but he never listens to his father's advice
to cut the training time," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Diving isn't a popular sport in the oil-rich desert country
which is crazy about soccer.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the status of the diving in Kuwait," he
said. "It is a great sport to me. I love it."
</P>
<P>
Hasan, now undisputedly No. 1 diver in the Gulf region, has
clinched a silver medal in the Asian-pacific Games in South Korea
in 1995 and last year finished fifth in the Asian Championships in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
In the centennial Olympic Games last summer, he had come close
to causing a surprise until he faltered at the sixth dive after
executing five nearly perfect dives.
</P>
<P>
Inconsistency is Hasan's Achilles' Heel and it cost him dearly
in the FINA Grand Prix here.
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst performance in my life. It's far from my
standard," he said after his poor showing in the three- and one-
meter springboard competitions.
</P>
<P>
His coach said Hasan should spend more time on training.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese divers trained for over eight hours a day, Hasan took
only two hours," Yu said. "If he had more and harder training, he
has a promising future."

<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia has completed the
withdrawal of its troops from Chechnya, a senior Interior Ministry
official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I can officially state that as of today there is not a single
soldier of the Interior Ministry or the Defense Ministry of the
Russian Federation left in Chechnya," Major-General Pavel Maslov,
chief of staff of the Russian Interior Ministry Forces, was quoted
by the Interfax news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry spokesman also confirmed that all troops
stationed in Chechnya had been pulled out.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government sent some 50,000 defense and interior
ministry troops into Chechnya in December 1994 to put down a bid
by separatists to sever Chechnya from Russia and declare an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The military intervention triggered 21 months of on-and-off
fighting in which tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians,
have been killed.
</P>
<P>
A peace deal was finally concluded on August 31 last
year. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has pledged to gradually
withdraw all troops from Chechnya to pave the way for the general
elections in the republic, due to take place on January 27.

<HEADLINE> Snowfall Causes Toll in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital's second
snowfall of the winter took its toll in victims as ankle-deep snow
piled up on the local streets and roads two days ago, causing some
100 traffic accidents and leaving hundreds of victims injured.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim that the snow is the largest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Jishuitan Hospital, which specializes in the
treatment of fractures, said it has treated more than 200 victims
in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 victims a day came to see doctors, most of them
pedestrians and cyclists suffering from broken bones after falling
on the slippery roads, according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The freezing weather and icy roads have caused various injuries
to nearly 600 residents since the first snow fell on December 31,
the hospital claimed.
</P>
<P>
The snow, which started on Friday night, is believed to be
helpful in clearing the air in the city's downtown areas and in
relieving drought in rural areas, but added to traffic problems in
the city.
</P>
<P>
To ensure orderly traffic, the Beijing Traffic Management
Bureau added 1,300 members to its workforce and sent out 300
vehicles to patrol and remove obstacles along snow-blanketed
avenues.
</P>
<P>
The city's environmental sanitation departments have also
sprayed 3,240 tons of salt water on the streets in the past two
days to help melt the snow.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's first winter snow on the last day of 1996 cost the
city's environmental control department 600,000 yuan (about 72,000
US dollars) to help dissolve it by spraying 4,100 tons of salt
water made from 800 tons of salt.
</P>
<P>
During the second snowfall, the Jing-Chang (Beijing-Changping)
Express way was closed temporarily, while flights in and out of
the Capital International Airport was abnormal until yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The snowfall in some parts of Beijing was equivalent to three
millimeters of rain.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Secretary to Decide Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa is giving himself four months to decide if he will
run for the presidency of the country in May 1998, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said de Villa admitted that his possible candidacy
has been the subject of recent discussions among family members.
But he has yet to decide whether to push through with it.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask myself why I should go for (the
presidency) in the light of national perspective, goals and
interest and if I am capable of (being president)," he said.
</P>
<P>
If anointed by President Ramos, de Villa said, he will zero in
on four concerns: poverty alleviation, eradication of graft and
corruption, improvement of the criminal justice system, and
reforms in the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the influential business association Makati Business
Club (MBC) reportedly endorsed de Villa's candidacy for the
president of the country.
</P>
<P>
But this was denied by the group, saying the report was
"incorrect and totally misrepresents MBC's positions in such
matters."
</P>
<P>
The report said de Villa welcomed the support of former
President Corazon Aquino and the Ayalas, another influential
business group in the country, for his possible presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
He said the support is only "natural" since they have always
been supportive of him.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Needs to Do More Before Exit from IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
have to clear three more hurdles to permanently graduate from the
auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July 1997,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The three conditions included the settlement of the country's
oil price stabilization fund deficits and the approval of the
comprehensive tax reform program, Gabriel Singson, governor of the
Philippine Central Bank, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Singson, head of the government's negotiating panel with the
IMF on its exit, said that Manila also needs to fully implement an
automatic oil price mechanism it began introducing last August.
</P>
<P>
After 35 years under IMF conditional lending, the Philippines
is set to complete this year the Extended Fund Facility, the
country's three-year exit program.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF's program, Manila is required to meet certain
targets, including keeping inflation down and restricting growth
of money supply.
</P>
<P>
The government has in the past found some of the targets too
restrictive and wants greater control of its economic options.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Offer Rewards for Reporting on Unauthorized VCDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing authorities will
give rewards for anyone who reports on illegal trading of VCDs,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to serve as a new measure this year to combat
copyright piracy in this capital city, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The measure is expected to weed out rampant illegal audio and
video products by wiping out distribution channels and places to
harbor illegal VCDs," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The rewards ranged from 10,000 yuan (1,025 US dollars) to
100,000 yuan (12,048 US dollars) in line with the number of
illegal VCDs confiscated, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Since December of last year, China has been carrying out a
nationwide crackdown on copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that a total of 55,900 illegal laser discs,
compact discs, video tapes and other electronic publications have
been confiscated this winter.
</P>
<P>
Increasing reports from local residents have been helpful in
cracking these cases, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Sagngau Ledo
village, Sambas district in Indonesia's West Kalimantan province,
which was hit by a tribal riot on December 29, has almost returned
to normal, local military chief said.
</P>
<P>
Antara news agency quoted Tanjungpura regional military XII
commander Major General Namuri Anoem as saying on Sunday that the
people's activities are expected to recover soon in the area, more
700 kilometers north of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Reports said earlier that thousands of people went on a burning
and looting rampage last Thursday in Sagngau Ledo. The riot, which
started from last Monday to Friday, had killed five people and
injured nine others.
</P>
<P>
The riot erupted after a man from Madura island off Java
stabbed two native tribesmen in a row over a woman.
</P>
<P>
As many as 5,146 villagers -- reportedly from Madura -- from
Singkawang village and the surrounding areas who fled their
village are now gradually allowed to return home, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Anoem, about 900 people who were evacuated to
Pontianak are now still accommodated in a Haji dormitory.
</P>
<P>
The military authorities have detained five suspects of the
tribal clashes, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the military commander received a report from the
conflicting tribal groups that they had conducted a peace ceremony
which they hoped would prevent the recurrence of such a rioting.
