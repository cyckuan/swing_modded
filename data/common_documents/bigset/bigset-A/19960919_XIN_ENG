<HEADLINE> France Aims for Deficit Fall in 1997 to Meet EMU Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- France's budget deficit in 1997
will be cut to below three percent of gross domestic product,
meeting the criteria to qualify for European Monetary Union,
the government announced today after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit in 1997 will be 283.7 billion francs (57
billion U.S. dollars), down just 1.5 percent on the expected 288
billion franc deficit for this year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the central government deficit, which was much
smaller than many analysts had predicted, will be achieved in
spite of tax cuts worth 25 billion francs announced in July
designed to revive consumer spending and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
A range of spending cuts and a one-off windfall from France
Telecom will help the government make sure the deficit remains
below three percent of GDP by the end of 1997. That will ensuring
France can meet the conditions set down by the Maastricht Treaty
for joining the single European currency when it is inaugurated on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
After a cabinet meeting to approve the 1997 draft budget, Prime
Minister Alain Juppe announced the government would allow early
withdrawals from tax-free Popular Savings Plans which it hoped
would release some 15 billion francs (3 billion dollars) to boost
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
"This is a budget of support to the economy through lowering of
taxes and through this important measure which will help people on
low incomes who aren't taxed," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
If the government manages to achieve its deficit target to
283.7 billion francs (57 billion dollars), it will have brought
the budget deficit down from six percent of GDP to just under
three percent of GDP in two and a half years, a government
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Finance and Economy Jean Arthuis said central
government spending will be frozen at around 1,553 billion francs
(310 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will raise petrol taxes by six centimes
(1.2 U.S. cents) a liter in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to spending cuts, the government has also managed
to cut its deficit on paper by including funds transferred from
France Telecom. The state telecoms company is handing over 37.5
billion francs to the government to cover future pension
liabilities.

positions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Monthly Trade Deficit Tops Eight-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
shot up to 11.7 billion U.S. dollars in July, reaching its highest
level in more than eight years, the Commerce Department announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that due to a surge in Japanese auto and
foreign oil imports, the July deficit was a sharp 43 percent
higher than the June imbalance of 8.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. worsening imbalance for July reflected a sharp 33
percent increase in the trade deficit with Japan, which rose to
4.3 billion dollars, the highest level since last October. Imports
of Japanese cars and car parts cost 294 million dollars more to
2.9 billion dollars, up 11 percent from the July figure. The auto
sector usually accounts for about two-thirds of the total trade
deficit with Japan.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the department's figure, the U.S. deficit
with China went up a 15 percent to 3.82 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade deficit with Western Europe also rose to an all-time
high of 4.3 billion dollars in July as U.S. exports decreased 2
billion dollars, led by a big decline in civilian aircraft sales.
Imports were up 1.5 billion dollars, led by an increase of 350
million dollars in European car imports.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign oil purchasing rose in July by a 10
percent to 4.7 billion dollars, the highest monthly total since
October 1990. The big growth reflected a rise in the volume of
imports to an average of 8.26 million barrels daily. The price per
barrel increased to 18.24 dollars, up from 18.02 dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The July deficit of 11.7 billion dollars was the peak deficit
in goods and services since they averaged 12.7 billion dollars in
the fourth quarter of 1987.
</P>
<P>
For goods trade, the deficit was 15.6 billion dollars, the
second highest in U.S. history, surpassed only by an imbalance of
15.9 billion dollars in December 1985.
</P>
<P>
For the month, U.S. exports of goods and services totaled 67.2
billion dollars, down a 3.6 percent, while imports rose 1.2
percent to 78.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It left the U.S. trade deficit running at an annual rate of
109.6 billion dollars, higher than last year's deficit of 105.1
billion dollars, the worst showing in seven years.

The vice-premier recounted that the country's achievements over
the years in building water conservancy projects, but explained
that, on the whole, the country's water conservancy facilities are
still inadequate and cannot meet the needs of agricultural
development, handling natural disasters and ensuring the safety of
lives and property.
</P>
<P>
He noted that water conservancy construction is still the weak
link in the country's economic and social develoment.
</P>

<P>
These mainly include: lack of psychological preparation for
heavy flooding; low level of flood-control projects; serious
silting and lowered ability to resist flooding and droughts.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, the vice-premier provided a list of

given to water and soil conservation projects in seven great river
valleys.
</P>
<P>
He called for localities to develop water-saving irrigation
methods for their agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said that construction of water conservancy works is a great
undertaking, transforming nature and improving production
conditions, one which demands a high degree of attention among
those involved.
</P>

<HEADLINE> BA Cuts 5000 Jobs in Its Savings Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- British Airways is to shed
5000 jobs to save one billion pounds (l.56 billion US dollars)
over the next l8 months, British Airways' chief executive Robert
Ayling announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Ayling said savings were needed despite last year's record 585
million pounds (912.5 million US dollars) profit. He hoped job
losses among the 49000 workforce in his company would be
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
"I do not expect wholesale job losses," the chief executive
said in a statement. "Jobs will also be created, and jobs secured.
We will grow and we will improve. I am committed to a strategy of
investment and improved profitability."
</P>
<P>
In what he called a "Step Change" efficiency drive, Ayling said
the announcement marked a further stage on the company's "long
journey from privatization".
</P>
<P>
"The competition is getting better and more efficient. Our
customers expect more but our cost of providing a seat has risen
faster than the price customers pay in a highly competitive
marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Ayling announced the intention to cut costs
to offset continuing falls in average fare levels and the rising
costs of handling more traffic.
</P>
<P>
But the savings plan announced today is expected to mean
ancillary services will be contracted out, the chief executive
said.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions were reported due to meet Ayling for negotiation
later today.

<HEADLINE> NEC Develops New High-Speed Data Transmission Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 18, (Xinhua) -- Japanese electronics giant NEC
said on Wednesday it has developed a high-speed optical data
transmission technology that will allow 600 years worth of data
from a newspaper to be sent in a single second, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The company said the data transmission speed of 2.64 terabytes
a second is a world record, breaking rival Fujitsu's record of 1.1
terabytes set in February. One terabyte is equivalent to one
trillion bytes.
</P>
<P>
The transmission speed is also equivalent to sending 60 movies
worth of data in a single second. NEC claims its new technology
is 1,000 times faster than optical transmission technologies
already on the market, which offer speeds of up to 2.5 gigabytes,
or 2.5 billion bytes.
</P>
<P>
NEC said the new technology will become an essential tool in
meeting growing consumer demand for large-capacity moving-image
transmission technologies such as those used in teleconferencing
and movies, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The company said it will seek to develop and market products
based on the new technology within a few years.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime Falls 9 Percent in US, Report Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Last year saw violent crime
falling more than nine percent in the United States, the largest
drop in a decade, according to a report released Tuesday by the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The data were taken from an annual survey of 100,000 Americans,
conducted by the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report also follows a different Justice Department report
in August that nationwide rate of juvenile violent crime fell
slightly last year for the first time in almost a decade, and th
rate of homicide by juveniles decreased for the second year in a
row, down by 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts point to several factors causing these drops in crime.
they include the aging of population, with baby boomers reaching
middle age, well past their prime years for committing
crime;putting more police officers on th streets; regulating the
sale of handguns and assault rifles; the tripling of the nation's
prison population with tough sentences for criminals,and a growing
use of crime prevention techniques with young people.
</P>
<P>
However, criminologists warned that crime rates may rise in the
future with an expected 20 percent increase over the next decade
in the number of teen-agers, whose crimes have become increasingly
violent.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Britain End Joint Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian and British infantry
forces today concluded three-week joint military exercises in
southern Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Deputy Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
attended part of the exercises today, said the three-week drills
at Qatranah to the south of Amman were aimed at upgrading the
performance of Jordanian forces and to cope with the latest
developments in the fields of military training.
</P>
<P>
He said the exercises were intended to keep pace with the
accelerating military technology and acquire combat skills and
expertise from such highly qualified forces as those of the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The 500-strong British force from the Cyprus-based British
army's 1st battalion joined the games, which were kicked off on
August 27, with the Jordanian Armed Forces' Third Mechanized
Guards Battalion.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale desert exercise today was a mock assault using
mortars, heavy machine-guns and light infantry weapons supported
by two helicopters.
</P>
<P>
A British diplomat said recently that the war games had been
"previously planned and they are not related to the current
events" in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"The drill is a symbol of excellent cooperation between
Jordan and the United Kingdom in the defense field," the
diplomat said. "Both armies stage war games on a regular basis."
</P>
<P>
Jordan has held two military exercises with U.S. troops, one
in the field of air forces in northern Jordan and the other
attended by U.S. marines at the Qatranah area.

<HEADLINE> WB Credit to Improve Financial Reporting in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced the approval of a 28.8 million-US-dollar credit for
enhancing public sector accountability and financial and
accounting systems in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to a press handout issued here today, the credit aims
at strengthening financial reporting, developing public sector
accounting, enhancing public sector accountability and supporting
improved government financial systems.
</P>
<P>
The credit, which has soft terms, will be provided by the
International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's
concessionary lending arm.
</P>
<P>
The credit was approved at the meeting of the Bank's board
Tuesday in Washington of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bank's municipal finance specialist, Graeme Lee, said the
government of Pakistan recognizes that, as it proceeds to open up
its economy and free it from regulatory controls, the need for
modern financial management systems and good governance becomes
paramount.
</P>
<P>
Instead of direct intervention, the government has to design
appropriate fiscal and monetary responses to changing conditions
-- which require a modern set of tools to provide comprehensive,
accurate and timely financial information, he added.
</P>
<P>
The project, for which the credit has been approved, has a
total cost of 37.2 million dollars, of which IDA will finance 28.8
million dollars and the government of Pakistan 8.4 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IDA credit is made on standard IDA terms, with 35-year
maturity.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Outstanding Debt Tops Maastricht Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 18 (Xinhua)-- Germany outstanding public
debt is expected to hit a record high of 2.154 trillion marks (1.4
trillion U.S. dollars) equivalent to 60.1 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP), local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Germany's public debt has nearly doubled since re-unification
in 1990. In 1991 public debt was 41 percent of GDP at 1.17
trillion marks (0.769 trillion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Outstanding public debt hit 2 trillion marks for the first time
and brought debt as a percentage of GDP up to 59.2 percent, just
under the 60 percent level acceptable under the conditions set by
the Maastricht Treaty for EU member countries wanting to join the
single European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Rising budget deficits by both federal and local governments
over the last few years left the average per capita debt in
western Germany last year at 8,000 marks (5,300 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Germany, under pressure from its costly social wealth insurance
scheme, is taking on new debt of about 70 billion marks (46.2
billion dollars) in 1996, exceeding the budgeted limit of 59.9
billion mark (39.53 billion dollars) and nearly double the new
debt of 38.6 billion marks (25.48 billion dollars) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
New states in the former German Democratic Republic have also
seen their outstanding debts rise to 90 billion marks (59.4
billion dollars) in 1995 compared with 33 billion marks (21.78
billion dollars) three years earlier. The average per capita debt
in the former east Germany rose nearly two times from 2,300 marks
(1,500 dollars) in 1992 to 6,400 (4,260 dollars) marks last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute Germany's mountain of debt mainly to its
expensive and comprehensive social welfare insurance which covers
sickness, accidents, disability, retirement and unemployment
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The rising debt is also blamed on aid given by Bonn to the
former east Germany after German unification in 1990 and the
costly project to transfer the country's capital from Bonn to
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
With a debt to GDP ratio of more than the 60 percent target set
by the Maastricht Treaty for EU countries to qualify for European
Monetary Union, the German government has had to launch a package
of austerity measures to cut the budget deficit by 11 billion
marks (7.26 billion dollars) in 1997 and cut planned new debt by
13.5 billion marks (8.9 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Graf's Father Still in Jail as Court Mulls Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Peter Graf, the father of tennis
star Steffi Graf, will remain in jail at least until Tuesday after
a state court said on Thursday it was still considering his appeal
to be freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for a court in Karlsruhe said the court had
reviewed objections from the prosecution to release Graf on bail
and was now waiting to hear the arguments from Graf's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Graf, on trial in a lower court in Mannheim for tax evasion,
has spent the last 13 months in investigative custody. He is
accused of evading 19 million marks (12.58 million U.S. dollars)
of tax on his daughter's earnings between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Mannheim court judge, Joachim Plass, said he ordered Graf
to be released from detention for the rest of the trial because
even if he is convicted, it was unlikely his sentence would be
much longer than the 13 months he has already served.
</P>
<P>
Plass agreed to release Graf on bail of three million marks,
but Graf has been kept in detention because of the appeal by
prosecutors who want him to stay in prison, fearing he might flee
the country.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Congress Urges Other Parties to Help Ratify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party
today appealed to all political parties in the country to help
ratify a controversial border river development treaty with India.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came at the end of a central committee meeting of
the Nepali Congress (NC) Party here today.
</P>
<P>
The NC said in a statement that the Mahakali River Integrated
Development Treaty with India should be ratified for the
preservation of democracy, national interest and the economic
prosperity of the people.
</P>
<P>
A joint meeting of The two houses of parliament is scheduled to
hold a vote Friday on ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed last February in New Delhi, has been hailed
as a watershed in Nepal-India cooperation in water resources
development.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has laid down principles for benefit sharing on the
development of the Mahakali River, Nepal's western boundary with
India, on an equitable basis, Nepali officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the treaty has met strong opposition in Nepal,
especially from some leftist parties.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML), which has 101 MPs in the 265-seat parliament
and holds the key to the treaty's ratification, has demanded
"necessary corrections" to the treaty as a precondition for the
ratification.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's position has forced the parliament to postpone
its decision on the treaty time and again since last week.
</P>
<P>
It is not certain whether the Mahakali Treaty, which needs a
two-thirds majority support, could be ratified at the joint
meeting of parliament.

<HEADLINE> India Develops New Process to Make Superconductors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
developed a new process to make high current density
superconductors called "infiltration and growth (IG)," the Press
Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
At an international symposium held in Mumbai (Bombay),
scientists from India's Defense Metallurgical Research Laboratory
and Hyderabad University said Wednesday that the IG process would
also help in the enhancement of the critical current density to
practically useful magnetic levels in high temperature
superconductors.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have made a hollow cylinder through the IG
process that could suspend relatively big magnets along the axis.
</P>
<P>
The applications in bulk form like energy storage devices and
magnetic shields could be brought only when a process was
developed which allowed the fabrication of near-net shaped and
larger sized components without internal defects and with a
uniform microstructure and superconducting properties.
</P>
<P>
"Inherent differences in IG processing in comparison with the
conventional melt processing samples allowed the generation of
superior microstructures and hence superior superconducting
properties," said the scientists.
</P>
<P>
IG process had also overcome the large porosity that occurred
unpredictably within conventionally melt process due to "melt
creep," they added.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was entitled Advances in Superconductivity: New
Materials, Critical Currents and Devices (ASMCCD 96).

PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of France today
lowered one of its key interest rates, the tender rate, by 0.1
percentage points to 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move, coming a day after the government unveiled a budget
to qualify for the single European currency in 1999, is seen as a
gesture of support by the central bank towards the government
which wanted a rate cut to stimulate employment and consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
This the second time in a month for the Bank of France to
lower its tender rate. The last cut came on August 22 when the
rate was lowered by 0.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The price of shares on the Paris Bourse reacted immediately to
the news, with its CAC-40 index showing a gain of 0.76
percent after the announcement, compared with a gain of 0.47
percent before the announcement.

<HEADLINE> "China Always Respects Universal Principles of Human Rights" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
always respected the universal principles of human rights, a
spokesman of the Chinese group to the 96th conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Qizhen, a member of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, also explained that human rights can be
guaranteed only when principles are connected with the particular
realities of individual countries.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries, the protection of human rights
includes economic development and guaranteeing people's right to
subsistence and development, Zhu said in a general debate. It also
covers improvement in legal system and democracy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, China has dedicated itself to democratic
politics and legal system construction," Zhu said, and the "NPC
has formulated and implemented a series of laws on the protection
of citizens' political, cultural, and social rights."
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also vice-chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee
of the NPC, told the conference that China has joined 15
international conventions on human rights and has fulfilled its
obligations as set forth in the conventions.
</P>
<P>
"On the human rights issue, China strongly advocates
constructive activities and is ready to have constructive
dialogues with all countries," Zhu noted. "We believe the
understanding of human rights cannot be completely the same,
because of differences in social systems, ideology, cultural
traditions, developmental level, and historical background.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot expect that there is a unified pattern in human
rights protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
China favors dialogues for all countries in strict accordance
with the principles of the UN Charter and on the basis of equality
and mutual respect, to increase understanding, alleviate
differences, and seek a common ground while reserving differences,
Zhu explained.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are always some countries and
individuals who try their best to politicize the human rights
issue, and attempt to impose their own views on others, or
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries under the
pretext of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Forests Declining: Government Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The forests in the mountainous
provinces of north Vietnam are disappearing at a rate of about
60,000 hectares every year, leading to serious soil erosion, local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development as blaming slash-and-burn farming and unwise
use of forests for causing the deforestation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remaining forests are declining sharply in
quality due to over-exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that up to 600,000 cubic meters of timber and
12.5 million cubic meters of wood are extracted every year from
forests in the north.
</P>
<P>
But only 40,000 to 50,000 hectares of forest are planted every
year, 10,000 hectares smaller than the area destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the disappearance of forests has resulted in
soil erosion and flash floods which have caused massive human and
material losses for the local people.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plans to Cultivate New Artificial Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is considering a plan to
expand the cultivation of artificial forests to reduce its
dependence on imported wood, which costs some 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Since Artificial forests do not require excessive water
resources and are compatible with Egypt's dry climate, the
Ministry of Agriculture has approved a project to cultivate
500,000 tropical African mahogany trees each year, a local
English-language weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The wood of these trees, which are naturally found in the
African rain forests, is proven by the ministry to be stronger
than that of beech trees, Al-Ahram Weekly quoted Amin Okasha, head
of the ministry's Horticulture Research Institute, as saying.
</P>
<P>
These trees can survive both on fresh and sewage waters,
making it possible to grow them around sanitary drainage
stations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry began cultivating mahogany trees on a small scale
about 28 years ago, Okasha said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdel-Dayem, head of the Forestry Department at the
Horticulture Research Institute, said that Egypt enjoys a number
of factors that facilitate the cultivation of artificial forests,
the first of which is an abundance of vacant land.
</P>
<P>
The second factor is that there are enough water resources to
irrigate the land on which these trees will be planted. The main
source of water will be sanitary and industrial drainage.
</P>
<P>
The only real drawback of artificial forests is that they take
longer time to reach maturity than natural forests, Abdel-Dayem
said.

BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met here
this afternoon with a delegation from the Confederation of Indian
Industry (CII), led by its president, Shekhar Datta.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that China and India are two developing countries
with the world's largest populations, and that they have many
points in common, and that increasing co-operation to solve the
problems that face them, would be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Saying that there is great potential in bilateral economic and
trade co-operation, Qiao suggested increased contacts for better
economic development on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's economic achievements over the past
18 years are remarkable, but that during the period it has also
encountered problems never seen before.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, it increased macro-economic controls and
adopted other necessary measures, resulting in a better handling
of these problems, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, and other international financial organizations
believe that China's economic development is moving forward
normally, and that China will still pay attention to
macro-economic controls to ensure steady, healthy and rapid
development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Datta said that CII is willing to develop greater co-operation
with the Chinese, especially in joint ventures, and holding
exhibitions and trade seminars in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced India's full support for China's early entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Indian guests were invited by the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade.

</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians discussed a draft of a resolution
titled "Promoting Greater Respect and Protection of Human Rights
in General and in Particular for Women and Children", and a draft
from the Chinese Group was used as a basis for the resolution,
with suggestions coming from other parliamentary delegations.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates expressed their support for China's encouraging
human rights and fundamental freedoms in the spirit of the UN

<HEADLINE> Macao Tourism Slightly Up in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists to Macao
rose slightly during the first six months of the year, latest
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
show that a total of 3.94 million visitors arrived in Macao by the
end of June this year, up 2.7 percent from the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains the dominant source of tourists for Macao, but
passengers from Taiwan increased by the largest margin of 125.6
percent from the figures of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of travelers from China's mainland, the
Republic of Korea, Japan, Thailand, the United States of America and
Britain also rose remarkably between 45.3 percent to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of visitors is believed largely the
result of the opening of an international airport which was
inaugurated last November. A total of 158,800 visitors arrived by
air during the period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the figures show that the rate of hotel rooms
occupation reached 57.4 percent, up 2.9 percent from the same period
of last year. The number visitors stayed in Macao overnight hit 1.27
million.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Say Universe Will Expand Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The universe will expand
forever because it contains too little matter to hold it together,
a group of British scientists said in a report in the latest issue
of the science journal, Nature.
</P>
<P>
By observing the most distant galaxies with three telescopes,
the scientists, all from Durham University, said that galaxies
had formed much earlier than previously supposed and that the
formation took place when the universe was between 20 to 30
percent of its present age.
</P>
<P>
That means the universe did not really contain as much matter
as it would have done.
</P>
<P>
"If there were a lot of matter, it would go on clumping and
forming galaxies right up to the present day. That doesn't appear
to have happened," the report said.
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, implied that there would not be enough matter
around to slow down and reverse the universe's expansion, which
would go on forever.

<HEADLINE> Hussein's Militia Tightens Siege on Rivals in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Faction soldiers loyal to
Somali warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid today tightened the siege on
the positions of another warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed in North
Mogadishu's Medina neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Medina said the militiamen who surrounded the
district were confiscating goods and personal belongings,
especially food and fuel, of traders from the district.
</P>
<P>
The confiscated goods were collected at one point just behind
a blockade erected by the gunmen, and were transported to the
Bakara market in South Mogadishu for sale, said an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the militiamen who declined his name, the
strict siege on Medina will continue for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the encirclement is not yet known. Nor did
the administration of Hussein Aidid, son of the late Somali
warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid, make any statement about the new
action taken by the militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Medina neighborhood has been a focal point for Mogadishu's
factional fighting until late General Aidid died 49 days ago.
From then on, there has been a standstill between the soldiers
loyal to Hussein Aidid and Ali Mahdi, but fighting broke out
occasionally.

governments, and parliaments should see to this.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, said that parliaments should not only
contribute to political and economic development in their own
countries, but should serve as models and follow international
relations guidelines.
</P>
<P>
They should play an active role in world peace and development,
and promote friendship, understanding and co-operation among the
people of the world, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
The principle of the inviolability of state sovereignty must be
observed, Cao said. He added that anything that provokes or
aggravates national conflicts, or damages the integrity of
sovereign states and is divisive, must receive the stern
condemnation of the international community, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China will follow the independent foreign policy
of peace unswervingly, and can get along with peoples of all
countries well.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Qizhen, a member of China's NPC Standing Committee, said
that the Chinese government has always recognized and respected
universal principles on human rights, and that human rights can be
guaranteed only when the principles are combined with the
particular realities of the particular country.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries, he noted, the protection of human
rights includes developing the economy, guaranteeing people's
right to subsistence and development, and improving democracy
and legal system.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Secretaries-General of Parliaments also held
a plenary meeting today to discuss the role of parliaments in
diplomatic affairs, restraints on parliamentary power, and
parliamentary responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> "Developing Countries Must Be Self-Sufficient In Food" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The key to securing global
food supplies is to enable developing countries to be
self-sufficient in food by raising grain output, a Chinese
delegate to the ongoing Inter-Parliamentary Conference (IPC) said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Dong Furen, an economist and member of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, said this is the fundamental
issue compared with liberalization of global food trade.
</P>
<P>
He expressed this point of view of China at an IPC session on
"Policies and Strategies to Ensure the Right to Food at the Time
of Globalization of the Economy and Trade Liberalization."
</P>
<P>
Dong pointed out that some countries emphasized only
liberalization of food trade in order to relieve food shortages in
developing countries, but "this can only bring immediate interests
to a few developed, major grain production countries, while doing
no fundamental good to developing countries that do not have
enough food."
</P>
<P>
To solve the food problem, he said, the first thing to do is to
develop agriculture. Developing nations should try their best to
become self-sufficient in food so as to promote long-term economic
growth and social stability in their countries, and in the region
and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"With a large population to feed, China has to rely on its own
to solve the food problem," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he pointed out, China has placed agricultural
development on the top of its priorities in the economic
development plan, and already successfully feeds 22 percent of the
world population with seven percent of the world's farmland.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China produced a total of 465 billion kg of grain, a
4.5 percent increase over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Modern Lifestyle Blamed For Rise In Eye Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Modern life may be to blame
for a sharp rise in the number of people suffering from an
incurable eye disease which leads to blindness.
</P>
<P>
Loss of sight caused by macular degeneration, in which the cell
layer behind the retina begins to rot, has doubled since the 1950s
and now affects more than 500,000 people in Britain, according to
today's Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The disease can be attributed to genetic factors, but
researchers at the Institute of Ophthalmology in London say
pollution, industrial and household chemicals and the modern diet
could also play an important role.
</P>
<P>
Alan Bird, professor of clinical ophthalmology and an expert in
the disease, said the illness had not existed in Japan 20 years
ago but was now the commonest cause of blindness in urban Japan.
</P>
<P>
Professor Bird is to conduct research in urban and rural areas
in England, Spain, Italy and Holland to study the role of genes
and the environment in the disease. Similar studies are to be
done in Japan.
</P>
<P>
A pilot survey showed that the disease was far less common in
southern Italy than in inner London, though the two peoples
display genetic similarity.
</P>
<P>
"The lifestyle of the people in southern Italy is completely
different," Bird said, "They don't shop at supermarkets, and they
grow their own food."
</P>
<P>
Macular degeneration is caused by the build-up of debris in the
cells at the back of the eye, damaging the central part of the retina
but leaving side vision unaffected.
</P>
<P>
One theory is that the increased use of plastics has caused the
entry of a type of chemical called polyphenols into food, which
affects the process of cell breakdown and renewal.

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sharpshooter Wang Yifu has
been hospitalized for 20 days for a neck injury, the injury
believed to have denied him a chance to win back to back in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Chinese, who entered the Olympic air pistol
final minutes after inhale of oxygen, fired the last shot in
blackout caused by the injury.
</P>
<P>
The four-time Olympian wasted a 3.8 points lead, losing the
title to Italian Roberto Di Donna.
</P>
<P>
"Wang has been suffering a very serious injury to his cervical
vertebra," said doctor Bao Zhihong, who is overseeing Wang's
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The injury is believed to be caused by years of shooting, the
sport requiring head to turn to one side," Bao added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese doctor said the X-ray films showed Wang's cervical
vertebra was dislocated and it also grew a spur.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who has won Olympic, world championship and World Cup
titles, said he would pick up the pistol again if the injury could
be healed.
</P>
<P>
"My future depends on doctors," he said. "I won't retire if I
can concentrate, aim and shoot."

HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals Limited (HACTL) is set to establish a new air cargo
handling record for 1996 with cumulative throughput for the first
eight months of this year rising 3.6 percent to 918,326 tons.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures showed that HACTL exports rose 2.4 percent
to 416,201 tons, imports climbed 5.9 percent to 393,074 tons and
transshipments remained relatively static at 109,051 tons for the
period of January-August.
</P>
<P>
The statistics for August showed the continued upward trend
with exports increasing 3.3 percent to 61,186 tons, imports
soaring 11.1 percent to 49,120 tons and transshipments gaining 4.2
percent to 15,178 tons.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Charter, the HACTL's managing director, said the
figures were encouraging, as August is traditionally a fairly
quiet month for importers and exporters alike.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the figures will continue to climb in
the next few months as factories in both Hong Kong and the South

<HEADLINE> Salomon Brothers Optimistic About HK's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A GDP growth of more than
five percent in Hong Kong is attainable this year, given a number
of encouraging trends in consumer expenditure and external trade,
says Salomon Brothers, one of major investment banks in the world.
</P>
<P>
The firm said that despite the fact that the Hong Kong
government has revised its 1996 growth estimate down to 4.7
percent from five percent, Salomon believes growth in excess of or
possibly as high as 5.2 percent, is achievable.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Chan, the firm's regional economist, said that one of the
major factors contributing to his firm's expectation for a
continued improvement in the GDP (gross domestic product) growth
rate is the recovery in retail sales during the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales growth indicates a rise in total consumer
expenditure, which accounts for 60 percent of GDP, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the recovery is still modest, retail sales growth has
now broken through the negative growth period of 1995, which
registered a 1.4 percent shrinkage, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the actual basis of the actual growth of real retail sales
in the second quarter of the year, it is expected that consumer
expenditure will grow in the same quarter by about 4.6 percent on
a year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The bottoming out of the decline in export growth in China will
help revive Hong Kong exports and particularly re-exports. As a
result, the trade deficit for 1996 could improve, and this will
narrow the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The continued delay in the long-expected increase in the
short-term US interest rates will help alleviate its negative
impact on the improving property market and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
He said that the changes in the components of the official
forecast also point to some encouraging developments for Hong
Kong's growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, growth in 1996 will be driven more by
favorable developments in consumption, investment and external
trade rather than by fluctuation in inventories.

Inter-Parliamentary Conference today.
</P>

1990s, the international situation became relaxed to some extent,
but that power politics, ethnic hatred, regional wars, and
unbalanced global economic development still exist.

All countries in the world must cooperate on an equal footing,
and try to establish a new environment which is good for peace and
development, he said.
</P>

peaceful means, and establishing a mechanism for dialogue and
negotiations.

politics is not decreasing in some countries, but is in fact
getting worse, and has become a major obstacle to world peace.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
is planning to improve social dialogue between trade unions,
employers and institutions within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Commission says the time has come to reflect on the entire
framework of the social dialogue at EU level, to reform and adapt
it in view of the major policy challenges facing the EU.
</P>
<P>
To kick off the debate, the EC today published a consultative
document, or communique, to stimulate discussion between the
social partners (trade unions and employers) and European
institutions on the most appropriate way forward for the future
development of social dialogue.
</P>
<P>
EU Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn pointed out that
this is the first occasion on which the EC has expressed an
overall position on different aspects of the social dialogue at
EU level.
</P>
<P>
The communique sets out a number of possible reform measures
designed to strengthen the social dialogue both at sectoral and
inter-professional levels and to make it more adaptable.
</P>
<P>
It makes suggestions for rationalizing structures and
optimizing the allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the document identifies a number of questions
concerning important, and sometimes sensitive issues, where a
debate is required in order to identify the best solutions.
</P>
<P>
The social partners and the EU institutions must submit their
views and suggestions on the questions raised in the document by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The EC will issue a second Communique in 1997 setting out
clearly the steps to be taken.

PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament today
voted to block a 53 million ECU (70 million U.S. dollars) special
aid package to Turkey because of what it called a "deterioration
in the human rights situation" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted 319 for,
23 against the resolution with 20 abstentions, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament accused Turkey of "increasing
provocation in the Aegean Sea and in Cyprus, and aggressions in
the north of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The special aid is part of the agreement between the European
Union (EU) and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament also called on the European Commission
not to allow Turkey access to EU aid under the "Meda" program for
Mediterranean countries, except for projects concerning the
"promotion of democracy and human rights."
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemned "the brutal assassination of two Greek
Cypriots by Turkish soldiers supported by para-military forces,"

<HEADLINE> India Imposes Presidential Rule in Gujarat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian cabinet today
decided to dismiss the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in
Gujarat and impose presidential rule in the western Indian state,
the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken as the constitutional machinery in the
state has been plunged into crisis following a recent split in the
ruling BJP in the state, which was caused by disputes between some
BJP leaders in the state and BJP national leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a vote of confidence in the state government on Wednesday,
the opposition members in the state assembly hurled microphones
and pin- cushions at the speaker and chief minister.
</P>
<P>
The violence left over two dozens people injured with blood
spilling in the hall and corridors of the Gujarat state assembly.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling party managed to secure a mandate by a
margin of 92 votes against nil in the vote of confidence, Gujarat
Governor Krishna Pal Singh said in his report to the Indian
government on Wednesday night that it could not be conclusively
established that the BJP government in the state enjoyed a
majority.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was a "breakdown" of the constitutional
machinery in the state which could not be run in accordance with
the provisions of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting of the cabinet this morning, Prime
Minister H.D. Deve Gowda decided to bring the state under
presidential rule for an initial period of six months after
considering Governor Singh's report.
</P>
<P>
The move was condemned by the BJP but welcomed by the Congress
party and some other parties.

<P>
-- Pope Jean Paul II began a visit to France this morning which
will see him preside over a controversial ceremony in Reims
marking the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis, a

Serb entity from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians attending
the 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference continued their discussion
on a draft resolution on human rights here today.
</P>
<P>
The draft, "Promoting Greater Respect and Protection of Human
Rights in General and in Particular for Women and Children," has
47 articles.
</P>
<P>
While focusing on problems facing children caused by social and
economic insufficiencies, natural disasters, armed conflicts,
economic and sexual exploitation, illiteracy, and hunger, the
draft should not neglect the harm done to children's rights by
violence, drug trafficking, and terrorism, according to a delegate
from Peru. The suggestion was accepted by the participants.
</P>
<P>
According to a member of the Drafting Committee, which consists
of representatives from 11 countries, a draft submitted by the
Chinese Inter-Parliamentary Group was unanimously approved, and
suggestions from French, Chilean, German, and Canadian
parliamentarians were taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The conference received 21 draft resolutions and 24
memoranda. In the name of the Latin American Group, a
parliamentarian from Chile wanted to incorporate opposition
against power politics in the draft.

MACAO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists to Macao
 rose slightly during the first six months of this year, the
latest statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
showed that a total of 3.94 million visitors came to Macao by the
end of June this year, up 2.7 percent from the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains the dominant source of tourists for Macao,
but passengers from Taiwan increased by the largest margin of
125.6 percent compared with the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of visitors from China's mainland,
South Korea, Japan, Thailand, the United States and Britain also
rose between 4.3 and 45.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of visitors is partly attributed to
the opening of an international airport in Macao last November. A
total of 158,800 visitors arrived by air during the period.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that the occupancy rate of hotels
reached 57.4 percent, up 2.9 percent from the same period of last

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An Agreed Minute of the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) on Hong Kong's Container
Terminal 9 (CT9) has been signed here today, which is believed to
help maintain the region's status as an international shipping
center.
</P>
<P>
According to the Agreed Minute, the two sides have discussed on
a number of occasions the question of the Hong Kong government's
proposal to grant the development rights of CT9 by private treaty.
</P>

CT9 on the rationalization of berths at the Kwai Chung port and
reached a common view, the Minute says.
</P>
<P>
It says that both sides consider that the above-mentioned
agreement, which was concluded by the relevant commercial parties
within the framework of the consensus in principle reached between
the two foreign ministers in respect of the settlement of the
question of CT9, will contribute to maintaining and enhancing Hong
Kong's status as an international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
The specific arrangements for the provision of land required in
the 1996/97 Land Disposal Program will be discussed and decided by
the Sino-British Land Commission, it adds.

contracts regarding CT9 to be granted by the Hong Kong government
in accordance with this Agreed Minute shall continue to be valid

<HEADLINE> Migrating Birds Threatened By Climate Change in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Climate change threatens the
future of millions of migrating birds that travel to Britain each
year, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Thames estuary, the Wash, the Solway Firth, the Humber and
Severn estuaries, the destination of wintering populations of wading
birds, are all expected to be threatened by rising sea levels within
the next century, today's Daily Telegraph quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report on worldwide bird migration and its vulnerability to
climate change has been assembled for the World Wide Fund for Nature
and is based on the latest United Nations scientific assessment.
</P>
<P>
Birds most at risk include the avocet, whose Minsmere sanctuary in
Suffolk is vulnerable to salination, and the knot, from Greenland and
Canada, which depends on sands in Morecambe Bay, the Wash, the Ribble,
Dee and Humber estuaries, which are at risk from rising sea levels.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has calculated
that 99 percent of the British population of wintering grey
plover, 88 percent of avocets, 75 percent of the population of
dark- bellied brent geese, 64 percent of knots and 54 percent of
shelducks use areas at high risk from rising sea levels.
</P>
<P>
Ornithologists are concerned that when migrating populations
are displaced there may be no comparable alternative site for them
to go to, even if the authorities abandon their strategy of
building higher sea walls, which destroys sands and mud flats, and
allow coastal erosion to take place.

<HEADLINE> Australia Hopes to Double Wine Export By 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wine export is
expected to reach 896 million Australian dollars (699 million US
dollars) in 2001 compared with 471 million dollars (367 million US
dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
While releasing its five-year plan today, the Wine Foundation
also said that domestic wine sales were expected to grow to 1.21
billion Australian dollars (943 million US dollars) by 2001 from
the level of 1.1 billion Australian dollars (858 million US
dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Grape supply was projected to reach almost one million tons by
2001, a media release said.
</P>
<P>
The five-year plan centered around accelerated penetration of
the international market, domestic market development and increase
in Australia's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Competitiveness would be improved through an upgrade of grape
supply security and quality, reduction in costs, shift in
investment priority and better government policy.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier figures from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, wine export in 1995-96 shot up by 12.6 percent to an
all-time high of 128 million liters.
</P>
<P>
Europe and North America are Australia's biggest export
markets, while the fledgling South East Asian markets upped its
wine purchases by more than 59 percent to 3.5 million liters
during 1995-96.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) --The Namibian government
has no intention to re-introduce the death penalty despite
widespread calls to do so, Namibian Minister of Justice Ngarikutuke
Tjriange said today.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Minister of Justice Ngarikutuke Tjriange said in
Windhoek that a clause abolishing the death penalty is entrenched
in Namibia's constitution and cannot be changed.
</P>
<P>
Radio Namibia said many people including the police are
calling for the return of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Many people giving evidence to the
</P>
<P>
Namibia's Crime Commission said the death penalty is more
effective in combating crime, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But Tjiriange said as much as the Namibian government is
sensitive to people's feelings, it cannot amend the constitution
to re-introduce the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty was abolished under a new constitution
adopted after Namibia gained independence from South Africa in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Delegate Says Iraq Doesn't Recognize "No-Fly Zones" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Iraqi
delegation to the 96th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
in Beijing attacked the US for its armed intervention in the
internal affairs of Iraq here today, and said it does not
recognize the "no-fly zones" called for by Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi representative, Saad Qassem Hammoudi, said that Iraq
reserves the right to fight any action that violates its territory
or air-space and waters, and that the so-called "no-fly zones" are
nothing but a "unilateral action" that is illegal and runs counter
to international law and the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
The actions are also contrary to the UN resolution on
maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty, he said,
and "we are opposed to any intervention in our internal affairs,
no matter whatever excuses."
</P>
<P>
In 1991 and 1992, the United States, Britain and other Western
countries established a "safe zone" north of 36 degrees north
latitude, inside Iraq, and declared that the area south of 32
degrees north latitude was a "no-fly zone", in the name of
protecting the Kurds and the Shiite Muslims. The US expanded the
"no-fly zone" to south of 33 degrees north latitude this month.
</P>
<P>
Hammoudi said that the UN Assembly has repeatedly emphasized
that the "no-fly zone" has nothing to do with UN Security Council
resolutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) approved here today three loans to Viet Nam, Nepal and
Micronesia to help them implement family health, livestock
productivity and water supply projects respectively.
</P>
<P>
Under a population and family health project for which the bank
approved a loan that is equivalent to 43 million US dollars, over
20 million people in 15 selected provinces in Viet Nam will
receive better primary health care.
</P>
<P>
The project will strengthen and revitalize the family health
and family planning programs, improve the health status of the
population and quality of family planning services, and reduce
fertility and population growth.
</P>
<P>
To help some 55,000 poor farm households in Nepal, the bank
will provide a loan equivalent to 18.3 million US dollars to
implement a livestock productivity project.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to yield to these farm households
direct economic benefits such as higher incomes, improved
nutrition levels, higher livestock productivity, better access to
credit and improved processing and marketing of livestock and
livestock products.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, the bank also agreed to lend an equivalent of
10.6 million US dollars to improve water supply and sanitation for
about 28,000 people in the Federated States of Micronesia.

industries and institutions that help facilitate Micronesia's
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Commercial Bank Reduces Loan, Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia today announced the reduction of loan interest rate from
15 percent to 10.5 percent and deposit interest rate from 10
percent to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Vice-President of Banking Operation, Alazar
Desse, said the reduction in loan interest rate will encourage
enterprenuers to borrow more money and invest in the various
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The measure taken earlier to increase loan and deposit
interest rates was aimed at holding inflation which is now
minimal, he added.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank also decided that the amount of money
charged for imported goods with confirmed letter of credit in a
transaction worth a million Birr has fallen from 27,500 Birr to
15,000 Birr. The amount the bank charges for imported goods with
unconfirmed letter of credit in a transaction amounting a million
Birr has decreased from 22,500 Birr to 12,500 Birr.
</P>
<P>
With regard to export trade, the price the bank charges in a
transaction worth a million Birr has been reduced from 7,500 Birr
to 2,500 Birr.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of import and export charges will streamline the
import and export trade of the country, Alazar said.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank disclosed that it had a total of over 11
billion Birr (about 1.7 billion U.S.Dollars) on deposit while it
loaned over six billion Birr (about 943 million U.S.Dollars) to
various sectors up till June 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The reduction on loan and deposit interest rates has been put
in effect since last Monday while the reduction of import and
export charges will become effective beginning tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> French Naval Dockyard Workers to Protest Lay-Off Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 workers in the
French naval dockyard of Brest will hold a demonstration this
afternoon to protest government plans to lay off 1,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, the second in two months at the western
French port, was called by political parties, trade unions,
businessmen, the local chamber of commerce and industry and the
bosses union to pressure Defense Minister Charles Millon to
stop cutting naval projects, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Among sub-contracted enterprises in other parts of the city, an
atmosphere of pessimism is also omni-present. Representatives of
the union Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) said that half
of the 2,000 workers in local metal workshops will lose their jobs
by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Charles de Gaulle" and
the "Sirocco" transport vessel for landing barques, currently
under construction at the Brest Shipyard, are due to be completed
by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The cutting of naval projects across naval dockyards in France
is part of the military restructuring announced by President
Jacques Chirac at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up in the defense industry is adding fuel to already
high social tensions caused by a 12.5 percent unemployment rate,
although President Chirac has vowed to carry out his plan to turn
the French defense industry into a leaner and more effective one.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 workers in another naval dockyard Cherbourg
demonstrated on September 10, protesting a plan by the bureau in
charge of naval construction to lay off 1,700 of the yard's 4,200
workers between now and the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister promised to let the dockyard build a
fourth nuclear-powered submarine in 2000, after a project to build
such a submarine was shelved earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Refutes Remarks by Westerners on Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, today refuted the remarks made by some Westerners on
China's Tibet policy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here to the independent Swiss daily
Tages-Anzeiger, Li described the Western statements about the
so-called suppression and attempts to eliminate religion and
tradition in Tibet as totally groundless and out of fabrication.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government treats the Tibetan religion
and cultural tradition the same as that of other ethnic groups in
the country and is pursuing a policy of respect and protection.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans have the full freedom to perform normal religious
activities and Tibetan is the main language used in Tibet although
Mandarin is also used there, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made enormous efforts in preserving
the Tibetan culture and published a number of important Tibetan
literatures, the senior Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the greatest change in Tibet is the end to the
serf system under which serf owners had unlimited powers over
serfs who were sold and bought like animals, exchanged as gifts
and killed ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Western countries are deliberately spreading
the lies to smear the Chinese government and hoping that Tibet
will some day be split from China, Li said. He added that the
attempts are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official said that the central government's Tibet
policy has always been to speed up the economic and social
development in Tibet and raise the living standards of the Tibetan
people ever since the peaceful liberation and democratic reforms
in Tibet in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The central government has given an accumulative sum of 35
billion yuan RMB (roughly 4.2 billion U.S. dollars at the
current exchange rate) to Tibet over the 40 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also denied the allegation that the Tibetans in Tibet are
outnumbered by Chinese Han people. At present, Li added, Tibet has a
population of about 2.196 million, 94.46 percent of them are
Tibetans and the Han people account only for about 3.7 percent
most of whom are technicians and skilled workers come to surport
the economic constructions in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
On the Dalai Lama, Li said that the Chinese government has
repeatedly reiterated that it will hold talks with him and welcome
him to return to the motherland if he gives up the idea for
"independence of Tibet," stops activities for splitting the
motherland and recognizes Tibet as an integral part of China.
</P>
<P>
The central government has made various efforts in this regard,
but received no response from the Dalai Lama and his supporters,
Li said. They are still sticking to their separatist stand and
creating barriers for contacts and talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that the Dalai Lama side has no sincerity in
contacting with the central government, the Chinese official said.

relations between Portugal and China by co-operating with Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Pharmaceutical Industry Urged to Tap Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Health
Minister Chua Jui Meng today urged the local pharmaceutical
industry to tap the country's bountiful plants and herbs to
develop an integrated traditional medicine industry and reduce
imports.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia should develop an integrated traditional
medicine industry to enable these products to be used in tandem
with modern medicine at local hospitals to help reduce the amount
of traditional or "oriental" medicine imported every year from
countries like China, India and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The plants and herbs are there... it's a matter of collecting
them, doing research, manufacturing and selling the products," he
said at a social function here.
</P>
<P>
Chua said medical plants could be cultivated in herbarium, as
done in China and South Korea, to ensure a ready supply of raw
material for traditional medicine production.
</P>
<P>
The annual sales turnover for traditional medicine in Malaysia
amounted to about two billion ringgit (about 800 million U.S.
dollars) with the products sold ranging from general health
products to herbal remedies and tonics, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon the local pharmaceutical industry to
establish research and development programs with foreign companies
and local academia to search for novel drug molecules from local
plants.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Drug Control Authority has licensed 62 manufacturers
including four of traditional medicines, 142 importers and 496
wholesalers of registered pharmaceutical products.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total 12,283 pharmaceutical products registered with
the Authority, 1,073 are traditional medicines.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bank SBC to Trim 1,700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's third-largest
bank, Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), has announced 1,700 job cuts as
part of a major restructuring program to improve domestic
operations, local press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the company will close or merge a quarter of
its 325 domestic branches. The job losses will take place over
three years and will come largely through attrition.
</P>
<P>
The company said the plan would improve its profit from next
year.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major Swiss bank shake-up since the
summer. In July, the second-largest Swiss bank CS Holdings
announced it would axe 3,500 Swiss jobs, cut its branch network by
a third, and set up a new structure for its banking and investment
banking business.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that although the shake-ups would improve the
companies' profits, they are bad news for the stagnating Swiss
economy because of the major job losses.

Maintaining world peace. China does not participate in arms
race nor seek military expansion. It resolutely opposes

form and encroachment by any country upon other countries'
sovereignty and territorial integrity or interference in their
internal affairs under the pretexts of the ethnic, religious or
human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Friendly relations and cooperation. China wishes to
establish and develop friendly ties and cooperative relationship
with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It does not base its relations
with other states on the social system or ideology.
</P>
<P>
Good-neighborly and friendly relations. China has vigorously
advanced its friendly relations with surrounding countries, worked
for regional peace and stability and promoted regional economic
cooperation. It stands for a fair and reasonable settlement
through dialogues and negotiations of the boundary and territorial
disputes, including the territorial sea, which are left over from
history. Those which cannot be settled for the moment may be
shelved for the time being in the spirit of seeking common ground
while putting aside differences. But they should not be allowed to
stand in the way of developing normal state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced unity and cooperation with developing
countries. It has always been a cornerstone of China's foreign
policy. China attaches great importance to the development of
all-round friendly relations and cooperation with other third
world countries, has vigorously explored ways of mutually
complementary cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific and
technological fields and increased consultation and cooperation
with them on international issues for the benefit of maintaining
their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Opening-up policy. China opens itself both to developed and
developing countries and has engaged itself in extensive
international cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit to promote common development. Being the world's largest
developing country and a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, China is ready to make unremitting efforts for world
peace and development and for the establishment of a new just and
equitable international political and economic order of peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"As mankind is about to enter the 21st century, a century full
of promises, the Chinese government and people would like to work
together with other peoples to build a new world of peace and
development," the premier concluded.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- British oil and gas
companies are prepared to transfer their technology to Malaysian
firms through joint ventures, Malaysian Minister in the Prime
Minister's Department Abu Bakar Mustapha said today.
</P>
<P>
The British companies are seeking to team up not only with the
Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas but also with other
Malaysian companies, Abu Bakar said after meeting British Trade
and Industry Minister Lord Fraser who arrived here Tuesday for a
six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The British companies have wide experience in offshore oil and
gas exploration in the North Sea coupled with efficient production
at minimum cost, Abu Bakar said. Petronas is striving to reduce
production cost and enhance efficiency and could benefit from
British firms' experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the British companies also offered places for
Petronas-sponsored students to do their practical training in
British oil and gas companies.

<HEADLINE> UN Faces Difficulties in Providing Aid to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The UN is facing
difficulties in providing aid to war-torn Afghanistan, UN special
envoy to Afghanistan Norbert Holl said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Holl said that many donor
countries were frustrated over the prevailing situation in
Afghanistan and were reluctant to pour more money into this
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's recent offensive in eastern Afghanistan triggered
a new wave of refugees who need emergency aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are many crises in the world, which need the
UN help, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Holl noted that the UN agencies must find out an
emergency way to help the Afghan people who had suffered a lot
from the wars.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is necessary to motivate more donor countries to
provide money for the relief program for Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UN had spent 130 million US dollars on
its relief program for Afghanistan this year, but it was still far
from enough.

Manila, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
working out "a new schedule" for a ceasefire agreement which the
Ramos administration was supposed to sign with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) today, said a senior official.
</P>
<P>
"I think they're working on a new schedule for the ceasefire

</P>
<P>
Some provisions of the ceasefire should be worked out, he
added. But he did not explain what these provisions were about.
</P>
<P>
The MILF had demanded for a withdrawal of government troops
stationed near Camp Abubakar in Magundanao, the southern
Philippines, before they sign any agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Torres said he did not know if that was one of the reasons
why the scheduled signing was put off.

JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes today
attacked Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon after clashes
between the Hezbollah guerrilla fighters and Israeli soldiers,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army, in the past few hours, has also shelled
Hezbollah targets in the Iglim al-Tuffah area just outside the
Israeli self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon.

Reports from Beirut, Lebanese capital, quoted Hezbollah
officials as saying that their fighters were involved in an
exchange of fire with Israeli soldiers in the eastern sector of
the "security zone."

No details are available at the moment.
</P>
<P>
This was the first exchange of fire in weeks between Hezbollah
fighters and the Israeli army in south Lebanon since the Lebanese
general elections started last month.
</P>
<P>
The clashes also came at a time when tension between Israel and
Syria has been escalating, following recent Syrian troop movements
in Lebanon and around the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Lucky Israeli Cows Get Daily Desserts of Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Life is sweet for the
lucky cows living at a northern Israeli Kibbutz: they eat
ice creams as daily desserts.
</P>
<P>
The 320 cows at Ein Hamifratz Kibbutz in northern Galilee
area have been receiving their desserts for the past two
months, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Every morning, a truck from the nearby Strauss dairy
delivers a ton of ice creams to the Kibbutz cowsheds, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The dairy is happy, because the ice creams are production
surplus determined unfit for human consumption. Finding a cheap
means of having its waste simply gobbled up is a handy solution
for the ice cream plant, which has been forced to comply with
stricter rules on industrial waste disposal in recent years.
</P>
<P>
These cows were reportedly licking their lips. Before the
ice creams, they were used to cheese water.
</P>
<P>
Happier still are the cowhands. Not only are the satisfied
cows producing more milk, but apparently the stench of rotten
vegetables, which marks cowsheds elsewhere, is gradually giving
way to a sweet vanilla-flavored aroma.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Health Ministry warnings that the ice creams
were not fit for human consumption, the temptation of the
delicacy seemed so irresistible that large quantities of the
ice creams kept disappearing everyday before the cows could
get a chance to lick at them.
</P>
<P>
The Kibbutz in-house video channel even screened a satire
on the food fad, but to no avail: members were not cowed,
and the desserts continue to disappear, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Addresses Inter-Parliamentary Conference (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li said the current international situation is, on the whole,
moving towards greater relaxation and forces for peace are on a
steady increase.
</P>
<P>
However, to seek peace and development remain two major tasks
of the world today, Li said. "We must not fail to see that the
World is still fraught with complicated contradictions and world
peace and stability are under serious threat."
</P>
<P>
The unfair and inequitable international political and economic
order remains largely intact, he said, noting that the gap between
the rich and poor countries continues to widen as a result of uneven
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The very survival and development of mankind are faced with a
formidable challenge," the Chinese Premier told the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trend towards multipolarity continues to gain
momentum throughout the world and inter-dependency, constraint and
cooperation among various major forces is conducive to world peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
"There are almost 200 countries in the world today and all of
them, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal members
of the international community," Li said.
</P>
<P>
World peace is to be maintained by the joint efforts of people
of different countries, and world affairs should be managed by all
countries together, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are living in a diversified and kaleidoscopic world where
the social system, value, level of development, historical
tradition, religious belief and cultural background vary from
country to country," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that people of different countries should have the
right to choose the social system, development model and way of
life suited to their own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"No country has the right to interfere in the internal affairs
of other countries," Li said. "It will lead nowhere if one turns a
blind eye to the objective reality of world diversity and tries to
impose one's own will on others in an attempt to build a world of
uniform system, model and ideology."
</P>
<P>
Li noted that peace and development are closely linked.
</P>
<P>
"Without peace, there will be no steady development, and
without development, there will be no guarantee for a lasting
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The scientific and technological progress and economic
development has contributed to closer inter-relationship among
states, the Chinese Premier said.
</P>
<P>
"No country can develop in isolation from world economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Solutions to such global problems as cross-country crime, drug
trafficking and environmental protection call for both the
endeavor of one country and extensive international cooperation,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
At present, some backward developing countries have embarked on
the road to steady economic revitalization, he said, adding that
countries in Asia have continued to achieve rapid economic
development and Latin America has regained its economic growth
momentum.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the African continent is also looking up and
South-South cooperation has taken new strides, the Premier
said.
</P>
<P>
"All this proves that the economic development of these
countries has not only helped improve the living standards of
their people, but also injected new impetus to the world economic
growth, thus providing developed countries with more business
opportunities and opening up broader vistas for international
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that as the economies of developed and developing
countries are complementary, North-South cooperation will benefit
both groups and serve the interests of the development and
progress of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Any act to bully the weak, oppress the poor, go in for unequal
exchanges and adopt discriminative policies in international
economic relations will harm not only interests of others but also
their own, which is against the world trend.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Meets with US Envoy to Discuss Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu met today with U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross to discuss current situation of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu briefed Ross on the recent tension in the northern
borders with Lebanon and Syria, which has redeployed its troops in
the area in the past weeks, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian troop movements have caused high concern in Israel
about possible military confrontation with Syria. Netanyahu told
Ross that Israel has been watching closely the military moves by
the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian relations topped the agenda of talks between
Netanyahu and Ross, who arrived here Wednesday from Egypt. Ross is
trying to push Israel and Syria to restart the stalled peace talks
which have caused the recent tension.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Ross has concluded a draft document
with Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Dore Gold on resuming the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks. Under the draft, Israel reportedly
accepted some of the understandings reached between Syria and
former Israeli Labor government, but refused to commit itself to
the whole package.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government made a conditional promise to
U.S. President Bill Clinton that Israel would withdraw from the
Golan Heights as part of a peace treaty, once necessary security
arrangements and normalization were made.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists Israel must withdraw from the whole Golan
Heights, which Israel seized in 1967 war, before sealing full
peace.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ross briefed Netanyahu on his meetings with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa. He assured Netanyahu that the November regional economic
summit in Cairo would go ahead, although Egypt repeatedly
threatened to cancel it to force Israel to advance the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Ross and Netanyahu also discussed matters relating to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. A day earlier, Ross met with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to discuss the
current Israeli-Palestinian ties and economic difficulties in the
territories.
</P>
<P>
Before the Ross-Arafat meeting, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai approved a plan to expand Jewish settlements in
the territories. Ross reiterated that the U.S. government
maintained its policies of opposing expansion of settlements,
calling it would "complicate the negotiating process."
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Mordechai held a four-hour meeting with
Arafat at the Erez Crossing between Israel and the Gaza
Strip. They failed to reach an agreement on Israel's demand
for revising the deal on its troops' redeployment from the
volatile West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, they agreed to convene the joint steering committee
in charge of the peace talks to formulate a final framework
that can be accepted by both sides.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Addresses Inter-Parliamentary Conference (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-1950s, Asian countries initiated the well-known Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, namely, the principles of
mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence, the
Chinese Premier said.
</P>
<P>
There are profound reasons behind this, he said.
</P>
<P>
In contemporary history, most Asian countries suffered many
years of colonialist aggression and were reduced to colony or
semi-colony, Li said.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the aggressive war launched by militarists
in Japan inflicted tremendous sufferings on Asian countries and
peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only after protracted sanguine struggles that Asian
countries and peoples freed themselves from the colonial rule and
won national independence and liberation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that is the very reason why they deeply cherish the
value of peace and independence and the hard-won state sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and urgently call for mutual
non-aggression and friendly co-existence among states.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the oppression, exploitation and bullying by
foreign powers, most Asian countries suffered long-term economic
backwardness and poverty and had no say in world affairs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
This further explains why these countries, once becoming
masters of their own destiny, all fervently hoped to lift
themselves form poverty and backwardness and replace the unequal
and unreasonable old international economic order, and looked
forward to mutual respect and equal treatment among states and to
exchanges and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant oriental ancient civilization constitutes a major
contribution to world culture and human progress, the Chinese
Premier said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, for a long period of time, the colonialists had
tried, in a domineering manner, to impose their own will and value
on Asian countries in an attempt to force Asian countries and
peoples to give up their own tradition and culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such acts naturally aroused strong indignation and opposition
from Asian countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
This is why Asian countries, after winning independence, firmly
maintained that all countries have the right to choose their own
social system and road to development, and opposed interference in
the internal affairs of other countries and imposition of one's
own will on others, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li told the conference that Asian people are peace-loving
people and Asian culture has a large room for accommodation.
</P>
<P>
"They always hold that countries and nations should live with
each other in amity, learn from and draw upon each other's culture
and cooperate with each other on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit in the interest of common development and progress," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence
represent an important contribution by Asian countries and
peoples to world politics and international relations.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past four decades and more, these principles have
stood the test of time with strong vitality and have been accepted
by the international community," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence
can serve not only as international norms guiding state-to-state
relations, but also as the fundamental principles for establishing
a new type of state-to-state relationship and a new international
political and economic order," the Chinese Premier said.

<HEADLINE> Prime Minister Says Russia Will Be Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's prime minister
assured visiting Olympics officials that his government would
guarantee political stability if St. Petersburg were chosen as
host of the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters after the
meeting Wednesday that Russia's uncertain political situation
could hurt St. Petersburg's chances of winning the games, the
Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was in St. Petersburg, Russia's second
largest city, for a few hours to meet with the experts from the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said he told them the city has all the necessary facilities
for the 2004 games and that his government would "guarantee
political stability in Russia," Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"Olympic games in Russia are a symbol of trust in us,"
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
St. Petersburg is one of 11 cities competing to hold the
Olympics in 2004. It played host to the Goodwill Games in 1994 and
some events during the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
firmer against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 78.95 US cents from 78.88 US
cents on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But it was weaker against the Japanese yen, ending at 86.36 yen
from 86.95 yen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was boosted by an issue of the
dual-currency Samurai bond worth 20 billion Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The local currency also received support from stronger
commodity prices in the world.
</P>
<P>
But analysts predicted that the Australian dollar might fall to
77.00 US cents by the end of the year because of a narrowing of
the Australian-US interest rates differentials.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australian is expected to cut short-term
interest rates by half a percentage points in November, while the
Federal Reserve of the United States is expected to raise the
official interest rates by half a percentage points in
approximately the same time.
</P>
<P>
Australia has one of the highest interest rates in the OECD
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries.
The one-percentage-point narrowing of differences between the
interest rates in Australian and the US would make the Australian
currency less attractive to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 1.1925 marks against the German
mark from 1.1937 marks on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> UN to Take New Peace Initiative After Reassessing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has to
reassess the prevailing Afghan situation and to take new peace
initiative instead of wait-and-see, a UN official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference attended by a group of foreign
correspondents based here, Norbert Holl, UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, said that the recent offensive launched by the
Taliban Militia "damaged the hopes we have reached sometime."
</P>
<P>
Everybody was frustrated to see the new military stalemate in
the war-torn Afghanistan, Holl added.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the military situation in the country is in favor of the
Taliban which is also not ready to join the UN peace initiative,"
he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Some Taliban leaders thought that if they could succeed by
using force, there would be no use to sit down for negotiation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not optimistic about changing the Taliban's idea in the
near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we have to reassess the Afghan situation," he said,
adding, "we must do something."
</P>
<P>
He said that his peace mission had elaborated proposals which
were submitted to the UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are waiting for the final decision on how we proceed,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to contact more with the Taliban,
saying that the UN still knew little about this student militia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, "so far, the situation is complex, but the
message is clear."
</P>
<P>
The Afghan parties should respect the UN Charter because
Afghanistan is one of the founding members of the UN, he added.
</P>
<P>
Norbert Holl has visited Afghanistan three times since he
replaced Mehmud Mestiri as the UN special envoy to Afghanistan in
June this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform Includes Political System: Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China should proceed with
appropriate reforms on its political system, as it deepens the
reforms on its economic system, said a senior Chinese leader here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks when
answering questions in an interview with Tages-Anzeiger, the
independent Swiss daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Li said Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and
opening-door policy and modernization programs, has made clear
that China's reform should include a reform on its political
system.
</P>
<P>
"The impression that China only adopts economic reform without
carrying out political reform is inaccurate," Li told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that in recent years, China made great efforts to
reform its political system and achieved significant progress. He
cited the office term limits for state leaders, the gradual
perfection of an election system and the establishment of a public
servant system as examples.
</P>
<P>
Li said some economic reform measures, such as streamlining
administration and granting local authorities with greater power
and the separation of the functions of government from those of
enterprises, also have the substance of political reform.
</P>
<P>
"We have always held that reforms on the economic system and on
the political system are supplementary to each other," Li
said. "Reform on the political system is both an inevitable result
of and an important guarantee for reform on the economic system."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the linkage of economic and political
reforms would possibly aggravate the tension in China, Li said
China enjoys political and social stability and there is no such a
question of intensifying the tension.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to push forward with the process of reform on
the political system," Li said. He stressed that China's
opening-door policy and modernization drive win full support of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
But the chairman also noted that China is a large country with
a population of 1.2 billion but less developed economy and
culture, so stability is a prerequisite to any undertakings in
China.
</P>
<P>
China's reform on the political system can only be carried out
according to China's actual conditions and with the adoption of
active and reliable policies. He said the reform should be
proceeded with on an orderly and gradual basis and in line with
the economic and social development of China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Addresses Inter-Parliamentary Conference  (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li cited China as the world's largest developing country with
one fifth of world's population.
</P>
<P>
If China can maintain political stability, economic prosperity,
ethnic harmony and social progress and its people can live in
peace and contentment, this will be an important contribution to
world peace, stability, development and prosperity, Li said.
</P>
<P>
This is way China's development and progress have been well
received and extensively supported by people around the world, Li
told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Yet one can still hear some uncalled-for noises, Li said,
noting that "some people have taken pleasure in playing up China's
difficulties and asserted that it would 'collapse'."
</P>
<P>
Others have deliberately exaggerated China's economic strength
and spread the fallacy of a "China threat", he added.
</P>
<P>
"Neither assertion tallies with facts," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable achievements in various aspects over
the past years, but its GNP in per capita terms remains very low,
Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said: "With a poor economic foundation and huge population,
we must continue to work hard for several more decades before we
become truly modernized."
</P>
<P>
Even when it does become stronger, China will never be a threat
to any other countries, nor will it ever commit aggression and
oppression against other people, the Chinese Premier said.
</P>
<P>
"We have solemnly declared on many occasions that China is
firmly opposed to hegemonism and will never itself seek hegemony,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is a staunch force dedicated to maintaining
world peace and promoting human progress.
</P>
<P>
"A world that enjoys peace and development needs a stable and
prosperous China and China's reform, opening-up and modernization
also call for an international environment of lasting peace," Li
said.

Concerning the agricultural sector, Premier Li said that of the
1.2 billion Chinese people, 900 million live in the rural
areas. The Chinese government has always attached great importance
to agriculture and the rural population, correctly handled the
related issues and given top priority to agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that China has been able to support 22 percent of the
world population with seven percent of the world's arable land
testifies to the Chinese people's ability to rely on themselves."
the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic development, population growth and
higher living standards will increase grain demand in China. But,
fortunately, the potential for increased grain production in China
is big.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's agricultural production is at a relatively
low level, he observed. There is a fairly big proportion of
medium- and low-yield land and the resources for agricultural and
side-line production have not yet been fully utilized.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed out that there is a broad prospect for an
all-round agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to deepen rural reform, increase
agricultural input, build water conservancy projects extensively,
adopt advanced and applicable technology and promote high-yield,
high-quality and cost-effective agriculture to ensure a steady
growth of grain production, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We have so far successfully met the basic needs of our people
for food on our own," he said. "With a sustained economic
development, the Chinese people are fully capable of providing
themselves sufficient food and clothes by relying on their own."

<HEADLINE> Germany Hopes to Resume Normal Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The German government will not
change its principled stand of always adhering to its "one-China"
policy and non-interference in China's internal affairs, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said he hopes to maintain good relations with China in
the political, economic and cultural fields so that bilateral
relations will be back normal on track.
</P>
<P>
He made the statements in an exclusive interview with the
German weekly Wirtschaftswoche recently.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel held out hope that his scheduled meeting with Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in New York next week will clear up
"the existing misunderstandings" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Never in the past has a German government wavered on the
"One-China" policy, he said, adding the current cabinet will
persist in the same policy.
</P>
<P>
He also said Germany does not support any effort aiming to
separate Tibet from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister pointed out that there have been no
conflicts between Germany and China, either historical or
geopolitical. Both sides favor the forming of a world structure of
multi-polarization in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
He said the economies of the two countries can be mutually
complementary, hoping that his talks with the Chinese foreign
minister will be conducted with a forward-looking attitude.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel stressed that Germany should not impose what Germans
understand about human rights on others. China with one-fifth of
the world population naturally must first of all meet the people's
basic needs. Therefore China should be praised for doing things in
ways sometimes different from others.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic relations, Kinkel pointed out that good
economic relations will be beneficial to both countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Relations between China and the
United States could improve and further develop if Washington
strictly complies with the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques and
keeps its promises on the Taiwan issue, a senior Chinese official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local newspaper, Tages-Anzeiger, Li
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said China
hopes to establish and maintain good relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Li said China wishes to develop friendly and cooperative
relations with all countries, which accords with the fundamental
interests of the Chinese people, and it has no intention to be at
odds with others.
</P>
<P>
But "we believe that all countries, big or small, rich or poor,
strong or weak, should be equal in international affairs," Li
said. "Any country, no matter how powerful it is, has no right to
claim leadership for other countries, dictate or bully others."
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here on a four-day visit to Switzerland, said there
are indeed some issues in the relations between China and the
United States that need to be properly tackled, the Taiwan issue
in particular.
</P>
<P>
"the Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue in
the Sino-U.S. relations as it concerns China's sovereignty,
territorial integrity and national reunification, as well as the
feelings of the Chinese people, including the compatriots in
Taiwan," Li said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
He added that he hoped the United States will strengthen
cooperation, instead of confrontation, with China so that their
relations "will continue to develop in a direction which benefits
both sides and serves world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Switzerland Monday on the fourth leg of his
European tour which has already taken him to Poland, the
Netherlands and Austria. His next stop is Russia.

<P>
While developing economy, Li went on to say, China has
vigorously advanced the socialist democracy, legal system and the
cause of the socialist culture and ethics to make all-round social
progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the Chinese Constitution, all power in the
Peoples Republic of china belongs to the people and the political
rights of its citizens shall be widely respected and protected.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the Chinese people enjoy freedom and democratic rights
to an extent unseen in the Chinese history. The efforts and
progress made by china in bringing all-round improvement to its
human rights situation are there for everybody to see," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government gives special attention to the rights
and interests of women and children and make sure that they enjoy
them through legal means and in action, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that it is clearly stipulated in the
Constitution: Women enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of
life, in political, economic, cultural, social and family life;
Marriage, the family and mother and child are protected by the
state; Violation of the freedom of marriage is prohibited; And
maltreatment of old people, women and children is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
To protect the rights and interests of women and children is a
consensus shard by all in the society, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Women account for 21 percent of the deputies to the eighth
National People's Congress, 31 percent of the government employees
and more than one third of scientific and technological
personnel. Equal work, equal pay is practiced in China. Working
women enjoy special labor protection and insurance. Women's right
to education is respected, said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese people regard children as the flowers
and future of their country and go all out to make sure that they
grow up healthily.
</P>
<P>
The rate of children enjoying medical care and education in
China is relatively high among developing countries and its rate
of children's preventive inoculation is almost as high as that of
developed countries, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He remarked that the Chinese government and people are ready to
work with other governments and peoples to further protect the
rights and interests of women and children.

China is a unitary multinational country and a harmonious big
family of 56 nationalities, the premier said. All the
nationalities in the country have based their relations on
equality, unity and mutual assistance.
</P>
<P>
"Sharing weal and woe, they have contributed jointly to China's
independence, unification and prosperity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we have adhered to and continuously improved the
system of self-government in national autonomous regions while
fully ensuring them their right to autonomy and equal rights."
</P>
<P>
In addition to enjoying the equal rights under the Constitution
and laws with the Han nationality making up 92 percent of China's
total population, the country's ethnic minorities have been
provided with special treatment in the areas of economic, cultural
and social development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Their tradition sand customs are respected, and their freedom
to religious belief fully protected, he said. The unevenness of
development in its various regions is basic Chinese reality, and
also a wide-spread phenomenon found in the development process of
large countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic, especially since
the beginning of reform and opening-up more than a decade ago, the
premier said, China has seen its regions, minority-inhabited
regions included, achieve rapid social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"However," he noted, "owing to historical reasons, natural
conditions and economic foundations, the problem of regional gap
cannot be solved entirely in a short span of time. The Chinese
government is stepping up efforts to narrow the gap, which has
begun to yield positive results."

<HEADLINE> Wafangdian Bearing Manufacturer to Issue B-Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Wafangdian Bearing (Group)
Corporation, one of the three largest bearing manufacturers in
China, is to issue b-shares at the Shenzhen Securities Exchange
(SSE) by the end of October this year.
</P>
<P>
It will become the first Chinese bearing maker to issue
b-shares. B-shares are only sold to foreign investors, while
a-shares are for domestic buyers.
</P>
<P>
The firm, which leads the country's bearing sector in terms of
economic performance, is located in Dalian City, Liaoning Province
in northeast China. Last October, it was turned into a stock
company based on the former Wafangdian Bearing Plant.
</P>
<P>
According to its president of the board Yu Jie, the company has
passed capital assessment, auditing and government approval for
issuing b-shares.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UN Peace Mission Withdraws From Afghanistan: UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- All members of the UN Peace
Mission in Afghanistan have withdrawn from the war-torn country,
UN special envoy to Afghanistan Norbert Holl said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at a local hotel this afternoon,
Holl said that all the 16 members of his mission had retreated
from Afghan eastern city of Jalalabad due to the unstable
situation there.
</P>
<P>
The UN mission shifted its headquarters from Islamabad to
Jalalabad at the end of July in a bid to boost the peace efforts
in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Holl said that he even kept one of his advisors in Jalalabad
after the Taliban Militia captured the city last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Afghan government forces launched an air raid on
Jalalabad on Sunday and the bombs landed very close to the
building of his mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Then, a decision was made to withdraw all the members of the
mission from Jalalabad to Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the mission has no plan to return to
Jalalabad or shift the headquarters to other places, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Future Government to Enjoy High Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The future government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will be governed
by people in Hong Kong and enjoy high autonomy, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference who was on a visit
here, said Hong Kong's capitalism will be maintained and its
current social and economic systems remain after it returns to
China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's life styles will be preserved and its laws will
basically remain intact, said Li in an interview with
Tages-Anzeiger, an independent Swiss daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will enjoy high autonomy in administrative and
legislative affairs and have independent judicial powers and the
right to final judgment, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government, which takes care of the
region's foreign affairs and national defense, will not send
officials to govern Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's chief executive will be chosen
in Hong Kong through elections or consultations and then be
appointed by the central government, before achieving eventually
the objective of holding general elections, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said all of Hong Kong's council members will also finally be
elected through popular votes, after a certain period in which an
increase will be allowed in the proportion of directly elected
council members.
</P>
<P>
"These have already had the understanding and endorsement of
people from all walks of life in Hong Kong," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if China will eliminate the "fledgling" and
"fragile" democracy in Hong Kong, Li said all talks about
so-called "democracy" in Hong Kong is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy means people being their own masters. But for more
than 150 years, the Chinese in Hong Kong have been under foreign
colonial rule. And the talk of them being the masters was out of
the question," Li said.
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, the Governor of Hong Kong has been the
sole representative of the British Queen, arrogating both
administrative and legislative powers. Members of the Executive
Council and Legislative Council were all appointed officials.
</P>
<P>
Only after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in
1984, did Hong Kong begin to have a small number of indirectly
elected council members.
</P>
<P>
"From this point of view alone, there is no democracy in its
real sense to talk of in Hong Kong," Li said.

countries, attached great importance to environmental protection
and rational exploitation of natural resources and persisted in
following a path of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Having formulated the policy of accelerating the economic
restructuring and shift in the mode of economic growth, he said,
"the Chinese government stresses the basic role of the marketplace
in allocating resources within the framework of the state
macro-management for the benefit of higher efficiency in the use
of resources, greater conservation of resources and better
environmental protection. The Chinese Government values the
indispensable role of scientific advancement and education in

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Leader Leaves Ankara After Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) leader Massoud Barzani left here this morning for
northern Iraq after holding talks with Turkish and U.S. officials,
according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a KDP official here as saying that Barzani
first departed for Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey, and then will
head for northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Barzani arrived here Wednesday for talks with Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau on the latest
developments of the situation in northern Iraq and the future of
the area.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-hour meeting Wednesday evening with Barzani,
Ciller told reporters that Turkey would give him its support,
provided he cooperates with the Turkomans in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that she had expressed Turkey's desire that the
Turkomans should also take part in the administration of
northern Iraq and have equal rights with the Kurds there.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey supports the territorial integrity of Iraq. But a
regional administration is on the agenda until the power vacuum
in northern Iraq is ended. We told Mr. Barzani that he should
cooperate with the Turkomans. And we saw that he was in agreement
with us," Ciller said.
</P>
<P>
She added, "World public opinion has to know about the
existence of the Turkomans. The Turkomans do not just exist in
the region, but are also an important source of power."
</P>
<P>
The Turkomans number 3.5 million in the whole of Iraq and the
Turkoman Front, representing this population, was set up in 1995
and is supported by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Barzani and the U.S. assistant
secretary of state on Wednesday night, Pelletreau asked Barzani
"not to enter into the orbit of Saddam Hussein," but he did not
elaborate on his remark.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau stayed in Ankara for talks with the Turkish
high-ranking officials on the situation in Iraq since Monday when
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry paid a four-hour brief visit
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicolas Burns has said in Washington: "Our objective is to have
Mr. Barzani and Mr. (Jalal) Talabani (leader of the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan) agree to talk about their differences
peacefully and across from one another at the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
On August 31, the Iraqi troops, at the request of the KDP led
by Barzani, launched attacks on PUK positions in northern Iraq
with heavy gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The KDP has fought with the PUK for supremacy in the
mountainous region where the U.S.-led coalition forces established
an enclave for the Kurds seeking independence from Iraq after the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the
KDP and its rival PUK began fighting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the United States punished Iraq for
intervening in Kurdish factional fighting in northern Iraq by
launching 44 cruise missiles at its air defense systems in southern
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Addresses Inter-Parliamentary Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
called on participants at the ongoing 96th Inter-Parliamentary
Conference to work together to build a new world of peace and
development in his address to the conference today.
</P>
<P>
The premier cited the conference as an important event and said
it is the first time for the Inter-Parliamentary Union to hold
such a meeting in China.
</P>
<P>
He extended a warm welcome to all participants on behalf of the
Chinese Government and people.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, Li said, delegates have had an in-depth
exchange of views on issues of concern to the international
community in a "sincere and friendly" atmosphere, which has
deepened mutual understanding and promoted cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that with our concerted efforts this conference will
yield positive results." he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier briefed the participants on the development in
China, its basic views on the current international situation and
its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
China is an influential member of the international community,
Li said. However, he added, the 100 years and more before the
middle of this century were a painful period of calamity for the
Chinese people who suffered a lot from invasion, bullying and
humiliation of foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the founding the People's Republic of China in
1949 "ushered in a new epoch in the Chinese history and made the
Chinese people master of their own destiny."
</P>
<P>
In the following 40 years and more, especially in the past 18
years since the introduction of reform and opening-up policy, Li
said, China has made remarkable achievements in the economic and
social development under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP has grown by over nine percent a year on average,
and its economic restructuring has made major progress, said
he. "As a result, an overall opening-up pattern has been roughly
put in place. Its urban and rural population have enjoyed an
increasingly better life. And various social undertakings have
flourished in an all-round way."
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the premier reviewed, China formulated the
Ninth Five-Year Plan and the long-range objectives to the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
"We now envisage an average annual GNP growth rate of eight
percent for the remaining five years of this century and seven
percent for the first ten years of the next century," Li said.
"This will further upgrade China's aggregate national strength and
people's livelihood."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy is in a good position to maintain its
development momentum, and the Chinese people are confident of
achieving these objectives, the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Price of China-Made Color TVs Drops to Bottom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China's domestic-made color
TVs are now being marketed at the lowest possible price, in line
with their average cost of production, experts from the Ministry
of Electronics Industry said recently.
</P>
<P>
The majority of color TV producers in the country are no longer
able to cut prices, following widespread competition to increase
sales by lowering prices, which started in April, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Large domestic color TVs manufacturers such as Changhong,
Konica, and TCL, whose market shares account for more than half of
the total, report a discount of about 20 percent in product price.
</P>
<P>
And some medium-sized color TV producers, including Panda and
HiSense, have also offered lower prices to customers.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, about 80 percent of the country's
color TV producers have an annual production capacity of less than
500,000 sets. Due to their small production scale, their
production costs have surpassed, or at least come close to the
current price.

<HEADLINE> Israel Opens Door for Palestinian Imports from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel will increase the
quotas on the list of goods the Palestinians are allowed to
import from Jordan, Egypt and other countries without being
subject to Israeli standards, specifications and customs.
</P>
<P>
Shaul Sasson, the commercial attache at the Israeli embassy in
Amman, said that the quantities will be increased by two and a
half times their current quotas, the English-language daily Jordan
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The official announcement of the decision was made earlier
this week following a meeting between Israeli Finance Minister
Dan Meridor and Palestinian Minister of Trade Maher Masri.
</P>
<P>
The increase in quotas includes cement, one of Jordan's first
and main exports to the Palestinian autonomous territories.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Cement Factories Co. was contracted by the Palestinian
Authority (PA) earlier this year to export 400,000 tons of cement,
although only 150,000 tons could be imported under Palestinian
standards, specifications and customs jurisdiction according to
the original quotas list.
</P>
<P>
The new cement has been set at 400,000 tons, Sasson said.
</P>
<P>
The decision constitutes an adherence to the economic agreement
signed between the PA and Israel in Paris 1994, which stipulated
three lists of goods that the Palestinians would be allowed to
import from other countries, including neighboring Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stated that upon the expansion of the
Palestinian self-rule areas, the quantities of goods wold be
accordingly expanded.
</P>
<P>
Although Palestinian autonomy spread to the West Bank in late
1995, Israel refused to further expand the lists, which drew
severe and substantial complaints and criticism from Jordanian
exporters eager to trade with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Sasson explained that Israel delayed implementing the remainder
of the agreement when a series of terrorist attacks erupted
inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials and exporters have expressed growing
frustration in recent months over Israel's refusal to implement
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
They also complained that the economic agreement between the
PA and Israel made it difficult for Jordan to fully implement its
own trade agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Along with the quotas, Jordanian officials have said that
they will express their frustration over the back-to-back system
of transport of goods which exporters say is time-consuming and
costly, and which makes Jordanian products less
competitive.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province has signed a letter of intent with a Hong Kong
power company for jointly building and managing a large power
plant using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel.
</P>
<P>
This will be China's first such power station.
</P>
<P>
Local officials originally planned to install four coal-burning
thermal power generating units, each with 660,000 kw generating
capacity, in the Eastern Power Plant, which is listed as one of
the city's major construction projects during the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
City authorities decided to use LNG as fuel for the new plant
after considering the effect Shenzhen's economic development would
have on environmental protection. The use of LNG is also in
keeping with the state's new energy policies for the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan period.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Power Plant will be located in Dapeng Bay in the
east of Shenzhen, and will be installed with eight large LNG
generating units, each with a generating capacity of 330,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
A nine billion yuan of investment will be made for first-phase
construction, during which four generating units will be
installed. The first unit is scheduled to go into operation by the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the supply of LNG for the power plant, facilities
will be built to handle three million tons of LNG annually, the
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Cause Death of 730,000 People: Iraqi MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Iraqi
National Assembly said today that by the end of August, 736,734
people in Iraq had fallen victim to the economic sanctions
that caused shortages of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 children have died as a result of the
sanctions, according to Saad Kasim Hamoudi, chairman of the Arab
and International Relations Committee of the Iraqi parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made at the ongoing 96th Inter-Parliamentary
Conference in Beijing, the head of the Iraqi delegation said the
majority of the Iraqi people, especially children, are now
threatened with health problems that have resulted from the lack
of food, salt and vitamins.
</P>
<P>
Since the sanctions were imposed six years ago, the number of
children suffering from malnutrition has soared 50-fold, and the
death toll of children below the age of five jumped eight times,
Hamoudi added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that public hygiene is also deteriorating in Iraq, as
evidenced by the fact that 24,436 typhoid cases and 1,345 cholera
cases were reported in 1994, compared with 1,819 and none in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions also triggered a sharp decline of the Iraqi
economy. In 1995, one US dollar was equivalent to more than 3,000
Iraqi Dinar, while it was only equivalent to less than one third
of a Dinar before the imposition of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq relies heavily on food imports, as its grain output can
only meet about 30 percent of the domestic demand, consequently the
country now faces a severe food shortage, Hamoudi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations as saying that the price of flour rose 11,667
times over that in July of 1993, and costs of other foodstuffs rose
5,000 times.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average income of an Iraqi family has dropped 70
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliamentarian emphasized that the memorandum of
understanding on "petroleum in exchange of food" reached between
Iraq and the United Nations last May was only a "tentative
humanitarian measure."
</P>
<P>
He called for the full implementation of UN Resolution No. 687,
and the lifting of the sanctions "without any additional political
conditions as quickly as possible."

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel To Sign Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) next
week, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Levy is to travel to New York next week to attend the U.N.
General Assembly, during which he will hold talks with his
counterparts from the U.S., Russia and several Arab states, the
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was passed last Tuesday by the U.N. General Assembly
in a vote of 158-3. India, Libya and Bhutan voted against the
treaty, which bans any test of atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israel supported the nuclear test ban, though it has not
detonated any nuclear devise. The Jewish state has long been
regarded as the first state in the Middle East which own the
potential to produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel has never announced openly that it owns
nuclear capability, some nuclear experts said it is able to
assemble about 100 nuclear heads in a short time, while others
suspect it has already owned about 200 nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring Arab countries, led by Egypt, has been
demanding Israel to discuss its nuclear arsenal in the Dimona
base in southern Negev desert, or at least subject it to
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Egypt and Jordan are also worried about the possible
radiactive leaks from the Dimona reactors, which have operated
for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, former Labor prime minister Shimon Peres
created a uproar in the country as he indicated that Israel would
renounce its nuclear arsenal after peace is established in the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks Funding to Fight Copyright Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has asked the
European Union (EU) for a higher allocation under the second
EU-ASEAN Patents Program to help fight copyright piracy and
counterfeit goods.
</P>
<P>
The current program, which will expire next June, has proven
"beneficial," Malaysian Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs
Minister Abu Hassan Omar said today.
</P>
<P>
It is appropriate for the EU to provide more money under the
second program as there is an increase in the membership of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations), he noted.
</P>
<P>
Of the 8 million U.S. dollar financial support allocated by the
EU under the current program, Malaysia got 1 million dollars,
mainly used to conduct training and seminars, he told reporters
after opening a national seminar here on Border Enforcement of
Intellectual Property Rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been a decline in the number of cases of
copyright infringement and counterfeit goods.
</P>
<P>
From January to the end of August, his ministry received 275
complaints of copyright piracy with the value of goods seized
amounting to 1 million ringgit (about 0.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ministry received 491 complaints with 2.5
million ringgit (about 1 million dollars) worth of goods seized.
</P>
<P>
He said his government wants to bring the level of intellectual
property protection on a par with international norms and
standards to convince foreign investors that their properties
would be adequately protected under the law.

<HEADLINE> Commercialization of State-Owned Banks Arduous: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The commercialization of state-owned banks faces both
opportunities and challenges in the 1996-2000 Ninth Five-Year Plan
period," Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China,
told an international seminar attended by senior company
executives, which closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the banking industry has witnessed rapid
development since China embarked on a reform and opening-up drive
in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Today, the banking industry in China is characteristically
marked by the co-existence of wholly state-owned banks,
policy-oriented banks, new commercial banks, rural and urban
cooperative banks, foreign banks, and joint-venture banks, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a result of financial reforms and the reform and
opening-up drive," Dai said. "It's also an objective need of the
development of a socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
During the whole process, the state-owned banks have achieved
something in transforming their operating mechanism and
establishing a new mechanism for self-restraint and
self-development, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
However, the governor pointed out, the commercialization of
state-owned banks needs to be matched by reforms in other sectors,
particularly the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I must say it's an arduous task to turn the
state-owned banks into commercial banks in the real sense," Dai
said.
</P>
<P>
Improvement in the operating mechanism of policy-oriented banks
will benefit the effort to accelerate the commercialization of
state-owned banks, he explained.
</P>
<P>
New commercial banks, foreign and joint-venture banks and the
gradual opening of the local currency business to foreign banks
pose challenges to the state-owned banks, though they also provide
an incentive for the state-owned banks to speed up internal
reforms, Dai acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of a modern enterprise and
financial system is an inherent need of the move to achieve a
fundamental shift in both the economic system and economic growth
mode over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
And transforming the operating mechanism of state-owned
enterprises and turning state-owned banks into real commercial
entities are a major part of a modern enterprise and financial
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the Ninth Five-Year Plan marks a critical period
for China to promote a coordinated reform of state-owned
enterprises and state-owned banks," the governor said.

entry by other staff apart from those assigned to the unit is not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
On that day, a midwife was on duty in the nursery with three
other student nurses. The nurse found the baby was missing in
late afternoon and the matter was reported to security.
</P>
<P>
The couple sued the hospital for negligence which led to the
disappearance of their baby and damages for nervous shock and
mental distress.
</P>
<P>
Judge Japhet Banda of the Ndola high court said there was no
doubt the baby disappeared as a result of the hospital's
negligence or with its connivance.
</P>
<P>
He said in a judgement that the loss of the baby could not be
compensated for and he was only awarding the couple 40 million
Kwacha (32,000 US Dollars) to console them.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator on Principle of International Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese legislator
said here today that all parliaments should not only contribute to
the political, economic and social development in their own
countries, but also serve as models by following the basic
guidelines of international relations.
</P>
<P>
The parliaments should play an active role in promoting world
peace and development, especially emphasizing the principle of
democracy in dealing with international relations and objecting to
hegemonism in the current global situation, said Cao Zhi,
secretary-general of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Cao, also vice-chairman of the Organizing Committee of the 96th
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, made the remarks
today at the general debate of the on-going IPU meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that parliamentarians in all countries can join hands
to step up efforts to build a still more beautiful 21st century,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War, the international situation has
become somewhat relaxed, and the world has tended to be more
multi-polar, Cao said. But there are still many signs of instable
factors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The thinking that went hand in hand with the Cold War did not
die with the end of that era, Cao noted. Some people still cling
to old-fashioned bloc politics, and are bent on peddling their own
concept of values and extending their sphere of influence, while
showing heavy signs of hegemonism and power politics in whatever
they do and in any place and at any time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Group (attending the IPU conference) hold that the
principle of no violation to state sovereignty must be
observed. Any activities provoking, creating and aggravating
national conflicts, damaging the integrity of sovereign states and
supporting splittism, no matter what beautiful banner they hoisted
for the activities, must be subjected to the stern denunciations
by the international community and be stopped," he said.
</P>
<P>
The disputes and contradictions between countries should be
resolved by means of negotiations and consultations, without
resorting to force or threat of force, the Chinese legislator said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the unjust and unreasonable international
economic order has yet to be altered, trade protection and trade
prejudice remain serious, the state of impoverishment and
backwardness in developing countries has not yet been improved,
and the gap between the north and south keeps widening.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with their internal laws, a few large countries
frequently threaten other countries with sanctions to compel them
to comply with their own will. Such activities have damaged normal
exchanges between countries and regions and will bring serious
damages to the interests of all countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The world we live is a colorful and splendid world, nobody has
the reason to impose his own concept of values and political,
economic and social system upon others," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China will unswervingly implement the
independent foreign policy of peace, and will get along well with
peoples in all countries of the world. A developed and strong
China will contribute to world peace and human progress, and will
never pose a threat to any country or region.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is impossible for anyone to renew the issuing of
orders to China wilfully or to bully the Chinese people
recklessly," Cao said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets Israeli Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai for the first time Wednesday night, in a bid to hammer
out the principles of a Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the Palestinian side of the Erez Crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip, lasted nearly four hours until
midnight, but ended without significant results.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting started, Palestinian officials said that
high on the agenda of the meeting will be Israeli army's
redeployment from the disputed West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat, at a joint press conference following the
meeting, declined to say if he had agreed to make any changes in
the Hebron redeployment, only by saying "the
(Israeli-Palestinian) steering committee will carry out all these
details."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials who joined Arafat at the meeting
reportedly maintained that they will not accept any renegotiation
of the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Observers here pointed out that now the issue is how to
produce an agreement that will let Israel show it has improved
security for Israelis in Hebron, while Arafat can show that it is
essentially unchanged.
</P>
<P>
At the joint press conference, Mordechai said that "Hebron is a
very complicated subject, and we are trying together to find the
best solution for both sides and we will find it."
</P>
<P>
"We spoke in a serious and pertinent way on a number of
issues," said Mordechai. "We decided that the steering committee
will convene in the near future and will discuss details."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister added that he will meet with Arafat again
and discuss further issues when the steering committee "has in its
hands the framework of an agreement."
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, the Israeli army was originally supposed to
complete its redeployment in the Hebron area by March 28.
</P>
<P>
But, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel in
February and March which left over 60 people dead and more than
100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres delayed the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the May
29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu
in the elections, said afterward that he would leave the decision
of the redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives were all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu had said that he
would like Hebron to be part of the final status
arrangements with the Palestinians, but, at the same time, he
also said he would stand by the international agreements.

<HEADLINE> Peres Not to Run for Israeli Premier in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Labor Party
chairman Shimon Peres has announced that he would not run for
prime minister in the country's 2000 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Peres, prime minister of the previous Labor government, made
the announcement during an interview on Wednesday night with
Israel Television Channel 1, saying that he thought "the time has
come for a change."
</P>
<P>
Peres, reaching 74 last month, said he will remain leader of
the Labor Party until the party's internal elections scheduled for
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu in the
May 29 elections this year which had marked his fifth defeat in
Israeli elections, refused to say who he would back as his
successor.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked by the interviewer whether he supported
the apparent front-runner MK (member of the Knesset, Israel's
parliament) Ehud Barak, he replied by saying that "Barak has the
qualifications to be prime minister, and there are a few others,
who have the talent to be prime minister, and I do not rule out
anyone."
</P>
<P>
Barak, former chief of staff of the Israeli army, formally
announced last week that he will seek the Labor leadership and its
nomination for prime minister, even if Peres does not step down.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who was in the United States at the time when Barak made
the announcement, then told Israel Television in irate tones that
"if that's what Barak wants to do, its his right .... I will
announce my intention when I see fit."
</P>
<P>
Peres' announcement came one day after the analysis of his May
electoral defeat, which was composed by Labor MK Shevah Weiss and
did not directly place blame on Peres, was presented to the press.
</P>
<P>
The former premier said at that time that he expected to face
the public's judgment in future, adding that he would make the
decision on whether to run again for prime minister in the due
time.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's interview, Peres stressed that in any case, he
"will not retire from the struggle for peace," adding, "One can do
a lot without being prime minister, and I do not intend to give up
the fight for what I believe in even by one centimeter."
</P>
<P>
Peres' announcement set the stage for a bitter succession
battle in the Labor Party between MK Haim Ramon, former interior
minister, and Barak, who took the portfolio of foreign minister in
the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Ramon was reportedly trying to put the leadership at a bout
for as long as possible, since he is now in the underdog
position, especially as his failed campaign strategy is under
strong fire.
</P>
<P>
Ramon, head of Labor's campaign headquarters, and his strategy
to ignore Netanyahu and treat him in an arrogant manner during the
election campaign had been mainly blamed for Labor's defeat in the
May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, who also hoped earlier to postpone the contest
for party leadership, said during the interview that the Labor
Party "must stick to its schedule for elections."
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, the Labor convention is to meet at
the beginning of 1997 to be followed by the elections in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
"The election process actually will begin in January or
February when a committee is be chosen which will decide on the
election rules," Peres added.

<HEADLINE> USAID to Help Vanila Production in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A United States Aid (USAID)
official said his agency will assist Uganda in developing vanila,
"the New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Steve New, the horticultural advisor of USAID, failed to
reveal detail of the assistance but said that 21 private vanila
demonstration plot will be set up in Uganda within the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
Among them, seven will be in eastern Uganda, seven around
Kampala, six in western and one in central Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Vanila is a food flavor and medical plant and has a high
demand in international market. The orchid crop is still new in
Uganda and has no practical local market.
</P>
<P>
New told local vanila farmers that Uganda has a potential to
produce 50 tons of the crop annually and that would amount to 10
percent of the world production.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda can only be certain of international buyers if it does
not send poor quality vanila," New said.

<HEADLINE> Railway Promotes Urban Development in Jiangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi
Province is seizing opportunities to accelerate the construction
of cities and towns along the Beijing-Kowloon railway, one of the
two lines in the country that run from north to south.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the railway stretches across the province, where
officials have vowed to set up a modern urban network including 15
cities and 200 towns along the line by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has called for greater attention paid
to overall planning, development of complete infrastructure
facilities and ecological environment in urban construction.
</P>
<P>
The province, which has a solid agricultural foundation and
abundant underground resources, will conduct pilot programs in
seven towns along the railway.
</P>
<P>
The province has focused on urban construction by using
investments, bank loans, and other financial sources, and by
initiating reforms of housing and household registration systems.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, 1.77 billion yuan (about 213 million
US dollars) have been injected into urban construction in areas
along the railway.
</P>
<P>
Urban construction has greatly promoted the economic
development along the railway. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
generated by 22 cities or counties along the line accounts for 41
percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the investment environment, more
investors have come to the areas. Hong Kong businessmen will
invest 120 million yuan in building a plaza in Ganzhou. Badu Town
in Jishui County will use 9.67 million yuan of investment to build
an edible oil cereals and foodstuffs company.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, real estate, posts and telecommunications industries
in areas along the railway also foresee a good development trend,
local officials said.

<HEADLINE> Dengue Fever Grips Indian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever has gripped
New Delhi, claiming at least eight lives in the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), one of the major hospitals
in the Indian capital, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, 20 people suspected to be suffering from
dengue were admitted to the AIIMS, bringing the number Since
August 18 to 45. Among them, eight patients under the age of 17
have died.
</P>
<P>
The patients come from every corner of Delhi and suspected
dengue cases were also reported from other hospitals of the
capital. Even two doctors from AIIMS are not spared by the dengue
menace.
</P>
<P>
Indian Medical Association President Prem Aggarwal warned that
figures reported may be much lower than the actual incidence as
they are only from government hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever is a disease caused by Dengue virus which is
transmitted from patients to healthy men through mosquito. The
patient usually suffers from very high fever, body ache and
vomiting of blood due to gastric hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
Despite the deaths and the ever-increasing number of dengue
patients, there still appears to be some doubt about the identity
of the fever.
</P>
<P>
"The persons who died have the clinical symptoms of dengue
fever. For proper diagnosis, there has to be a serological test
which can be done only at the laboratory in Pune (in Maharastra
state of India). Only that can positively determine that this is
dengue," a highly-placed source in the AIIMS said.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Governor Reiterates Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to follow
a stringent monetary policy during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), the governor of the People's Bank of China said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international seminar attended by senior company
executives, Dai Xianglong said that the next five years mark a
critical period in China's reform and opening-up drive, as well as
in its effort to pursue socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
"We should focus our effort on consolidating and improving what
we have achieved in reform and opening-up, speeding up economic
development, and preventing an economic overheating and
inflation," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to solve deep-rooted contradictions
and problems concerning the economic mechanism, while avoiding
major fluctuations in economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of this means that the monetary policy of the central bank
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period can neither be loose nor
too tight," Dai said. adding that "Instead, we should continue to
follow an appropriately tight monetary policy and make inflation
control the first task of our financial macro-control."
</P>
<P>
He said this is a realistic choice based on past practices and
experience, and noted that a relatively tight monetary policy over
the past several years has played a significant role in curbing
inflation and promoting the rapid, healthy and sustained
development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Official data shows that China's gross domestic product grew
9.8 percent year-on-year in the first of this year, while the
retail price index was up 6.9 percent between January and July,
compared with 21.7 percent for 1994 and 14.8 percent last
year. The monthly retail price index for July was 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that he expects the year-round economic growth rate to
stand at around 10 percent, and the retail price index to be around
seven percent, well below the planned target of 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Troops Massing Along Border With Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudan is massing troops
along the common border with Uganda and has infiltrated 800
Uganda's rebels of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) into the
country, reported "the Crusader" paper today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, Presidential Advisor
on Military and Political Affairs in the North as saying, "I
think the build-up was intended to infiltrate in the WNBF group."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the September 8 peace deal still holds in
the face of the Sudanese army build-up at the border, Saleh
expressed misgivings, but said he was not mandated to speak on
behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
On September 8, Uganda and Sudan signed an agreement on
normalization of relations between the two countries in Khartoum,
Sudan under the mediation of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Osman, Sudanese deputy ambassador in Nairobi, Kenya was quoted
by the paper as saying, "I can tell you that our government is
committed to abiding by all the ten points of the Khartoum
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Among the terms of the Khartoum agreement, Uganda and Sudan
pledged to cease providing territory to be used by belligerent
forces against each other. They also agreed to stop supporting or
training rebels.
</P>
<P>
But both the Sudanese envoy in Nairobi and senior foreign
ministry official here told the paper the tenets of the agreement
would sort out any such breaches once implemented.
</P>
<P>
Osman said, "the two countries are working to implement the
agreement and things will be sorted out once it is in place."
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Uganda foreign affairs official was quoted
as saying that before the verification team agreed upon by both
governments was in place, it was impossible to monitor what was
happening at the border.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously before those teams are in place one cannot rule out
the possibility of any group trying to have a quick advantage,"
he said.

<P>
YINCHUAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China has set up more than
40 nature reserves for the protection of aquatic wildlife,
according to a recent national conference on aquatic wildlife
protection in the capital of northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserves have become a haven for such precious
animals as the Yangtze River dolphin, Chinese sturgeon, sea
turtles, and salamanders, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in aquatic wildlife resources, but, because of
uncontrolled fishing, many precious species have seen their
numbers drop dramatically since the 1970s. There are now fewer
than 100 Yangtze River dolphins in the country.
</P>
<P>
Because of the efforts of various groups, however, the decline
in the number of Chinese sturgeons and salamanders have stopped
this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, 13 varieties of aquatic animals are under class-one
protection and over 70 varieties are under class-two protection in
the nature reserves, officials said.

The Ganges, passing through the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh
and Bihar, enters into West Bengal state and finally flows down to
Bangladesh before falling into the Bay of Bengal. Since India
constructed the Farakka barrage in West Bengal state on the upper
stream of the Ganges, Bangladesh has suffered a lot during the dry
season due to the alleged "unilateral withdrawal" of water by
India.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the Bangladeshi foreign minister told newsmen
in Calcutta that he had positive and fruitful exchanges of views
on the issue at stake and was hopeful of an agreement before the
beginning of the next lean period in the early months of next
year.
</P>
<P>
But Basu was quoted by local press as saying that there had
been difference of opinion about the quantum of water at the
Farakka point, which had created some problems in working out a
water sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal could not concur with Bangladesh on the quantum of
flow which was being demanded by it, he said, hoping that the
Joint Expert Committee of both countries would be able to resolve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Indian External Affairs Minister I. K.
Gujral visited Dhaka and promised a permanent agreement with
Bangladesh on the water sharing issue before the next dry season.
</P>
<P>
But since the Farakka barrage on the Ganges is located in West
Bengal, the attitude of the state government is the crux to the
solution of the issue, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Makes Success in Cultivating Highland Spring Wheat, Barley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to high-yield
cultivation technologies, a bumper harvest of highland spring
wheat and spring barley has been reported in Deqen Town of
Doilungdeqen County in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The output per mu (0.06 hectare) of spring wheat reached 431
kilograms, and barley hit 417 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Deqen Town is located at an altitude of more than 3,800 meters
above the sea level. For a long period, the per-mu volume of
spring wheat and barley stood only at about 200 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Lhasa Science and Technology Committee charged
Doilungdeqen County with carrying out a program which aims to
improve the wheat and barley cultivation technology in this region.
</P>
<P>
The new cultivation technologies have been used on some 2,000
mu (120 hectares) of farmland in Deqen Town. They are also
expected to be popularized in other parts of the autonomous
region.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Province Intensifies Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has redoubled efforts to control pollution, in accordance with
environmental protection regulations set forth by provincial
authorities and city governments.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Jiangsu provincial authorities and 11
cities directly under the provincial government have formulated
300 sets of regulations and rules on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the regulations, the provincial government and
the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress have
conducted six environmental protection inspections throughout
Jiangsu, one of the most developed areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, 10,483 manufacturers have been
inspected, a provincial government official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the provincial government ordered 200
manufacturers to shut down, install pollution control facilities
or shift to other lines of production.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,400 manufacturers were ordered to bring pollution under
control within a prescribed time, he said, adding that another 800
were fined.
</P>
<P>
Following environmental protection regulations, governments at
all levels spent 8.96 billion yuan for pollution control projects
during the 1989-1994 period.
</P>
<P>
During that time, products worth 4.38 billion yuan were turned
out by making use of wastewater, waste gas and slag, he said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will spend 14 billion yuan over the
next decade to control pollution in the Huaihe River Valley, the
Taihu Lake and the section of the Grand Canal that flows through
the southern part of Jiangsu.

<HEADLINE> Consumers' Co-Operatives For Hangzhou's Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Trade unions in the capital
of east China's Zhejiang Province are setting up inexpensive
co-operatives to help workers cut their costs by buying directly
from producers or manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The co-operatives purchase grain, cooking oils, various kinds
of non-stable foods, and general merchandise, according to an
official of the Hangzhou City Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
In this way, commodity prices in the co-operatives are usually
15 to 20 percent lower than those in other stores and shops in
Hangzhou, the official said, noting that to date, trade union
organizations in 58 enterprises have opened co-operatives that
serve 30,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Some co-operatives have introduced a membership system, under
which workers buy shares in the co-operatives and draw dividends
regularly.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou City Federation of Trade Unions is preparing to
set up a marketing center that will provide various kinds of
services for the co-operatives, as well.

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Needs Effective State Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese central
government needs to regulate the auto industry's growth in
accordance with the development in other sectors, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The automobile sector, which is still a fledging industry in
China, has proved invaluable in stimulating other sectors, but its
growth demands concerted efforts of different departments and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The annual automobile output growth in China reached 23.3
percent during the period of the Eighth Five-Year-Plan (1991-95),
which might be too fast compared with the development of roads.
</P>
<P>
Hence, travel is slower, and traffic jam is a constant
phenomenon in urban areas. To cope with this, different cities
across China have adopted various kinds of policies, including
restricting the traffic of vehicles with smaller emission engines.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Beijing's municipal traffic authorities issued a
decree limiting jeeps, light buses and sedans with engines smaller
than 1.0 litres to every other day traffic according to their
licence plate numbers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victim vehicles are domestically made economy cars.
</P>
<P>
Though the State Automotive Industry Policy encourages the
manufacture and consumption of private and economy cars, many
local governments were discouraging individuals from buying cars
by placing restrictions on the use of small, domestically produced
cars. They imposed taxes and fees on car owners, banned traffic
and restricted the number of parking places.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, taxes and fees on car purchases equal a third of a
car's price. In Shanghai, a private car licence costs 140,000 yuan
(16,860 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Buses are much more efficient in carrying passengers, some
say. They suggest the state should limit the number of cars
purchased with public funds, impose higher fees for occupying the
road space, and limit emission levels and petroleum use.
</P>
<P>
Many local governments also use the chance for solving traffic
difficulty in cities as pretexts for local protectionism. For
example, in Beijing, locally produced Cherokee jeeps are not
restricted, whereas Shanghai banned the sale of Tianjin-made
Charades in March and April of 1996. And other cities have adopted
similar protectionist policies.
</P>
<P>
So, intervention by the central government is a must for
preventing freewheeling local authorities from fragmenting the
auto market and freezing the industry's development.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the State Council issued another directive
demanding regional authorities to rescind regulations that
restrict the purchase and use of economy cars. But it does not
clarify penalties for violations and lacks a deadline.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of restrictive measures, China's automobile
market has plunged to its lowest in years. In the first four
months of this year, production of cars, trucks and buses rose 3.1
percent nationwide, but sales showed a drop of 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sedan prices dropped notable, with prices down 13 percent from
the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> NZ, Australia Agree on Single Aviation Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand and Australia
have agreed on arrangements for a single aviation market (SAM) to
come into effect from November 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced jointly today by NZ Minister of Transport
Maurice Williamson and his Australian counterpart John Sharp, said
a press release from Williamson's office.
</P>
<P>
Under the new SAM arrangements, airlines of each country enjoy
unrestricted rights to fly anywhere within the other country and
have unrestricted rights to fly trans-Tasman services.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no limit on the number of SAM airlines of either
country that can operate services linking any two cities within
and directly between the two countries," the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that "these historic SAM arrangements will
mean that air services are much more effectively part of the
broader closer economic relations between Australia and New
Zealand, and will provide for a more competitive environment,
benefiting the consumer."
</P>
<P>
The agreement is a symbol of warming up of relations between
the two countries, which were strained in November 1994, when a
similar agreement was scrapped by the then Australian government
only days before it was to be put into effect.
</P>
<P>
Relations began to improve after the Australian government of
John Howard came to power this year.

<HEADLINE> 16 Pregnant Women Die of Hepatitis in Nepali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of the
hepatitis E disease this year has claimed 16 pregnant women in
this capital city of Nepal, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The women, all in the age group between 18 to 26, died during a
two-month period till mid-August, sparking health experts' concern
over local hospitals' capability to treat the acute liver disease.
</P>
<P>
Health experts here warned that if the government fails to act
promptly, more pregnant women will die each year due to hepatitis
E infection.
</P>
<P>
According to a local hepatitis expert, pregnant women are prone
 to contract the disease which could lead to acute liver failure.
</P>
<P>
90 percent of the infected women lost their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
The experts have suggested that the maternity hospital in
Kathmandu should open a specialized intensive care unit for
pregnant women with hepatitis diseases.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to take immediate measures to
get rid off the very cause of hepatitis outbreaks in Kathmandu
every year-- the unclean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people in the capital area contract hepatitis
every year through heavily contaminated tap water during the
monsoon season, normally from June to September, they said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition Blames PM for Poor Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The opposition has accused
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa of mishandling Thailand's
external economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Banharn was personally responsible for the poor performance of
the Thai export sector in the first half of this year, Democrat
Party MP Jurin Laksanavisith said in parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first seven months rose by a disappointing 3.8
percent, which was held back by declining exports of 15 important
Thai farm products.
</P>
<P>
This year has also run a trade deficit with the US for the
first time in 12 years, according to Jurin.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that it was unfair to compare this year's exports
with the "exceptional export growth" of last year, and export
growth last year was unusually high because the Chuan government
distorted the figures.
</P>
<P>
The Banharn government came to office in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, who is leader of
the Chart Pattana (national development) party, accused Banharn of
failing to fully pursue Mekong river sub-regional economic
development projects, which, if properly managed, would enable
Thailand to serve as a gateway to Indochina.
</P>
<P>
The quadrangle project in the north and the seaboard
development projects in the south have virtually come to a halt
under the Banharn administration, Chatichai said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Banharn government has paid little attention
to Indochina, and other countries have moved into what is supposed
to be Thailand's backyard.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai also said that Banharn lacks vision in foreign
economic policy-making.

<HEADLINE> Christopher to Meet Syrian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Warren Christopher will meet his Syrian counterpart, Farouq
al-Shara, in New York next week to discuss peace prospects between
Syria and Israel and Syria's recent troop movements in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said today the
meeting "will provide an opportunity to discuss all of the issues"
concerning the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Syria has, in effect, recently turned down U.S.-Israeli
proposals as they contain nothing related to the "land-for-peace"
formula, which Syria has always said is the starting point for any
Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria in recent weeks has moved up to 12,000 troops in Lebanon
closer to Israel's border, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu says is an attempt to pressure Israel into granting
territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
The focus is the Golan Heights, once Syrian sovereign
territory, but snatched by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
Netanyahu has said Israel would not cede the strategic plateau as
a peace swap.
</P>
<P>
Burns played down the Syrian troop movements, saying it was
"obviously an issue that bears watching". He said the United
States wanted to know "what the Israelis think and what the
Syrians think".
</P>
<P>
Burns was also cautious about Wednesday's disclosure that
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai had approved a plan to
build more homes in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We will just first have to see exactly what this announcement
is, what the timetable for construction is, if there is a
timetable that exists," he told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The United States sees Jewish settlements as a problem
complicating the Middle East peace process.

Customer Services, the training and service center co-established
by Airbus Industrie and the China Aviation Supplies Corp.(CASC) to
accommodate Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
Some of the world's leading aerospace firms are among the 13
enterprises to sign agreements with CASC-Airbus Customer
Services. They include Aerospatiale of France, and Allied-Signal
of the United States, according to sources with Airbus Industrie
China.
</P>
<P>
With offices in the center, the companies will be able to offer
technical assistance and spare parts to Chinese buyers. And most
of these companies will set up repair facilities in the center, to
reduce the time and cost for changing parts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several other companies are also negotiating with
the center and are expected to sign contracts.
</P>
<P>
Located near the Capital Airport in Beijing, the center is the
first in the world to combine training with customer support, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Construction for the new facility began in July of 1995, and
the center is scheduled to open next year. Airbus' investment in

BONN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany was "very satisfied"
with a report of the United Nations (U.N.) on reform of the
Security Council, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann
today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest work report of the U.N. committee on
Security Council reform, Erdmann said the report verified the
necessity of council reform and analyzed the international
community's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the report showed that most of the 185 U.N. members
supported Germany's efforts to become a permanent member of the
Security Council, the U.N.'s premier decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman criticized the report for giving too much
space to the views of six countries opposed to Germany's permanent
membership.
</P>
<P>
The six countries are Italy, Mexico, Pakistan, India, New
Zealand and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Italy has proposed adding 10 non-permanent seats to the
15-member Security Council to "democratize" it, but has opposed
any formula that would grant Germany permanent membership status
without giving others a chance.
</P>
<P>
Nobody expected the "door of reform" to open immediately,
Erdmann said. "It is not strange that some countries at present
don't want reform."

<HEADLINE> Russia to Tighten Fiscal Measures in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government will
strengthen tax collection, cut down fiscal deficit and encourage
investment next year, Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said
today.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the economic measures for 1997, Livshits told a
meeting of federal departmental leaders that while tax system will
be simplified and enterprises' profit tax be reduced, tax
collection will be tightened to stop loopholes.
</P>
<P>
Those who violate the tax system will be severely punished or
even face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
He expected that these measures will help bring in an
additional fiscal revenue of at least 40 trillion roubles (about
7.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He added that the government will continue to contain inflation
and cut fiscal deficit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 draft budget envisages a fiscal deficit of 89.1
trillion roubles (16.5 billion dollars), or 3.3 percent of the
Gross National Product (GNP). That will be 0.5 percentage points
lower than the level of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deficit will be made up by the issues of
government bonds worth 50 trillion roubles (9 billion dollars) and
by the financing from external sources.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government will improve the environment
for investment. The central bank will cut its lending rate to
commercial banks and the rate of returns of government bonds.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government may issue foreign exchange bonds to
utilize the large amount of foreign currencies being held by
Russian residents.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Market Index Down Due To Censure Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The three-day censure debate
against Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa which began
Wednesday has sustained a nose-dive on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the market opened on Wednesday, the SET index
dipped 2.15 points. It fell by a further 17 points, the lowest for
the morning session, before rebounding to end the day at 1,038.03,
making a total loss of 12.32 points, or 1.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market turnover was as low as 2.72 billion baht (108.8
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Investors are watching the no-confidence debate against the
prime minister and many of them are hoping that the censure motion
would bring in a new government to tackle the economic problems
facing Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi, an opposition MP and a deputy prime
minister in charge of economic issues in the former Chuan
government, seemed to have convinced a large section of the
business and financial community that the Banharn government has
mismanaged the economy.
</P>
<P>
Supachai warned during the debate in the parliament that the
Thai economy could be heading for a "crash landing."
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen believed that the opposition's charges were
well prepared and backed by credible data, which showed
mismanagement of the economy by the government.
</P>
<P>
Several bankers said the prime minister is likely to lose his
job after the censure.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, share prices finished 0.8 percent lower on
profit-taking after three consecutive days of gains and on the eve
of the censure debate.
</P>
<P>
The broad-based SET index fell 8.52 points from Monday to close

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Sri Lanka in Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 19 (Xinhua)-- The United States is to
provide 3.85 million U.S. dollars for three development projects
in Sri Lanka, economic sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the two countries signed a grant agreement
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to fund the ongoing sustainable Economic
Growth Program and Citizens Participation Project and a new
Natural Resources and Environmental Practices Program.
</P>
<P>
The Sustainable Economic Program aims to increase employment
opportunities and incomes through the expansion of small and
medium-sized businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Resources and Environmental Practices Program is
for technical assistance and training which aims to help improve
environmental practices in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Under the Citizens Participation Project, ordinary people are
empowered to participate in democracy and the funds allocated to
this project will be used to help disadvantaged people such as war
victims and displaced children and orphans.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the grant, totaling 3.85 million dollars for
the three projects, is the third tranche of economic assistance
grant funds provided to Sri Lanka by the United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The United States, through its international development aid
programs, continues to support Sri Lanka's broad-based sustainable
development objectives, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Space Dock and Shannon's Homeward Bound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States space
shuttle Atlantis successfully docked with orbiting Russian space
station Mir late today, on the first step to get woman astronaut
Shannon Lucid home soon.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis and Mir connected over the Carpathian Mountains above
Eastern Europe at 11:13 p.m. EDT, at the planned time.
</P>
<P>
The docking, the fourth linkup between Atlantis and Mir, will
serve as a practice for the planned International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
Lucid broke the previous record by staying six months in orbit
-- unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old biochemist was supposed to return to Earth in
early August. But problems with Atlantis' booster rockets and two
hurricanes delayed the spacecraft's trip and helped Lucid set a
U.S. space endurance record, and a world record for a woman
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
According to the NASA schedule, the hatches between the joined
spacecraft were to be opened shortly after 1:30 a.m. EDT, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lucid and John Blaha were to swap places -- Lucid will join the
Atlantis crew while Blaha begin his four-month stay on the Russian
space station.
</P>
<P>
The two spacecraft will fly together for five days and be
undocked next Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Coca Cola company will
invest 500 million U.S. dollars in Venezuela in the next five
years while Pepsi will return to this Latin American country with
a 400-million-dollar investment.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Goizueta, president of Coca Cola's directive board,
said here today that the 500-million-dollar investment will have
positive effects for the Venezuelan economy as it will create some
100,000 direct or indirect jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Coca Cola executive also said the Venezuelan market is very
important for the soft drink business because the climate of the
country favors the consumption of cold drinks.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelans have high buying power and the soft drinks
industry is not sufficiently developed in this country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Uribe Montalvo, Pepsi company's president for Latin
American region, also announced here today that this company will
return to Venezuela with the investment in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
He said his company expects to lead again the soft drink field
in the country, after the strong strategy of its competitor.
</P>
<P>
He said that in two years his company will recover the position
it had held in this Latin American country before August 16, when
the contract expired.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Hold Security Talks in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Japan started a two-day talk here today on bilateral issues and
their relations with other countries in the Asian-Pacific region,
the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his Japanese
counterpart Yukihiko Ikeda kicked off discussions at the State
Department this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined on Thursday by Defense Secretary William
Perry and his Japanese counterpart Hideo Usui in the so-called
two-plus-two talks, which have been held periodically between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
After the two-plus-two talks there will be a joint news
conference.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Christopher and Perry and their Japanese
counterparts are expected to discuss the work being done by the
Special Action Committee on Okinawa, the ongoing review of the
1978 defense guidelines, the two countries' respective
relationships with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and
the efforts of our two governments to expand the stabilizing
influence of multilateral security dialogues in the Asia-Pacific
region, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the American military bases on the Japanese
island of Okinawa would be an important issue during the
U.S.-Japanese talks as there is a surge of protest staged by
Okinawans against the 27,000 U.S. troops occupying one-fifth of
the island.
</P>
<P>
Residents have long resented the noise, inconvenience and
crime, many of which were associated with the American presence.
</P>
<P>
That resentment erupted last year when three U.S. servicemen
raped a 12-year-old Japanese schoolgirl. The three were
subsequently found guilty and sentenced to prison for up to seven
years.
</P>
<P>
Okinawan residents overwhelmingly favored withdrawal of U.S.
troops in a recent referendum, but the United States and Japan say
such a move would destabilize security in the region.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Seeks U.S. Rent for Military Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran armed forces
will ask the United States government to pay one million
U.S. dollars in "rent" for the Palmerola Base built by the United
States in the 1980s during the period of tension in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
Honduran military sources said today that its armed forces are
in danger of disappearing because of the low military budget.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, James Creagan, said his
government did not pay anything for a military base anywhere.
</P>
<P>
He said the permanence of a U.S. military group in Palmerola
"is of mutual interest", because programs and exercises
implemented in the base benefited Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Officers of the U.S. Army's Southern Command said several
months ago that the U.S. military presence in Honduras would be
increased with the deployment of more troops to the Palmerola
base, which is located in the province of Comayagua, in the middle
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Honduran armed forces has asked Honduran
President Carlos Roberto Reina to increase the military budget in
order for the army to "survive".
</P>
<P>
Honduran Human Rights National Commission leader Leo Valladares
said: "Our national sovereignty must not be loaned or leased."

<HEADLINE> Official on China's Strategy for Fine Chemicals Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) --- China's fine chemicals
industry scored remarkable achievements in the past five years,
and the sector will continue to develop through the remainder of
the century, said Cheng Siwei, Chinese Vice-Minister of Chemical
Industry today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China's total chemical output value rose from 25 percent in
1990 to 32 percent in 1995, Cheng said in his keynote speech at
the opening session of the '96 China Chemical Conference.
</P>
<P>
To raise the country's fine chemical ratio to 40-50 percent by
the year 2000, the Chinese Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI)
will open wider to the rest of the world and enhance its
development capability for new technology and new products, Cheng
said, adding that by doing so, China will improve its
competitiveness in the fine chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
MCI has clearly defined development guidelines for nine major
sectors, including pesticides, dyestuffs and dyeing and finishing
auxiliaries, which are used to make additives, paper-making
chemicals, leather chemicals and water treatment chemicals, Cheng
said.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, China will need 1.5 million tons of
food additives, and paper-making chemicals each year, and its
demand for leather chemicals and water treatment chemicals will
double and redouble.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, efforts will also be made to tap into some
markets which are expected to grow rapidly in the near future,
such as auto paints, building coatings and a full range of
reagents for large-scale integrated circuits and new-style
components and devices.
</P>
<P>
While striving to raise its supply of raw materials for fine
chemical production, the country will continue to import organic
intermediates and surfactants of dyestuffs and pesticides.
Meanwhile, technical cooperation may be carried out to develop,
manufacture and supply some fine chemicals for clients from
abroad, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that the ministry has decided to build a
number of fine chemicals bases across the country. The first group
consists of 15 small and medium-size cities, namely Suzhou, Wuxi,
Huangyan of Taizhou, Jingsha, Fushun, Xingji, Luzhou, Binzhou,
Nantong, Wuhu, Xiangtan, Deyang, Kaifeng, Huzhou and Zhongshan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Explains China's Dissident Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China allows different
opinions, but the criminal acts by a few people to undermine
social stability, national unity and unification must be checked
according to the constitution and law, said a senior Chinese
official here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local newspaper, Li Ruihuan, chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, elaborated on China's policy on
dissidents in response to a question from reporters.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here on a four-day visit to Switzerland, said that
China's reform and opening process and its socialist modernization
construction had enjoyed most wide endorsement and support from
the people because they comply with the fundamental interests of
all Chinese nationalities.
</P>
<P>
It is normal that there are different opinions in China, since
the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics is an
unprecedented cause with many aspects of it in trial, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Only when the criminal acts to sabotage social stability,
national unity and unification are checked in accordance with the
constitution and law, can normal social order be maintained and
people's interests be safeguarded, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
The policy is the same in all countries ruled by law and has
nothing to do with the strength of a country, Li went on to say,
in response to a question whether an economically stronger China
could be softer to anti-socialist forces.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Switzerland Monday on the fourth leg of his
European trip which has already taken him to Poland, the
Netherlands and Austria. His next stop is Russia.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows More U.S. Children Abused, Neglected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of children
abused and neglected in the United States nearly doubled between
1986 and 1993 and the trend is continuing, according to a U.S.
Federal study released here today.
</P>
<P>
The study was released by the Department of Health and Human
Services at a National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect.
</P>
<P>
It said the estimated number of children abused and neglected
rose to 2.81 million in 1993, up 98 percent from 1.42 million in
1986 when the last report was published.
</P>
<P>
The estimated number of seriously injured children nearly
quadrupled, from 141,700 in 1986 to 565,000 in 1993, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics appeared to "herald a true rise in the scope and
severity of child abuse and neglect in the United States," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
Drug and alcohol abuse and a breakdown of the family were to
blame for many of the cases, while unemployment contributed partly
to the rise.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that children of single parents had more
chance of being abused and neglected than those who lived with
both parents. The risk was 77 percent greater in physical abuse
and 87 percent greater in physical neglect.
</P>
<P>
The single-parent children also had an 80-percent greater risk
of suffering serious injury or harm from abuse or neglect than
those who lived with both parents.
</P>
<P>
Another factor the study found was that children from families
earning less than 15,000 U.S. dollars a year were 22 times more
likely to suffer maltreatment than children from families with
annual incomes above 30,000 dollars. They were also 18 times more
likely to be sexually abused and 22 times more likely to be
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
While the incidence went up during the seven-year period, the
report noted that the number of cases investigated by state
agencies remained constant. As a result, the cases that state
child protective services workers investigated fell from 44
percent of the total in 1986 to 28 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"This picture suggests that the child protective system has
reached its capacity to respond to the maltreated child
population," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking at are extremely grim prospects for the
future," said Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health
Fund.

<HEADLINE> '96 China Chemicals Conference Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international
conference on China's fine and specialty chemicals opened here
today, attracting executives and representatives from many of the
world's largest chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the '96 China Fine Chemicals Conference include
senior executives from such big-name transnational firms as Du
Pont, Monsanto, LG, Bayer and Rhone Poulenc, as well as senior
officials of China's Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI)) and
representatives from China's major fine chemicals production bases.

opening session of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to jack up the contribution of fine chemicals to the

Though the two countries had different social systems, cultural
traditions and values, Liu said, "we believe that Sino-Italian
relations will undergo a long-term, stable, healthy and smooth
development" as long as both sides seek common ground and reserve
differences.
</P>
<P>
Liu also said the links between the two armies constituted an
important part of the bilateral ties. He stressed that the level
of the military cooperation should be in parallel to that of the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there had been frequent exchanges and good
cooperation between the two armies during the past years and said
he hoped his visit would help promote the friendly cooperation.
</P>

France, will meet Italian President Oscar Scalfaro and Prime
Minister Romano Prodi during his stay here.

<HEADLINE> "ASEAN 10" to Encourage Confidence-Building Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The proposed enlargement of
ASEAN membership to 10 countries will encourage further regional
cooperation which in turn will facilitate the taking of
confidence-building measures, a noted Malaysian scholar said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Noordin Sopiee, director general of Malaysia's Institute of
Security and International Studies (ISIS), said an "ASEAN Ten"
would fuel economic growth and reduce economic barriers to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international seminar themed "one Southeast Asia
in a new regional and international setting," Sopiee said an ASEAN
grouping 10 countries would also make the Southeast Asian region
more stable.
</P>
<P>
But there might also be an adverse aspect to the planned
admission of Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar as ASEAN members at the
association's 30th anniversary in Kuala Lumpur next July, he said.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement of ASEAN membership would complicate relations
between ASEAN and its dialogue partners, such as the United
States, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea
and Japan. It would also slow the creation of an ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA), he said.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1967, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
currently groups seven countries: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
At their summit in Bangkok last year, ASEAN leaders called for
the "speedy realization of an ASEAN comprising all Southeast
Asia."
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, which was organized by Indonesia's Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) to commemorate its
silver anniversary, is being attended by more than 200 scholars
from Indonesia and foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> ROK Chemical Giant to Invest 5 Billion US Dollars in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The LG Group, a leading
transnational company in the Republic of Korea, plans to make
investments totaling five billion to six billion US dollars in its
chemical business in China in the coming 10 years, Jin-Hwan Chun,
president of its LG Group Executive Office said here today,
</P>
<P>
While addressing the on-going China Chemical Conference '96
(fine and specialty chemicals), he said the investment will be
concentrated on three major chemical sectors, namely, oil refining
and petrochemical complex; farm chemicals, daily-use chemical and
other chemical products; and fine chemical, new material and
biological engineering.
</P>
<P>
The group has riveted an eye on the promising growth prospects
for China's chemical industry, Jin-Hwan Chun noted.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that at the beginning of the next century, the
growth in demand for chemicals from the developing countries will
outpace that of the global average. Among these nations, China is
regarded as one of the most important chemicals markets in the
world.
</P>
<P>
LG deems that China boasts many advantages in developing
chemical industry, said Chun, citing a world together with a
rather low-level, per-capita chemicals consumption; abundant
natural resources for manufacture of chemicals; rich human
resources for scientific development; and a complete chemical
industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
The group started to develop chemical business in China in
1994, and it has, to date, launched six joint ventures in the
country, producing cosmetics, PVC, dyestuffs and sorbitol (or a
kind of faintly sweet alcohol). These ventures involve a combined
investment of 150 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Power Industry in Tibet Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Tibet's power industry has
grown rapidly over the past five years as a result of central
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Regional Department of the Power Industry
said that power production reached 520 million kilowatt-hours in
1995 and has risen at annual rate of 10.2 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The official said that during the 1991-95 period, 2.3 billion
yuan, 85 percent of which came from the central government, was
spent in building power stations with a total generating capacity
of 200,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tibet's generating capacity rose to 193,000 kw and
electricity became available in eight of the 21 counties that had
no supply, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of the Power Industry and other parts of China
are helping Tibet upgrade its power industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-95 period, the Ministry of Power Industry spent
26 million yuan upgrading the Qamdo power grid, and Shandong
Province in east China spent 78 million yuan to modernize the
Tanghe Power Plant in Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government
also raised 220 million yuan to undertake 30 updating projects in
local power industry, he said.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
today recommended its exporters to increase their trade with the
countries on the rim of the Asia-Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"The Asia-Pacific zone will be one of the areas with the
fastest economic growth in the world in the next 30 or 40 years,
and that is one of the reasons why we must extend our strategic
commercial lines in that direction," said Foreign Minister Guido
di Tella.

</P>
<P>
Participants agreed to promote a strategy of searching for new
markets for Argentine products and those of the South American
Common Market (Mercosur) in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that between 1990 and 1996, Argentine
exports to East Asia went from 1.162 billion U.S. dollars to about
2.5 billion dollars, an annual increase of 13 percent.
</P>

BRASILIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said here today that his country supports Brazil's bid to
become a permanent member on the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"A Latin American country must occupy a seat" in the Security
Council that would be eventually expanded, "and anyone who looks
at a map can see that that country must be Brazil", said Kohl at a
press conference before leaving Brazil for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The current makeup of the council dates back to the end of
World War II and no longer corresponds to reality, he said, adding
that Brazil should be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
Germany also wants to be a permanent member of the Security
Council and has Brazil's support. Japan is still the other also
seeking a permanent seat.
</P>
<P>
Kohl added Brazil and Germany are preparing a proposal to be
presented to the United Nations for protecting the global
environment.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kohl and Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso signed a technological cooperation agreement and a
memorandum of understanding in transportation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Hostages Found Dead in Irian Jaya, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The last two of 16 hostages
taken by separatist rebels in Indonesia's easternmost province of
Irian Jaya last month were found dead in a ravine Wednesday, a
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
They were murdered by their captors, the spokesman was quoted
by Antara News Agency today as saying.
</P>
<P>
A group of about 50 armed men raided the base camp of Pt.
Kamundan Raya, a logging company, 60 kilometers north of Timika on
August 14 and kidnapped 16 workers.
</P>
<P>
However, two hostages later escaped while two others were
released to deliver a letter to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
On August 30, Indonesian troops rescued nine of the 12
remaining hostages held by the Security Disturbance Group (GPK)
and another one was found in a weak condition on September 16
near where he was abducted.
</P>
<P>
The finding of the bodies of the two workers brings to a close
the drama of the second hostage taking in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The first one occurred last January when the Irianese
separatist rebels took hostage 11 biological researchers including
several foreign nationals. Two Indonesian researchers died during
a rescue attempt in May by the military.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Police Begin Hunting Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican police has
deployed its forces to hunt for the group that kidnapped a Dutch
couple in August in the north of the country, the authorities said
today.
</P>
<P>
The couple, Huite Sierd Zijlstra and Jetty Cuors, both 50, were
abducted by a Nicaraguan group on August 25 and released Tuesday
after a 600,000-U.S.-dollar ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
The couple, who are employees of the Altamira Hacienda company,
a Dutch enterprise exploiting forestry resources in the north of
Costa Rica, remained at the company, some 300 kilometers north of
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Alvarado, director of the Judicial Investigative
Organization, said the police will capture the kidnappers at any
cost.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the kidnappers were members of the former
Nicaraguan counter-revolutionary forces "Contras" who fought
against the Sandinista government in the last decade. They had
demanded a 1.5-million-dollar ransom and 2 million colons (about
9,500 dollars), but the amount was reduced to 600,000 dollars
during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The group may consist of seven or 10 persons, according to the
two go-betweens, a priest and a Nicaraguan, after they met some of
the abductors four times in the area of Infiernillo de Cutris
bordering with Nicaragua, where the Dutch couple were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
The zone, densely forested and wet during the current period,
makes it very difficult for the police to hunt the captors who
entered the mountains after releasing the couple.
</P>
<P>
This is the second kidnapping in the same area since the
beginning of this year when a German tourist and her Costa Rican
guide were kidnapped on January 1 and freed 71 days after the
payment of a 200,000-dollar ransom.
</P>
<P>
Two of the kidnappers, also Nicaraguans and former members of
the "Contras", were captured. One is now in a Costa Rican jail
and the other in a Nicaraguan one.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican police is coordinating its operations with the
Nicaraguan authorities because the second group of kidnappers have
tried to cross the San Juan River to enter Nicaraguan territory
</P>
<P>
No captures or injuries have been reported after the hunting
operation began on Tuesday, though a shootout was reported.

MONTEVIDEO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists began a
meeting here today to discuss the damage done to the Paraguay
section of the Parana River, the second longest water system in
South America behind the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar known as "Environmental Impact on the
Paraguay-Parana Waterway", they will analyze the effects of the
navigational projects on the environment and the alternate
measures which will cause least alterations to the ecosystems
along the river.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by the executive secretariat
of the intergovernmental waterway committee, the permanent
transport commission of the River Plate Basin and the General
Secretariat of the Latin American Association for Integration.
</P>
<P>
The seminar participants include government officials,
legislators, scholars, representatives from shipping companies and
other organizations.
</P>
<P>
The 3,200-kilometer-long river, which meanders through Brazil,
Paraguay and Argentina before emptying into the Atlantic, has been
hampered by shifting channels, sandbars and fluctuating river flow
which causes flooding.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia and Uruguay, which are the sources of some Parana
tributaries and signatories to the Santa Cruz de la Sierra
Agreement on Parana Transportation with Brazil, Paraguay and
Argentina, are also participating in the two-day seminar.

<P>
GENEVA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- FIFA, soccer's world governing
body, on Wednesday dismissed that the 2002 World Cup final
tournament would increase from 32 teams to 40.
</P>
<P>
"It's pie in the sky," FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. "It's
an idea the Japanese have been quoted about in Japan but they have
not discussed it with FIFA.
</P>
<P>
"The regulations are not determined by organisers, only by
FIFA. Absolutely nothing has been tabled for discussion. I mean
we only just increased the World Cup to 32 teams."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four teams took part in the 1994 World Cup finals in
the United States. The number will increase to 32 for the 1998
tournament in France.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea, who will jointly host the 2002 World
Cup, were making what FIFA termed unscheduled "courtesy calls" on
Wednesday and Thursday this week. The subject of increasing the
number of teams was not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The issue, however, could be brought up at meetings on
November 6 when FIFA meets the co-hosts to begin sorting out the
problems of staging the World Cup in two countries for the first
time.

The peso has its exact value, because it has maintained the

He said an opinion was being circulated, with versions about a

<HEADLINE> Tax Reform Facilitates Fair Taxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China is taking measures to
bring tax system in line with international practices, according
to a "Economic Information" report.
</P>
<P>
Beginning January 1, the export tax-rebate rate was cut
in different categories.
</P>
<P>
This action, the first step towards fair taxation, is to help
to create a balance between actual duties and discounts. Taxes on
the export of foreign-funded enterprises vary depending on when
they were established.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises set up before 1993 will be excused
from the value-added tax (VAT) and some other taxes though rebates
will not be given to the VAT imposed on raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Those set up after 1994 which exported products before June 30,
1995, are free from both the VAT and consumption taxes.
</P>
<P>
If the product is entirely for export, there can be a rebate of
the product tax and, otherwise, only the VAT on materials for
export products will be exempt.
</P>
<P>
Through two years of transition, the new tax-collecting system
has been operating smoothly. Now is the right time for foreign
enterprises to establish new businesses of the new system because
they can take advantage of the new tax rates.
</P>
<P>
Because of the way the bureaux are divided, the State
Administration of Taxation will collect only VATs, consumption
taxes and enterprises income taxes from foreign-invested
enterprises. That means the collection of other taxes and
individual income taxes will be passed to the regional tax bureaux.
</P>
<P>
But despite these changes, only the central government has the
authority to legislate taxes.
</P>
<P>
Tax rates and tax categories are the same for Chinese and
foreign businesses.

RIO DE JANEIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people
were killed and 60 others injured when a freight train went out of

</P>

A federal railway official said that faulty brakes on the
freight train caused the accident which took place at Japeri, 80
kilometers north of Rio.
</P>

The freight train plowed onto the back of the commuter train
which was stopped at a rail intersection.
</P>

The official said that the freight train conductor had called

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New System to End Single-Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in New
Zealand have unfolded their election campaign after all of them
submitted their party list to the Electoral Commission Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A latest research shows that the knowledge about the new voting
 system, the Mixed Member Proportional representation system
(MMP), has been improved among the voters after the Electoral
Commission conducted an expensive advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the research find that 68 percent of the
population now knows the importance of the party vote in deciding
how may parliamentary seats a party can win, compared with 44
percent in the last survey announced at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
This year's election is the first to be carried out under the
MMP, endorsed by a referendum in 1993. Since 1853, New Zealand has
all along used the British-style First-Past-The-Post (FPP)
electoral system.
</P>
<P>
The new system will bring about significant changes to both the
 structure of the parliament and the way of election.
</P>
<P>
Under the FPP, there were 99 seats in the Parliament, all
directly elected from 99 electoral districts, including four
reserved for the Maori people. The new MMP increases the number of
parliamentarians to 120, but cuts down the number of electoral
districts to 60, in addition to five reserved for the Maoris.
</P>
<P>
A voter will have to cast two votes in the election, one to
choose the member of parliament for his electorate, another to
tick off the party he or she supports. The MP candidate a voter
chooses may not necessarily belong to the party he or she
supports.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the election, all political parties winning at
least five percent of the nationwide party vote will have a share
of parliament seats. The five percent threshold is designed to
prevent small parties from gaining parliamentary representation
while ensuring that parties enjoying reasonable electoral support
are represented in Parliament in proportion to their electoral
support.
</P>
<P>
For example. If a party wins 20 percent of the total votes
cast, it is entitled to having 24 MPs. Suppose 10 of its
candidates win their parliament seats fro share the state power by allowing more

parties to be represented in Parliament. However, as the system is
practiced for the first time, it seems to have complicated the
political scene. A case in point is that up to now New Zealanders
have had no idea about how their future government will be formed.
</P>
<P>
The research also indicates that over 30 percent of the New
Zealanders are still unaware of the importance of the party vote,
with the election date now less than one month away.
</P>
<P>
The poor awareness will affect the shape of the post-election
government, which will be most likely a coalition. The votes are
expected to be so diversified that no party would win the majority
 needed to rule the country by its own.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: Slow Economic Growth to Continue in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Global economy will continue
to grow in 1996 by no more than last year's 2.4 percent, with the
developing countries again outrunning the developed world, the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
In a report released today, the U.N. agency predicts a
continuing downtrend in growth, following the slowdown from 2.8
percent in 1994 to 2.4 percent last year. The 2.4 percent growth
was short of official expectations for at least a 3 percent
growth, which was needed to help ease unemployment in the North
and raise income in the South.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the world economic recovery since 1993, after
one of the worst postwar recessions, has been much weaker than
after earlier recessions, UNCTAD says in its Trade and Development
Report 1996.
</P>
<P>
The loss of steam in global economic recovery is mainly due to
the slowdown in the developed countries, where growth fell to 2.0
percent in 1995 from 2.8 percent in 1994, viewed by UNCTAD as a
result of their focusing solely on inflation control and
government budget cutting.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the developing world too slowed from 4.7 percent
in 1994 to 4.0 percent in 1995, affected by the Mexican financial
crisis. UNCTAD puts the growth rate for the group in 1996 at 4.5
percent, compared to 1.9 percent for the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
China will remain one of the fastest growing economy, expecting
a 9.0 percent growth this year, slowed from 10.2 percent in 1995
due to government measures to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the other Asian developing economies will also continue
to expand rapidly, with growth at 6.1 percent in 1996, compared to
6.3 percent last year. UNCTAD predicts faltering export growth for
some east and southeast Asian countries, in part due to emergence
of new competitors.
</P>
<P>
It also warns that serious balance of payments difficulties
might be caused by diversion of foreign investment from them to
low-wage countries.
</P>
<P>
Growth in Africa is expected to further rise to 3.1 percent
this year from a decade high of 2.8 percent in 1995, when improved
commodity prices pushed the region's export earnings over 10
percent higher and greater political stability helped growth
performance in some countries.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD sees the need for the continent to sustain faster growth
for some time to restore per capita incomes to their level of 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, growth is forecast at 2.4 percent, up from
the disappointing 0.7 percent growth last year resulting from the
Mexican crisis, and compared to 4.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Progress was made in central and eastern Europe last year, with
a 5.3 percent increase in output in central Europe and smaller
decline in many of the former Soviet republics than in
1994. UNCTAD puts the growth at 0.3 percent for the region as a
whole this year, compared to a 2.6 percent decline in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been leading in economic performance
among the industrialized countries, creating over 3 million jobs
over the past two years while keeping wages and prices stable. Its
economic growth in 1996 is predicted at 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is expected to rise further in both Japan and
Europe. Thanks to measures including expanding public spending,
Japan shook off in the end of 1995 a 4-year-long economic
stagnation with annual growth averaging 0.5 percent. Growth will
pick up this year, possibly exceeding 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD deems structural reforms particularly stimulating
domestic private consumption necessary for Japan to put growth on
a firm basis.
</P>
<P>
For the European Union (EU) economies, budget cutting policies
for achieving the goal of the European Monetary Union have
affected the growth, and will pull the growth from 2.5 percent
last year down to 1.3 percent in 1996. UNCTAD believes lowered
interest rates will help offset the adverse impact of fiscal
policies on growth.

<HEADLINE> 5 Million EU Children Live With Single Parent: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- About 8 percent of the
European Union's 72 million children under the age of 16 are
living in single-parent families.
</P>
<P>
The proportion ranges from under 4 percent in Greece and Spain
to over 14 percent in Denmark and over 15 percent in the United
Kingdom, said a report from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.
</P>
<P>
The report, Under The Same Roof -- Living Arrangements In The
European Union, noted that in Ireland and the Mediterranean
countries, children tend to stay with parents until starting new
families themselves, usually upon marriage.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the "family norm" is being eroded -- 10
percent of citizens of EU member nations live alone, 6 percent are
in single-parent families and 28 percent of the under-30s living
as couples are unmarried.
</P>
<P>
Also in Ireland and the Mediterranean countries, grandparents
still tend to live in the family -- nearly one-fifth of the
population in Greece, Spain and Portugal live in so-called
multi-generational households.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Slip Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Computer-related shares
lifted the Nasdaq market in New York to its ninth straight gain,
but worries about the rising inflation brought down the broad
market again today.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 11.47 to 5,877.36, only
slightly worse than Tuesday's 0.37-point slip from Monday's record
close.
</P>
<P>
Most broad measures also edged lower in quiet trading.
</P>
<P>
After rallying on a burst of optimism that economic growth may
be moderating to keep inflation steady, bonds have been weighed
down by renewed fears that the Federal Reserve will try to contain
inflation by raising its key lending rates at a meeting next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 395.81 million
shares, down from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.46 to 681.48, the
NYSE's composite index fell 0.99 to 363.44, and the American Stock
Exchange's market value index fell 0.51 to 566.65.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite, whose many small and speculative
issues have lagged the market's rebound from July's rout, rose
2.40 to 1,205.71.
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth straight advance for the technology-laden
index, which is creeping closer to the record high of 1,249.15,
set June 5.

<HEADLINE> China Named as Best Emerging Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China is the most attractive
emerging market for investment, a survey of 100 executives working
at British largest companies shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey was commissioned by Control Risks group, a political
and business risk consultancy. The participants were asked to
judge the prospects of 40 emerging economies and placed political
stability and security at the top of their list of concerns.
</P>
<P>
Overall, more than 75 percent of British companies represented
in the survey with international operations are investing in
emerging economies. India was considered set to become the most
promising market in five years' time, with 80 percent of
participants forecasting increased opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of survey participants said they favored some form
of local partnership when investing in emerging markets, while
only 12 percent said they preferred to invest alone.
</P>
<P>
Almost 25 percent of survey participants said they had no clear
opinion on whether opportunities in emerging economies would
increase or decrease in the next five years, a finding described
by Control Risks as "astonishing."

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic said today that he will strive for the reintegration
and justice of the country as chairman of the new presidency.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic, a Muslim, was elected to the three-member
presidency of Bosnia together with Momcilo Krajsnik, a Serb, and
Kresimir Zubak, a Croat. Since Izetbegovic won more votes than the
other two, he will be the chairman of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize my political points of view;
shortly, they are the reintegration of the country and the
establishment of justice," Izetbegovic said following the
announcement of election results by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which organized the elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, he also said that the results
confirmed his suspicion of irregularities in the territory of
Republika Srpska which had a larger voter turnout than in the
Bosnian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Some complaints from the Muslim side about the irregularities
in the Serb entity have been submitted to the OSCE and more will
come in the next 72 hours, Izetbegovic said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expects the voting list in Republika Srpska
will be reviewed and elections in many parts of Republika Srpska
will have to be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Zubak, when asked about his reaction to the results on BH
Television, said that he would do his best to implement every
thing that was agreed upon in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed, "The constitution of Bosnia which was agreed
in Dayton has not given the solution to many open problems. We
should solve them in the presidency."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the chairmanship which will be held by
Izetbegovic for two years instead of rotating as stipulated in the
Dayton agreement, Zubak said that the first meeting of the
presidency will have to deal with this issue.

WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Talks on scheduling the
presidential debates were postponed today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives for the campaigns of President Bill Clinton who
is seeking reelection and Republican challenger Bob Dole hoped to
meet again this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Dole said he would not reconsider a Commission on Presidential
Debates recommendation to exclude Reform Party nominee Ross Perot,
while Clinton's team refused to budge on finishing the debates by
October 16.
</P>
<P>
After three hours of talks Tuesday failed to produce any
agreement, both sides had planned to sit down again today. But
Dole negotiator Carroll Campbell, president of the American
Council of Life Insurance, was called away this morning to preside
over a board of directors meeting.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, who represents Clinton, was
making an overnight political trip to Florida late Thursday, after
canceling a North Carolina stop at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans last week proposed four-hour-long debates
between Dole and Clinton and two vice presidential forums spread
over several weeks. Clinton's team made a counteroffer of
condensing the schedule to October 6-13, with one vice
presidential and two two-hour presidential debates. Clinton also
wants Perot in one of the forums.

SHENYANG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one thousand people
from the northeastern Chinese cities of Shenyang, Fushun and
Anshan came to pay a visit to the Memorial Hall of the September
18th Incident today, to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the
event.
</P>
<P>
Citizens of Shenyang, where the incident took place 65 years
ago, have held a series of commemorative activities that included
speeches and the issuing of commemorative envelops to mark the
day, which lives in their memories.
</P>
<P>
At 10:00 p.m. today, the city sounded its siren for 3 minutes
to mark the exact moment when the incident occured.
</P>
<P>
On September 18th, 1931, at 10:00 p.m., Japanese troops blew up
the Liutiaohu section of the Nanman Railway, signaling the start
of the Japanese invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
On September 18th, 1991, the local government opened a Memorial
Hall of the September 18th Incident on the site where the incident
took place.
</P>
<P>
According to the curator of the Memorial Hall, Li Huichun, more
than 700,000 people have visited the shrine since it was
opened. It contains displays, background information, photos and
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the hall also has 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese
visitors every year, many of whom weep or kneel down after seeing
the exhibits. Li added that the hall has become one of the
country's 100 bases for patriotic education.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Exports Hit Record High in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's exports grew 2.1
percent in July, hitting a record high of 16.4 billion
U.S. dollars, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was largely due to rising lumber shipments to the
United States and robust exports of auto parts, while grain
exports declined 6.5 percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
July's exports increased the most to the U.S. and Japan, but
slowed to all other major trading partners, the federal
fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canada's imports grew 3.2 percent, reaching
14.1 billion dollars, the highest level since last February.
</P>
<P>
Import gains largely came from the industrial goods and
machinery sectors, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
As imports moved ahead faster than exports, Canada's trade
surplus dropped slightly in July from June's level to 2.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canada saw surpluses in trade with Japan and the U.S., but
deficits with all other trading partners, the agency added.

<HEADLINE> Canada's WestJet Airlines Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's discount airline
WestJet Airlines has suspended flights for up to two weeks
after Transport Canada warned the carrier's maintenance
procedures were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The federal agency issued Calgary-based WestJet a notice on
Tuesday that its operating certificate would be suspended if it
did not address two major "deficiencies" within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it discovered maintenance shortcomings in a
routine safety audit. The carrier must now appoint a qualified
person to be responsible for aircraft maintenance and must also
implement an aircraft maintenance system that meets the agency's
approval.
</P>
<P>
"We are acting today out of an abundance of caution," Transport
Minister David Anderson was quoted as saying by today's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Clive Beddoe, chairman and chief executive of the low-cost
carrier, said he expects the airline to be flying again in seven
to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of safety, it's a question of records," he
said, adding that "it's a paperwork issue."
</P>
<P>
WestJet has four Boeing 737 aircraft, with an average age of 22
years. It has flown 380,000 passengers in western Canada since it
took to the air on February 29.
</P>
<P>
The carrier has promised to refund customers who miss their
flights.
</P>
<P>
After WestJet's grounding, Canada's two major airlines - Air
Canada and Canadian Airlines International - immediately offered
to pick up the slack, saying they would honor WestJet tickets on a
standby basis.

Bosnia-Herzegovina and replaced by headquarters based on LANDCENT
(Allied Land Forces Central Europe)," Solana told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The new headquarters to be deployed are expected to take
command from the existing IFOR headquarters by early November," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose for this reorganization was to prepare for
the execution of the last phase of IFOR's mission.
</P>
<P>
In the month ahead, he said, IFOR would have much to do and its
primary military mission would continue to be carried out "firmly
and fairly."
</P>
<P>
"While the trend of compliance by the parties with the military
obligation under the Dayton Agreement remains positive, the
experience of the last weeks and months showed that outmost
vigilance by IFOR is still required," the Secretary General said.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that beyond its primary mission, IFOR would further
be fully engaged in assisting the High Representative Carle Bildt
and related international agencies in the post-election period.
</P>
<P>
He added that IFOR would support the OSCE (Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe) in the preparation and
conducting of the postponed municipal elections before the end of
IFOR's mandate and would assist the establishment of common
institutions created after the 14 September elections.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the meeting of NATO defense ministers due to be held
in Bergen, Norway, next week, Solana stressed that it was an
informal meeting and "no decisions will be taken."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, there would be substantial discussion on
the key issues facing the Alliance nowadays, including situation
in Bosnia, NATO's internal reform, Partnership for Peace,
expansion of the Alliance and relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Eventhough no decisions will be taken at Bergen, I look
forward to interesting exchange of views that should help the
North Atlantic Council to guide IFOR to the completion of its
mission and to consider security requirements in Bosnia after the
end of the IFOR mandate," he stated.

<HEADLINE> Polio Breaks out in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based World Health
Organization (WHO) confirmed Wednesday that a mysterious outbreak of
paralytic disease which started in Albania in April is poliomyelitis.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak started in the countryside in the northwestern part
of Albania, later spreading to Tirana and the rest of the country.
As of today, there have been 66 cases and seven deaths reported.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a mass immunization campaign carried out in Albania
in April and May when 350,000 children under five years were
immunized, only five of the 66 cases were in children under
five. The vast majority of cases occurred in teenagers and adults,
the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO and UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) are seeking international
aid for another mass immunization campaign in Albania which will
cover mostly the adults.
</P>
<P>
The WHO Regional Office for Europe will hold a one-day consultation
in Copenhagen to sum up available epidemiological information gathered
by WHO experts working with Albanian authorities and to work out
details of the immunization campaign as well as to prepare a social
mobilization plan.
</P>
<P>
WHO, UNICEF and Rotary International are also helping to organize
mass polio immunization campaigns in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine in the next month.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the outbreak in Albania, there had been 11 confirmed cases
of polio reported in the European Region of the WHO in 1996, with 10
cases in Turkey and one in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were 206 registered cases of confirmed polio in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said it remains firmly committed to worldwide polio
eradication by the year 2000. It would be the second virus, after
smallpox, to disappear completely.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Closes Hezbollah-Owned Radio, Television </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- In an extraordinary session
chaired by President Elias Hrawi here today, the Lebanese
government ordered the closure of radio and television stations
operated by Hezbollah, or Party of God, along with most other
private broadcast media.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the
government stressed that the law demanding the licensing of
broadcast media that go on the air applies to all audio and
video media "without exception."
</P>
<P>
It was still unknown how the Shiite Hezbollah, the
Iranian-backed group having thousands of guerrillas fighting an
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, will react to the government
decision.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah had announced earlier that it's two organs,
Al-Manar Television and Al-Nour Radio, would continue to
broadcast even if the government refused to give them licenses.
</P>
<P>
Today's Council of Ministers meeting was held in the
Presidential Palace and attended by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
and cabinet ministers, and the decision abrogated another one
taken by the government Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Council of Ministers decided to limit the licensing to
four television stations of the first class, three radios of the
first class and eight radios of the second class without any
exception," Information Minister Farid Mkari said, announcing
the cabinet decision.
</P>
<P>
Radios and televisions belonging to the first class are
allowed to broadcast political news and recreational programs,
and those belonging to the second are only admitted to broadcast
music and other non-political programs.
</P>
<P>
At a regular meeting Tuesday, the cabinet decided to give
licenses to the 15 private radio and television stations and
ordered other private audio and video media to close by the end
of November.
</P>
<P>
The four television stations licensed by the cabinet were
Future TV owned by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, NBN, which House
Speaker Nabih Berri is planing to set up, MTV owned by a brother
of Deputy Prime Minister Michel Al-Murr and LBCI, Lebanon's
major private station.
</P>
<P>
The government did not license Al-Manar Television and
Al-Nour Radio run by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, but granted
them special permission to continue operating and broadcast news
on a guerrilla campaign to oust Israeli troops from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They would "exceptionally and temporarily" continue to operate
 "until the Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon is
eliminated," the government said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in Lebanon, a country with a population
of some 3,500,000, there are about 40 private television
stations and 150 radio stations.
</P>
<P>
Some of these media were mouthpieces during the 1975-90 civil
war but have turned commercial since the war ended.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tele-Liban television and Lebanon Radio were
already licensed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to make his first ever
Sub-Sahara African tour, which would include five countries, from
October 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will leave Washington on October 7 and make stops
in Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Angola and South Africa before
returning on October 15, according to an official statement
released today by the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
His first stop will be Bamako, Mali, where he will meet
President Alpha Oumar Konare and other officials.
</P>
<P>
The next stop will be Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he will
meet Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to discuss bilateral issues and
regional issues. He will also meet the Secretary General of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to discuss how the United
States can best support some of the conflict resolution efforts
the OAU has taken a lead on.
</P>
<P>
Christopher then goes to Arusha, Tanzania, for talks with
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and former President Julius
Nyerere. He will also meet other leaders from Central and East
Africa on economic integration and development issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State will use the Tanzania stop to talk
about the problems in nearby Burundi and the Rwanda war crimes
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
He will then spend several hours in Luanda, Angola, meeting
President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and the country's former rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi. Dos Santos and Savimbi have formed a unity

The final stop is Cape Town, South Africa, where Christopher
will meet President Nelson Mandela, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other leaders to discuss ways to
expand the ties with the African economic power.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State, however, will not visit three of
the most important countries in Africa -- Nigeria, Zaire and
Kenya -- "because of U.S. problems with the lack of progress in
those countries toward democracy and human rights," U.S.
diplomats said.

<HEADLINE> BBC Launches 240 "Green World" Series Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- BBC today launched Green
World, a new BBC World Service educational radio initiative on the
environment. More than 240 programs will be aired over the next
four months in 22 languages.
</P>
<P>
The project, which features investigative reports on the
environment in 40 countries including China, is the first of its
kind to be undertaken by an international radio broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
Sir David Attenborough, broadcaster of the Green World series,
said at the press conference here "Radio is one of the most
powerful and effective tools we have for relaying messages about
the environment."
</P>
<P>
"It is easily accessible and has very low costs. It does not
depend on literacy and it can be heard in the remotest areas," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The programs look at some of the world's most serious regional
environmental problems: controversy surrounding ecotourism in
Israel and the Galapagos Island, the illegal logging in
Afghanistan, the threat to the holy Ganges River in India and the
plight of wildlife and local fishermen around the Caspian Sea
whose existence is threatened by pollution and rising sea-levels.
</P>
<P>
Two programs will highlight air pollution in China's cities
caused by the heavy use of coal and motor vehicles, the measures
taken by China to prevent the problem getting worse and how
ordinary people use coal more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The programs will give people an updated picture of the
environmental problems we are facing. The twenty-five series
examine the hopes, fears and some possible solutions for the world
we all live in.

<HEADLINE> UN Refuses to Accept Donations from Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of the
United Nations decided to refuse acceptance of the donations from
Taiwan authorities, which were not consistent with the policies,
aims and activities of the organization, a U.N. spokeswoman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said at the noon briefing that someone
who did not identified himself asked an official in the Treasury
Department of the United Nations how to make donations to the
organization on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Foa noted that under U.N. financial regulations, voluntary
contributions and donations can be accepted by the Secretariat
only provided that the purposes of those who make the
contributions and donations are consistent with the policies, aims
and activities of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
After learning the donations were made by Taiwan authorities,
the U.N. legal department and the Secretariat decided that they
were not private donations. The donations came from Taiwan
authorities which attempted to publicize its own aim in U.N.
</P>
<P>
Foa stressed that following resolution 2758 adopted by the
General Assembly in 1971, representatives of the government of the
People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of
China to the United Nations, "so we are not in the position to
accept the donations."

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
has given the green light to the acquisition of joint control of the
German new channel n-tv by a subsidiary of Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt
GmbH, which is part of the publishing group van Holtzbrinck, it was
learned here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, a subsidiary of the US media company Time
Warner and CNN Germany, a subsidiary of the US media company Turner
Broadcasting, also exercise joint control in n-tv.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this decision, the EC reasoned that the market share of
n-tv in the German television advertising market is low and the
concentration does not lead to an addition of market shares.
</P>
<P>
"The publishing group von Holtzbrinck only has a minority share
in another German television channel," it said, "the concentration
is not likely to lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant
market position."

ADDIS ABABA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
announced today it has launched various road projects worth a
total of 151 million U.S. Dollars this fiscal year beginning from
July 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tesfa Mikael, General Manager of the Ethiopian Road Authority,
said in an official report that 132 million U.S. Dollars were
allotted to finance the designing, construction and maintenance
of roads, bridges and buildings.
</P>
<P>
Another 19 million U.S. Dollars would be used as the current
budget for the authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the authority announced a plan to spend 15
2.3 billion U.S. Dollars to maintain 10,000 kms of highway and
constructing 5,000 kms of new roads in the rural areas in the
following five years.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is an inland country and its road transport is about
90 percent of the total transport volume. However, the nation has
only 20,000 kms of highway and rural roads, i.e., with 18 kms of
roads in every 1,000 square kms.

<HEADLINE> Athens to Get Cleaner, Cheaper Buses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- New gas-powered buses will go
into circulation in Athens as of 1998, the semi-official Athens
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The buses will be manufactured at the factory of the Greek
vehicle industry (ELBO) in the industrial zone in Salonika. Their
production will start after the signing of an agreement between ELBO
and the urban transport organization of Athens (OASA) in November.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, apart from the production of 100 such
buses, the agreement anticipates the production of another 650
conventional technology buses of various types, 114 trolleybuses and
80 wagons for the Athens-Piraeus trains.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sign the agreement was made by the government in
August and its funding, amounting to 80 billion drachmas (350
million US dollars) will be carried out by the state budget with the
disbursement of 20 billion drachmas (87.5 million dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the cost of keeping the gas-powered buses
in circulation will be six times less than that of conventional
buses due to the much lower price of fuel while the pollution
level could also be reduced.

<P>
"The unique money will come...it will come on January 1 of 1999

<P>
"Policy decisions and the technical preparations that precede
them are just the first step," he said, adding that it was then up
to others from the world of business and finance to take over.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Deficit Reaches 4.5 bn Pounds in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- British government borrowed
4.5 billion pounds (7 billion US dollars) in August to cover the
shortfall between spending and revenue, casting fresh doubt on its
borrowing target and on its room for budget tax cut.
</P>
<P>
The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) Wednesday, were up on the same month last year and higher
than City economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
A combination of weak receipts from value added tax (VAT) and
other taxes as well as excess spending by government departments
were blamed for the revenue shortfall.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that VAT receipts in August totaled 3.3 billion
pounds (5.1 billion US dollars), about one billion pounds (1.6
billion US dollars) less than last August.
</P>
<P>
The August figures left the deficit in the first five months of
the current financial year at 13.4 billion pounds (20.8 billion US
dollars), below the 16.7 billion pounds (25.9 billion US dollars)
at the same stage last year.
</P>
<P>
However, stripping out privatization proceeds, borrowing in the
first five months has totaled 16.1 billion pounds (25 billion US
dollars), almost unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are now expecting yet another overshoot in the
government's 27 billion pounds (42 billion US dollars) target for
the year, with some putting the likely outturn at 29 billion
pounds (45 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Greece to Host Conference on Test Tube Baby Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The scientific "daddies" of
"test tube babies" from around the world will meet in northern
Greek city of Salonika on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The doctors who pioneered in-vitro fertilization, including
British professor Robert Edwards -- "father" of the first
test-tube baby, Louisa Brown, who is 18 years old today -- and
Belgian professor Andre Van Stairtegem, the first to apply the
method of micro-fertilization, will be attending the two-day
conference of the European society of human reproduction and
embryology.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists' statistics, approximately 40 percent
of sub-fertility today is due to the female, another 40 percent to
the male, and the remaining 20 percent to both partners.
</P>
<P>
Male subfertility, attributed by specialists to stress, lack of
exercise, dietary habits and infection by sexually transmitted
diseases, is successfully treated in recent years by a
revolutionary method of micro-fertilization that gives solutions
even in cases of severe low level of sperm.
</P>
<P>
The new method, called intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
egg fertilization method uses only one spermatozoon, isolated
under a high-definition microscope. The spermatozoon is aspirated
into a specially-designed micro-needle, and is then drive into the
center of the egg after piercing its outer layer.
</P>
<P>
The ICSI method is commonly used in Belgium, while it has also
been successfully attempted in Britain, Cyprus and Greece.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Coalition Government to Be Set up Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chechen coalition
government will be fully formed by September 24, one of the ten
co-chairmen of the coordinating council of Chechen parties and
public movements, Shamil Beno, stated today.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference here today that "nearly all minister
portfolios in this government are already distributed."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the future government, which is a compromise
between Chechen separatists and (Russian) federal center, must
meet the interests of both Moscow and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Beno, who represents the public and political movement Daimohk
in the coordinating council, said that 14 seats in the government
will be given to members of Chechnya's most influential parties and
movements.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Moscow-backed Chechen government headed by
Doku Zavgayev may be included in the new coalition government,
Beno added.
</P>
<P>
According to experts here, most and, particularly, key posts in
the new Chechen government will be covered by the Chechen
separatists.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lebed, secretary of the Russian Security Council and
President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya, met with
Chechen separatist leaders during his short trip to the breakaway
republic on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Returning to Moscow overnight, he confirmed in an interview with
reporters here that he discussed with the Chechen separatist
leaders a number of issues including the formation of the future
Chechen government, and expressed hope that Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin will take part in talks with the Chechen separatist
leaders this weekend.
</P>
<P>
A Russian government spokesman told a news conference that
Chernomyrdin had met with Lebed over the Chechen settlement
earlier today, but gave no details of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Plans 20 New Joint Ventures with France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and France
have planned to set up 20 new joint venture projects, bringing
the total Saudi-French ventures to 80, according to a commercial
statement carried by the English-language daily Arab News today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a press release by the Saudi Ministry of
Commerce as saying the new ventures would attract a cumulative
investment of nearly 200 million Riyals (53.3 million
U.S. dollars). The projects are believed to be in the non-oil
sectors.
</P>
<P>
So far, Saudi Arabia and France have set up 60 joint ventures
with total French investment amounting to a staggering 1.7
billion Saudi Riyals (453.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade between Saudi Arabia and France, excluding
oil and petrochemicals, has surged to 4.5 billion Riyals (1.2
billion U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Several Saudi-French joint ventures are presently operating in
the Kingdom in such sectors as communications, electro-mechanical
 equipment, oil and petrochemicals, pharmaceutical products,
heavy industries and banking.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia supplies almost 30 percent of France's oil
imports. It topped the list of crude oil exporting countries to
France during August 1995 to July 1996.
</P>
<P>
It ranked 31st in terms of total imports from France and 17th
in terms of exports.

<HEADLINE> GA General Committee Rejects Proposal on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The General Committee
of the 51st General Assembly rejected on Wednesday a proposal on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was put forward by a small number of
countries, requested the General Assembly to set up an ad hoc
committee to study the issue of the so-called Taiwan's
"participation in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth consecutive year that Taiwan has been
attempting to include the issue in the agenda of the General
Assembly and ending in bitter failure.
</P>
<P>
"Justice is bound to defeat evil. An unjust cause naturally
finds little support," Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Qin Huasun said to reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year the number of sponsors of the proposal
on Taiwan's "representation" is obviously smaller than that of
last year.
</P>
<P>
While 37 friendly countries, including most General Committee
members, spoke out to support China's position and opposed the
inclusion of the proposal in the agenda of the current session of
the General Assembly, he said, adding that there was not a single
member of the General Committee that spoke in support of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This fact has fully reflected the firm stand of the general
U.N. membership in safeguarding the authority of the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter and General Assembly Resolution
2758," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It also shows that the secessionist activities by the Taiwan
authorities to `return to the United Nations' enjoy no support
whatsoever and will only end up in a ignominious defeat," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official on Israeli-Egyptian Relation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
said today that Israel and Egypt "are now moving to a better
relationship," although there have been some "misunderstandings"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's foreign policy advisor Dore Gold said that
Netanyahu's last visit to Cairo, capital of Egypt, was "very
successful."
</P>
<P>
Following the visit, Gold said, there have been frequent
contacts on different levels, including Foreign Minister David
Levy's visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"Now, what we have to do is to institutionalize these good
conventions, so that we will not have those up and downs which
would weaken our relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gold played down recent dispute between Netanyahu and
Egyptian leaders, saying that their statements "sometimes were
mistranslated and misinterpreted."
</P>
<P>
Gold's remarks came after Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
 criticized Netanyahu's statement on Egypt's Middle East policy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier said Sunday that in threatening to
postpone the regional economic conference scheduled for November,
Egypt was "acting like a man who cuts off his nose to spite his
face."
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have threatened on
several occasions to cancel the Economic Conference for the
Middle East and North Africa scheduled for November in Cairo
unless Israel will do enough to advance talks with Syria and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In responding to Netanyahu's statement, Moussa described
Israeli criticism as "unfortunate," and advised Netanyahu to
watch out for his own nose, rather than making remarks about
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
However, Gold told Israel Radio today that despite those
strong terms used in public, "private conversations between
these men are very good conversations."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the fundamental directions of both the
highest levels in Israel and Egypt are designed to build a good
relationship" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Gold, U.S. Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross's
current visit to the region will focus on the Israeli-Egyptian
relationship and Egypt's regional interests.
</P>
<P>
He also said that although the resumption of negotiations
between Israel and Syria "is very important to the (Israeli)
government, Ross's current visit will not deal with this issue."

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Rhino Population Increases by 55 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's white rhino
population has increased by 55 percent over the past 36 years,
said a survey released today in Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
The Big Game Parks, a Swaziland umbrella organization managing
the kingdom's game reserves, attributed this conservation success
to anti-poaching legislation by King Mswati III, reported the
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
According to the Big Game Parks, Mswati is a committed
supporter of nature conservation whose interest has been mirrored
by the Swazi game rangers, whose effectiveness has become
legendary.
</P>
<P>
The rhino population increase came after a traumatic four-year
period in which the country lost almost 70 percent of its rhinos
to commercial poaching in what is now referred to as the rhino
war.
</P>
<P>
Big Game Parks head Ted Reilly said in a statement that
Swaziland lost an average of one rhino every two weeks to
poaching from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, Reilly said the rhino population in the country
increased by 55 percent by natural increment after a short period
of stability without poaching losses.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland has both black and white rhinos, who are slow
breeders.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- France and Switzerland today
signed two conventions in Berne on the change of two brief border
lines between the two countries, said official sources here.
</P>
<P>
One rectification of the border involves the exchange of 81,400
square meters of land between France and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The change has resulted from the linking of a highway between
the frontier post of Bardonnex near Geneva, and Saint-Julien in
Genevois in the French department of Haute-Savoie.
</P>
<P>
Another convention concerns the Swiss canton of Vaud and the
French department of Doubs, which have to exchange 30 square
meters of their land for the construction of a customs platform.
</P>
<P>
The two conventions, signed by French ambassador to Switzerland
Bernard Garcia and a Swiss Foreign Ministry official, will be
submitted to the parliaments of the two countries for
ratification.

legal sitting tenants, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Also eligible are spouses or children of a civil servant who

houses will be sold to them as part of the package.
</P>
<P>
The sitting tenants who have benefited from the sale of
council houses shall not be eligible to purchase a government
pool house while the same applies to retirees and spouses or
children of the deceased who have been paid their packages.
</P>
<P>
The government has restricted the change of ownership,
disposal or sub-division of property purchased to a minimum
period of five years.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Court Sentences Thiefs of Renoir's "Bather" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Belgrade district court
on Wednesday sentenced to prison thiefs who had stolen Renoir's
picture "Bather" from Belgrade's National Museum on March 14.
</P>
<P>
Zoran Stevanovic, 28, and Sasa Tatalovic, 26, were each
sentenced to four years and five months, Danijel Lojen, 26, to
four years and Rikardo Radaela to three years and eight months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
The thiefs, who cut Renoir's picture out of the frame, tried to
sell it for 20,000 U.S. dollars. The thiefs were arrested by
police four days after the theft and the painting was recovered
with damages.
</P>
<P>
Judge Dragoljub Djordjevic said that the picture belonged to
the state's cultural and national wealth.
</P>
<P>
National Museum Curator Nikola Kusovac, who was questioned as a

francs at an auction in Paris in 1935 and that it had been in
perfect condition until the theft.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of the paint was damaged during the theft and
the picture, which is worth about two million U.S. dollars, is now

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Arafat to Demand Israeli Pullout from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat said today he will demand Israel's
implementation of its troops redeployment from Hebron in
accordance with the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks during a meeting this afternoon in
the Gaza Strip with U.S. Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross, who
is currently on a trip to the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Gaza today from Egypt, where he held talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace
process and the upcoming regional economic summit scheduled for
November in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Ross that he would raise the issue of Hebron
redeployment during his meeting with Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai this evening.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled to take place at 8:00 p.m. local time
(1800GMT) at the Palestinian side of the Erez Crossing between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, is expected to focus on security
measures.
</P>
<P>
There has been expectation for months that the two were to
meet, but it was only after the summit between Arafat and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the ground was set for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the meeting will be Israeli army's
redeployment from the disputed West Bank town of Hebron, the
operation of the Palestinian airport in Gaza, and the issue of
safe passage route for Palestinians between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mordechai today refused to elaborate on his plan
for the redeployment in Hebron at an inner cabinet meeting,
saying that he would not present his plan to Arafat this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Hardline Ministers Ariel Sharon, minister of national
infrastructure, and Ze'ev Begin, minister of science and
technology, sharply criticized Mordechai at today's cabinet
meeting for not giving details of his plan.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli media revealed that a new plan was
prepared by Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords
with regard to the extent of Palestinian control in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Palestinian self-rule authority would
only gain civilian control over the Hebron area, and overriding
security control would remain in Israel's hands.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull
back from approximately 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab
neighborhoods of the town under full PA control, designated Area
A.
</P>
<P>
However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be
designated Area A, but part of Area B, an area of shared
control, with the Israeli army permitted to move freely as it
deems necessary for security reasons.

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the Israeli army was originally
supposed to complete its redeployment in the Hebron area by March
28.
</P>
<P>
But, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel
in February and March, which left more than 60 people dead and
some 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres delayed the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the May
29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Netanyahu in the
elections, said afterwards that he would leave the decision of
the redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu said that he would
like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following his first ever meeting
with Arafat earlier this month, Netanyahu declined to say whether
he would redeploy in Hebron according the interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to discuss this issue (of redeployment) in the
steering committee," the Israeli prime minister told reporters at
the press conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli and Palestinian Steering Committee for
the implementation of the Oslo accords failed to reach an
agreement on the Hebron redeployment at its first session last
week.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio initially reported that Israeli and Palestinian
officials had agreed at the meeting that the redeployment in
Hebron would take place, but with a few modifications.
</P>
<P>
However, Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian negotiating
team, later denied this report. He told Xinhua that the
Palestinian side "will not even want to hear the word of
modification."
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed that the redeployment should be implemented
according to the Oslo accords in order to expand Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials maintained that the PA would not agree
to renegotiate on the Oslo accords, including the Hebron
redeployment issue, which had been already agreed and signed
upon.

Ciller said: "Turkey will provide support for Barzani in
the framework of cooperation with Turkomans."
</P>
<P>
Hoping that Kurds and Turkomans enjoy equal rights in the
local administration to be formed, Ciller said: "I desire
that this new partnership will be beneficial to the regional
peace. We are working for the protection of the forces of
Barzani, the Kurdish groups and other civil forces."
</P>
<P>
However, Barzani declined to answer any question from
reporters following his meeting with Ciller.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, Iraq troops launched attacks on Kurdish
guerrillas in northern Iraq with heavy gunfire at the request
of the KDP led by Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The KDP has battled another Kurdish faction named the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) for supremacy in the
mountainous region where the U.S.-led coalition forces established
an enclave for the Kurdish people seeking independence from
Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the
KDP and its rival PUK began fighting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The United States Punished Iraq for intervening in Kurdish
factional fighting in northern Iraq by launching 44 Cruise missiles
at air defense systems in southern Iraq on September 3 and 4.

<HEADLINE> Captured S. Africans Return Home From Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen South African
men, detained in a Luanda jail for eight days, arrived at
Johannesburg International Airport on a commercial flight from
the Angolan capital Luanda this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Cierro Combrink, spokesman for the group, said at the airport
they were happy to be back, but they were tired after their
ordeal in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Those South Africans were arrested last week after most of
them were accused of being in diamond areas without official
working permits and of illegally importing mining equipment.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the group had also allegedly contravened
Angolan aviation regulations.
</P>
<P>
However, Combrink said: "This was all a misunderstanding on
the part of the Angolans. All our papers were legal and ready, it
was a mistake."
</P>
<P>
The release of the group reportedly was facilitated by South
Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs with the Angolan
authorities and the South African companies the men worked for.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Debate Negotiations Going on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
campaigns of U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is seeking
reelection and Republican challenger Bob Dole campaigns were
expected to continue to work out an agreement on the presidential
debates when negotiations resume later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sticking points include when and how many debates to have,
how long they should be, and whether to accept a commission's
ruling to exclude Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton team said it still wants Perot included in at least
one of the presidential debates, despite a recommendation Tuesday
by the Commission on Presidential Debates that he did not have a
"realistic chance" of winning and should not be allowed to debate.
</P>
<P>
The Dole camp does not want Perot in the debates.
</P>
<P>
While the Dole's campaign said it wants at least four debates
-- three presidential and one vice presidential, the Clinton
campaign said it only wants two presidential debates, and one vice
presidential.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also have not agreed on dates for the debates.
</P>
<P>
The Commission had proposed having four debates, three
presidential and one vice presidential, beginning on September 25.
</P>
<P>
The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 600 adults, released
Wednesday, found 52 percent believe the commission should have
included Perot in the debates, while 37 agreed with the decision.
But 87 percent did not think Perot has a "realistic chance" of
winning the election, while 9 percent said he did. The poll had a
4 point margin of error.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Deflation Threats to Drag World's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Deflation in developed
countries threat to hold up the globalization and world economic
growth, according to the Trade and Development Report 1996
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the world economy slowed from 2.8 percent in 1994 to
2.4 percent in 1995. The overall economic performance this year
will not exceed last year's growth rate despite the continued
buoyancy of world trade which registered an 8 percent increase in
1995. The outlook for developing countries is again brighter than
for the developed world, according to the report prepared by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
After one of the deepest recessions in the post war era,
recovery since 1993 has continued but has been much weaker than
after earlier recessions, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The loss of steam is mainly attributed to the slowdown in the
industrialized countries, which registered 2.0 percent growth in
1995, compared to 2.8 percent in the previous year. Though the
growth in the developing world also slowed in 1995, it was
nonetheless almost double that of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
With ever more integrated financial markets, the risk of
deflation is real if monetary policy in developed countries
continues to focus solely on combating inflation while governments
are mainly concerned with cutting the budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
In the developed world, the deflationary gap widened in 1995
and unemployment rose by almost one third since the beginning of
the decade, reaching a level reminiscent of the interwar years.
With some 34 million unemployed in mid-1996, no real improvement
is in sight for this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the major economies, only the United States continues to
enjoy one of its longest recoveries in postwar history while its
growth is expected to increase to 2.2 percent in 1996 and
inflation remains under control.
</P>
<P>
By contrast unemployment is on the rise in both Japan and
Europe, and is expected to rise further over the near term. Japan
continues to struggle with the combined effects of heightened
foreign competition and the legacy of the bursting of the
speculative bubble. In Europe the commitment of most European
members to meet the requirements for monetary union while
fostering growth and employment presents a daunting challenge,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In the developing world, most Asian developing countries
continued to grow rapidly in 1995, pushing regional growth rate to
6.3 percent. However, export growth in some East and Southeast
Asian countries appears to be faltering in 1996 while the
balance of payments deficits reached 10 percent of GDP in Malaysia
and in Thailand 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The exception is China with its expansion exceeding 10 percent
in 1995 and a larger trade surplus. Growth in China is expected to
slow to 9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in Africa posted a decade-high rate of 2.8 percent in
1995 and would further increase to 3.1 percent this year. Export
earnings rose by over 10 percent in 1995, unprecedented for many
years. However, the region needs to sustain faster growth for some
time to restore per capita incomes to their level of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The aftermath of the Mexican crisis dominated developments in
Latin America in 1995 when growth fell to 0.7 percent, compared to
4.9 percent in the previous year. Though the output is set to
advance at 2.4 percent, the region will face the challenge to
sustain rapid growth while consolidating recent significant
progress in the fight against inflation and limiting external
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
The growth forest for Central and Eastern Europe as a whole is
0.3 percent in 1996. Economic recovery in Central Europe is now
well under way with a 5.3 percent increase in output in 1995. But,
output continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace, in many the
CIS republics and current levels are still considerably below
1989.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Issues Warning to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid said today that there will be an uprising
against Israel again if the Jewish state does not rescind its
hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd session of Arab ministers of economy, which
opened at Egypt's port city of Alexandria today, Abdul-Meguid said
that Israel's attempts to impose fait accompli on the
Israeli-occupied Arab lands can never be accepted.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Israel for its attempts to resume peace
negotiations without preconditions, saying that they constitute a
setback to the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to resume talks with its Arab neighbors without
committing itself to the land-for-peace principle, which the Arabs
regard as the basis for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that by doing so, Israel would gain nothing, but
trigger uprising again, which the Arabs regard as a form of
defending Arab legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit to be held
in Cairo on November 12-14, he stressed the importance of creating
an appropriate political atmosphere for the convocation of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
"Regional economic cooperation needs an atmosphere full of
commitment to international legitimacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has linked the conference to progress in the Mideast
peace process. President Hosni Mubarak and some other senior
officials had said that Egypt may cancel or postpone it if there
is still no progress in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak later said that Egypt would go ahead with the summit on
schedule, but he called on Israel and the United States to assist
in making the get-together successful.
</P>
<P>
In another turnaround, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Tuesday
evening that Egypt had not ruled out delaying or canceling the
summit.
</P>
<P>
On the session of Arab ministers of economy, Abdul-Meguid said
that the meeting would mainly discuss means of developing Arab
trade exchange to pave the way for the establishment of an Arab
free trade zone by 2007.

<HEADLINE> Oral Researchers Urged to Use News Media to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in oral
health were today urged to utilize the established news media:
newspapers, radios, and televisions to educate the masses on
their research findings in order to improve people' oral health.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was thrown in Arusha, northern Tanzania by
retired secretary of the Commonwealth Health Secretariat for
East, Central and Southern African Region, A. M. Nhonoli, who is
one of the oldest medical practitioners in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nhonoli was opening the 10th anniversary meeting of the
International Association for Dental Research (IADR) -- East and
Southern African division held in Arusha today.
</P>
<P>
He said that local media can play an important role in
desseminating research results to the common people.
</P>
<P>
He warned the researchers not to restrict dissemination of
their valuable research findings to the few researchers attending
few scientific conferences which are also very rare and not
affordable by the majority of local researchers.
</P>
<P>
He also underscored the need for integration of oral health
with the rest of health care saying that the existing traditional
tendency to isolate the two in many countries is not relevant to
"our situation".
</P>
<P>
The conference with the theme "challenges for the 21st century
in oral health promotion, East and Southern Africa region" is
attended by 80 participants from Botswana, Kenya, South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Uganda, USA and Finland.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Denies Wartime Nazi Infiltration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) today strongly denies
allegations that the humanitarian agency had been infiltrated by
agents on the Nazi payroll.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued today, the ICRC said that allegations
contained in documents found in the files of the U.S. Office of
Strategic Services (OSS) in early August and dating back to the
end of World War II gave the impression that the ICRC had been
infiltrated by Nazi agents.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said that after investigating these allegations "with
utmost care," it was able to come up with some initial findings
which can deny such allegations.
</P>
<P>
It said that of the 21 people who were alleged as wartime ICRC
representatives by the U.S. documents, only 16 actually worked for
the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
In several cases, ICRC delegates were labeled as "enemy agents"
and accused of espionage simply because one U.S. agent had no idea
whatsoever of the ICRC's mandate, the ICRC communique said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the U.S. agent was surprised that an ICRC
delegate passed on technical details about a ship, the SS Canada.
</P>
<P>
According the communique, the ICRC had, however, received the
information from the French government in exile and been requested
by it to notify the German authorities that the vessel was being
put into service as a hospital ship.
</P>
<P>
"The notification was sent in accordance with the Hague
Convention No.X.," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the U.S. agent accused an ICRC delegate of
communicating the names of addresses of two prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
But the ICRC argued that that was its normal practice and it
had communicated information about millions of prisoners of war to
their states of origin and their relatives during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC admitted that it cannot certify that there were no
Nazi or other agents in its ranks during the war, but "it is
nevertheless quite clear that the OSS agent misinterpreted
activities carried out entirely openly and with the consent or at
the request of the Allies, and qualified them wrongly as
espionage."
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said it would contact the team of U.S. research
workers currently sifting through the OSS files and give them its
replies to these allegations.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says It Receives No Notice From S. Africa on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry
denied that it has received any official notice from South Africa
on its retiring from a joint communique with Iran, although a
South African official has reportedly expressed such retirement.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi stressed
that the joint communique of the two countries had been concluded
by the authorized officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It was also agreed to be issued at 19:00 hours South African
time on Saturday, 14 September, simultaneously in Pretoria and
Tehran," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question posed by reporters in relation to
the statements made by the spokesman of the South African
Foreign Ministry on the joint communique, the Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman said, "Today, we received the statements made
by the spokesman of the South African Foreign Ministry through
some international news Agencies."
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the South African Foreign Ministry has not yet
directly expressed its official view over that issue. At present
we are conducting the necessary discussions with the competent
authorities in the South African Foreign Ministry," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the Islamic Republic of Iran is concerned, the
joint communique issued by Iran had been concluded by the
authorized officials of the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted "if supposedly this news is correct and South
Africa, for certain reasons not clear to us, had wished not to
go on with issuing the joint communique, the least the Islamic
Republic of Iran would have expected was to be informed of its
decision in advance."
</P>
<P>
The joint communique was issued by the two countries at the
end of the visit by President Hashemi Rafsanjani to Pretoria. It
said that the two sides discussed the current situation in the
Middle East and Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa commended Iran for the role it had played to
resolve regional conflicts in Afghanistan, Tajikistan,
Nagormo-karabakh and recently between Uganda and Sudan through
peaceful means," it said.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that Nelson Mandela expressed
satisfaction with the situation of human rights in Iran in the
light of a U.N. report.

CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said in Gaza today that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai's decision to build 1,800 residential units for Jewish
settlers in the West Bank is a new violation of agreements signed
with the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference held by Arafat and U.S. Middle East
peace process coordinator Dennis Ross in Gaza today, Arafat said
that his meeting with Ross was aimed at pushing forward peace
negotiations, according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ross, commenting on the Israeli decision, said
that the U.S. is still viewing the Israeli settlement policy as
complicating the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
Ross said he agreed with Arafat to work as fast as possible
for reaching tangible results and translate the signed
agreements into reality.
</P>
<P>
He added that he briefed Arafat on the American
administration's resolve to continue efforts to push forward the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly General Committee Rejects Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The General Committee
of the 51st General Assembly today rejected a proposal on the
so-called Taiwan's participation in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was put forward by a small number of
countries, requested the General Assembly to set up an ad hoc
committee to study the issue of the so-called Taiwan's
participation in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth consecutive year for Taiwan to attempt to
include the issue in the agenda of the General Assembly but end in
an utter failure.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the committee, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nation Qin Huasun appealed to all
members of the General Committee to reject the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal is a brazen attempt to create `two Chinas' or
`one China, one Taiwan' in the United Nations that not only
constitutes a serious encroachment upon China's sovereignty and
a gross interference in its internal affairs, but also gravely
contravenes the U.N. Charter and General Assembly Resolution
2758," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose the inclusion of item 159 of the provisional
agenda in the agenda of the current session of the General
Assembly and hope that members of the General Assembly will
support the position of the Chinese delegation by upholding
justice and safeguarding the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter as well as the spirit of General Assembly Resolution
2758," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the General Assembly, at its 26th session, adopted by
an overwhelming majority the historically significant Resolution
2758 (XXVI).
</P>
<P>
The resolution recognizes that "representatives of the
Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful
representatives of China to the U.N. and that the People's
Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven countries spoke in favor of China's position and
urged the General Committee to reject the proposal on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The proposals on inclusion of an item on Taiwan in the past
three years went against the expressed will of the Assembly that
settled the representation of China 25 years ago," the
representative of Pakistan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an interference in the internal affairs of the People's
Republic of China. The people of China should make their own
decisions on the internal affairs of Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The representative of Egypt said the vast majority of member
states, including his country, did not support the inclusion of
the item on the agenda. The historic resolution adopted by the
Assembly 25 years ago had determined that the only
representative of China would be the People's Republic of China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
After two hours of debate on the issue, President of the
General Assembly Razali Ismail decided that in view of
overwhelming opposition, the General Committee will not include
the proposal on Taiwan in the agenda of the 51st General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"Justice is bound to defeat evil. An unjust cause naturally
finds little support," the Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year the number of sponsors of the
proposal on Taiwan's "representation" is obviously smaller than
that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, 37 friendly countries, including most
General Committee members, spoke out to support China's position
and opposed the inclusion of the proposal in the agenda of the
current session of the General Assembly, and there was not a
singly member of the General Committee that spoke in support of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This fact has fully reflected the firm stand of the general
U.N. membership in safeguarding the authority of the purposes
and principles of the U.N. Charter and General Assembly
Resolution 2758," Qin Huasun said.
</P>
<P>
"It also shows that the secessionist activities by the Taiwan
authorities to `return to the United Nations' enjoy no support
whatsoever and will only end up in an ignominious defeat," he
said.

<HEADLINE> US to Withdraw Peacekeepers From Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States is to
withdraw some 20,000 American peacekeepers from Bosnia-Herzegovina
as the secretary of state has indicated no reason to keep troops
there after successful elections in that nation, U.S. officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, said, "It appears to me that based on the
results of this election IFOR (Implementation Force) will be able
to depart within about a year of its commencement, that is
sometime in December."
</P>
<P>
"The election is a strong indicator that IFOR's basic mission
can be completed within a year, as President Clinton earlier
indicated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also said that the United States will support a
complete lifting of economic sanctions on Serbia as the result of
the election.
</P>
<P>
"(Lifting sanctions) would be in contemplation because the
election was orderly, calm and democratic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Christopher telephoned U.S. congratulations to Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic after the OSCE (Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe) announced today that Bosnian
President Izetbegovic, Serb nationalist leader Momcilo Krajisnik
and Croat Kresimir Zubak prevailed in the election for a
three-person presidency, and Izetbegovic will chair the presidency
since he received more votes than the two others.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of American troops and the lifting of economic
sanctions on Serbia have been highly controversial issues in
discussion between the United States and its European allies.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who only reluctantly agreed to dispatch American
troops to the war-ripped Bosnia-Herzegovina one year ago, has said
repeatedly that they would be withdrawn shortly after the
beginning of 1997, while the NATO allies, who say some type of
military presence must remain after the elections, have just as
steadfastly asserted that its forces cannot simply cut and run in
January.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the two positions are not necessarily
incompatible. The Clinton administration will consider what type
of military presence is now required in Bosnia, but it will not
entertain suggestions for extension of the existing NATO mission.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of economic sanctions on Serbia, the allies have
consistently pressed for a lifting as the sanctions have barred
forms of trade with Serbia and its participation in international
institutions. But the United States has insisted that the
sanctions remain on Belgrade, seen as chief patron of the Bosnian
Serbs during the war, as a form of leverage over Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic.
