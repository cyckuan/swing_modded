<HEADLINE> No. 14 Tulsa 93, TCU 71  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- David Shelton, a sparkplug reserve all
season for Tulsa, did it again Friday night as the Golden Hurricane
captured a spot in the Western Athletic Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton scored 18 of his 24 points in the first half as Tulsa
(29-3) beat TCU 93-71 in a tournament semifinal. Tulsa, the WAC
regular-season champion, will face Fresno State or Hawaii in
Saturday night's title game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was up to David, I'm sure he would be starting and
playing 35 minutes a game. But he has accepted his role on this
team, even though he deserves the chance to start,'' Tulsa coach
Bill Self said. ''He may be the best sixth man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Hill added 16 points, Eric Coley scored 14 and Brandon
Kurtz had 13 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out for Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Marquise Gainous had 20 points and Estell Laster had 18 for TCU
(18-14), which began the week second in the nation in scoring with
88.6 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa trailed 17-12 when Shelton entered the game with 7{
minutes gone in the first half. He hit seven of his eight shots in
the half, including a pair of 3-pointers, as the Hurricane took a
46-36 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the game, Shelton immediately set up Tony Heard
for a 3-pointer and then tied the game with a steal and layup. He
scored 10 straight points for Tulsa later in the half, including
consecutive 3-pointers that built the Hurricane lead to 39-30 with
3:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was Tulsa's leading scorer this season, averaging 13.5
points, but made just two starts. The junior college transfer is
playing his first season for the Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys make it pretty easy for me, because usually when I
come in we're not fighting to get back into the game,'' he said.
''Not starting is not a big issue with me now. It was in the back
of my mind earlier in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa never was threatened in the second half. Shelton and Coley
had consecutive layups to give the Hurricane a 69-52 lead with
11:55 remaining, and TCU didn't get closer than 12 points the rest
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous moved into 10th place on TCU's career scoring list with
1,228 points in two seasons with the Horned Frogs after
transferring from a junior college in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a pretty good season,'' Gainous said. ''I wanted to be
more aggressive at the start because for some reason I struggled
the last three times we played Tulsa.''

Gore, Bush Win in Colorado, Utah
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Al Gore and George W. Bush, already battling for the White
House as the nominees-to-be, began playing out the string of presidential
primaries with uncontested victories in Colorado and Utah on Friday. The vice
president and the Texas governor are past the campaign for the Democratic and
Republican nominations, and confronting each other in a marathon struggle for
the general election eight months away. The national campaign is on, with 24
state primaries still to come.

Energy Panel: Oil Reserve Dwindling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The world's richest countries have depleted their oil
inventories to the lowest levels seen in four years, a widely read survey said
Friday, reinforcing concerns that motorists will soon be paying even stiffer
prices to fill their tanks. Pinched profit margins for oil refineries have
caused a slowdown in the production of gasoline and other products, and this
delay could lead to gas shortages during the peak driving season this summer,
the International Energy Agency reported. World output of oil increased in
February by a slight 0.3 percent to 75 million barrels per day.

Sri Lanka Bomb Explosion Kills 20
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomber blew himself up, killing at least 20
other people and wounding 64 on a busy street in Sri Lanka's capital Friday, but
apparently missed his target -- a motorcade of Cabinet ministers. Authorities
said three separatist rebels, believed accomplices in the bombing, killed
themselves Saturday after hundreds of police and anti-terrorist commandos
surrounded the apartment building they were hiding in. The Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam are the principal suspects in most explosions in Sri Lanka. The
guerrilla group has been fighting for 17 years for a separate homeland for the
country's 3.3 million Tamils, a minority of Sri Lanka's 18.6-million. The
conflict has claimed 61,000 lives.

Iranians Said Indicted for Spying
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- Eight Iranian Defense Ministry officials are under
federal indictment here on charges they tried to obtain military secrets and
smuggle them out of the country, a Customs Service agent said. Special agent
Brian Buschini told the Great Falls Tribune in an interview published Friday
that authorities decided to release some information to help locate one of the
eight who is known to travel extensively in the United States and Europe. The
Iranian officials have never been arrested. According to the Tribune, Buschini
would not say what secrets the Iranians allegedly tried to obtain, but said
their success would have significantly compromised U.S. military abilities in
the Middle East.

   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Thunderstorms moved through North Texas with winds up
to 70 mph Friday, causing damage estimated in the millions of dollars at the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Three people died in traffic accidents.
A 16-year-old girl died when her car hydroplaned on Texas 155 near Tyler and
skidded into an 18-wheeler, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. Two
other people died when an 18-wheeler slid across the median on Interstate 20
during a rainstorm and collided with another 18-wheeler, which was hauling a
tanker full of fuel.

Dinosaur Fossils Challenge Theories
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered the bones of what could be largest meat-eating
dinosaur ever to walk the Earth -- a needle-nosed, razor-toothed beast that may
have been more terrifying than even the Tyrannosaurus rex. A team of researchers
from Argentina and North America unearthed the fossilized bones of as many as
six of the previously unknown species in Patagonia, a desert on the eastern
slopes of the Andes in South America. Researchers estimated the meat-eating
giant was 45 feet long, bigger than the reigning king of the carnivores, the
41-foot Giganotosaurus. The better-known T-rex was about 40 feet long.

Panthers Beat Lightning 4-3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mike Wilson scored the go-ahead goal with 8:18 to play
and the Florida Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 in an fight-filled
game Friday night to move into a tie for first place in the Southeast Division.
Pavel Bure added his league-leading 46th goal as Florida did all of its scoring
during a third period that was delayed twice by altercations involving 10
players. Wilson scored on a slap shot from the high slot as the Panthers beat
the Lightning for the ninth straight time and pulled even with Washington atop
the Southeast.

<HEADLINE> INS Whistle-Blower Settles With Govt  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Immigration and Naturalization Service
official in Texas who believes he was punished for speaking out
about problems in the agency's citizenship program reached a
settlement Friday that will pay him $30,000 and protect his job
status.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Office of Special Counsel announced the settlement. The
counsel's office had alleged the INS violated the Whistle-blower
Protection Act by suspending Dallas INS official Neil Jacobs and
demoting to a nonsupervisory job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied with the outcome,'' Jacobs said Friday. ''I
think under the circumstances it was the best thing for myself and
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   INS spokesman Bill Strassberger noted that a suspension due to
misconduct remains in Jacobs' record.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement in no way acknowledges that INS retaliated
against Neil Jacobs nor did INS concede that the agency violated
the Whistle-blower Protection Act,'' Strassberger said. The agency
agreed to a settlement in order to resolve the case and end the
cost of litigation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, the INS' assistant director for investigations in
Dallas, filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel
alleging that INS retaliated against him for testimony he gave a
congressional panel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In that appearance, Jacobs told lawmakers of possible abuses in
the processing of 10,000 naturalization applications in the Dallas
district office. He also was critical of the agency's Citizenship
USA program, an expedited program that resulted in more than 1
million people becoming citizens between September 1995 and October
1996. Republicans contended it was designed to bring in new voters
for the Democrats in the November 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   INS later came under harsh attack on Capitol Hill and elsewhere
for systemic failures in the Citizenship USA program and had to
retool its entire naturalization operation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, INS suspended Jacobs for 21 days and ordered his
reassignment, citing discrimination complaints from Hispanic agents
under his supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigation uncovered significant evidence that the
personnel actions INS subsequently took against Mr. Jacobs were in
retaliation for his congressional testimony,'' said Special Counsel
Elaine Kaplan, whose office handles whistle-blower cases.
</P>
<P>
   While Jacobs expressed regret for ''this whole ordeal,'' he
said: ''If I was to do it over again, I would do it exactly the way
I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement will provide Jacobs a requested reassignment to
Hawaii with similar pay and grade; back pay for 19 of the 21 days
of his suspension; payment of his attorneys' fees; and restoration
of some sick leave and annual leave. Jacobs also will receive
$30,000.

<HEADLINE> Turgeon To Coach Wichita St. Hoops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Mark Turgeon will be the next basketball
coach at Wichita State, The Wichita Eagle reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement was expected to be made Saturday, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon, 35, a native of Topeka and former point guard at
Kansas, resigned Friday as coach at Jacksonville (Ala.) State.
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon would replace Randy Smithson, who was forced to resign
Sunday after the Shockers finished 12-17.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Jim Schaus said Wednesday that Turgeon was at
the top of the list of candidates for the coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like Mark Turgeon a lot,'' he said. ''He's a dynamic young
man who fits a lot of criteria we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon went to Jacksonville State in April 1998. He led the
Gamecocks to a Division I school-record 17 wins this season after
finishing 8-18 his first season. His two-year record was 25-29.
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon told The Wichita Eagle on Thursday that he was extremely
interested in the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an attractive situation,'' he said. ''It's a good school
in a good league. And it's home. I'd be back with family. That's
what I'm excited about.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki approves wilderness expansion  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki approved a plan to
strictly limit the use of a 14,700-acre stretch of Adirondack Park
land.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki officially classified the state-owned William C. Whitney
tract of land on Friday as a wilderness area, the state's most
restrictive land use designation. The action prohibits structures
and motorized vehicles within the tract, which includes Little
Tupper Lake, a popular canoeing spot.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki took the action in conjunction with related land
classifications aimed at protecting portions of the 6 million acre
Adirondack park.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this action, we are ensuring a magnificent wilderness
area in the heart of the Adirondacks will be an enduring legacy for
this and future generations,'' Pataki said in a prepared release.
</P>
<P>
   The state purchased the Whitney land in 1998, creating the need
for an official land use classification. Some Adirondack-area
officials had favored a less-restrictve designation, fearing that
the limitations would deprive the area of an economic boost. But
the Adirondack Park Agency in January voted unanimously to classify
the area as wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki on Friday accepted his agency's recommendation. The
governor also:
</P>
<P>
   --Reclassified and added 5,870 acres of the adjacent Lake Lila
Primitive Area to the Whitney wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   --Gave wilderness protections to the West and Middle Branches of
the Oswegatchie River in the Watson's East Triangle Area,
preserving existing motorized access for camping, hunting and
fishing in a less restrictive ''wild forest'' portion of the area.
</P>
<P>
   --Reclassified a small portion of the Alice Brook Area to a
primitive classification, restoring a snowmobile corridor between
the hamlet of Star Lake and the communities of Wanakena and
Cranberry Lake.
</P>
<P>
   -- And classified the 80-acre Little Tupper lake headquarters for
state administrative use.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists praised the actions, saying they protected a
significant portion of the park from overuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means 41,600 more acres of wilderness in the Adirondack,''
said John Sheehan of the Adirondack Council.

<HEADLINE> No. 24 Oregon 60, Oregon State 53  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Jenny Mowe had 14 points and 10 rebounds as
No. 24 Oregon clinched its first outright Pac-10 title by defeating
Oregon State 60-53 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (23-7, 14-4 Pac-10) clinched a share of the conference
championship when Stanford lost to Arizona 79-72 Thursday night.
Oregon, headed to its seventh straight NCAA tournament under coach
Jody Runge, shared the title last season with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Reda Petraitis scored 15 points, and Sissel Pierce had 15
rebounds for Oregon State (14-16, 10-8).
</P>
<P>
   The game was close throughout, and Oregon's perimeter defense,
as well as the inside play of the 6-foot-5 Mowe, were the keys in
the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A short jumper by Mowe broke a 46-all tie with 6:36 to play, and
Shaquala Williams added a long jumper and a 3-pointer to make it
53-48.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Ragland's 3-pointer pulled the Beavers to 56-53 with
41.3 seconds left. Oregon State trailed 57-53 when Petraitis sank a
3-pointer, but an official had called a foul on Oregon first,
waving off the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Mowe got a steal down low and hit two free throws to make it
59-53 with 11.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Wolvert and Williams, who leads the Pac-10 in scoring
at 17.9 points per game, added 13 for the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 9,087 was the second-largest in school history for
a women's game, second only to the 9,738 that turned out on March
8, 1996, before McArthur Court was renovated.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Hillary Clinton together again in N.Y. to court Hispanicvotes  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton joked about doing salsa and merengue. The always-stiff Gore
even tried a couple of sentences in Spanish and admitted his salsa
looks a lot like his macarena.
</P>
<P>
   But the two Democratic candidates were serious Friday about
trying to protect and even increase their margins among Hispanic
voters in New York and around the nation with a joint appearance at
an Latino legislative conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ''presence, his commitment, his actions to be here so
soon after Super Tuesday speak loudly,'' said Democratic state
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, chair of this weekend's Somos El
Futuro legislative conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Mrs. Clinton already have strong leads among the
nation's fastest growing voter population -- Senate candidate
Clinton had a 2-1 advantage over likely Republican challenger
Rudolph Giuliani in a February poll and Hispanic voters went 8-1
for Gore on Super Tuesday, more than any other New York demographic
group .
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never forget how at the core of the Big Apple was the
comunidad de Puerto Ricon,'' said Gore, working in halting and
sometimes incorrect Spanish as much as he could in his speech to
enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nuestra causa es su causa,'' Gore repeated over and over -- our
cause is your cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two presidential elections, Hispanics voted
overwhelmingly for President Clinton and Gore -- 72 percent to 21
percent in 1996 and 61 percent to 25 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of us know if we continue those (Clinton-Gore) policies
and make sure they work for everybody, we will bring prosperity to
those people who have been left out up until now, and that should
be our goal for this upcoming election,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance by Gore and Mrs. Clinton before New York
Hispanics so soon after his Super Tuesday victories will resonate
beyond the state, said Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Latino vote in Texas, California and Florida is more
important than the one in New York, a Democratic state, but I'm
sure this event will get widespread coverage and give them a boost
in those other states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials say Gore and Mrs. Clinton shouldn't take
Hispanic votes for granted. Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush is saying all the right things, too, Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is well-liked by Hispanics in Texas and has been making a
push to compete with Gore for that voting bloc in voter-rich
California and in Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor.
During the primary, Bush even challenged other candidates to debate
him on issues important to Hispanics, but ''solamente en espanol''
-- only in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, New York's Hispanic vote is largely centered in New
York City, where Giuliani has won two terms as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that Bush has the ability to attract, as he did in
Texas, the Hispanic voters and we'll give him the opportunity to do
that in New York,'' state GOP Chairman William Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Giuliani will be appear together March 29 at a New York
City fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a sometimes Spanish speaker, will debate Bush on Hispanic
issues but wants to do it on Spanish-language network Univision and
in English, said Peter Ragone, the vice president's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also doesn't plan to make it easy for Bush to appeal to
minorities, condemning ''Confederate flag waving, Bob Jones
embracing, right wing extremists'' during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican primary, Bush refused to take a stand on
whether the Confederate flag should be removed from the South
Carolina Statehouse and appeared at the private Bob Jones
University, whose leaders have espoused anti-Catholic views and
only recently allowed interracial dating.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton discusses primary results  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- When New Yorkers vote for their next
president and senator in the November elections, Hillary Rodham
Clinton says the choice is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you compare the positions of the vice president and myself
to Governor (George W.) Bush and Mayor (Rudolph) Giuliani, you
could not have a starker comparison,'' Clinton said while
campaigning in upstate New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she and Gore would continue fiscal responsibility
while Bush and Giuliani ''would do a U-turn and take us back to the
days of exploding deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also cited differences on how to support public
education, developing a patients' bill of rights and foreign
policy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared with Gore at a convention in Albany Friday
night, courting Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was very pleased with Gore's victory over Bill
Bradley in the Democratic primary but did not say whether she was
relieved by Republican presidential contender John McCain's
decision to put his campaign on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls after Super Tuesday's election suggested that many
McCain voters would be likely to vote for Clinton in November.
</P>
<P>
   Although the election was still fresh in everyone's minds,
Clinton spent the day discussing teen pregnancy, elderly care and
women's issues during stops earlier Friday in Ithaca and Cortland.
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell University, 5,000 students and alumni attending
packed into Barton Hall to hear the first lady's perspective on
women's leadership heading into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the progress made by women's rights pioneers in the
19th and 20th centuries, Clinton repeatedly urged all women to
unite and put aside their political, cultural and religious
differences during a 45-minute keynote address to the President's
Council of Cornell Women.
</P>
<P>
   ''The woman of the 21st century will be blessed with choices and
empowered with the tools of opportunity to make the most of her
God-given talents ... her voice will be heard, her concerns will be
followed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before her speech, Clinton took a quick tour of a local senior
residential center, where she dropped by the center's
intergenerational daycare facility.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started the day in Cortland, where she met with nearly
300 teens at the city's Youth Bureau Center to talk about the
city's teen pregnancy reduction program. The Zero Adolescent
Pregnancy program has been so successful that other communities
have used it as a model.
</P>
<P>
   ''A program where kids say no to sex and yes to the future. This
is the kind of program we need to have from one end of the state to
the other,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing teen pregnancy also is a first step in combatting child
abuse and street violence and in checking high school dropout
rates, she told her listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton concluded her appearance by answering several questions
from her young audience. One question came from a high school
junior who said she was living on her own with her 8-month-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she supported providing financial assistance and
child care help to young mothers so they could continue their
education.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady will speak to the Somos El Futuro Conference
breakfast today. The conference is sponsored by the Puerto
Rico/Hispanic Legislative Task Force.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 La. Tech 91, Arkansas St. 81  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES PRICHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (AP) -- Louisiana Tech is on another roll, and
there is little the other women's teams in the Sun Belt Conference
can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lennox had 28 points and 10 rebounds and Catrina Frierson
added 19 points as the No. 3 Lady Techsters held off Arkansas State
91-81 in the Sun Belt tournament semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Lady Techsters (27-2), winners of 17 straight
games, will meet Western Kentucky, a 77-67 winner over Florida
International, in the championship game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hagood scored 32 points, tying a tournament record, while
Keeshia Evans, a Louisville native, had 20 points and 14 rebounds
for Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have an answer for Betty and they didn't have an
answer for Julie, either,'' said Brian Boyer, Arkansas State's
first-year coach.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Arkansas State (18-11) led 40-39 at halftime and
stayed close throughout the second half, trailing only 83-81 with
40 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But Frierson made two free throws after being fouled beneath the
basket with 26.9 seconds left. Louisiana Tech went up 87-81 with
17.2 seconds to play when she sank two more free throws after being
fouled while trying to rebound a Hagood miss.
</P>
<P>
   Ayana Walker then ended any hope of a Lady Indians victory by
blocking a shot by Evans and then hitting two free throws after
Evans fouled her. That put the Lady Techsters up 89-81 with 8.4
seconds remaining. Lennox's two free throws with 0.8 seconds left
completed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people in this country who don't think anything
about the Sun Belt Conference,'' Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore
said. ''They're out of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Indians lost both of their regular-season games against
Louisiana Tech, a 95-59 defeat on the road on Feb. 15 and an 82-69
loss at home five days later.
</P>
<P>
   Walker scored 12 points and Tamicha Jackson added 11 for
Louisiana Tech. Jolie McKeirnan had 10 points for Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Takeisha Lewis had 11 rebounds apiece for the Lady
Techsters. Frierson added eight and grabbed several key boards down
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I had to step in and rebound,'' Frierson said. ''My job
is to get out there and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans lamented Louisiana Tech's 56-36 rebounding advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't hit the boards hard enough and rebounding is the
bottom line,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagood, who shot 50 percent (11-of-22) from the field and hit
all nine of her free-throw attempts, kept the Lady Indians in the
game in the second half when it appeared Louisiana Tech was poised
to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a typical Julie Hagood performance,'' Boyer said.
''I've seen her do something like this for four years.''

<HEADLINE> Land claim talks end in impasse, case heads back to court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A year of negotiations in the Oneida
Indian Nation land claim ended with an impasse in a Florida
courtroom and the case now heads back to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mediation process is at an end,'' U.S. District Court
Judge Neal McCurn said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn ordered an end to the talks after court-appointed
mediator Ronald Riccio told him, ''The talks have extended into
areas not necessary to settle the land-claim dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations collapsed when New York state officials refused to
drop a state lawsuit against the ''multi-game'' gambling machines --
which have similarities to outlawed slot machines -- used at the
Oneida Indian Nation's Turning Stone Casino in Verona.
</P>
<P>
   William Taylor III, attorney for the Oneida Indian Nation of New
York, said the tribe considers the lawsuit a threat to its
financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion to the talks means a new phase in the land-claim
lawsuit. McCurn predicted resolution in court might not occur until
''three or four years from now, if then.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurn will also have to decide whether to grant the Oneidas'
motion to add 20,000 individual landwoners in Madison and Oneida
counties to the land claim lawsuit as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida Indian Nations of New York and Wisconsin and the
Thames Band of Oneidas in Canada are suing Oneida and Madison
counties for compensation for some 250,000 acres of ancestral land.
The U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that the land was seized in
questionable transactions with the state and private individuals
and ruled the Oneidas are entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Riccio, a former Seton Hall University law school dean, had
worked since early last year to help the parties reach an
agreement. But in February, he gave McCurn a report concluding the
talks would not yield one. In a document made public Friday, Riccio
had recommended to McCurn that an impasse be declared.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCurn ordered attorneys for all parties involved in
the mediation effort to his temporary courtroom in Florida Friday
to explain their failure to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, McCurn offered the lawyers one more chance to
bargain. He said if attorneys would agree to stick to ''germane''
issues, he would extend the talks until April 30. Six attorney
signed the agreement three hours later, but New York state's
refusal to drop the gambling machine lawsuit killed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm extremely disappointed,'' Riccio told the
Observer-Dispatch of Utica. ''I thought we had put it back on
track.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Oilers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Ray Bourque scored his first two goals
as a member of the Avalanche to lead Colorado to a 4-2 win over the
Edmonton Oilers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who joined the Avalanche on Monday after being traded
from the Boston Bruins with left-winger Dave Andreychuk, got both
his 11th and 12th goals of the season on power plays.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic and Adam Deadmarsh also scored for the Avalanche, who
lead Edmonton by two points in the Northwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   George Laraque and Alex Selivanov scored for the Oilers, who
finished their three-game homestand without a win (0-3-0).
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, who have won four in a row, opened the scoring at
3:13 of the first period as Bourque's shot from the point beat
Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton tied it 1-1 midway through the first when Selivanov put
away his 22nd of the season on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Laraque put the Oilers ahead 2-1 when he spun around in front of
the net and beat Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque tied it early in the second with Oilers defensemen Tom
Poti and Roman Hamrlik in the penalty box with high-sticking double
minors, handed out just four seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   Deadmarsh put the Avs ahead to stay at 14:15 of the second.
Sakic rounded out the scoring with his 20th goal when he beat Salo
at 15:43 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Roy made 28 saves for the victory and is now just 11 wins short
of tying the all-time wins record for a goalie, held by Terry
Sawchuk with 447.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Igor Ulanov played his first game as an Oiler after
being traded from the Montreal Canadiens, along with Alain
Nassreddine, in exchange for defensemen Christian Laflamme and
Matthieu Descoteuax.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 99, Warriors 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton had 27 points and 16 assists and
keyed a 14-0 run in the second half as the Seattle SuperSonics
rolled to a 99-85 victory over Golden State on Friday night and
handed the Warriors their fifth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics beat the Warriors for the ninth straight time at Key
Arena and for the 15th time in the last 16 meetings overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics seized command by scoring the last five points of the
third quarter and the first nine points of the fourth for a 77-63
lead. The Sonics led by as many as 19 points after that.
</P>
<P>
   Donyell Marshall led the Warriors with 27 points and Larry
Hughes added 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics lost their best low-post scoring threat in the third
period when Baker suffered a strained left hamstring with 9:38 left
and the Sonics down 50-49. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Grant contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds for the
Sonics and Rashard Lewis had 13 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes followed up a 41-point effort against the Lakers on
Thursday night with a big night against the Sonics and Payton, who
guarded him most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's biggest lead was 87-68. The Warriors ran off eight
straight points on 3-pointers by Marshall and Hughes, closing to
87-76 with 5:17 left. But they got no closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics opened the fourth quarter with two free throws by
Payton, two steals and a pair of dunks by Lewis and Payton's
3-point shot for a 77-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Emanual Davis's 3-point shot on a cross-court feed by Payton and
two free throws by Grant gave the Sonics a 68-63 lead after three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Adonal Foyle's block of Lewis's dunk attempt started a fast
break, and Hughes' left-handed jam tied the game at 63-63 with 1:18
left in the third quarter. Foyle had four blocks during the third
period as he also rejected shots by Payton and Baker and blocked a
dunk attempt by Jelani McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led 45-43 at halftime on Payton's spectacular left-hand
hook shot over Marshall in the low post.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Warriors shot 71 percent (12-for-17) in the first
period and led 30-21. ...Vernon Maxwell played in his first game
since January 5 and drilled a 3-point shot from the right side on
his first attempt.

Gore, Bush Win in Colorado, Utah
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Al Gore and George W. Bush, already battling for the White
House as the nominees-to-be, began playing out the string of presidential
primaries with uncontested victories in Colorado and Utah on Friday. The vice
president and the Texas governor are past the campaign for the Democratic and
Republican nominations, and confronting each other in a marathon struggle for
the general election eight months away. The national campaign is on, with 24

Energy Panel: Oil Reserve Dwindling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The world's richest countries have depleted their oil
inventories to the lowest levels seen in four years, a widely read survey said
Friday, reinforcing concerns that motorists will soon be paying even stiffer
prices to fill their tanks. Pinched profit margins for oil refineries have
caused a slowdown in the production of gasoline and other products, and this
delay could lead to gas shortages during the peak driving season this summer,
the International Energy Agency reported. World output of oil increased in
February by a slight 0.3 percent to 75 million barrels per day.

involving the increasingly controversial drug comes as an FDA physician asked

Sri Lanka Bomb Explosion Kills 20

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomber blew himself up, killing at least 20
other people and wounding 64 on a busy street in Sri Lanka's capital Friday, but
apparently missed his target -- a motorcade of Cabinet ministers. Authorities
said three separatist rebels, believed accomplices in the bombing, killed
themselves Saturday after hundreds of police and anti-terrorist commandos
surrounded the apartment building they were hiding in. The Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam are the principal suspects in most explosions in Sri Lanka. The
guerrilla group has been fighting for 17 years for a separate homeland for the
country's 3.3 million Tamils, a minority of Sri Lanka's 18.6-million. The

that authorities decided to release some information to help locate one of the
eight who is known to travel extensively in the United States and Europe. The
Iranian officials have never been arrested. According to the Tribune, Buschini

their success would have significantly compromised U.S. military abilities in

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Win in Colorado, Utah  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush, already battling for the White House
as the nominees-to-be, began playing out the string of presidential
primaries with uncontested victories in Colorado and Utah on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and the Texas governor are past the campaign
for the Democratic and Republican nominations, and confronting each
other in a marathon struggle for the general election eight months
away.
</P>
<P>
   The national campaign is on, with 24 state primaries still to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The two Western primaries, along with GOP county conventions
plus a straw poll in Wyoming, are the remnants of a failed attempt
to gain clout for Rocky Mountain and Western states in the
nomination of presidents. Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah tried to
engineer a nine-state combination, but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign turned out, it would have been too late anyhow,
with Republican challenger John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley
both out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado and Utah, Gore and Bush won predictable landslides.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley each stood to gain a handful of delegates
since they were awarded in proportion to the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   --With 100 percent of the Colorado precincts reporting, Bush had
65 percent of the vote, McCain 27 percent and Alan Keyes 7 percent.
So Bush was leading for 28 delegates, McCain for 12. Gore was
polling 71 percent of the Democratic vote to 23 percent for
Bradley. Gore led for 44 Democratic delegates to 7 for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   --In Utah, with 93 percent of precincts reporting, Bush was
polling 63 percent, Keyes 20 percent, and McCain 15 percent. Even a
distant second place would be Keyes' best outing of the season.
Bush got all 29 GOP delegates in Utah. For the Democrats, Gore had
81 percent of the vote to Bradley's 19 percent. Gore won 16
delegates to Bradley's two, with six yet to be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes says he will keep campaigning despite the certainty of
Bush's nomination. He said it is a myth that politics should be
about winning.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who attended the Wyoming conventions overwhelmingly
supported Bush. With 22 of 23 county caucus sites reporting, Bush
collected 422 votes in a straw poll. Alan Keyes received 75 votes
and John McCain 59. Bush picked up 19 delegates, McCain 2 and Keyes
1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went into Friday's primaries with 617 of the 1,034
delegates needed to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had 1,479; it takes 2,170 to install the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The primary outcome was forgone before a vote was cast.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Leavitt said it was worth the effort. ''The voice
of the West will be heard,'' the governor, a Bush man, said after
voting in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Few seemed interested. At one Salt Lake City polling place, only
five people cast ballots during the first hour and 45 minutes.
''Nobody cares,'' said Clayton Hurst, an election judge.
</P>
<P>
   The western delegates push Bush and Gore closer to majorities by
which the national conventions will ratify the primaries that were
settled in only six weeks, when both men won overwhelmingly in the
16 contests of Super Tuesday. Gore swept, Bush won all but four GOP
contests, and both races were over.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were evenly matched in a CNN-Time poll released
Friday, Gore with the backing of 48 percent of registered voters
and Bush with 46 percent. The poll, taken after Tuesday's results,
also showed the two candidates closely matched on public perception
of their strengths as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls from Colorado and Utah showed voters mostly satisfied
with a Bush-Gore matchup in November. Fewer than a fifth said they
would consider a third-party candidate. Voters were surveyed as
they left the polling places by Voter News Service, a consortium of
The Associated Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   In both states, conservatives made up two-thirds of the
Republican primary electorate -- a bigger share than in any other
GOP contest with exit polls this year except the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll showed Bush stronger on a question that had nagged
in the earlier primary states, with four out of five Colorado and
Utah voters saying he knows enough to serve effectively as
president. There was more skepticism among people who called
themselves independents, the bloc that had boosted McCain. About 30
percent expressed doubts on Bush's ability.
</P>
<P>
   Bush again ran strongest among Republicans, while about half the
self-styled independents in both primary states opted for McCain or
Keyes. Along with the delegates, the rest of the primary schedule
offers something of a framework for the national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was on the road all weekend, in New York,
Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston, Miami and Orlando, winding up at
home in Tennessee, one of next Tuesday's primary states. It is the
kind of road trip that usually waits until fall, but there was no
waiting in the 2000 campaign, with the party contests over early.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a break at home in Austin before beginning a two-day
swing through the Southern states that vote next week. The biggest
of them are his own Texas, and Florida, where his brother, Jeb, is
governor. Both will be crucial to the Republican ticket in the Nov.
7 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech wrinkle added a bit of interest in Arizona on
Saturday. No doubt about the outcome, but for the first time,
Arizona Democrats had the option of voting over the Internet
beginning last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are primaries to come in other major states that will be
keys to the general election, among them Illinois on March 21,
Pennsylvania on April 4 and New Jersey on June 6, the last day of
primary voting.

   A 16-year-old girl died when her car hydroplaned on Texas 155
near Tyler and skidded into an 18-wheeler, the Texas Department of
Public Safety said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people died when an 18-wheeler slid across the median
on Interstate 20 during a rainstorm and collided with another
18-wheeler, which was hauling a tanker full of fuel, public safety
spokesman Tom Vinger said. Two pickups and a car were also involved
in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   In Irving, several high-rise construction sites and large office
buildings were damaged east of the airport. At one site, three
people inside an office trailer were injured -- one seriously -- when
winds toppled the structure.
</P>
<P>
   There was no dollar estimate on the damage, but it could run
into the tens of millions, said Sandra Ray, public relations
director of the Southwestern Insurance Information.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of damage to businesses, so we could be
talking about some high numbers here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away, two plumbers inside another office trailer
were thrown about when winds up to 70 mph ripped through the
parking lot. One worker had minor cuts to his head. The other man
escaped injury, said Jason Nunley, who works for C.D. Henderson,
Inc. of Garland.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta Air Lines hangar at the airport was damaged by strong
winds that ripped portions of the roof off. Some American Airlines
and Delta planes were delayed because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, one person was killed as a storm system spawned at
least two tornadoes near Birmingham and high winds, heavy rain and
hail in other central regions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman was killed in Tuscaloosa, about 45 miles west of
Birmingham, when she was struck by a billboard that was torn down
by near hurricane force winds, said Don Hartley, spokesman for the
Tuscaloosa County Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said ''several thousand'' people in the county were without
power and there were reports of trees falling on houses and several
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Jefferson County, there were no immediate reports
of injuries from two tornadoes that touched down in the Birmingham
area, said Mark Kelly, spokesman for the county emergency
management agency.
</P>
<P>
   Damage estimates were not immediately available, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Want Hijacking Trial Moved  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Defense lawyers for Pakistan's deposed
premier said today they want their client's hijacking trial moved
out of the southern city of Karachi, a day after one of their
colleagues in the case was gunned down in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal Raad, a key lawyer for former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
was to be buried today near his home in one of Karachi's wealthiest
neighborhoods. Paramilitary Rangers and heavily armed police were
deployed to maintain security at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   So far, authorities have established no connection between the
killing of Raad and Sharif's trial, which is currently under way in
Karachi. But other members of Sharif's defense team told The
Associated Press they fear more violence unless the trial is
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just too vulnerable here,'' said Khawaja Sultan, who
says the defense team will ask for the trial to be moved either to
Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab state, or to the federal
capital, Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said one man with a Kalashnikov rifle and two men with
pistols entered Raad's second-floor office on Friday and opened
fire. A fourth gunman was seen standing guard outside the office
building.
</P>
<P>
   The other two victims were Shehzad Kathri, also a lawyer, and
Ghulam Abass, Raad's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Karachi, a city of 14 million people, is Pakistan's largest and
most violent, wracked by relentless ethnic and religiously
motivated fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, along with his younger brother and six other people, is
on trial accused of hijacking, attempted murder, terrorism and
kidnapping -- all charges that carry either the death penalty or
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from events on Oct. 12, the day the army
overthrew Sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say after dismissing army chief Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, Sharif ordered that the general's plane be denied
landing rights at Karachi airport. The pilot of the Pakistan
International Airlines plane with 200 passengers and crew on board,
claimed the plane landed with only seven minutes of fuel remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's dismissal sparked the army to revolt, arrest Sharif
and allow the aircraft -- which prosecutors say had circled Karachi
for more than one hour -- to land.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military government, now led by Musharraf, has
condemned Raad's shooting and promised to track down the killers.
No suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's wife said Friday that Raad had received death threats
warning him to resign from the defense. There had been no earlier
reports of the threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''He received telephone calls and letters threatening him. He
was very worried,'' Khulsoom Sharif said. ''They told him to quit
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President
Clinton has no plans to cancel his scheduled visit to Pakistan this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we condemn this kind of horrific act of violence,
and call upon them to investigate fully this assassination,''
Lockhart said. ''We believe the former prime minister deserves a
free, open and transparent trial so that he and the rest of the
world can see that justice is being done.''

<HEADLINE> Mudslide Destroys Calif. Homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLBRAE, Calif. (AP) -- A football field-size mudslide which
threatened eight houses in this San Francisco suburb, has caused
the Delgado family home to lean at a 45-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gone through all of the emotions: denial, sadness,
grief,'' Maria Delgado, 45, said Friday as she stood across the
street, unable to get any closer to her disintegrating
half-million-dollar house.
</P>
<P>
   The slide buckled one foundation, punched a tree through the
garage wall of another home and sent a wall of mud into the bedroom
of a third.
</P>
<P>
   The Delgados and four other families were evacuated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of three houses at the top of the unstable hill were
told to stay out of their back yards and warned they might have to
leave at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council on Friday decided to let the five homes stand
for now, partly because they were holding back the slide from the
rest of the street. The Delgado house, however, would eventually be
demolished.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had its rainiest February in history, and several
storms over the last two weeks sent the hillside falling about 50
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of dry weather slowed the slide to a crawl Friday, and
although there was a slight chance of rain Friday night, fair skies
were forecast for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get a couple of dry days maybe that will solidify it,''
said Tom Coletti, Millbrae's superintendent of public works. ''We
don't know what nature's going to do here. It's unpredictable.''

<HEADLINE> Food Prices Spiral in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIAQUELANE, Mozambique (AP) -- At about 30 cents each, the dozen
red mangoes spread on the grass for sale are far too expensive for
Zokwe, a 50-year-old farmer with two wives and eight children to
feed.
</P>
<P>
   Before a month of fierce floods swept away his crops, food
stores and savings, Zokwe, who uses only one name, would have
laughed at the display in derision. Now, he looks at it and shakes
his head in despair.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can I do?'' he asked Friday. ''Almost all my money is
gone, my goats have gone, my crops have gone. And these prices are
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   An acute food shortage caused by a month of record rains and
floods have sent food prices in Mozambique soaring up to 400
percent. Emergency food aid won't offset the increase, leaving many
in this nation of subsistence farmers wondering where their next
swallow of food will come from.
</P>
<P>
   Like many survivors, Zokwe can't grow food because his fields
are under water. He can't buy it, either, because the current swept
away the small amount of money that he hid in his hut, the
customary place of safekeeping in this farming community, 110 miles
north of the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 57,000 displaced people camped here can't afford
even one mango, and the young woman trying to sell the fruits said
trade was almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of the few selling food at the Chiaquelane camp. At
Xai-Xai, another hard-hit farming town further downstream, a
110-pound sack of corn now costs $43 -- three times more than before
the floods.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these subsistence farmers had money, they wouldn't be
able to buy much because the shelves of markets in the area are
almost bare. The region has been cut off by floodwaters for almost
a month, and efforts to restore road links have been disrupted by
more downpours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Food prices in the flooded areas are unusually high because
the food situation is critical,'' said Jose Rodolfo, assistant
national director of internal trade. ''The poor can't pay these
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   In areas unaffected by flooding, food prices remained stable,
officials and aid workers said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Limpopo burst its banks, floodwater spread 30 miles on
each side, ruining crops in one of the country's most fertile
regions. As the floodwaters subside, the government plans to give
seeds and tools to farmers so they can harvest some food within
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The floods came as Mozambique was making a comeback after a
devastating civil war. Though the per capita income of its 19.1
million people is just $670 each year, the southeast African nation
had been hailed as a model of promise and recovery, with its
economy averaging 10 percent annual growth and foreign investment
streaming in.
</P>
<P>
   For Zokwe, having no money or possessions added to the dejection
in the camp -- sodden after two days of heavy downpours, Zokwe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty sad situation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Copes With More Rain  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With heavy rains still pounding
southern Mozambique, relief efforts have been delayed, more crops
are facing ruin and refugees are unlikely to be heading home
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   More international aid is reaching the impoverished African
nation, where an estimated 1 million people have been left homeless
by floodwaters that peaked two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The waters had begun to recede, raising hopes that refugees
could go home quickly and large quantities of aid could be
delivered efficiently by road.
</P>
<P>
   But southern Mozambique has been deluged with rain since
Wednesday -- and more showers are expected over the weekend. Many
key roads remain impassable and the latest downpours have pushed
back the date when the refugees will be able to leave crowded,
makeshift camps.
</P>
<P>
   The weather has been clear in central Mozambique, and U.S. Air
Force helicopters were in action for a second day Friday, flying
doctors to three villages located near the mouth of the flooded
Save River.
</P>
<P>
   The medics discovered malaria among the residents but no major
flood-related illnesses, said Abby Spring of the U.N. World Food
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Aid helicopters also delivered cooking oil, corn, flour and
porridge to 35,000 people along the Save River valley, authorities
said. Seven large rubber boats also ferried seven tons of supplies
upriver to the town of Buze, Spring said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The food distribution is running smoothly but we're still
concerned about the potential of isolated pockets of people cut off
from food and (drinking) water,'' Spring said by telephone from the
central city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
   Airlift operations from the rain-soaked capital, Maputo, were
delayed for several hours Friday by rain, though they resumed
during brief patches of clear weather.
</P>
<P>
   The downpour in Maputo turned some streets into ponds
bumper-deep with water. Pedestrians tried to dodge sheets of water
coming off the tires of passing vehicles. At flooded intersections,
they took off their shoes, grimaced, and waded through the murky
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Mula, 29, has lived in a cashew nut warehouse on the
outskirts of the capital with 3,100 other people since his
neighborhood was flooded a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shrieking children ran past in the humid, cavernous building.
Dozens of people tried to take naps on the concrete floor, some
with the luxury of thin straw mats, others with only a plastic
sheet between themselves and the hard floor.
</P>
<P>
   Their possessions -- cooking pots, utensils, and a few coloring
books -- sat on rusted metal tables formerly used for sorting
cashews.
</P>
<P>
   Mula stepped outside, stared up at the leaden skies and shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait for this rain to stop,'' he grumbled.

<HEADLINE> Threats Alleged in White House Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former White House contractor says she was
told that e-mail messages never turned over to congressional
investigators or the Justice Department discuss Vice President Al
Gore's involvement in the campaign fund-raising controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In a declaration unsealed Friday in federal court, Betty Lambuth
said a subordinate also told her some of the unreviewed e-mails
deal with ''the sale of Clinton Commerce Department trade mission
seats in exchange for campaign contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she was warned by White House superiors in May 1998
not to reveal a problem with the e-mail system that made it
impossible to do a computer search of 100,000 or more messages in
response to various investigations of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   After Lambuth informed the White House of the problem, she said
Office of Administration counsel Mark Lindsay told her ''that if I
or any of my team who knew about the e-mail problem told anyone
else about it we would lose our jobs, be arrested and put in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it will complete an initial review of the
e-mail matter next week and declined to comment on Lambuth's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth unsealed Lambuth's
declaration in a lawsuit filed by a conservative legal group,
Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she was told by the subordinate who examined some
of the e-mails that they also contained information on the White
House's improper gathering of FBI background files of Republican
appointees and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth says she learned of a problem with the White House
e-mail system in the midst of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
perjury and obstruction investigation of President Clinton in the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware of the allegations regarding the e-mail issue,
and we are taking appropriate steps with regard to those
allegations,'' said Neille Mallon Russell, a spokeswoman for the
office of Starr's successor, Independent Counsel Robert Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem
''Project X'' and that because of the threats, she and her staff
took to discussing the issue in a park near the New Executive
Office Building and in a Starbucks coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail problem came to light last month in declarations by a
former White House computer specialist, Sheryl Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hall alleged in a new declaration, which Judge Lamberth also
unsealed Friday, that she understood from a ''career staff member
of the Clinton-Gore White House's Office of Administration'' that
presidential aides plan to get rid of computer-taped archives and
the contents of computer hard drives of presidential aides who
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer James Gilligan, representing the
Executive Office of the President, assured the judge that the
e-mails, computer hard drives and back-up tapes were being
preserved, and he supplied the names of White House custodians of
the records.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan rejected the suggestion that the White House has
''suppressed production of e-mails.'' He said it has always
maintained that it is an ''undue burden'' to do mass searches of
e-mail, but that it is willing to do so within ''reasonable search
parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan also said the e-mail problem has been publicly known
for some time. He pointed to an article in Insight magazine in
December 1998 that outlined it.
</P>
<P>
   As for suggestions of a coverup, ''it just doesn't add up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Friday night, ''We are
actively in the process of fully reviewing all these matters and
will be reporting on them next week, as the president's counsel has
said.'' He declined to address Lambuth's assertions.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Take Colorado, Utah  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won
uncontested victories in the Colorado and Utah presidential
primaries, but their attention is clearly focused on the general
election eight months away, rather than the remaining two dozen
state contests.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's two primaries and GOP county conventions, plus a straw
poll in Wyoming, were elements of a failed effort to set a common
voting date for nine Rocky Mountain and Western states and give
them a bigger say in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it might have been moot since Gore's remaining
opponent, Bill Bradley, and Bush's main Republican challenger, Sen.
John McCain, withdrew from the race after Super Tuesday defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic caucases were being held today in Michigan and
Minnesota. A Democratic primary in Arizona was attracting a bit of
special interest because for the first time, there was the option
of voting over the Internet beginning last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado and Utah, Gore and Bush won predictable landslides,
although McCain and Bradley each stood to gain a handful of
delegates since they were awarded in proportion to the popular
vote.
</P>
<P>
   --With all Colorado precincts reporting, Bush had 65 percent of
the vote, McCain 27 percent and Alan Keyes 7 percent. Bush was
leading for 28 delegates, McCain for 12. Gore won 71 percent of the
Democratic vote to 23 percent for Bradley. Gore led for 44
Democratic delegates to 7 for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   --In Utah, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, Bush polled 63
percent, Keyes 20 percent and McCain 15 percent. Even a distant
second place would be Keyes' best outing of the season. Bush got
all 29 GOP delegates in Utah. For the Democrats, Gore had 81
percent of the vote to Bradley's 19 percent. Gore won 21 delegates
to Bradley's three.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming GOP county conventions did not bind the 22
delegates, but Bush won 19 of them, McCain two and Keyes one.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's primaries, Bush had 701 of the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the nomination. Gore had 1,587; it takes 2,170 to
install the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Western delegates push Bush and Gore closer to majorities by
which the national conventions will ratify the primaries that were
settled in only six weeks, when both men won overwhelmingly in the
16 contests of Super Tuesday. Gore swept, Bush won all but four GOP
contests, and both races were over.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were evenly matched in a CNN-Time poll released
Friday, Gore with the backing of 48 percent of registered voters
and Bush with 46 percent. The poll, taken after Tuesday's results,
also showed the two candidates closely matched on public perception
of their strengths as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls from Colorado and Utah showed voters mostly satisfied
with a Bush-Gore matchup in November. Fewer than one-fifth said
they would consider a third-party candidate. Voters were surveyed
as they left the polling places by Voter News Service, a consortium
of The Associated Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   In both states, conservatives made up two-thirds of the
Republican primary electorate -- a bigger share than in any other
GOP contest with exit polls this year except the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll showed Bush stronger on a question that had nagged
in the earlier primary states, with four out of five Colorado and
Utah voters saying he knows enough to serve effectively as
president. There was more skepticism among people who called
themselves independents, the bloc that had boosted McCain. About 30
percent expressed doubts on Bush's ability.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the delegates, the rest of the primary schedule
offers something of a framework for the national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was on the road all weekend, in New York,
Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston, Miami and Orlando, winding up at
home in Tennessee, one of next Tuesday's primary states. It is the
kind of road trip that usually waits until fall, but there was no
waiting in the 2000 campaign, with the party contests over early.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a break at home in Austin before beginning a two-day
swing through the Southern states that vote next week. The biggest
of them are his own Texas, and Florida, where his brother Jeb is
governor. Both will be crucial to the Republican ticket in the Nov.
7 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   There are primaries to come in other major states that will be
keys to the general election, among them Illinois on March 21,
Pennsylvania on April 4 and New Jersey on June 6, the last day of
primary voting.

<HEADLINE> Congressional resolution condemns Sharpton  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling the Rev. Al Sharpton a promoter of
racial hatred and bigotry, a conservative Florida congressman
introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives to condemn
the flamboyant preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Scarborough also called on Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore to denounce Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore is an Al Sharpton Democrat and Al Gore's Democratic
Party is the party of Al Sharpton,'' Scarborough said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that the Democrats' presidential candidate and other
leaders of the Democratic Party continue to embrace the most
mean-spirited, racist extremes of their party is disturbing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican's attack came as Rudolph Giuliani's
advisers also talked up Sharpton's relationship with Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is running against Clinton for the U.S. Senate seat
being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Republican county chairmen, the mayor's campaign
spokesman, Bruce Teitlebaum, wrote that Sharpton ''has become an
important ally to Democrats ... who view him as the road to elected
office here in New York.'' The letter, which was first reported on
in the Daily News, suggested the first lady had ''read aloud from
the Al Sharpton playbook'' in her critique of the Amadou Diallo
case.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton on Friday called Scarborough's charges untrue and said
he wore the attacks as a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did this to Jesse Jackson 10 years ago and now they're
after me,'' Sharpton said in a telephone interview. ''This is
nothing more than a cheap Republican attack by some obscure
congressman I've never even met.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp did not return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   While mainstream politicians once kept their distance from
Sharpton, many Democrats trolling for votes in New York City's
black community now actively court him.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has toned down in recent years, swapping his trademark
jogging suits and gold chains for coats and ties, and distancing
himself from his controversial past.
</P>
<P>
   Gore met privately with the reverend in February, and the first
lady met with him on Martin Luther King Day. Sharpton has not
endorsed either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The fire-and-brimstone preacher grabbed the media spotlight in
the 1980s when he aggressively trumpeted Tawana Brawley's charges
of rape by a white gang -- and named a Dutchess County prosecutor as
one of her alleged attackers. A grand jury found the charge without
merit and Sharpton was later ordered to pay the prosecutor -- Steven
Pagones -- $65,000 for wrongly naming him.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton was also accused of anti-Semitism when he organized a
boycott of a discount clothing store in Harlem, taking the side of
a black tenant against a Jewish landlord. A protester later set the
store afire.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sharpton made a surprisingly good showing in the 1997
mayoral primary, forcing a run off with Ruth Messinger. He also
gained a measure of respect for his role in organizing
demonstrations last year against the New York City Police
Department after four officers gunned down Diallo.

Gore, Bush Take Colorado, Utah
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won uncontested
victories in the Colorado and Utah presidential primaries, but their attention
is clearly focused on the general election eight months away, rather than the
remaining two dozen state contests. Friday's two primaries and GOP county
conventions, plus a straw poll in Wyoming, were elements of a failed effort to
set a common voting date for nine Rocky Mountain and Western states and give
them a bigger say in the nomination process. Democratic caucases were being held
Saturday in Michigan and Minnesota.

   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Defense lawyers for Pakistan's deposed premier said
Saturday they want their client's hijacking trial moved out of the southern city
of Karachi, a day after one of their colleagues in the case was gunned down in
his office. Iqbal Raad, a key lawyer for former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was
to be buried Saturday near his home in one of Karachi's wealthiest
neighborhoods. Paramilitary Rangers and heavily armed police were deployed to

   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- A storm system moving across the South on Friday
spawned thunderstorms in North Texas and at least two tornadoes in Alabama. At
least three people were killed in traffic accidents in Texas, while a woman in
Alabama was killed by debris. Winds up to 70 mph caused damage estimated in the
millions of dollars at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. There was no
dollar estimate on the damage, but it could run into the tens of millions, said
Sandra Ray, public relations director of the Southwestern Insurance Information.

Energy Panel: Oil Reserve Dwindling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The world's richest countries have depleted their oil
inventories to the lowest levels seen in four years, a widely read survey said
Friday, reinforcing concerns that motorists will soon be paying even stiffer
prices to fill their tanks. Pinched profit margins for oil refineries have
caused a slowdown in the production of gasoline and other products, and this
delay could lead to gas shortages during the peak driving season this summer,
the International Energy Agency reported. World output of oil increased in
February by a slight 0.3 percent to 75 million barrels per day.

involving the increasingly controversial drug comes as an FDA physician asked

Sri Lanka Bomb Explosion Kills 20

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomber blew himself up, killing at least 20
other people and wounding 64 on a busy street in Sri Lanka's capital Friday, but
apparently missed his target -- a motorcade of Cabinet ministers. Authorities
said three separatist rebels, believed accomplices in the bombing, killed
themselves Saturday after hundreds of police and anti-terrorist commandos
surrounded the apartment building they were hiding in. The Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam are the principal suspects in most explosions in Sri Lanka. The
guerrilla group has been fighting for 17 years for a separate homeland for the
country's 3.3 million Tamils, a minority of Sri Lanka's 18.6-million. The
conflict has claimed 61,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Fireman Confesses to Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A firefighter has confessed to killing his
new bride, setting her home on fire and fatally shooting two
colleagues and a sheriff's deputy called to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrick Williams, 41, was charged Friday with murder, attempted
murder and arson. He was under guard at a hospital, where he was in
stable condition from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a statement of admission from Fredrick Williams that
he committed these acts of his own hand,'' Police Director Walter
Crews said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Crews wouldn't comment on the motive for Wednesday's spree, but
detailed the sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   He said it began when Williams' wife of three weeks, Stacey
Williams, arrived home from her letter carrier job and was killed
in the kitchen with a 12-gauge shotgun. Williams then set fire to a
back bedroom, Crews said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes later, Deputy Rupert Peete, who was on his way
to a theft call, was flagged down by a passer-by reporting a fire
and an armed man. Williams allegedly came out of the house and
fired a shot through Peete's windshield, hitting the deputy in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Gatewood, the passerby, was shot in the face and
suffered non-life threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, the first fire truck arrived. The firemen
apparently could not see Peete's wrecked squad car and did not know
he had been shot.

<HEADLINE> Spain's First Lady Joins Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By MAR ROMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- If Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar holds
onto his job in national elections Sunday, he will return to
Moncloa Palace with something rare in Spanish politics: a
politically active first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Ana Botella has always balanced her roles as mother, gracious
host and active partner in her husband's career.
</P>
<P>
   She may not be a Hillary Rodham Clinton or Eva Peron, but
Botella has blossomed into a major element of the campaign,
especially boosting Aznar's efforts to win support from women.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prime minister's campaign promises is to find work
for the avalanche of women who have entered the job market in
recent years. While taking credit for greatly reducing
unemployment, Aznar acknowledges that too many of the 15 percent
jobless are women.
</P>
<P>
   Botella has been a member of the Popular Party for 19 years --
longer than her husband -- but was not tempted in the past by
politics or public office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Campaigning is not only for leaders, it's also a task for
those who believe in an idea,'' a self-assured and perpetually
smiling Botella said as she flew back to Madrid after a campaign
stop in the northeastern region of Catalonia -- traditionally
hostile territory for the Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   That day she had addressed businesswomen in Girona, detailing
Aznar's economic accomplishments and listing his goals for a second
term -- especially in strengthening women's role in Spanish society.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women play an important role in our success as a nation.
Especially women like you who start their own business'' she told
them, her voice rising forcefully while reading, slightly
stiltedly, from a prepared script.
</P>
<P>
   The women, residents of the only province where the Popular
Party does not have a single deputy, applauded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's so intelligent, she's a great help to our prime minister
and she has great charisma as first lady ... and besides, she's so
cute,'' said Paquita Masquet, a hotel owner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her predecessors in Moncloa Palace, Botella has not shied
away from the limelight since Aznar won elections in 1996 and ended
14 years of Socialist governments headed by Felipe Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from accompanying her husband on campaign swings and
foreign visits, she frequently travels around Spain, addressing
conferences, talking to social and business leaders and always
promising to take complaints to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've loved this opportunity to meet people and see great
things happening all over the country,'' she said. ''It's a real
responsibility to live with a person who takes decisions that
affect a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Botella, 46, the eldest daughter of 13 children, attended a
Roman Catholic school until she was 18, when she went to college to
study law at the same Madrid school as Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   Botella said she was attracted by Aznar's intelligence, sense of
humor and self-confidence. They have three children: Jose Maria,
21, Ana, 18 and Alonso, 11.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband led the opposition, Botella held jobs in the
civil service and as a commentator on a private TV channel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was she who pestered Aznar into joining the Popular
Party,'' said party member Rafael Luna.
</P>
<P>
   Botella grants few interviews and prefers talking about her
husband's hobbies, such as skiing, and the Aznar household. She
tends to brush aside questions about controversial Spanish or
international issues.
</P>
<P>
   With a thriving economy in his favor, Aznar is leading the
opposition Socialist Party of Joaquin Almunia in opinion polls and
is expected to win, although without a majority.
</P>
<P>
   And if Aznar is defeated?
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't be a big upset if we don't win,'' Botella said.
''Personal happiness does not depend on the results of a general
election.''

<HEADLINE> Aznar Call For Consistency in Spain  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- In the last hours of Spain's election
campaign, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar took the offensive
against leftists and touted the economic improvements made since he
took office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conserve our gains and don't return to the past, to the
politics of resignation,'' Aznar said at a rally before the
campaign for Sunday's election ended at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't put at risk what we've achieved. Four years ago there
was uncertainty (and) there's still much more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the country's two main opposition parties, meanwhile,
made a plea to leftist voters to help oust Aznar and his
center-right Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''No leftist vote should be left at home on March 12,'' said
United Left communist leader Francisco Frutos.
</P>
<P>
   ''No abstention should allow the right, which is in a minority,
to be re-elected to government,'' said Joaquin Almunia, the head of
Spain's main opposition Socialist party.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists and United Left ended years of animosity last
month by signing a mutual support deal to try to avert the
re-election of the Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion polls indicate the Popular Party could increase
its current 156 seats in the 350-seat lower house of Parliament.
The surveys also indicate little change for the Socialists, who
have 141, and the United Left, which has 21.
</P>
<P>
   If no party wins an absolute majority, King Juan Carlos will
call on the one that garners the most seats to try to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's 1996 victory ended nearly 14 years of Socialist rule.
But falling short of a majority, his party has had to govern in
alliance with regional nationalist parties.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Chief, Cohen Disagree  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- The conversion of Hong Kong to a largely
autonomous enclave of mainland China should be a model for
negotiating the return of Taiwan to Beijing's communist control, a
senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
   That view directly conflicts with statements by Defense
Secretary William Cohen upon his arrival here Friday. Cohen said
Hong Kong is a special case and not a model for resolving the
Taiwan problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lam, spokesman for Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung
Chee-hwa, told reporters that Hong Kong residents have ''the best
of both worlds'' by enjoying full economic and political freedoms
while leaving to Beijing the responsibilities for Hong Kong's
defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to spend a large slice of our government's
budget on running a huge foreign service,'' Lam said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement worked out between Britain and China for
the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in July 1997, the
relationship was defined as ''one country, two systems.'' Questions
remain, however, how long Hong Kong will retain all its freedoms
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Lam described the relationship with Beijing in glowing terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this will be a model for our compatriots in Taiwan,''
he told reporters while Tung was meeting with Cohen. Afterward,
Tung said he and Cohen had not discussed the matter of Hong Kong as
a model for Taiwan. Neither he nor Cohen commented on the substance
of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cohen said the Clinton administration does not see
Hong Kong as a model for Taiwan, which has been separate from the
mainland since the Chinese communist revolution in 1949. China
views Taiwan as a renegade province and insists that it negotiate a
return to Beijing's control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hong Kong is a unique situation,'' Cohen said. ''I think the
way in which Hong Kong has functioned under its relationship with
China -- the 'one China, two systems' -- is unique to it, and I don't
think it could be used as any kind of model for any other
country,'' he said when asked how Taiwan might be reunited with
China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has pursued a series of high-level visits to
Hong Kong to underscore its determination to help Hong Kong remain
as free and open as before the July 1997 reversion to Chinese rule.
The 1984 agreement, under which the colony reverted to Chinese
rule, pledged it would retain many of its pre-turnover laws and
social rules.
</P>
<P>
   As a special administrative region, Hong Kong has a high degree
of autonomy from China in all matters except foreign and defense
affairs. That means, for example, that U.S. Navy ship visits to
Hong Kong, routine before 1997, are now decided case-by-case in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   After a U.S. bomber attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
last May by mistake, China halted all military contacts with
Washington -- including port calls to Hong Kong. Ship visits resumed
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said Hong Kong welcomes U.S. ship visits for the tourist
trade they bring, but he declined to comment on the degree to which
a U.S. military presence in the region helps maintain political
stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hong Kong understands and supports the position taken by
Beijing'' in halting port calls last May, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the weekend in Hong Kong, Cohen is scheduled to
travel Monday to Vietnam, becoming the first American secretary of
defense to visit since the Vietnam War ended in April 1975. He will
be there amid a series of national celebrations over the
communists' defeat of U.S.-backed South Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> New York City would lose billions in census undercount  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 2000 Census could take a big bite out of
the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   New York City stands to lose $2.3 billion in federal aid over
the coming decade if this year's Census undercounts the population
as it did in 1990, a study by a Census oversight panel found. That
loss would be more than any other metropolitan area in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, composed of political appointees charged with
monitoring the Census Bureau's work, also said other urban centers
in New York state could benefit despite the city's financial loss.
Cities outside the five boroughs would receive an additional $2.1
billion over 10 years. Money would shift from larger cities to
smaller urban centers that tend to have a smaller concentration of
groups more likely to be undercounted, like minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the
presidential appointees of the U.S. Census Monitoring Board,
studied how federal funding would be affected if the Census fails
to make a more accurate head count that it has in the past. It also
considered the financial ramifications of using a statistical
method known as sampling to account for people who have
historically been missed by the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling takes a small amount of data and extrapolates it out to
account for people missed by the Census.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates it failed to survey 1.4 percent of
U.S. residents in 1990, and officials with the bureau favor using
sampling to account for them this time. The people overlooked are
mostly children, minorities and urbanites.
</P>
<P>
   Because minorities and city residents are more likely to vote
for Democrats, that political party tends to favor sampling. Most
Republicans -- with the notable exception of New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani -- favor using a strict head count, claiming it is most
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is serious business,'' Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-Manhattan,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study about the Census impact on federal funding projected
this year's Census will undercount 1.75 percent of the population.
The Census Bureau itself has predicted an undercount of 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 U.S. Supreme Court decision barred statistical sampling
from being used in reapportioning congressional seats, but left
open the possibility of using it to redistribute federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, the following metropolitan areas in New
York state would receive more federal funding if New York City's
population is undercounted:
</P>
<P>
   --Albany-Schenectady-Troy, $200 million more, or 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Binghamton, $44 million, or 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Buffalo-Niagara Falls, $297 million, or 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Dutchess County, $37 million, or 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Elmira, $18 million, or 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Glens Falls, $23 million, or 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Jamestown, $21 million, or 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Nassau-Suffolk, $1 billion, or 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Newburgh, $34 million, or 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Rochester, $208 million or 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Syracuse, $155 million, or 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Utica, $47 million, or 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes Pension Law Changes  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Congress explores ways to overhaul the
nation's pension law, consumer groups and unions are urging caution
before easing restrictions that prevent employers and mutual fund
companies from giving advice.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, speaking Friday before a House Education and
Workforce Committee panel, said easing the law would allow them to
improve the way they advise the nation's workers, 55 million of
whom have invested in defined contribution retirement plans. The
largest portion of these investments are in 401 (k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   Unions and consumer groups, however, have expressed concern that
if Congress changes the Employee Retirement Income Security Act as
planned, workers may fall victim to ''conflicts of interest'' by
firms promoting products.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think that employers are the right people to be
offering investment advice,'' said John Hotz, deputy director of
the consumer advocacy group Pension Rights Center.
</P>
<P>
   Current law does not prevent employers from offering employees
investment education, but they could be held liable if the
education could also be construed as advice.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates worry that relaxing the restrictions would be the
first step in allowing employers to hire big mutual fund companies,
which often provide a range of the investment choices in workers'
401 (k) plans, to also advise workers on how to invest their money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned about workers receiving investment advice
that is not objective,'' said Damon Silvers, associate general
counsel of the AFL-CIO, adding that ''the growing concentration of
financial services in a few firms creates more opportunities for
pension fund clients of these firms to fall victim to conflicts of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Raymond, assistant general counsel to Fidelity
Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, told
lawmakers that pension plan ''participants who want investment
advice have been disserved by this prohibition, because the service
providers they trust -- like mutual fund companies and other
investment professionals -- are unable to provide what participants
need and want.''
</P>
<P>
   W. Allen Reed, chairman of the Committee on Investment of
Employee Benefit Assets, said ''there's more demand for investment
guidance with the dramatic growth in the 1990s of defined
contribution plans such as 401 (k) plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Daniel P. O'Connell, chairman of ERIC, an organization
that represents employer interests, ''Employees would benefit from
expert assistance that reflected their personal circumstances, and
employers would be protected from the threat of unnecessary and
inappropriate litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ERISA was passed in 1974 to protect pension plan participants
after some high-profile plans failed. Most notably, Studebaker,
known for bringing America several popular cars, closed in the
1960s, leaving many employees with no pensions.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few changes to the law since, and Democratic and
Republican lawmakers are looking at a number of reforms to
streamline and strengthen the law overall.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Rep. John Boehner, the Republican who chairs the Workforce
Committee's employer-employee relations subcommittee, which held
Friday's hearing, agreed that many workers want specific advice on
stocks and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can pay for this themselves, of course, if they can
afford it. But if employers want to make high-quality investment
advice available to workers, and the law says they can't, then
there's a problem with the law,'' Boehner said. ''A law that now
prevents workers from receiving adequate investment education and
advice is not protecting workers.''

<HEADLINE> Diversity Data Guidelines Released  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing diversity of the American
population is prompting the Clinton administration to release new
guidelines for federal agencies as the Census Bureau prepares to
mail out forms offering people a chance to say if they are of more
than one race.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, issued Friday by the Office of Management and
Budget, allow for more specific racial combinations to be counted
when results from the 2000 census are released, changing the way
demographic data about the country is kept.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, this year's census forms allow respondents
to mark one or more of 14 boxes representing six races and
subcategories or ''some other race.'' For instance, in the last
census, someone who was of both black and white ancestry could only
check off only one choice.
</P>
<P>
   In all, as many as 63 racial combinations are possible, and the
Census Bureau will release data for each of those categories, said
Nancy Gordon, the agency's associate director for demographic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also revise the way statistics are kept for
purposes of civil rights monitoring and enforcement, said Sally
Katzen, counselor to the OMB director.
</P>
<P>
   For that purpose, OMB added new multi-race categories in
addition to the standard single-race categories of American Indian
or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian
or Other Pacific Islander, and White.
</P>
<P>
   The new multi-race categories for purposes of civil rights
monitoring and enforcement are: American Indian or Alaska Native
and White; Asian and White; Black or African American and White;
American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American.
</P>
<P>
   ''We anticipate that most of the people who check off more than
one race will check off one of these categories,'' Katzen said when
asked why those specific combinations were selected.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also provide for the collection of information on
any multiple race combinations that comprise more than 1 percent of
the population of interest, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   If an individual who is white and of one minority race is
involved in a civil rights enforcement case, that individual will
be allocated to the minority race. A person of two or more minority
races and involved in an enforcement case would be allocated to the
race that is allegedly discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if a person of two or more minority races is involved
in a civil rights case based on a pattern of discrimination, the
enforcement agency ''will conduct a thorough analysis of effects on
each minority group alleged to be affected by the pattern of
discrimination,'' an OMB statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to speculate on how the new groupings will
affect civil and voting rights enforcement until data from the 2000
census is released next year, said Anita Hodgkiss, deputy assistant
attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the guidelines allow people to be counted once. ''No
individual is counted twice, nor is any individual counted as a
fraction,'' Katzen said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration estimated about 2 percent of the population
would check off that they are of more than one race.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Chided on Peru Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department was ready to arrest a
visiting Peruvian official on allegations of torture carried out in
his homeland, but the man was let go because he was protected by
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to detain Tomas Ricardo Anderson Kohatsu, a
major in Peru's intelligence service, caused an outcry Friday among
human rights groups, which cited ''overwhelming evidence'' that
Anderson was a torturer.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department did not dispute the torture allegation but
informed the Justice Department that diplomatic immunity precluded
legal action against Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Tense moments and a flurry of phone calls, however, preceded
Anderson's liberation Thursday night at a Houston airport where he
was interrogated by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest had been sought by human rights organizations based
on an international convention against torture. Five such groups,
including the Center for Justice and International Law, or CEJIL,
criticized the State Department for interceding on Anderson's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who reportedly intended to return to Peru on Friday
night via Mexico, had come to the United States to testify at a
hearing of the Organization of American States' Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights in Washington. Details of the hearing
were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overwhelming evidence implicates Anderson in the torture of
Leonor La Rosa Bustamante, also a former intelligence officer, who
was left paraplegic as a result of the torture,'' CEJIL said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   An international torture convention permits the prosecution of
torturers regardless of national boundaries. It was under
provisions of that convention that former Chilean President Augusto
Pinochet was arrested in London in October 1998 at the request of a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile last week on grounds he
was too ill to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the difference between the Pinochet and
Anderson cases was that Anderson was part of a ''diplomatic
mission'' to the OAS. In contrast, Pinochet's visit to London 17
months ago was not officially sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   The torture episode in Peru is linked to the case of Israeli
native Baruch Ivcher, who was stripped of his Peruvian citizenship
after his television station revealed torture by Army intelligence
service officers and the wiretapping of journalists, government
officials and opposition politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have approved
resolutions criticizing Peru for its actions in the Ivcher case and
other alleged examples of government repression.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's annual human rights report said Anderson
was linked to ''horrendous crimes.'' It is the department's
official policy to ''condemn torture no matter where it may
occur.''

<HEADLINE> H.S. Hoopster's Jail Term Remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A former high school basketball player will
continue serving a five-year jail sentence for breaking an
opponent's nose during a game.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark Luitjen has declined to reduce 18-year-old Tony
Limon's sentence. The judge had until Friday -- 30 days after
punishment was imposed -- to modify the decision, but he took no
action, a court spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Limon's attorneys had not expected Luitjen to change his mind.
They plan to apply later for ''shock probation'' requiring Limon to
serve up to six months behind bars followed by probation.
</P>
<P>
   An aggravated assault charge was filed against Limon after he
hit another player in a January 1999 basketball game between South
San Antonio High School and East Central High School.
</P>
<P>
   Videotape footage shows Limon hitting East Central's Brent
Holmes in the head with his forearm, knocking him down. Holmes
suffered cuts, a broken nose, a concussion and required surgery on
his nose.
</P>
<P>
   School officials suspended Limon for the rest of the season, but
he graduated last spring and was voted most popular in his senior
class.
</P>
<P>
   Limon, who was indicted by a Bexar County grand jury, had
expected to be put on probation after agreeing to plead no contest.
But Luitjen gave Limon five years behind bars because the teen
already was on probation for attempted burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Limon, who is now in the Bexar County Jail, said his coach, Gary
Durbon, encouraged the aggressive play. Durbon denies it.

Hong Kong Chief, Cohen Disagree on Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- The conversion of Hong Kong to a largely autonomous enclave
of mainland China should be a model for negotiating the return of Taiwan to
Beijing's communist control, a senior government official said Saturday. That
view directly conflicts with statements by Defense Secretary William Cohen upon
his arrival here Friday. Cohen said Hong Kong is a special case and not a model
for resolving the Taiwan problem. Under the arrangement worked out between
Britain and China for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in July 1997, the
relationship was defined as ''one country, two systems.'' Questions remain,
however, how long Hong Kong will retain all its freedoms and prosperity.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., IBM and AT&AMP;T have promised $101 million in
cash and equipment to 39 black schools, kicking off a United Negro College Fund
drive to close the so-called ''digital divide'' that separates minorities from
the high-tech economy. The UNCF announced the $130 million fund raising effort
on Friday and said it hopes to find another $29 million in contributions.
Microsoft plans to give $50 million in software and training material. IBM will
offer schools, professors and students discounts of up to 50 percent on personal
computers and networking hardware -- a gift valued at $50 million, the UNCF
said. AT&AMP;T is contributing $1 million to the campaign.

   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won uncontested
victories in the Colorado and Utah presidential primaries, but their attention
is clearly focused on the general election eight months away, rather than the
remaining two dozen state contests. Friday's two primaries and GOP county

set a common voting date for nine Rocky Mountain and Western states and give
them a bigger say in the nomination process. Democratic caucases were being held

Energy Panel: Oil Reserve Dwindling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The world's richest countries have depleted their oil
inventories to the lowest levels seen in four years, a widely read survey said
Friday, reinforcing concerns that motorists will soon be paying even stiffer
prices to fill their tanks. Pinched profit margins for oil refineries have
caused a slowdown in the production of gasoline and other products, and this
delay could lead to gas shortages during the peak driving season this summer,
the International Energy Agency reported. World output of oil increased in
February by a slight 0.3 percent to 75 million barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Porn actress will be referred to only as a dancer andactress  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors say it is ''highly relevant --
indeed, crucial'' to tell a federal jury that a Wall Street
executive had a sexual relationship with an X-rated movie star
before giving her inside information.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood disagreed at a court hearing
in Manhattan on Friday, saying she probably will limit information
about Kathryn Gannon, allowing prosecutors to refer to her only as
a dancer and actress.
</P>
<P>
   She told prosecutors and lawyers for the executive, James
McDermott Jr., that it was possible for prosecutors to show there
was a sexual affair between Gannon and McDermott without revealing
Gannon's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors protested, saying in a letter to the judge that
evidence of Gannon's occupation is ''highly relevant -- indeed,
crucial -- to the government's case.''
</P>
<P>
   They contend that her job ''raises the strong inference that
McDermott paid her for sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Pomponio, Gannon and McDermott, the former chief
executive officer of Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, are charged with
conspiracy and securities fraud. Prosecutors allege the trio made
more than $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to the judge, prosecutors said they wanted to
tell the jury McDermott had an illicit sexual relationship with
Gannon and then gave her inside information about companies,
causing her to open a brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   ''Virtually immediately thereafter,'' prosecutors said, ''she
began trading almost exclusively in the stocks of obscure, regional
commercial banks,'' including numerous clients of McDermott's
company.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon fled the United States and remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Her intimate relationship with McDermott, prosecutors said, was
the ''principal motive'' for his crime.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys said they would prove the relationship with
testimony that McDermott told two witnesses he and Gannon were
having an affair. Other evidence includes records of numerous calls
from McDermott to Gannon and bank records detailing substantial
payments from the executive to Gannon, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon's ''status as an adult film actress may fairly lead the
jury to conclude that McDermott felt the need to impress her by
providing inside stock tips as a means of demonstrating his
influence within the world of finance,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who herself trained briefly as a Playboy Club bunny
in the 1960s, said she worried that some jurors might hear Gannon's
profession and think the defendants were ''sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors wrote that they realized Gannon's occupation is
''potentially distracting and inflammatory'' and that they planned
to avoid sensationalizing it. They said they would refer to Gannon
only as ''an exotic dancer and actress who appeared in adult films
under the screen name 'Marylin Star.'''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would withhold the titles of her films.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you get to the titles of the movies, it gets graphic very
fast,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney James J. Benjamin Jr.
</P>
<P>
   He also said prosecutors didn't intend to disclose to the jury
the existence or content of Gannon's adult Web site, and would
limit photographs to the kind found on a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said she planned to make formal rulings on pre-trial issues
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said she was inclined to allow lawyers to ask
prospective jurors if they had any strong personal reactions to
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, and Pomponio, 45, of North
Caldwell, N.J., remain free on bail. Gannon, 30, has lived most
recently in Miami, Fla., before returning to her Canadian home.
Prosecutors are seeking her extradition from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Both McDermott and Pomponio have pleaded innocent.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Gore, Bush Very Close  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When they finally emerged from the campaign's
decisive week in the primary season, Al Gore and George W. Bush
were almost even in national polls, including in the public's
perception of their skills as political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two dispatched their chief rivals for their parties'
nominations in Tuesday's cluster of primaries and quickly turned
their attention toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democrat, and Bush, the Republican, were tied in a
CNN-Time poll released Friday, Gore with 48 percent and Bush with
46 percent, a difference within the poll's 3 percentage point
margin of error. They also were tied in an NBC-Wall Street Journal
poll.
</P>
<P>
   When registered voters were asked about the abilities of the two
candidates, they were evenly matched in several categories:
</P>
<P>
   --Just over half of voters thought both were honest and
trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   --About half thought each had new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   --About half said each candidate agrees with the issues they care
about.
</P>
<P>
   --Fewer than half saw Gore and Bush as people they admired.
</P>
<P>
   --Just over a third saw each as a real reformer.
</P>
<P>
   More in the CNN-Time poll saw Gore as a candidate who has the
necessary knowledge and understanding to be president, by a 71
percent to 63 percent margin. More saw Bush as a strong and
decisive leader, by 56 percent to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBC-Journal poll, the candidates matched on having good
ideas and being trustworthy. On the question of who has the right
experience and ability, Gore had a 17-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led Gore by double digits in a CNN-Time poll in mid-January
and in an NBC-Journal poll in December. But their standing in most
national polls leveled off as Bush and John McCain fought their way
through a series of contentious GOP primaries and Gore moved easily
past Bill Bradley to claim the Democratic spot.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN-Time poll of 1,229 registered voters was taken Wednesday
and Thursday and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points. The NBC-Journal poll of 621 registered voters was taken
Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> High Oil Prices May Hurt US Economy  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Rising oil prices may have left their mark at
the gas pump and on airline ticket prices, but their climb has yet
to ripple through the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts say, if oil prices stay high for months, the
impact could grow as consumers pay more for basic goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money spent filling up at the gas tank is money you can't
spend at the mall,'' said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard
&AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. ''We'll start to see that later
this year. It takes people a little while to adjust their habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Word this week from Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. that its profits are
suffering due partly to increased prices of raw materials is a good
gauge that the rise's impact is widening.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of well-known consumer brands such as Crest
toothpaste, Pampers diapers and Tide detergent said Tuesday it will
earn less than expected in the next quarter -- in part because
prices are rising for the petroleum-based materials it needs for
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street punished the company harshly, causing its stock to
fall from $87.43} on Monday to $53.37{ late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumer products companies such as Colgate-Palmolive Co.
and Kimberly-Clark Corp. also saw their stocks suffer, although
those firms took pains to tell investors their profit picture
hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   These companies use petrochemical-based products a number of
ways, from their plastic bottles to their detergents. They must
also pay higher prices for fuel for the trucks that deliver their
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high gas prices, the auto industry has yet to suffer.
Sales of light trucks increased by more than 10 percent from
January to February, for instance. Still, there are some signs of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Higher fuel costs for transporting products prompted Ford Motor
Co. on Monday to raise delivery charges for vehicles by $25.
General Motors Corp. is considering raising its destination charge
for shipment of products.
</P>
<P>
   Shipper FedEx Corp. said last week it would increase the 3
percent surcharge it began last month to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Continental Airlines attempted to impose a new
fare increase of up to $40 per round trip, blaming the rising cost
of fuel. The airline led the industry in a $20 boost in January,
but had to back off on a second increase of $30 two weeks ago after
other airlines wouldn't follow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, economists say, oil prices haven't spurred significantly
higher overall inflation because the country is now less
oil-dependent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.S. oil bill was about 6.5 percent of the gross
domestic product. Today, it is about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because of conservation and also because
inflation-adjusted oil prices have increased slower than other
consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, P&AMP;G's chairman Durk Jager spent the better part of
the week reassuring major investors that the company will keep on
its long-term program of increasing sales and getting new products
to market faster.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stock will ultimately come back. We hope it will be pretty
quickly, to restore investors' confidence,'' Jager said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And demand won't slacken, said company spokeswoman Linda Ulrey.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are still going to need diapers and toothpaste and
toilet paper,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bike Week Death Toll in Fla. Hits 12  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) --The freewheeling atmosphere of 500,000
motorcyclists rumbling around this tourist mecca each March for
drinking, coleslaw wrestling and wet T-shirt contests has been
dented by the deadliest Bike Week on record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been here for 41 years and it's the worst I've seen it,''
said Imogene Williams, an employee at the Iron Horse Saloon, a
popular biker watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of two motorcylists in a head-on collision Friday
brought the death toll for the bikers' rite of spring to 12, one up
from the record set in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Highway Patrol has been tracking Bike Week
fatalities since 1989. Capt. Bill Sanders blamed the increase in
accidents on the growing number of motorcyclists who attend the
event combined with more novice bikers -- plus drinking. Truckloads
of beer are consumed in a festival that has expanded from a long
weekend to a 10-day event.
</P>
<P>
   ''With motorcyclists, alcohol is always a factor,'' Sanders
said.
</P>
<P>
   The festival ends Sunday with a traditional biker parade down
Main Street. With the busiest two days left, police said they will
be out in force to try to slow bikers down.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a motorcyclist swerved to avoid a dead bird and
collided with another biker. Both were killed. On Wednesday, three
people were killed, including a firefighter who was thrown from a
motorcycle and run over by a car.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy. Even one death is unacceptable,'' said Kevin
Kilian, vice president of special events for the Daytona Beach
Chamber of Commerce. ''When you get 500,000 people in town, bad
things can happen. We don't have a crystal ball on how we are going
to fix it.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Police Let Bank Robber Die  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police who allowed a bank robber to bleed to
death after a wild bank robbery shootout got away with murder, an
attorney told a federal court jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't let them get away with that. Their conduct was
atrocious,'' attorney Stephen Yagman said in closing arguments
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Yagman represents the family of Emil Matasareanu, 30, who died
after being wounded in the 1997 shootout following a North
Hollywood bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have sued the city and retired policemen John Futrell
and James Vojtecky, claiming that Matasareanu was denied medical
treatment in violation of his civil rights. The lawsuit seeks
unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is scheduled to begin deliberations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the defense hammered away at what they said was the
robbers' responsibility for the violent attack.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven officers and six civilians were wounded as Matasareanu,
30, and Larry Eugene Phillips Jr., 26, both wearing body armor,
tried to get away by firing automatic weapons at police. The
shootout lasted nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips died when he shot himself and was hit by police gunfire
at the same time. Matasareanu was brought down in a firefight in
the street where he eventually died.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the worst bank robbery in the history of the world
and that changes everything,'' said Brad Gage, attorney for
Futrell. ''We're talking about lunatics who were shooting at anyone
and everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys have argued that the scene was too dangerous
for ambulance crews to enter the area where the gunman lay wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Futrell has testified that the chaos of the scene -- and fears
that other suspects were in the neighborhood -- led him to cancel an
initial ambulance call.

<HEADLINE> 1 Boy Killed After Ga. School Dance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- A teen-age boy was shot to death and two
others were wounded outside a high school late Friday as hundreds
of students left a dance honoring the girls' basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made early Saturday, and investigators had
not determined a motive for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The two injured students, whose ages and identities were not
released, suffered gunshot wounds to the head and body, Savannah
police spokesman Bucky Burnsed said. One was in critical condition
and the other was treated at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings happened near Beach High School, where a dance was
held to celebrate the Lady Bulldogs' state championship victory
March 3. About 300 students were leaving the gymnasium about 11
p.m. when gunfire erupted, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody knows at this point how it got started,'' said Robert
Gilbert, associate superintendent of Savannah-Chatham County Public
Schools. ''It did not happen on the campus ... it happened across
the street, not on school property.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims attended Beach High School, and the other two
attended Savannah High School, Gilbert said. The two schools are in
the same district.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad situation,'' Daisy Richards, a grandmother of two
Beach High School seniors, said as she and other parents stood
outside the school after the shooting. ''These kids have just as
much a right to celebrate their victory as anyone else. Why, why,
why, don't they get these guns away?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials planned to dispatch counselors to both schools Monday
to help students cope with the shooting, Gilbert said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Ventura To Talk Finance Reform  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BAKST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) -- Trying to grab independent-minded
voters that rallied behind Republican John McCain, Vice President
Al Gore deepened his call for campaign finance changes and again
challenged George W. Bush to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, told a rally in a VFW
hall Friday night that he wants to take the presidential race
''straight to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged Bush, the expected GOP nominee, to get rid of negative
advertising and join him in frequent debates and open meetings with
undecided voters, ''instead of having the special interests
determine these races.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's make this a contest of ideas and not insults,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the theme, Gore scheduled a breakfast meeting this
morning with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura to talk about campaign
finance reform, a Gore spokesman said. Ventura, who left the Reform
Party last month, has been a loud proponent of campaign finance
changes.
</P>
<P>
   On his way into the hotel for the breakfast, Ventura was asked
what he expected from the meeting with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   His response: ''food.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who suspended his campaign Thursday, put the campaign
finance issue on the front burner this year. So did Gore's rival
Bill Bradley, who dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore mentioned the issue during the early primaries, but he has
made it even more of a point heading into the general election
campaign. In 1996, he was caught up in Democratic Party
fund-raising scandals during the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the VFW event, Gore emphasized that he was a Vietnam War
veteran before running through a potpourri of issues, from Social
Security to the environment. He drew his loudest applause when he
called for an overhaul of federal farm policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wants to restore the safety net that was removed as
part of a 1996 law, which did away with some Depression-era
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ''That Republican so-called Freedom to Farm bill is a
catastrophe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rally fell on the eve of the state's Democratic caucuses,
and Gore pleaded with party faithful to turn out and support him.
It's not a winner-take-all contest, so delegates will be
distributed in proportion to votes received.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Storms in South  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tornadoes and powerful thunderstorms ripped
a path across the South, killing a woman in Alabama and leading to
at least three traffic deaths in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was killed when a billboard was blown over by near
hurricane-force winds in Tuscaloosa, Ala., about 45 miles west of
Birmingham, said Don Hartley, spokesman for the Tuscaloosa County
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people were without power late Friday, and
there were reports of trees falling on houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm spawned at least two tornadoes near Birmingham, and
high winds, heavy rain and hail were reported across the state and
into Georgia, though no injuries were reported there.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, winds up to 70 mph caused extensive damage at the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old girl died when her car hydroplaned on Texas 155
near Tyler and skidded into an 18-wheeler, the Texas Department of
Public Safety said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people died when a tractor-trailer slid across the
median on Interstate 20 during a rainstorm and collided with
another tanker truck full of fuel, public safety spokesman Tom
Vinger said. Two pickups and a car were also involved in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-rise construction sites and large office buildings
were damaged east of the airport in Irving. At one site, three
people inside an office trailer were injured -- one seriously -- when
winds toppled the structure.
</P>
<P>
   There was no dollar estimate on the damage, but it could run
into the tens of millions, said Sandra Ray, public relations
director of the Southwestern Insurance Information.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away, two plumbers inside another office trailer
were thrown about when winds up to 70 mph ripped through the
parking lot. One worker had minor cuts to his head. The other man
escaped injury, said Jason Nunley, who works for C.D. Henderson,
Inc. of Garland.

<HEADLINE> Dems Vote in Mich., Minn., Ariz.  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won
uncontested victories in the Colorado and Utah presidential
primaries, but their attention is clearly focused on the general
election eight months away, rather than the remaining two dozen
state contests.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's two primaries and GOP county conventions, plus a straw
poll in Wyoming, were elements of a failed effort to set a common
voting date for nine Rocky Mountain and Western states and give
them a bigger say in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it might have been moot since Gore's remaining
opponent, Bill Bradley, and Bush's main Republican challenger, Sen.
John McCain, withdrew from the race after Super Tuesday defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic caucases were being held today in Michigan and
Minnesota. A Democratic primary in Arizona was attracting a bit of
special interest because for the first time, there was the option
of voting over the Internet beginning last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado and Utah, Gore and Bush won predictable landslides,
although McCain and Bradley each stood to gain a handful of
delegates since they were awarded in proportion to the popular
vote.
</P>
<P>
   --With all Colorado precincts reporting, Bush had 65 percent of
the vote, McCain 27 percent and Alan Keyes 7 percent. Bush was
leading for 28 delegates, McCain for 12. Gore won 71 percent of the
Democratic vote to 23 percent for Bradley. Gore led for 44
Democratic delegates to 7 for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   --In Utah, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, Bush polled 63
percent, Keyes 20 percent and McCain 15 percent. Even a distant
second place would be Keyes' best outing of the season. Bush got
all 29 GOP delegates in Utah. For the Democrats, Gore had 81
percent of the vote to Bradley's 19 percent. Gore won 21 delegates
to Bradley's three.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming GOP county conventions did not bind the 22
delegates, but Bush won 19 of them, McCain two and Keyes one.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's primaries, Bush had 701 of the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the nomination. Gore had 1,587; it takes 2,170 to
install the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Western delegates push Bush and Gore closer to majorities by
which the national conventions will ratify the primaries that were
settled in only six weeks, when both men won overwhelmingly in the
16 contests of Super Tuesday. Gore swept, Bush won all but four GOP
contests, and both races were over.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were evenly matched in a CNN-Time poll released
Friday, Gore with the backing of 48 percent of registered voters
and Bush with 46 percent. The poll, taken after Tuesday's results,
also showed the two candidates closely matched on public perception
of their strengths as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls from Colorado and Utah showed voters mostly satisfied
with a Bush-Gore matchup in November. Fewer than one-fifth said
they would consider a third-party candidate. Voters were surveyed
as they left the polling places by Voter News Service, a consortium
of The Associated Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   In both states, conservatives made up two-thirds of the
Republican primary electorate -- a bigger share than in any other
GOP contest with exit polls this year except the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll showed Bush stronger on a question that had nagged
in the earlier primary states, with four out of five Colorado and
Utah voters saying he knows enough to serve effectively as
president. There was more skepticism among people who called
themselves independents, the bloc that had boosted McCain. About 30
percent expressed doubts on Bush's ability.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the delegates, the rest of the primary schedule
offers something of a framework for the national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was on the road all weekend, in New York,
Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston, Miami and Orlando, winding up at
home in Tennessee, one of next Tuesday's primary states. It is the
kind of road trip that usually waits until fall, but there was no
waiting in the 2000 campaign, with the party contests over early.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a break at home in Austin before beginning a two-day
swing through the Southern states that vote next week. The biggest
of them are his own Texas, and Florida, where his brother Jeb is
governor. Both will be crucial to the Republican ticket in the Nov.
7 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   There are primaries to come in other major states that will be
keys to the general election, among them Illinois on March 21,
Pennsylvania on April 4 and New Jersey on June 6, the last day of
primary voting.

<HEADLINE> Deal Struck on 2001 Spending Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican-written $1.8 trillion budget for
next year will bolster Social Security and Medicare, cut taxes and
help schools and the military, an author of the spending plan said
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the goals we should strive to meet if we are sincere
about building a better America,'' House Budget Committee Chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio, said in the GOP's weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., announced Friday they had agreed to the framework for a
fiscal 2001 budget. They hope to push the measure through their
panels later this month, and for Congress to complete it by
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement followed weeks of internal GOP bickering -- which
may not be over -- and seemed to guarantee an election-season
confrontation with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP plans for tax cuts and defense spending
would force cuts in many domestic programs, ensuring an autumn
budget brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're assuming unrealistic cuts in vital services from
health to environment, so they can either have significant tax cuts
or rely once again on end-of-year gimmicks and shell games,'' said
Gene Sperling, a top White House economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spending levels in this budget will lead to a budget train
wreck in September or October,'' said Tom Kahn, Democratic staff
director of the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the framework, spending on many defense and domestic
programs would total $596.5 billion next year, $10.5 billion more
than this year, and boost funds for defense, education and health.
Clinton wants $625 billion, leaving the two sides nearly $30
billion apart.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also envisions $150 billion for tax cuts from 2001
through 2005, and leaves the door open for at least $60 billion
more. Clinton has proposed $99 billion in tax cuts, offset almost
completely by $96 billion in tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said that ''first and foremost,'' the GOP plan would use
Social Security surpluses over the next five years -- estimated by
the Congressional Budget Office at $978 billion -- to reduce the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not one dime of Social Security money will be spent on a
bigger Washington government,'' he said in the radio address.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to continue GOP plans to pay down the entire
$3.6 trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
An additional $1.9 trillion in debt is money the government owes
Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will mean lower interest rates, more money for investment
in a growing economy, and just as important, it will lift the
tremendous burden of debt off the backs of our children,'' Kasich
said. The GOP package would also set aside $20 billion to $40
billion over five years for a Medicare prescription drug benefit or
other changes to the program, plus $5 billion next year for
financially strapped farmers. It would reserve any money for tax
cuts that Clinton vetoes for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and many conservatives initially wanted to limit defense
and domestic programs to $586 billion, the same as this year. But
they agreed to the higher figure after it became clear they lacked
enough support for any less.
</P>
<P>
   The budget blueprint, which does not need Clinton's signature,
provides the broad outlines for tax and spending bills that
lawmakers will write later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But pushing the proposal through the Senate budget panel will
take work, because it has become tangled in Republican presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one of four conservatives on the
Senate committee who want less spending than Domenici prefers, said
he would ''vigorously oppose'' it. Gramm wants to hold spending
down, in part to leave room for the $483 billion tax cut proposed
by the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, however, have decided to keep their tax cuts this
year smaller than Bush's proposal to avoid Democratic accusations
that Republican tax plans would eat into Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans already have pushed separate tax-cut packages
through the House and Senate totaling $126 billion over five years.
They include reductions in taxes on small businesses, tax
incentives for people to save money for education and easing the
so-called marriage penalty that hits many two-earner couples.
</P>
<P>
   The $596.5 billion in spending covers government programs that
Congress approves each year. The remaining $1.2 trillion the
government will spend next year covers automatically expenses such
as Social Security benefits and interest on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Defense would get $306.8 billion next year, $500 million more
than Clinton's request and about $16 billion more than this year's
total.

<HEADLINE> Spoon To Leave Washington Post  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan G. Spoon, president and chief operating
officer of The Washington Post Co., will leave the newspaper next
month, the company announced.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon, 48, was architect of the company's Internet strategies.
He created Post Co. Web sites, www.washingtonpost.com and
www.newsweek.com, as well as partnerships aimed at capturing online
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon's departure, to become a general partner of the capital
venture firm Polaris Ventures in Waltham, Mass., was announced
Friday. Although he steps down from The Washington Post Co. next
month, he will remain as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive, said he will
take over Spoon's responsibilities and will not seek an immediate
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard Law School, Spoon joined The Post Co. in 1982. He moved up
to chief financial officer at The Post Co. and then to president of
Newsweek. He was promoted to chief operating officer of The
Washington Post Co. in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth Kids Cleared of Cheating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Dartmouth College cleared 78 students of
accusations they cheated in a computer science class.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing 500 pages of evidence, school officials said
Friday the case was so confusing it was impossible to determine who
was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Some students in the introductory class said they were tempted
to cheat when visiting professor Rex Dwyer left the answer to a
complicated problem on the class Web site and displayed its
Internet address on an overhead projector.
</P>
<P>
   Computer records revealed which terminals were used to obtain
the answers, but officials said that wasn't enough to prove which
students cheated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just don't have any way of knowing whose fingers were on
what keyboard,'' said James Larimore, dean of the college.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, a North Carolina State University professor who has since
resigned the two classes he was teaching Dartmouth, was unimpressed
with the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a whitewash,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Older Students Prompt College Surge  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her dreams, 33-year-old Kimberley Rogers walks into a
classroom at Smith College next fall, 18 years after quitting high
school because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, writing essays for her college applications to Smith
in her hometown Northampton, Mass., and nearby Mount Holyoke
College, Rogers fought tears describing how she transformed herself
from a dropout into an honors student at a community college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've spent my life driving by the campus ... wishing I could
go there,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   By early April, Rogers and millions of other American students
will know if their dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   March and April are the height of admissions season -- when elite
institutions like Smith, Mount Holyoke and a few hundred others
send fat letters of acceptance to prospective students or the
dreaded thin envelope bearing bad news.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a particularly busy year for college admissions
officers, who are reporting a surge in applications this year,
continuing an upswing that began in the late 1990s and is projected
to rise into the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The federal forecast of 2.5 million first-time freshmen in fall
2000 is the highest since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the boom are more college-age kids, older adults pouring
into college, and computers and the Internet that make applying a
breeze. Admissions officers also suspect more students are applying
to more places. Plus many schools now actively seek students,
especially less well-known schools like Iowa Wesleyan College,
which mounted a heavy sales campaign to fill 125 freshman seats
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all fighing for survival,'' said admissions director
James Lynes.
</P>
<P>
   College enrollment hit a record 14.9 million last fall, a
reflection of how children of baby boomers -- the so-called echo
generation -- are swelling high school graduating classes.
</P>
<P>
   A majority head straight for college; 67 percent of the 2.8
million high school graduates in 1997 started college that fall,
according to the most recent data available.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Americans past conventional college age are
flocking to campus, as they have since the 1980s. Students age 25
and older made up 19 percent of full-time enrollment in fall 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Federal college enrollment projections to 2009 show numbers
steadily climbing, says Tom Snyder, managing statistician at the
National Center for Education Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Like other campuses, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Cambridge, Mass., is enjoying a larger applicant pool this year
than last: 10,673 compared to 9,136 for fall 1999. Roughly
one-third of this year's applicants -- and one-third more than last
year -- sought early admission, an increasingly popular trend.
</P>
<P>
   Neelesh Chudasama, 17, of Watchung, N.J., was among them. He got
the good news in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   ''It relieves that stress of having to perform for a high school
transcript,'' he said. ''Now it's more for the sake of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Wesleyan College mounted an aggressive marketing campaign
to make sure none of its freshmen seats went empty. The college
bought names of high school students who took the SAT and ACT
entrance tests and showered likely prospects with brochures,
letters and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the small liberal arts campus of 800 students in
Mount Pleasant, Iowa, expects 440 applicants, up from 300 a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even large, well-known schools like Arizona State University,
with 33,000 undergraduates, take nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the school received 18,000 applicants to its flagship
Tempe campus; 14,000 were accepted and 5,868 enrolled as freshmen.
Plans call for increasing next year's class to more than 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   To boost the applicant pool, a squad of student workers writes
and telephones anyone who shows interest. The school also buys
lists of test-takers and conducts mass mailings. This year
applications are up 25 percent over last.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, it's not a one-sided process: As admissions
counselors sort through heaps of applications, students make their
own evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of current college freshmen at two- and four-year
institutions applied to four schools or more, according to research
at University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cooper, an A and B student and member of the National
Honor Society, applied to 13 schools. The 18-year-old also is head
of the student council and track team at Lane Technical, one of
Chicago's selective public high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Replies from colleges, including eight acceptances so far,
started arriving before Christmas. Penn State and the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign already want him. He's still waiting
to hear from two of his other top picks, Princeton and Duke
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to have a lot of options,'' said Cooper, who plans to
major in business and minor in psychology. ''Then you have a chance
to fly and stretch your wings.''

<HEADLINE> Cohen: US Not Sorry for Vietnam War  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said Saturday
he will not apologize for U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War when
he visits the Vietnamese capital Hanoi but will focus on future
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't intend to go into any apologies, certainly, for the
war itself,'' Cohen said in an interview with reporters traveling
with him on a four-nation Asia tour that will include two days in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrives Monday in Hanoi, Cohen will become the first
American secretary of defense to visit since the war ended in April
1975. One major item of business will be discussions of Americans
still listed as missing in battle.
</P>
<P>
   The last American combat troops withdrew in 1973, but 2,000 U.S.
servicemen remain unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, including
about 1,500 on Vietnamese soil.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has kicked off a series of national celebrations of the
25th anniversary of their victory over the U.S.-backed government
of South Vietnam. Cohen said this will not make his visit more
awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no perfect time for this,'' he said. ''Both nations
were scarred by this. They have their own scars from the war. We
certainly have ours.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 58,000 American servicemen were lost in the war.
Vietnam's losses are estimated at 3 million. Beyond the heavy human
toll, the war's outcome left the American military with
institutional wounds, battered morale and an aversion to getting
drawn into conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to discuss areas where we can cooperate in the
future. I'm not going to go back and review the past,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meetings with Vietnamese government officials in
Hanoi, Cohen plans to travel to the countryside where U.S. and
Vietnamese specialists are searching for remains of an American
fighter pilot, Navy Cmdr. Richard N. Rich, of Stamford, Conn.,
whose F-4B jet crashed south of Hanoi on the morning of May 19,
1967.
</P>
<P>
   The Rich case has been investigated several times dating to
1994, most recently in September-October 1999 when a joint recovery
team excavated a site near the village of Dong Phu and recovered
wreckage judged to be consistent with an F-4 aircraft. No
identifiable remains have yet been found.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Saturday he does not expect that remains will
necessarily be found during his brief visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we will show is the degree of difficulty involved'' in
finding and recovering remains so long after the war, he said.
Also, Cohen said, he wants to use the visit to reassure families of
missing Americans that remains recovery has a high priority, and
''The search is not going to be discontinued.''

<HEADLINE> Sharif's Attorneys Seek New Trial  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- A day after their colleague was slain,
lawyers for deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed Saturday to
boycott their client's hijacking trial unless the case is moved out
of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal Raad was shot and killed Friday in a brazen daylight
attack by three gunmen who stormed his legal office in the heart of
Karachi and opened fire. Two other men were also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite government promises of increased protection, Khawaja
Sultan, another of Sharif's lawyers, said the defense team will
refuse to attend the case in the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Iqbal Raad can be killed in his office, how can we be safe
anywhere in Karachi?'' he said in a telephone interview from his
home in the eastern Punjab provincial capital of Lahore. ''We will
not participate if the trial stays in Karachi.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution, led by Attorney General Raja Quereshi, said
it is too late in the trial proceedings to change the location.
</P>
<P>
   ''With only six days remaining, it doesn't make sense to move
the trial,'' said Quereshi. All that remains is for the defense and
prosecution to give their final arguments. Each side has been given
three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will increase security for all the lawyers and
whatever extra security the defense wants, it will be given,'' said
Quereshi.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 mourners, most of them lawyers wearing black arm
bands, attended Raad's funeral Saturday. From the mosque, a
procession of several thousand people, many of them shouting
anti-government slogans, walked through the streets of Karachi to
the graveyard four miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers also held a one-day strike Saturday to protest Raad's
killing. The Sindh High Court Bar Association issued a statement
saying Raad was ''yet another casualty of the continuous violence
and anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   No connection has been made between the killing and Sharif's
hijacking trial currently underway in southern Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Raad, whose home was in Karachi, Sharif's
other defense lawyers from elsewhere in Pakistan have been living
in hotels since the trial began in December.
</P>
<P>
   Karachi, a city of 14 million people, is Pakistan's largest and
the most violent, wracked in recent years by relentless ethnic and
religiously motivated violence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Raja Zafarul Haq, a leading member of Sharif's
Pakistan Muslim League, demanded the military government establish
a judicial inquiry into Raad's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government cannot exonerate itself,'' he said. ''It is up
to the government to provide security.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, along with his younger brother and six other people, are
on trial, charged with hijacking, attempted murder, terrorism and
kidnapping. All charges carry either the death penalty or life in
prison upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from events on Oct. 12, the day the army
overthrew Sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say after dismissing army chief Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, Sharif ordered that the general's plane be denied
landing rights at Karachi airport. The pilot of the Pakistan
International Airlines plane -- with 200 passengers and crew on
board -- claimed the plane landed with only seven minutes worth of
fuel remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's dismissal sparked the army to revolt, arrest Sharif
and allow the aircraft to land.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military government, now led by Musharraf, has
condemned Raad's shooting and promised to track down the killers.
No suspects have been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks Arabs for Financial Aid  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon called on fellow Arabs today to
help financially in its confrontation with Israel and to reconsider
dealings with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Arabs should send a message to
Tel Aviv that ''aggression against Lebanon is aggression against
all the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged Arab countries to reconsider ''dealings with Israel,
including normalization of relations and participation in
multilateral talks'' if Israel did not cease its attacks in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss opened a two-day Arab League biannual foreign ministers'
meeting held in Beirut as a show of solidarity after Israel
responded last month to guerrilla attacks on its soldiers by
launching airstrikes on Lebanon's civilian infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 8 Israeli attacks knocked out three power stations,
causing widespread electricity outages, and wounded 15 civilians.
Damage was estimated at $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak threatened more strikes if
attacks by Lebanese-based guerrillas continued. Seven Israeli
soldiers were killed between Jan. 25 and Feb. 11 by Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas, who are leading the war to oust Israeli
forces from an occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech today, Hoss said Lebanon looks forward to a
''decision on aid and fulfillment of previous commitments'' to deal
with his country's ''material damage and the huge economic
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous Arab summits in Tunisia in 1978 and in Morocco in 1982
earmarked $2 billion for Lebanon after Israeli troops invaded the
country. Only $425 million, however, has been paid to Lebanon so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia last week committed $100 million in loans and $30
million in grants during a visit by Crown Prince Abdullah to
Beirut. Kuwait recently donated $16 million to repair the damaged
power stations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al Faisal of Saudi Arabia told the
conference that it was sending ''a clear, frank and unequivocal
message to Israel affirming that all of us stand by Lebanon's
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, whose country was the first
to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, criticized the Israeli
attacks and the threats.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the meeting, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon and guerrillas fired on
Israeli troops and allied militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   The front lines in the south were quiet today.
</P>
<P>
   Since the league made its decision to meet in Beirut, the
Israeli Cabinet announced it would pull its army out of south
Lebanon by July. Israel has maintained a buffer zone in southern
Lebanon since 1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in Beirut today that
''it was natural to welcome'' Israel's decision. But questions
remained about whether a withdrawal would lead to stability, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Looting Adds to Mozambique's Woes  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOKWE, Mozambique (AP) -- Leaning against a wall with his arms
crossed, Lucas Madebe growls when he sees people in the street
wearing clothes stolen from his store.
</P>
<P>
   His indignation rises further when he is asked if authorities
have done anything to crack down on looting since Mozambique's
massive flooding forced thousands to abandon this now-ravaged town.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police fled as well,'' said Madebe, one of the thousands
of Mozambicans who made their way back to their homes this week to
find them stripped bare or, worse yet, destroyed altogether by
waters that rose to the rooftops in many places.
</P>
<P>
   At least a quarter million other flood victims remained in 89
makeshift camps Saturday in central and southern Mozambique. Aid
agencies and soldiers from at least five nations, including the
United States, were delivering them food and medical supplies under
a rare spell of sunny skies.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the flooding that struck a month ago in central and
southern Mozambique killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people.
Up to 1 million people were driven from their homes or saw their
crops and other property destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   While floodwaters were by far the biggest thief here, sporadic
looting also has flared throughout the region, Mozambican officials
said this week. For Madebe, it meant the destruction of his
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Along with most of Chokwe's 40,000 people, Madebe ran away in
panic when floodwaters from the nearby Limpopo River suddenly
surged to seven feet on Feb. 27. When the 26-year-old businessman
returned here last week, he found his store knee-deep in stinking
mud.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were the clothes that Madebe and his family had bought in
neighboring South Africa with most of their savings. They had
planned to sell the items in this rural farming town 120 miles
north of the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   Madebe said he does not dare confront those he sees wearing his
clothes because there are still few police in the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may turn violent if I face up to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Madebe blames the looting on 45 prisoners that guards freed from
the local jail to save them from drowning. Others accuse residents
who stayed behind in the safety of their three-story buildings, out
of the water's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Soltana Mussa, whose husband runs the local hotel, said the
looters were ''opportunists'' taking advantage of the deserted town
to steal expensive electronic goods. Her husband fired shots into
the air to scare them away, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The local police chief said this week his men are doing what
they can to restore order and deal with theft claims. But as they
try to nab the small bands of looters who have sprouted up in
flood-hit areas, the police have their own problem: Without any way
to determine ownership, how do they distinguish between allegedly
stolen goods and goods people claim they have salvaged from
floodwaters?
</P>
<P>
   ''We are having to do some diplomatic negotiating,'' said the
police chief, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Looters have struck elsewhere in flood-affected areas of
southern Mozambique. Police in Xai-Xai, 60 miles southeast of
Chokwe, said Friday they arrested a gang that was cruising the town
by boat at night and swimming into submerged shops to steal
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said police are stepping up
patrols and that anyone caught looting will not only stand trial
but also will be publicly humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have instructed the police to publish these people's names
in the newspaper so that everyone knows who the thieves are,''
Simao said Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Diversity Data Guidelines Released  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing diversity of the American
population is prompting the Clinton administration to release new
guidelines for federal agencies as the Census Bureau prepares to
mail out forms offering people a chance to say if they are of more
than one race.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, issued Friday by the Office of Management and
Budget, allow for more specific racial combinations to be counted
when results from the 2000 census are released, changing the way
demographic data about the country is kept.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, this year's census forms allow respondents
to mark one or more of 14 boxes representing six races and
subcategories or ''some other race.'' For instance, in the last
census, someone who was of both black and white ancestry could only
check off only one choice.
</P>
<P>
   In all, as many as 63 racial combinations are possible, and the
Census Bureau will release data for each of those categories, said
Nancy Gordon, the agency's associate director for demographic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also revise the way statistics are kept for
purposes of civil rights monitoring and enforcement, said Sally
Katzen, counselor to the OMB director.
</P>
<P>
   For that purpose, OMB added new multi-race categories in
addition to the standard single-race categories of American Indian
or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian
or Other Pacific Islander, and White.
</P>
<P>
   The new multi-race categories for purposes of civil rights
monitoring and enforcement are: American Indian or Alaska Native
and White; Asian and White; Black or African American and White;
American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American.
</P>
<P>
   ''We anticipate that most of the people who check off more than
one race will check off one of these categories,'' Katzen said when
asked why those specific combinations were selected.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also provide for the collection of information on
any multiple race combinations that comprise more than 1 percent of
the population of interest, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   If an individual who is white and of one minority race is
involved in a civil rights enforcement case, that individual will
be allocated to the minority race. A person of two or more minority
races and involved in an enforcement case would be allocated to the
race that is allegedly discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if a person of two or more minority races is involved
in a civil rights case based on a pattern of discrimination, the
enforcement agency ''will conduct a thorough analysis of effects on
each minority group alleged to be affected by the pattern of
discrimination,'' an OMB statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to speculate on how the new groupings will
affect civil and voting rights enforcement until data from the 2000
census is released next year, said Anita Hodgkiss, deputy assistant
attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the guidelines allow people to be counted once. ''No
individual is counted twice, nor is any individual counted as a
fraction,'' Katzen said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration estimated about 2 percent of the population
would check off that they are of more than one race.

<HEADLINE> A Vote for Old Fashioned Ballots  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The paper sign, tacked onto the fence of P.S.
199 in Manhattan, flapped in the wind as it pointed the way: ''VOTE
HERE.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers walked in, met friendly volunteers, cast their
ballots in the halls of public education, emerged into the sunlight
and strode off to experience the day. Most were smiling when they
left.
</P>
<P>
   This is how I voted in the New York primaries last week -- how
Americans in every corner of the republic will vote for the next
president: We will go to schools, senior centers, gymnasiums, even
neighbors' living rooms, and cast ballots, deciding events of
national import in the most local of places.
</P>
<P>
   But in Arizona's Democratic primary this past week, casting a
vote meant something different than ever before: Like so many of
today's activities, it meant, for some, logging onto the Internet
and clicking a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   No trip to the polling place. No getting up from the couch, if
your mouse was nearby. No chitchat with neighbors. ''Now that's
what I call service,'' said Stan Robinson of Phoenix. ''There's no
going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are concerned: Will it be fair? Accurate? Will it favor
the digital over the analog generation? Probably not, since
conventional polling places are still available -- this time around,
at least.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something stands to be lost -- that pause in our daily
routine, perhaps even the opportunity to reflect on democracy.
Should voting be so routine, so easy that it's utterly forgettable
and not worthy of our most serious consideration?
</P>
<P>
   When I was a child in suburban Pittsburgh, I'd accompany my
mother on Election Day to the Hampton Township Municipal Building,
where she would cast her ballot. She'd banter with the pamphleteers
outside. On her way in, she'd chat with her beloved Democrats at
the sign-in table -- yet never fail to offer cheerful hellos to the
Republican volunteers, many of them our neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Until I was about seven, they'd even let me enter the booth with
her. The powder-blue curtain would whisk shut, she'd pull levers
and show me the names, and then -- the best part -- I'd get to push
the red button. Cha-ching! The machine would rumble like a cash
register and whisk the curtain open once again.
</P>
<P>
   To me, this was government -- and I looked forward to the day I
could vote.
</P>
<P>
   To speak with my peers (I'm 31), I'm in the minority these days.
Yet the 'Oh-say-can-you-see' patriotism was fulfilled. Even today I
feel I'm doing something momentous when I vote, albeit on a small
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the message on www.election.com feels a bit hollow in
comparison: ''Click here,'' it says, ''to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the information that a private company is operating this
whole thing doesn't feel quite, well, civic enough. Somehow,
there's a sense of loss in hearing the Arizona Democratic Party
implore voters to ''demonstrate that online voting is an effective
and secure method to increase voter turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone's motivations are impure. When turnouts of 50
percent are considered heavy voting days, attracting Americans to
the polls is a worthy endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Baldino certainly thinks so. A professor at Wilkes
University in Pennsylvania, he remembers, when his kids were young,
taking them along when he voted. ''They thought it was kind of
neat,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   These days, his son doesn't even cast an absentee ballot. ''I'm
a political scientist. Do you know how embarrassing this is?''
Baldino jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This warm, fuzzy feeling that I have about voting, it's been
lost between my generation and my children's generation,'' he says.
''The passion our forefathers felt for the actual act of voting has
dissipated. ... If you do it in the solitude of your own home, it's
one more way people are disconnecting from the body politic.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldino acknowledges the importance of using technology to get
out the vote, which isn't something we ought to take for granted: A
memorable image of the 1990s was the serpentine line of black South
Africans, waiting eagerly to cast their first ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, where more than 30,000 citizens voted online, a
memento was available after balloting. ''To keep a souvenir of this
historic moment, feel free to print your election certificate,''
the computer told voters. ''It's as simple as if you were printing
a Word document.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to put on your mantel or paste in a scrapbook. But not
an experience -- at least, not like greeting pamphleteers, signing
in, flipping levers and watching the curtain whisk open.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a vote. And no matter how it comes in, as long as
it's legal and from a citizen, it still counts. Even in a wired
America.

<HEADLINE> Analysts say more casino mergers on the way as the big get bigger  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Casino analysts predict more mergers are on the
horizon for an industry adept at knowing when to hold 'em, when to
fold 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are definitely going to be more deals,'' Jason Ader,
casino analyst for Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. said after MGM Grand's $4.4
billion buyout of Mirage Resorts earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no new states approving gaming, so the only way a
company is going to grow is to acquire,'' Ader said.
</P>
<P>
   The MGM Grand-Mirage deal was a classic Las Vegas high stakes
showdown. Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who has built the world's
largest hotel here three times and is one of the city's premier
players, offered Mirage stockholders $17 a share last month. Steve
Wynn, who parlayed a land deal with billionaire Howard Hughes into
a $1 million profit that spawned his Mirage kingdom, rejected the
offer of his longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders close to the negotiations say Kerkorian then stopped by
Wynn's office in the glitzy Bellagio resort and upped the ante to
$19. Wynn countered with $21 and the deal was done. The two sides
worked out the details in the next four days before inking an
agreement at dawn Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has major implications for Atlantic City, where both
companies had plans to build elaborate new casinos. The future of
those projects is now clouded, with many industry observers
expecting MGM Grand to give up on its 35-acre Boardwalk site in
favor of taking over the marina district site where Mirage is
planning a $1 billion, 1,144-room project.
</P>
<P>
   Mirage's interest prompted Boyd Gaming Corp. to commit to a $750
million, 1,500-room project in the marina district. Construction on
that hotel is to begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The MGM buyout is just the latest venture making prophets out of
those who predicted several years ago that a dozen-plus casino
companies eventually would be swallowed up, leaving only a handful
of giants.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal reduces to six the number of major players in the
gambling industry -- MGM-Mirage, Park Place Entertainment Corp.,
Harrah's Entertainment, Inc., Mandalay Resort Group, Boyd Gaming
Corp. and Station Casinos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst thinks the number could fall further.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere out there it would not surprise me if Mandalay is
taken over,'' said Marvin Roffman, a casino analyst with Roffman
Miller Associates. ''It's just such a prime company. They own
fabulous real estate and have fabulous properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandalay, formerly Circus Enterprises, reported disappointing
fourth-quarter results last month, blaming the figures on a ho-hum
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Mandalay stock has been trading in the $14 range, down 30
percent for the year. Company officials did not return phone calls
this week seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roffman agreed that Tuesday's passage of a constitutional
amendment in California legalizing Indian casinos could spell
trouble for Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   A Bear, Stearns report last month noted 35 percent of Nevada's
casino revenue is generated by Californians, and the spread of
Indian gambling after Proposition 1A could affect the Nevada
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mandalay Resorts is very, very focused on Nevada, they don't
have the geographical diversification of someone like Harrah's,''
Roffman said. ''So if Nevada is impacted by Indian gaming in
California, they would have a high percentage of their assets that
could get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Roffman said he expected mergers in the industry to ''continue
unabated, and could even speed up as the California market
blossoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Ader calls smaller casino companies such as Aztar, Isle of
Capri, Argosy and Pinnacle ''good targets'' for the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harrah's and Park Place have been aggressive acquirers of
casino assets,'' Ader said. ''The real question of smaller
companies is do they continue to grow through acquisition or do
they consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big companies will be looking at the small companies, and
the small companies will be looking at other small companies,''
Ader said. ''Everything is fair game at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's is wrapping up a $425 million deal to acquire Players
International Inc., with riverboat casinos in Lake Charles, La.,
St. Louis, and Metropolis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Gary Thompson said the company doesn't have any other
deals pending, but that doesn't mean Harrah's is standing pat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to look at any acquisitions that make strategic
sense,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place completed the $3 billion acquisition of the Caesars
properties in December, giving the company an interest in 29
casinos worldwide. Future plans are unknown,
</P>
<P>
   Roffman thinks the gambling industry is a perfect candidate for
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three characteristics about the casino industry never
change,'' Roffman said. ''It's very heavily regulated, it takes
very deep pockets to be in the business, and it's very management
intensive. To me, that's the perfect environment for more
consolidation.''

<HEADLINE> Cops Confiscate Nazi-Themed Float  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTO, Italy (AP) -- Police in northern Italy on Saturday
confiscated an Auschwitz-themed Mardi Gras float featuring dancing
concentration camp inmates and Nazi guards, blocking it from
appearing in another parade.
</P>
<P>
   The float, part of a Carnival parade in the town of Storo, shows
inmates and guards dancing together under a banner showing clasped
hands, with white doves flying out of a crematorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intended message unequivocally is an invitation to
peace,'' Storo Mayor Pippo Scaglia said in a statement Saturday
defending the float.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Rome-based Italy-Israel Association had
written a letter of protest to the mayor after the float appeared
in Tuesday's parade, urging him to forbid its appearance Saturday
in another parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only does the float offend Jewish sensibilities, its
stupidity and anti-Semitism offend all Italians,'' Chicca Falcone
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Storo announced it had decided to stick with plans to
show the float again.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors in the nearby city of Trento ordered it
seized. Italian police hauled it away to a site near a police
station. Prosecutors are investigating whether the float broke any
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Scaglia stressed that the creators of the
float included children of concentration camp inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The float ''wasn't born to render comic a tragedy, to offend
anyone, to inspire or be inspired by bad sentiments,'' he said.
''If Storo has offended the sensibilities of anyone, we ask them to
excuse us.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the press, and not Storo, that acted shamefully,
Scaglia said.
</P>
<P>
   Italian media said the float was entered under the title,
''Arbeit Macht Frei -- Hauswitz 2000.'' The phrase combines the
notorious motto written above the gates to Auschwitz with a
nonsense phrase translating as ''House Joke 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaglia said the true name of the float was ''Life is More
Beautiful than Ever,'' a play on the Roberto Benigni move about the
Holocaust, ''Life is Beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> Collins parts company over money, philosophy, in schoolconstruction debate  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- More than money separates Assembly Speaker
Jack Collins from the Whitman administration and Senate Republicans
on the multibillion-dollar issue of school construction funding.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a philosophical divide that's going to take some
work to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Collins last week presented yet another plan to provide state
aid to the state's 30 so-called special needs districts to replace
or repair crumbling school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But, like his first proposal, the latest bill does not provide
full funding for all the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it provides 100 percent funding only for emergency
repairs and for new classroom space to relieve overcrowding. State
dollars for extras such as cafeterias and media rooms would be
provided on a sliding scale depending on a school district's
economic condition.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Whitman and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco
favor 100 percent state funding for all projects in the special
needs districts. That is the only way, they say, for the state to
comply with the state Supreme Court's landmark Abbott vs. Burke
ruling, which requires the state to take steps to upgrade the
schools in the poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing less than full compliance, Collins -- who, like
DiFrancesco, has gubernatorial ambitions -- is flexing his
legislative muscles over what he terms an activist court.
</P>
<P>
   Collins wants to withhold some funding from the special needs
districts to advance his point that there are other poor schools in
the state that are not automatically in line for special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Critics say this will never be accepted by the court,'' he
said of his maverick plan. ''I'm amused when I hear that. No one
ever knows how the court will react.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker portrayed his newest proposal as a compromise with
plans advanced by the governor and DiFrancesco. But his insistence
that the special needs districts share some of the burden for new
schools has so far fallen on deaf ears outside the Assembly
Republican caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Senate sympathizer, Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic,
said he agreed with Collins' premise but said he couldn't sidestep
the court's clear mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor believes we need to fund the Abbott districts at
100 percent,'' Whitman spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor agreed. ''We'll
continue to talk. At this point, that's the only way the difference
can be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins spokesman Chuck Lietgeb said the speaker hopes the
governor and the Senate president will meet him halfway.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has said he will not stand in the way of a school
construction project this year. If that meant moving a little bit
off his first bill, he made a strong point,'' Lietgeb said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg Edwards, executive director of the Senate Republicans,
questioned whether Collins' new proposal is a true compromise.
Education Commissioner David Hespe last week said the special needs
districts might have been better off financially under Collins'
original proposal, which called for a flat 90 percent state aid
formula for all new school projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to tell if he was really trying to show the spirit
of compromise. In fairness, I think he believed he was,'' Edwards
said.
</P>
<P>
   An advocate for the poor schools believes Collins will
ultimately fall in line with Whitman and DiFrancesco. A recent
court ruling on still another Abbott matter may have tamed some
legislative rebels, said David Sciarra, director of the Education
Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   In that ruling, the court reaffirmed its order that the state
provide for quality preschool programs in the special needs
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who was inclined to think the court would back off ...
that doubt has been put to rest,'' said Sciarra.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure may also come to bear on Collins from middle-class
school districts, which also stand to benefit from the school
construction bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the parties may well compromise out of sheer exhaustion, he
said. After all, the Abbott case has been around for more than 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Legislature and the governor would rather get on
with implementing this important program, instead of engaging in a
fruitless effort in court,'' Sciarra said.

<HEADLINE> Swedes To Vote on Adopting Euro  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Euro supporters and opponents claimed
victory Saturday after the ruling Social Democrats voted to adopt
the common currency but leave any final decision up to Sweden's
voters.
</P>
<P>
   After a daylong debate, delegates to a party convention in
Stockholm voted Friday to approve Prime Minister Goeran Persson's
recommendation to change government policy and join the European
Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   But delegates who oppose joining the euro succeeded in
pressuring the party's executive committee to support a national
referendum on the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was a big, big success,'' Maj-Britt Theorin of
Stockholm said Saturday. ''We got the referendum, and it is now the
people who will decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven EU countries launched the common currency on Jan. 4,
1999, for corporate and investment transactions, in hopes it would
increase European integration and virtually free trade. Euro coins
and bank notes won't be introduced until Jan. 1, 2002. Denmark,
Sweden and Britain opted not to adopt the euro in its initial
phase.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, which was not allowed in because of its high inflation
and budget deficit, formally applied for membership last week and
is expected to be ready for admission early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion polls in Sweden have shown declining
support for the euro, a drop that analysts attribute to the euro
zone's poor economic performance compared to strong growth in
Sweden, and traditional concerns about handing financial authority
to EU officials in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Euro supporters argue that the increasingly global economy
demands that Sweden join the other euro countries to retain
international influence and protect Sweden's welfare state from
growing market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Persson, who has led efforts to support the currency, said
Sweden could be ready for a referendum next year, depending on
national wage negotiations. He declined to mention any specific
date, the Swedish news agency TT said.
</P>
<P>
   Persson has said he does not want a fight over the issue to mar
Sweden's turn at the six-month rotating EU presidency, which it
takes over on Jan. 1, 2001. Others have called for the referendum
to be held after parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Danes also have taken steps closer to membership, with Prime
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen announcing Thursday that a national
referendum on the currency would be held Sept. 28 and urging voters
to say ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the outcome of referendums in both Scandinavian neighbors
was far from certain and Friday's debate among the 350 delegates --
which typically agrees with its executive committee -- was unusually
contentious.
</P>
<P>
   Persson had to take the podium at one point to persuade
delegates to reject a last-minute amendment that called for the
European Monetary Union and its central bank to become more
democratic and for there to be an option to oust the bank's
governors.

<HEADLINE> Van Gogh Exhibit Opens in Detroit  </HEADLINE>
By RANDI GOLDBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The old man with the sunken cheeks and top hat
gazes sullenly from one of Vincent Van Gogh's stark drawings in
''Van Gogh: Face to Face,'' the first comprehensive exhibition
solely of the Dutch master's portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ''What fascinates me much, much more than does anything else in
my metier is the portrait, the modern portrait,'' Van Gogh said in
1890. ''I would like to do portraits which will appear as
revelations to people in 100 years time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a century later, the exhibition opening Sunday at the
Detroit Institute of Arts showcases 31 drawings and 36 paintings,
many of which have not been seen in this country before. It runs
through June 4 before moving to Boston and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes works on loan from private collectors
and museums the world over, as well as the Detroit museum's Van
Goghs: ''Portrait of Joseph Rulin,'' a 1992 gift from Walter B.
Ford II and his wife Josephine; two Van Gogh landscapes; and the
''Self Portrait,'' acquired in 1922 -- the first Van Gogh purchased
by an American museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an artist who has staggering name recognition, so
you're asking to borrow truly the signature paintings from any
great museum collection,'' said George Keyes, the museum's curator
of European painting and the brainchild behind the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale and finely detailed drawings, produced in the
Netherlands between 1882 and 1885, are the earliest works in the
exhibit and capture the essential character of Van Gogh's subjects:
poor peasants, fishermen and pensioners.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Orphan Man in the Top Hat'' was drawn in 1882 at The Hague
with pencil, black lithographic crayon, pen, brush and brown ink.
Van Gogh applied the graphite and lithographic crayon with such
force that they left indentations on the paper. He also scratched
through some of the black areas, such as the top hat, to create the
effect of light reflecting off the sheen of the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit museum organized the collection with The Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the only
other museums where the exhibit will be displayed.

<HEADLINE> JP signs order to evict former mob hitman from apartment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Former mob hitman Salvatore ''Sammy the
Bull'' Gravano, who was arrested on charges he helped run an
ecstasy ring, has now been evicted from his suburban apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice of the Peace Victor Wilkins signed the eviction papers
on March 2, the Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix,
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano was accused of breaching a pledge in his lease that he
avoid criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Clark, an attorney for the apartment complex's management
company, wrote a letter addressed to Jimmy Moran, the alias Gravano
had used, that said Moran had ''irreparably breached'' that
provision.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, three members of his family, and dozens of others were
indicted this month on charges of conspiracy and racketeering
related to the ring, which authorities said did $500,000 in
business a week.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to setting up residence in Phoenix, Gravano, who admitted
to murdering 19 people while in the mob, crippled New York's
Gambino crime family by agreeing to testify against boss John Gotti
and other former Mafia cronies. Gotti was sentenced to life in
prison in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano served just five years on a racketeering charge. He was
released in 1995 and given a new name through the witness
protection program. By early 1997, he had left the program.
</P>
<P>
   Pati Urias, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Attorney General's
Office, said Gravano would be allowed to live with his wife, Debra,
and daughter, Karen, at their Tempe home if he makes bail.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano is being held on a $5 million bond. Debra and Karen
Gravano were also charged in the case.

<HEADLINE> No Campaign Finance Problems Here  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRINY BREEZES, Fla. (AP) -- Robert Conkey, the 77-year-old mayor
of this oceanside mobile home park, has spent $11 in pursuit of
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   His 83-year-old opponent? He hasn't spent a cent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Herbert M. Kessman, the first Briny Breezes resident
ever to challenge a sitting mayor, returned his sole campaign
contribution, a check for $43.
</P>
<P>
   ''I opened it up and there was a check for Campaign 2000,''
Kessman said as he relaxed in his double-wide just yards from the
beach on a picturesque South Florida morning. ''I made a copy and
wrote him a nice thank you note and returned it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this political season of mudslinging and exorbitant campaign
spending, the standoff between the two senior citizens could be one
of the most inexpensive and civil elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Conkey, whose $11 paid for a list of the town's 292 registered
voters, is surprised he has competition. But he's not offended.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this business, you don't get your ticket punched
automatically,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Kessman says he's not disgruntled over Conkey's politics, and
he's not in the race for money. The post doesn't pay anything.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he placed his name on Tuesday's ballot because he
believes people ought to exercise their constitutional right to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't find fault with Mayor Conkey. We are friends,''
Kessman said. ''It's just that we haven't had an election in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Conkey was appointed mayor in 1997 after the death of the town's
first mayor, Hugh David, who had held the post since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   No elected official in the town has had any competition since
1977, saving the town $350 in election costs every four years, Town
Clerk Rita Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the 500 or so mostly elderly residents don't seem to mind
the upcoming expenditure. The race gives them something to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   Life is pretty laid back in Briny Breezes, where 28 citizens in
their 90s and three 100-year-olds showed up for a recent community
center party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all excited about it,'' said Peter Fingerhut, 75, while
carving furniture in ''Chiseler's Club,'' a wood shop where the men
gather for a little handiwork and talk.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the campaign trail, Conkey steers his golf cart -- the
main mode of transportation in Briny Breezes -- up and down narrow
one-lane streets flanked by mobile homes sporting tiny manicured
yards in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a campaign sign, bumper sticker or button in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Conkey waves and calls out to passers-by. He knows everybody's
name.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same as any mayor, anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atop his wrinkly head is a baseball cap with ''Dockmaster''
scripted across the front. He explains that the mayor serves
double-duty as head of the town's marina.
</P>
<P>
   Still, being mayor isn't really a full-time job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly do the duties include?
</P>
<P>
   ''Not much,'' Conkey said, a twinkle in his eye. ''It's just a
ceremonial post.''
</P>
<P>
   The only real issue facing the town, a corporation owned by the
residents, is the threat of developers who'd like to buy up the
prime 46 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Briny Breezes is flanked on the west by Florida's Intracoastal
Waterway. The Atlantic sits to the east and to the north and south
are million-dollar estates and the exclusive St. Andrews golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   Kessman paid $2,700 for his lot in the 1960s. A developer
recently offered to buy up the entire town for $100 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My lot's worth $189,000 now, but these people are elderly,''
Kessman said. ''Where would we go? We won't sell. Not in my
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The race likely will heat up on election day. Still, these guys
play fair and square. They'll canvass the town with bullhorns, but
not to promote themselves.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities Push Causes to Colleges  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER KIMURA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Moon Zappa hooted, hollered and danced
wildly on stage to the taped music of Kid Rock, demonstrating for a
crowd of college students what she calls ''self-revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Be your own hero,'' said the 32-year-old daughter of rock
legend Frank Zappa. ''Don't despair -- your calling calls you.''
</P>
<P>
   The former ''valley girl'' and '80s one-hit wonder is among a
group of celebrities that began a tour of college campuses last
week aimed at persuading students to become more involved in
political issues.
</P>
<P>
   But some students at Reed College, the tour's first stop and an
iconoclastic bastion of liberal arts, protested outside,
questioning whether the $15,000 used to host the tour could have
been better spent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the college was going to spend that kind of money, it
could've been spent on something more activism-related,'' said
student Eloise Nelson, 20.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The Spitfire Tour, now in its third season, seems to
be formed around celebrity passions as much as delivering a
coherent message.
</P>
<P>
   Former MTV veejay Kennedy spoke out for privatizing social
security and legalizing drugs. She called herself a Republican but
also an ''18th century liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic talked about his own
political activism, and of witnessing the November riots at the
World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nonviolent political organizers made the greatest impact
on the WTO marches,'' he said. ''Indeed, it was a victory for
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-created by Rage Against the Machine's Zack De la Rocha, The
Spitfire Tour began in 1998 to fight apathy on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The tour doesn't carry a single message. Instead, celebrities
talk about issues that concern them personally, and how they got
involved.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tour features Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls on human
rights, Andy Dick on drug abuse, rap artist Ice T on censorship and
actor Woody Harrelson on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years -- including a performance at Woodstock
'99 -- the entourage had been met with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't exactly the case at Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Some students grilled panelists about why they agreed to a tour
that has a corporate sponsor -- an Internet textbook seller. A large
banner that featured the Web site's name hung over the
living-room-style stage where performers sat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want the corporate media thing thrust upon us,'' said
Sam Donald, 21. ''I don't like being advertised to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour organizer Sarah Hynes said the crowd's reaction caught them
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the most brutal audience we've ever had,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tour will appear in 20 cities including those in West
Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy to Cameroon Slightly Hurt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) -- The United States ambassador to this
Central African nation was slightly injured when a bandit hit him
on the head with a pistol butt during an attempted carjacking, U.S.
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador John Melvin Yates, 60, was driving home from an
embassy function late Friday night when a group of men approached
his car and tried to steal it, an embassy official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Yates escaped his attackers -- with his car -- and returned to his
house with ''very superficial'' injuries, the official said. No one
else was in the ambassador's car and no shots were fired at the
ambassador -- though one of the bandits apparently accidentally
fired off one round. No one was believed to have been hit.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department official, speaking in Washington on
condition of anonymity, said one of the attackers hit Yates in the
head with the butt of a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Yates ''is resting comfortably at home and will be in his office
at work Monday morning,'' the embassy said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of a political motive behind the attack,
the official in Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were searching for the gunmen, who fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Yaounde, the hilly capital city of this poverty-ridden nation,
has had a rapidly increasing crime rate in recent years, with
carjackings and burglaries becoming commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government launched a major anti-crime crackdown
in Douala, Cameroon's port city, after the large expatriate French
community there reacted with anger and alarm following the murder
of a well-known French butcher. Last week, the crusade was widened
to other parts of the country, with anti-crime squads stepping up
patrols in high-risk areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yates is a career foreign service officer and a longtime Africa
specialist. His last posting was as ambassador to Benin, and he has
also served as charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa,
Zaire, now called Congo, and ambassador to Cape Verde, among other
places.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment as ambassador to Cameroon was confirmed by the
U.S. Senate in Oct. 1998

<HEADLINE> Rocky and FBI cooperated from Nazis to Attica  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. Nelson Rockefeller received so much
hate mail in the anxious days after the bloody 1971 Attica prison
uprising that he sought help from the FBI, according to the
bureau's files.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure is included among 1,592 pages of documents in the
former vice president's FBI file, which was recently posted on the
bureau's Web site. The papers formerly had been viewable only at
FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily-redacted hodgepodge of reports, teletypes, letters
and press clippings reveals Rockefeller often worked closely with
the FBI -- so much so he was on a first-name basis with bureau
director J. Edgar Hoover. And the papers show the FBI investigated
a series of death threats against Rockefeller when he was governor
and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those threats came after state troopers, on
Rockefeller's orders, stormed prisoners who had taken over Attica
state prison in 1971. Thirty-two inmates and 11 correction officers
died during the uprising, most of them killed during the Sept. 13
raid on the western New York prison.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller called the White House several days later, asking
that the FBI provide state police with any information the FBI had
on bomb threats. The FBI cooperated, with Hoover asserting in a
memo that the governor ''did a courageous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, according to the files, ''expressed concern for his
personal safety as well as that of other state governmental
officials involved in the Attica Prison incident because of the
volume of hate mail being received at the Governor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions eventually cooled, but Rockefeller was called to answer
for his actions to FBI agents three years later as his record was
being investigated in connection with his nomination for the vice
presidency. Rockefeller insisted that he made the right call to
refuse requests to appear at the scene and to retake the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rockefeller was empathic in his statement that the Chief
Executive Officer of a state or nation should not succumb to an
inmate demand to appear in person when hostages are involved,''
according to a summary of that interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller said he would proceed the same way if he were the
governor faced with another prison riot, according to the summary.
</P>
<P>
   The files detail a relationship between Rockefeller and the FBI
that stretches at least as far back as 1940, when Rockefeller began
a war-time government assignment to coordinate commercial and
cultural relations with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller and the FBI talked in 1940 about a plan to create an
Institute of Public Opinion in South America, that could serve to
gather information.
</P>
<P>
   ''He suggested that we might even want to write the questions
and indicated that he would go along with anything we wanted to
do,'' read an Aug. 23, 1940, memo to Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   The files do not make clear if those plans were developed.
</P>
<P>
   Documents show Rockefeller was interviewed by FBI agents in 1949
and made statements ''believed to be of interest to the bureau'' in
the case of Whittaker Chambers, who had accused senior federal
official Alger Hiss of being a communist. The files do not include
that information.
</P>
<P>
   And documents show the FBI regularly checked Rockefeller's home
and office phones for wiretaps during World War II, at his request.
Rockefeller wrote Hoover about phone checks in 1945, concluding,
''As always, I'm grateful for your watchfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   That watchfulness extended to Rockefeller's own life several
times when he was investigated for government posts. Agents vetting
him in 1974 as President Ford's vice presidential pick interviewed
more than 1,250 people, most of whom praised Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the files:
</P>
<P>
   --An informant claimed that Rockefeller contacted Coretta King
after her husband Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968
to ask whether she or her husband's Christian Southern Leadership
Conference needed money. There is a reference to another memo, not
included, captioned ''Coretta King, Security Matter - Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   --Gov. Rockefeller in 1969 sought a briefing from the FBI on
student radicals and black militants in New York state. Hoover
overruled FBI officials who wanted to deny the request for an
unprecedented briefing of state officials.
</P>
<P>
   --The FBI was tipped on Nov. 11, 1973, that Rockefeller planned
to resign as governor and ''put into motion machinery which he
hopes will lead him to the White House in 1976.'' Rockefeller
announced his resignation a month later to the day.
</P>
<P>
   --Rockefeller, as the vice presidential nominee, defended his
practice as governor of creating quasi-governmental authorities to
borrow money for public works projects ''as a very valid
approach.''

<HEADLINE> Critics: Land, architectural gems could be lost in state sale  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The yellow and gold Tiffany glass dome in an
old psychiatric center building is said to have hovered over
President William McKinley as he was fatally shot in Buffalo during
the Pan-American Exposition in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   The Erie County Historical Society is investigating that
account.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the dome, now located among several buildings and 660
acres of rolling hills and woods in the J.N. Adam Development
Center in Cattaraugus County, are up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   As the state tries to find buyers for a number of properties
that have thus far been tough to sell, environmentalists and
preservationists are worried that the dome and other significant
elements of the properties are not getting enough attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a real danger of architectural and landscape features
being lost forever,'' said Tania Werbizky, of the Preservation
League of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   J.N. Adam is one of 13 sites -- most are remote woodsy and
waterside locations once used as psychiatric centers -- being
marketed by the Empire State Development Corp. over its Web site.
The deadline for bids on the properties is Wednesday, March 15.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the agency has used Internet technology
to help sell property. It is also advertising through more
traditional means such as newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   There is little information provided in the advertisements for
the properties on the Web. Aerial photos display the sites but the
descriptions do not reveal how many buildings or any information
about their former uses. Interested parties are encouraged to
register and pay $100 to get more information. Even asking prices
are not listed. Agency spokesman Eric Mangan said that's because,
''We feel the private sector market is the best indicator of the
market value.''
</P>
<P>
   On one site, a 370-acre lot in Kings Park, Long Island,
potential buyers are advised of environmental restrictions. The
listing says the owner must maintain a 3-1 open space ratio and
preserve old-growth forests. Activists around the Kings Park site
were successful in getting the state to reserve 150 acres of
parkland, and have urged the state to keep more land from
development.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the Kings Park listing, the Empire State Development
Corp. does not mention significant environmental or historical
features on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Werbizky questioned this method.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the limestone castle-like 1866 building that
housed the nation's first hospital intended strictly to treat
alcohol as a disease. Overlooking the city, the New York State
Inebriate Asylum, later known as the Binghamton State Hospital, is
a national historic landmark and listed among the National Trust
for Historic Preservation's ''Eleven Most Endangered Historic
Places.''
</P>
<P>
   But New York state's advertisements mention neither its national
historic landmark nor its ''endangered'' status. They do, however,
say it's a spectacular site that enjoys riverside views and easy
access from Interstate 81.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way it's marketed isn't conducive to attaining a
preservation-minded developer,'' said Werbizky.
</P>
<P>
   Binghamton Mayor Richard Bucci is not as worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's on a hill located in the heart of a residential
neighborhood -- we're going to make sure what goes there is
compatible,'' he said. Bucci added that the city doesn't typically
get involved in land sales -- but would step in if an owner wanted
to demolish the historic site.
</P>
<P>
   Empire State Development contends it cannot advertise every
feature on the Web site and argues the same point as Bucci -- that
local authorities will retain control over development.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't put a shovel in the ground until they get zoning in
place,'' Mangan said of potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The sales arrangements also seem satisfactory for officials in
Ogdensburg -- where the state is hawking 260 acres on a peninsula
fronting the St. Lawrence River.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pretty pragmatic up here in the North Country, we need
development'' said John Krol, Ogdensburg city manager.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that since there are no wetlands, he cannot think of
any other environmental roadblocks. ''We're blessed with a great
deal of open space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving open space, though, was part of the reason New York
voters in 1996 approved the $1.75 billion Clean Water-Clean Air
bond, according to John Stouffer, of the New York chapter of the
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's ironic for New Yorkers to spend millions in bond
money and they're going around selling properties that if they
didn't own them would be eligible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stouffer added that the momentum of a sale would be hard for
smaller communities to stop and that's why state officials need to
keep more land for public use instead of trying to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no evaluation of whether the lands could be used for
recreation or whether there were rare (animal or plant) species,''
Stouffer said.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven members of the state Assembly agree. They've
proposed regulating the sales of state-owned land. The legislation
would require the state to determine if the sites are within
protected areas, and it advocates the use of a scoring system to
determine which lands are the most ecologically valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Empire State Development officials, though, say there's no need
to further survey the properties, and that they are aware of every
unique feature on the properties since the state has owned the
lands for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the dome in the J.N. Adam building may prove the critics'
point.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after saying it felt confident each property had been
adequately catalogued, Mangan said the agency only recently learned
of the potential significance of the Tiffany dome in the J.N. Adam
building. The agency said it is now considering options for its
preservation.

<HEADLINE> Disputed O'Keeffe Works a Mystery  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The land was flat, the sky luminous --
and for prairie-born Georgia O'Keeffe, West Texas was inspiration
for revolutionary watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   But how many of the paintings were really hers?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight watercolors that surfaced in 1988 -- two years after
O'Keeffe's death -- were initially welcomed as hers. But last fall,
their authenticity was challenged because paper used for some of
them could not have been obtained in the United States during the
period, 1916-18, that O'Keeffe taught art at West Texas Normal
College in Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art excluded the ''Canyon Suite'' from
O'Keeffe's ''Catalogue Raisonne,'' dealer Gerald Peters refunded
the $5 million that a Kansas City museum paid for them, and Peters
says those 28 works will never be resold.
</P>
<P>
   Asked their value, he said: ''It is zero. They're not going back
on the marketplace. It's just not the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said he had 10 to 20 art experts analyze the watercolors
before they were credited to O'Keeffe and sold to the Kemper Museum
of Contemporary Art in Kansas City. He said he believes the
authenticators acted in good faith and just didn't catch the paper
anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   He still believes most of the 28 watercolors are O'Keeffe's. He
is less certain about how the pictures came to light.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears as though someone added something to the pot,''
Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of their discovery is well-known in West Texas: A
former art department chairman, Emilio Caballero, an acclaimed
watercolorist, presented a packet of watercolors to his son and
daughter-in-law, who thought they might be O'Keeffes and sought to
authenticate them. Caballero has been quoted as saying he never
opened the package he received from longtime O'Keeffe friend Ted
Reid. Caballero gave it to his son and daughter-in-law, Terry Reid
Caballero, Reid's granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Caballero did not return messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   David Rindlisbacher, an art professor at West Texas, says
Caballero never claimed the paintings were O'Keeffe's. But
Rindlisbacher finds it odd that Caballero would not have looked
inside the packet he received from Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one at WT knew anything about these paintings,'' said
Rindlisbacher, 50, also a longtime friend of Reid, who died in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another Reid friend, former WT art chairman Steve Mayes, said
Reid insisted that despite his friendship with O'Keeffe he had none
of her work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never heard he had anything like that,'' Mayes said of the
28 watercolors. ''I find it odd that Ted would tell one story, then
act in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayes, who now teaches art at Arkansas State University, was art
chairman at WT from 1977-88.
</P>
<P>
   There are many undisputed O'Keeffe watercolors from Canyon.
O'Keeffe herself talked about them in her 1976 book, ''Georgia
O'Keeffe,'' and in a PBS interview with New York art historian
Barbara Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had nothing but to walk into nowhere and the wide sunset
space with the star,'' she wrote of one series of watercolors
called ''Evening Star'' that she painted at Canyon in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Born Nov. 15, 1887, in Sun Prairie, Wis., O'Keeffe in 1916
became chairwoman of the art department at West Texas Normal, now
Texas A&AMP;M's West Texas campus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the brilliance of the newfound watercolors convinced
the art world lost O'Keeffes had materialized, said Peters,
''because they're fantastic, they're absolutely compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, the National Gallery and the Georgia O'Keeffe
Foundation began collaborating on the O'Keeffe catalog and doubt
began to stir. Barbara Buhler Lynes, now curator of the Georgia
O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, was chosen to compile the catalog,
investigating more than 2,000 works. The two-volume catalog
excludes 250 works including the Canyon Suite, National Gallery
spokeswoman Deborah Ziska said.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Keeffe didn't paint them, who did?
</P>
<P>
   That may never be known.
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Fe man, Jacobo ''Jackie'' Suazo, has asserted copyright
claims for at least three watercolors, which he said he did as a
boy painting with O'Keeffe. He said he met her when he was 9{ and
lived with her.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo, 65, estimated he painted about 100 works, either alone or
in collaboration with O'Keeffe. He said he tried to get his
paintings from O'Keeffe near the end of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried going over there, but they would never let me in,'' he
said. ''I didn't know whether my paintings were even still there or
they had thrown them away.''
</P>
<P>
   When she died, he received $30,000 from the estate but no
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Suazo saw a photograph of a Canyon Suite painting in a
newspaper and headed for Kansas City, where he told Kemper museum
officials some of the watercolors were his.
</P>
<P>
   But Suazo told The Associated Press he never met Ted Reid and
cannot explain how pictures he painted in the 1940s in Abiquiu
could get mixed in with pictures that supposedly originated 30
years earlier -- before he was born -- in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the FBI decided against investigating the
Canyon Suite controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to open up a full investigation due to a lack
of jurisdiction,'' Supervisory Special Agent Doug Beldon said. ''It
looks like the issues will best be dealt with in a civil setting.''

<HEADLINE> Nine Killed in Indian Mine Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- A land mine exploded on Saturday, killing
eight police officers and their driver, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were on patrol duty when the vehicle they were
traveling in hit the land mine in the Garhwa district in southern
Bihar, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believed rebels of the outlawed People's War
Group were responsible for the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The PWG is fighting to carve out a homeland for tribal
communities in Bihar and three adjoining states. It accuses rich
farm owners of exploiting poor laborers by denying them fair wages,
seizing property and raping women. They allegedly target policemen
who they believe back the rich against the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bihar's director general of police, K.A. Jacob, said he believed
the attack was in retaliation for a gunbattle last week when 11 PWG
activists were killed.

<HEADLINE> Crews Rush To Bring Mozambique Aid  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Blessed with a full day of sunshine
and receding waters, aid groups on Saturday stepped up food
deliveries to 1 million flood victims in central and southern
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   With previously impassable roads opening up, the international
relief effort was expected to gain pace. In the largest overland
delivery so far, trucks carrying 52 tons of food left the Indian
Ocean port of Beira and headed south to the hard-hit city of Save.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials welcomed the rare stretch of sunny skies. Heavy
rains during the past few days had grounded many helicopters and
clogged some key roads, and food supplies were beginning to back up
in warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been able to supply the key areas, and with the good
weather we plan to fan out to more remote places,'' said Lindsey
Davies, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding that hit Mozambique last month was the worst here
on record. Walls of water from overflowing rivers submerged towns,
and thousands of people spent days clinging to trees and rooftops
with no food or drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 1 million people were driven from their homes or saw their
crops and other property destroyed. Some aid groups fear that
thousands were killed. An accurate count is unlikely until the
waters finish receding, but to date only a few hundred have been
confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   At least a quarter million flood victims remained in 89
makeshift camps in central and southern Mozambique on Saturday, two
weeks after the floodwaters peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there was a pressing need to move relief supplies
overland. Many flood victims were still stranded Saturday in
hard-to-reach rural areas, forcing relief teams to rely heavily on
helicopters -- an expensive and inefficient way to deliver food. The
helicopters, supplied mostly by the militaries of several Western
nations, can carry only a few tons of food per trip.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 59 aircraft are taking part in the aid operation and
more than 2,200 international personnel are in Mozambique. About
half are from foreign militaries, including the United States,
Germany, Britain, Spain and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Maj. Joseph Wehrle, the commander of the U.S. relief
mission, said Saturday that U.S. officials had been asked to send
high-tech airplanes over remote areas of Mozambique in search of
more stranded flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is that everyone is nervous,'' Wehrle told reporters
in the capital, Maputo. ''This is a very big country and there
could be some folks somewhere. We won't know until we look.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical teams are on the lookout for possible epidemics in the
camps. Many camps still lack tents, clean water and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In and around the capital, there has been an increase in
malaria, and 10 cholera cases have been confirmed in recent days,
the aid group Doctors Without Borders said. But both those
illnesses occur regularly in Mozambique, and as yet, there have
been no major outbreaks in the camps.
</P>
<P>
   There have been sporadic reports of looting, though. Police in
the southern coastal city of Xai-Xai said they had arrested a gang
that had been navigating the still-submerged city in two boats and
stealing goods from homes and shops. Mozambique Foreign Minister
Leonardo Simao said looting was not a serious problem, but he urged
police to publicize the names of those caught stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say it's still too soon for refugees to return home
in the river valleys where the worst flooding took place. Although
some villages and towns are no longer under water, the government
fears that another round of heavy rains could again trigger
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The government and aid agencies are working to get seeds and
basic farming tools to villagers in time for the spring planting
season. The government plans to hold an international conference
next month to begin looking at long-term reconstruction needs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in nearby Madagascar, relief supplies were airlifted
Saturday to flooded regions on the eastern coast amid reports that
the northern areas of the Indian Ocean island weathered
back-to-back tropical storms better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The national disaster agency previously had said flooding left
730,000 people homeless or destroyed their crops or property. On
Saturday, it put the number at 469,370.

<HEADLINE> Newark leads the nation again in flight delays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- For the eighth time in nine years, Newark
International Airport has topped the list as the worst in the
nation for flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration report stated that about
36,500 -- or 7.89 percent -- of Newark's 463,000 flights were delayed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA figures, released on Friday, showed that Newark and
LaGuardia were first and second in the nation for percentage of
flight's delayed, with John F. Kennedy International dropping a
notch to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Third and fourth place on the list went to Chicago O'Hare
International and San Francisco International.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, Newark has missed first place on the list only once
-- when O'Hare took the top spot in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 percent of last year's flight delays around the country
were blamed on weather. Newark's weather-related delays made up 76
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Newark's late flights were delayed an average of 50
minutes, compared with 40 minutes at LaGuardia and 36 minutes at
JFK. The national average last year was 43 minutes on 353,244 -- or
2 percent -- of the 20.6 million flights handled by air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said Newark's chronic flight delays are the
result of its location in the nation's most congested airspace,
handling more flights and passengers than any other nearby airport
and being in a region particularly prone to inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a title we are not proud of,'' Dan D'Agostino,
head of the Newark division of the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association, said. ''It's something we definitely want to get rid
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Air travel problems made up the bulk of complaints lodged with
the federal Department of Transportation last year, accounting for
7,129 of the 20,495 letters the agency received. In 1998, the DOT
received 9,608 letters, 2,552 complaining about air travel.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Friday announced a plan to curb flight
delays at the nation's airports during spring and summer
thunderstorms by having the FAA share high-tech weather forecasts
and help redirect traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to avoid a repeat of last year, when more than 1,200
planes were delayed daily due to some of the worst summer storms on
record.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were 197,531 air traffic control delays
between April and August last year, 36 percent higher than that
period the year before.

<HEADLINE> French Support US Death Row Inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Several thousand people marched through Paris on
Saturday to press for a new trial for Mumia Abu-Jamal, the former
Black Panther on death row in Pennsylvania for the 1981 shooting of
a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators marched peacefully through the Right Bank from
the Place de la Republique to the Place de la Madeleine. They held
a banner reading ''Liberty and Justice for Mumia Abu-Jamal.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said that some 2,000 people took part in the march, while
organizers put the figure at 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of groups, unions and some leftist political parties
backed the demonstration, organized by the National Collective in
Support of Mumia Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   The group claims to have gathered 100,000 signatures in support
of freedom and a new trial for Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, 45, a one-time Black Panther and radio journalist,
was convicted of fatally shooting a Philadelphia police officer in
1981 after the officer stopped Abu-Jamal's brother for driving the
wrong way down a city street.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal has repeatedly claimed his innocence, and his cause
has drawn international support, in part because of his 1995 book,
''Live From Death Row,'' about race and the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal's backers claim he did not get a fair trial. Amnesty
International, which opposes the death penalty, and
France-Libertes, the human rights foundation of former French first
lady Danielle Mitterrand, are among those calling for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   One support group, Freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal, resorted to
violence in November, damaging three U.S.-related buildings in
Zurich, Switzerland, to make its voice heard. The Paris offices of
the International Herald Tribune were occupied earlier in November
by another support group.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Washington, police arrested about 185 people
outside the Supreme Court, which turned down an appeal by Abu-Jamal
in October. That same day in San Francisco, another 164 people were
arrested during a protest for blocking the sidewalk in front of the
federal appeals court building.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in Philadelphia is expected to reach a decision
on a new appeal by April 2.

<HEADLINE> Baia Mare Romania's Polluted City  </HEADLINE>
By ANCA PADURARU, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAIA MARE, Romania (AP) -- After the second major pollution spill
in six weeks, most residents of this northwestern town agree that
they live in Romania's most polluted region.
</P>
<P>
   But the mines and factories which foul the air, poison the
rivers and ruin the soil also provide jobs in a country where there
aren't many.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a simple argument. Rather than dying of hunger now, I
would prefer to die later of pollution,'' said Rozalia Cosma, head
of the environmental lab at a lead processing company.
</P>
<P>
   Baia Mare gained international infamy when cyanide spilled from
a nearby reservoir on Jan. 30, sending poisonous water gushing into
the Tisza and Danube Rivers, killing hundreds of tons of fish in
four southeastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a dam at a state-owned zinc and lead plant burst just
60 miles away, sending 20,000 tons of deadly zinc, lead and iron
into the same rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But while the international community has been shocked by these
environmental disasters, the 150,000 residents of Baia Mare, a town
sheltered by fir covered hills near the Hungarian and Ukrainian
borders, have long become accustomed to levels of pollution which
most Europeans and Americans would find intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   According to local health officials, Baia Mare's residents on
average die six years before reaching the national average life
expectancy of 69. Children and adults suffer from lead poisoning,
decaying teeth and respiratory diseases due to the noxious cocktail
of gases spewed into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Sasar river, which flows through the city, has no life in
it. Environmentalists say it carries a deadly mixture of zinc,
copper, manganese and cadmium.
</P>
<P>
   According to public health statistics, some 11,000 workers in
Baia Mare are suffering from some kind of work-related disease.
Workers here are 30 times more likely to suffer a job-related
disease than counterparts in Bucharest, where 10 percent of the
country's industry is located.
</P>
<P>
   But the 11 mines and three factories in this city, 265 miles
northwest of Bucharest, provide jobs in a country with double-digit
unemployment and an average monthly income of less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cristian Anghel acknowledges the dangerously high levels
of pollution, but argues that people need jobs. ''We have to favor
both sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution has been a problem in the region since former
Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu began an industrialization
program in the 1960s with scant regard for people's health or the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem continues because the skilled labor force,
willing to take big risks for low wages, has attracted foreign
investors. Australia's Esmeralda Exploration Ltd., which bought
half of the Aurul gold mine in 1997, was warmly welcomed when it
brought 3,000 jobs to Baia Mare with few people questioning the
company's environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   After the January spill, however, some are having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in nearby Bozanta Mare complain they cannot sell their
milk, cheese or organically grown vegetables because townspeople
are afraid to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walk the streets like a leper in the Bible: nobody sees me,
nobody touches me, and nobody wants to buy from me anymore,'' said
Ilie Mihut, 55, who used to supplement his $43 monthly pension by
selling milk, cheese and eggs. He fears he may be forced to leave
the village because experts warned the cyanide from the spill will
permeate the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Mihut believes that once the international furor over the spill
fades and international organizations such as the United Nations
and the European Union withdraw, Aurul will continue to pollute
their community.
</P>
<P>
   Romanians are unaccustomed to filing lawsuits against the
authorities and are skeptical whether the limited amount of funds
promised so far by the government will ever reach them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let God's will be done. We don't know whether we will die
today or tomorrow,'' said Mihut, leaning on his slatted fence and
casting his eyes down to the muddy road.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Want Kohl Prosecuted  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- About 300 protesters marched to Helmut Kohl's posh
Berlin apartment Saturday, demanding that the former chancellor be
prosecuted for his role in his party's financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, led by prominent arts figures that included
German actors Meret and Ben Becker, called for Kohl to be put on
trial for accepting $1 million in illegal political contributions
during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''The constitution must apply to every citizen equally,'' said
Axel Zawierucha, a protester.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Bonn are considering charging Kohl for his
actions while he was chairman of the Christian Democrats for over a
quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Der Spiegel magazine reported Saturday that, after
analyzing dozens of files pertaining to the slush funds Kohl set up
to keep off-the-books donations secret from other party officials,
prosecutors believe they would be able to make a case for breach of
trust.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bonn prosecutors' office, Bernd Koenig,
denied that prosecutors had already decided that a fine would not
be enough to resolve the case, as the magazine also reported. But
he refused to comment further on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his office, Kohl's lawyers denied that
any crime had been committed and said they expected the 10-week-old
investigation to be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ''To speak of a 'hardening of suspicion' is absolutely out of
the question,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   All the money was used for legal political activities, the
lawyers said in the statement. Kohl himself has said the money went
to help establish the party in the former communist eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   But his refusal to name the donors has triggered a parliamentary
investigation into charges -- denied by Kohl -- that cash might have
been traded for government favors.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's lawyers also accused prosecutors of trying to circumvent
the will of parliament, which specifically left criminal penalties
out of party financing laws. Violations instead are to be punished
by fines against the party itself, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's announcement Thursday that he had collected millions in
new -- this time declared -- donations to cover any potential fines
was interpreted by some as an effort to show prosecutors that he
was not causing the party financial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl also said he wanted to end months of seclusion and return
to his seat in parliament next Friday, when lawmakers are to
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the first democratic elections
in East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's newly selected parliamentary leader, Friedrich
Merz, advised Kohl against showing up at the Reichstag, saying he
could help the Christian Democrats more as an ''elder statesman''
in the background.

<HEADLINE> Report: Truckers Pile Up Violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Truck drivers suspected of getting their licenses
through a bribery scheme in Illinois racked up scores of traffic
convictions in New York and were involved in at least 40 accidents,
according to a joint investigation by two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Sun-Times and the Daily News of New York found that
dozens of those drivers swapped Illinois licenses for fresh
licenses in New York and at least eight other states. The
investigation was published in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six drivers tracked to New York had 148 traffic
convictions, the newspapers reported. And 25 were involved in at
least 40 crashes, including 28 that caused injuries. Many of those
accidents occurred in cars, not trucks, and none was fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White announced Friday that he
has warned 11 other states that drivers may have traded tainted
Illinois licenses for licenses elsewhere. White suggests those
states re-test the truckers.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Brown, a spokesman for the New York Department of Motor
Vehicles, said his agency will require 102 drivers to take New
York's written and road tests. If they refuse, their licenses will
be suspended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aggressively pursuing these people with fraudulent
licenses to get them off the nation's highways,'' Brown told the
Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   A federal investigation dubbed ''Operation Safe Road'' has
uncovered widespread bribery under Illinois Secretary of State
George Ryan, now the governor. Hundreds of people are suspected of
obtaining commercial drivers licenses by paying bribes to low-level
government employees, who then donated some of the money to Ryan's
political fund.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 30 people have been charged, with 22 pleading guilty.
Ryan has repeatedly denied any involvement and has not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   White spokesman Dave Druker said 175 drivers exchanged their
Illinois licenses for licenses in other states. As a result,
Illinois has no power to force them to take a legitimate license
test.
</P>
<P>
   New York, by far, has the largest number of drivers who
originally were licensed in Illinois -- 115. The rest are scattered
among California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The White administration ordered 510 Illinois truckers to retake
their tests. Only 171 -- or one-third -- performed well enough to
keep their licenses and the same driving privileges, Druker said.

<HEADLINE> Journal Studies Science of Ordinary  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The mysterious silence of passengers in
office elevators. The political significance of a morning shave.
The cultural impact of plain talk among friends.
</P>
<P>
   Do those sound like boring subjects? Not to the editors of the
Journal of Mundane Behavior, which tries to fill a void in social
science research with scholarly analyses of the ordinary, earthy
and just plain normal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to make it so that we look at everyday life as
something that's valuable and to understand how it gets
constructed,'' said Scott Schaffer, the journal's managing editor
and a sociology instructor at California State University,
Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer and co-editor Myron Orleans started the online
publication in response to what they believe is sociology's
emphasis on deviancy -- sort of a Jerry Springer takeover of their
field. Instead, Mundane Behavior's theme mirrors ''Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the popular sitcom, the journal seemingly about nothing
strives to find something deeper in all the little things in
ordinary lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of us don't live Jerry Springer lives,'' Schaffer says.
''We get up at some ungodly hour, live in a 6-by-6-foot cubicle for
eight or more hours, reverse the insane commute and go home to our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amounts to probably 60 percent or more of our lives,'' he
says. ''And the editors here think that this vast amount of energy,
effort and, in some cases, sheer drudgery, deserves some
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first edition of the peer-reviewed journal, an article on
shaving analyzes how facial hair defines masculinity. Another
report shows how small talk promulgates a culture. And a third
reviews how the Japanese see an elevator ride as a ''respite from a
norm-governed society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists say the study of mundane behavior is nothing new,
and mainstream journals devote many pages to such analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to sort of step back from everything that we take
for granted and say, 'What's really going on here, anyway?''' said
William Roy of the University of California, Los Angeles. ''A fish
is the last creature to ever notice water.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schaffer and Orleans want to expand the journal's scope
beyond sociology -- the study of interaction among people -- to
include history, political science, literature, art and anything
else touched by normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea sprang from a 1998 article published in the journal
Sociological Theory. Wayne Brekhus of the University of Missouri
complained that there were many journals devoted to extreme
behavior but nothing concentrating on the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Brekhus, who studied the lives of suburban gay men, said many of
his subjects suggested he talk to gays in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''They saw little in their lives that would be of interest to a
social scientist and attempted to direct me to where I might find
the 'type of gays' that social scientists write about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brekhus' half-joking call for a journal to study the mundane
caught the attention of Schaffer and Orleans. They sent out e-mail
notices six months ago requesting papers and launched the Web site,
www.mundanebehavior.org.
</P>
<P>
   They received a handful of e-mails wondering if it was a hoax.
They also got three times as many submissions as they could use for
the debut issue. The next journal will be posted in June.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Short Pakistan Stay  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juggling U.S. foreign policy interests and
distaste for the military regime, President Clinton will spend only
five hours in Pakistan during a visit this month, tending strictly
to business.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts with a five-day visit to India, traveling widely
in the country and paying homage to India's landmarks and
democratic ways.
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that cannot be lost on the government of Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in October in Pakistan and has
failed to set a sure timetable for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to go, holding his nose all the while, is in
line with a tradition of American presidents and secretaries of
state who opt for tending to important business even while
disapproving of the regime with which they must deal.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, diplomatic but unmistakable ways of signaling
disapproval include not accepting the hospitality of an overnight
stay, avoiding historic sites and, above all, making the visit as
brief as possible with only business on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Stays in Syria, for instance, tend to be short, reflecting
disapproval with its authoritarian ways and what the State
Department concludes is support for terrorism. Still, Clinton and
secretaries of state for more than a quarter-century have traveled
to Damascus in the interest of promoting peace with Israel. And
President Nixon traveled to China in 1972 during that country's
repressive Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided last week to stop in Pakistan only after weeks
of debate and consultation with experts inside and outside the U.S.
government and with members of Congress. His visit will be short,
businesslike and confined to the capital, Islamabad. The U.S. side,
at least, will try to minimize the publicity, planning no joint
Clinton-Musharraf public appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the president to go ahead were private promises by
Musharraf that he would meet with Taliban leaders in Afghanistan
about uprooting terrorist camps and ending the sanctuary given
Osama bin Laden, the accused mastermind of a terrorism network.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will emphasize U.S. concern with the nuclear arms race
between India and Pakistan, a need to stem the spread of such
weapons, and U.S. allegations that terrorists are being trained in
Pakistan-held territory. Still, the visit will be without much
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Large counties whose engagement is deemed vital for the United
States, on the other hand, are often treated far more kindly, even
when there are strong differences.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's trip to China in 1972 was made because the president was
determined to establish U.S. relations with the world's most
populous nation. He extolled the long history and rich culture of
the communist country.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, was similarly
solicitous of Beijing and made a number of high-profile visits
after a secret mission in 1971. And, of course, presidential
summits and visits to Moscow were not curbed during the Cold War.
The Soviet Union, with its nuclear and military might, was wooed
and pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's more or less a fact of life,'' said Helmut Sonnenfeldt,
a former State Department and White House official now with the
Brookings Institution. ''Sometimes it gets a bit awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
at Tianamen Square in 1989, President George Bush sent top aides
Brent Scowcroft and Lawrence Eagleburger on a secret trip to
Beijing for what Bush considered to be important business:
registering strong U.S. disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Scowcroft and Eagleburger were depicted on
television clicking champagne glasses with their hosts, stirring
indignation back home that they even went to China at all.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Sonnenfeldt recalled a spirited debate within the
Nixon administration in 1972 over whether Nixon should call off a
summit to Moscow rather than risk being disinvited by Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev in protest of the U.S. saturation bombing
of North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon went ahead, guessing correctly that Brezhnev would choose
Soviet interests over public displays of displeasure with the U.S.
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the two leaders conducted serious business,
agreeing on nuclear weapons reductions and a ban on anti-missile
defenses. Brezhnev, concerned about Nixon's opening to China,
proposed a secret alliance against China, Kissinger recalled in his
memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   From the Soviet leader's perspective, foreign policy took
precedence over distaste for U.S. actions in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit will be the first presidential trip to South
Asia since Jimmy Carter visited India, but not Pakistan, in 1978.
If not the for coup, Clinton would have stayed longer in Pakistan
and traveled about the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is going.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's essential,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., who
lobbied Clinton's security adviser, Sandy Berger, to make the stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a unique situation,'' Brownback said in an interview.
''You have the most volatile region of the world, two nuclear-armed
belligerents sharing a volatile spot that I consider a pool of gas
waiting on a match, which is Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton did not go to Pakistan, Brownback said, ''he would
strengthen militant fundamentalists. The people waiting in the
wings after Musharraf are not Jefferson democrats. They are
militant fundamentalists who possibly would create the next
Afghanistan in Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl R. Inderfurth, the assistant secretary of state for South
Asian affairs, said in a separate interview, ''We are not choosing
one country over another. We want good and strong relations with
both countries. They are both important to us.''

<HEADLINE> Violence Soars in LAPD Scandal Area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gang-related violence increased nearly 40
percent in the area of Los Angeles plagued by a police corruption
scandal, figures showed.
</P>
<P>
   Police in January and February recorded 151 violent gang-related
crimes, ranging from extortion to rape and murder, in the city's
Rampart area. That compared to 108 crimes for the same period in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The increase follows the suspension last fall of two
court-ordered injunctions that barred known street gang members
from congregating. The injunctions were based on sworn statements
from police officers who had lost their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a blip, or it could be that gang members are being
more brazen since the injunctions have been lifted,'' said Capt.
Robert Hansohn, who heads the Rampart division. ''It also could be
some gang fight beneath the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampart, located between downtown and Hollywood, has been one of
the city's most violent and gang-infested areas.
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the sanctions makes gang members ''feel they've
been given the green light to go back and terrorize people, and
it's going to get worse,'' argued Ted Hunt, president of the Police
Protective League, the union representing police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption scandal has centered on a group of anti-gang
officers in the Rampart station. Former Officer Rafael Perez has
alleged that officers framed innocent people. Since the scandal
broke last year, more than 40 convictions have been overturned and
at least 20 officers have been relieved of duty.

<HEADLINE> New Norwegian Premier Faces Clouds  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The man about to become Norway's
youngest-ever prime minister said Saturday he will take into
account the environmental issue that helped topple the prior
government when he names his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to it,'' said Jens Stoltenberg, a former
oil minister and finance minister for the Labor Party. ''It will be
exciting, educational and important. It will also be demanding, and
I will face conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoltenberg, who turns 41 next week, is to become the country's
youngest premier ever. Labor had hoped his youth, charm and
popularity would counter flagging support for the nation's largest
political force.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before he even takes office next week, Stoltenberg has
environmentalists, factions of his own party and the political
opposition against him over the building of natural gas power
plants -- a proposal he supports.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor party helped topple a popular coalition led by
Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik with a vote of no
confidence Thursday over the construction of natural gas power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bondevik, who formed the coalition in October 1997, refused to
weaken anti-pollution laws to allow the plants, as demanded by a
parliamentary majority. His was the first government to quit over
an environmental issue in Norway, the world's second largest oil
exporter. He resigned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Stoltenberg and other proponents of the plants say the plants
would reduce pollution in Europe by cutting Norway's imports of
dirty coal power. The outgoing government wanted to wait until new
technology can reduce the plant's emissions of climate-damaging
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced plans to create a new government next week,
Stoltenberg acknowledged he would have to consider own party's
split view on gas power when he named his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to take into account many things, including
environmental issues, when putting together a government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's powerful youth auxiliary, which Stoltenberg led in the
1980s, opposes the plants. Norway's environmental movement has
vowed not to give Stoltenberg any peace.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is just one of the challenges facing Stoltenberg,
often described by the nation's media as the wonder boy of
Norwegian politics, or ''Norway's Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor has just 65 seats in the 165-member parliament, and none
of the other six parties are willing to enter an alliance with
Stoltenberg's government. That means he will have to negotiate
support for every matter he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boy will have a tough time,'' said Lars Sponheim, a member
of the outgoing government.
</P>
<P>
   Labor named Stoltenberg as its parliamentary leader and prime
minister candidate a month ago, replacing former Prime Minister
Thorbjoern Jagland, who remains party leader.

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Prison Riot in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Prisoners rampaging through a
cellblock in midwestern Brazil left 13 inmates dead and three
others wounded Saturday, a prison guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising began after breakfast in one of the three
cellblocks at the Mata Grande Penitentiary in Rondonopolis, 1,110
miles northwest of Rio, Tome Lima said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   About 17 prisoners armed with handmade knives overpowered four
guards and forced them to open an adjacent cellblock controlled by
a rival gang, Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebelling inmates roamed through the cellblock, killing
their enemies, he said. The dispute apparently was for control of
the drug trade in the prison.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours, police invaded the prison and regained
control.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising was the fourth since the prison was inaugurated in
November. Unlike most Brazilian prisons, overcrowding is not a
problem at Mata Grande, which holds only about half its capacity of
700 inmates.

<HEADLINE> Impasse over gaming ends land negotiations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- An end to the contentious, more than
25-year-old Oneida Indian Nation land claim has been further
prolonged because of New York State's fight over video lottery
machines.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Judge Neal McCurn on Friday declared an impasse in
negotiations between the Indians and New York State. That came
after state officials refused to drop from the talks a lawsuit
filed against the nation over slot-like gaming machines at the
Turning Stone Casino in Verona.
</P>
<P>
   The state's stand exasperated the court-appointed mediator, the
Indian nation, and people living on the 250,000 acres of disputed
land. All now expect a lengthy and costly federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am frankly disgusted that the state of New York could not
find a way to sign a stipulation which all the other parties signed
that would have kept this process moving forward and probably
gotten settled,'' said Ronald Riccio, the Seton Hall law school
dean appointed to mediate the talks a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the table were lands in Madison and Oneida counties, and
sales and property taxes, casino gaming and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   None of the issues outside the land claim would be resolved in a
trial, which would focus on the amount of damages owed the Oneidas
by the state. McCurn suggested removing all the side issues from
the discussions except the lottery machines. All the parties except
New York State agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's office said dropping its 1995 lawsuit over
the gaming machines would have been unfair to taxpayers. The state
has claimed the Oneida's lottery machines were never approved. ''We
are going to continue to fight this lawsuit,'' spokesman Michael
McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that the judge is trying to tie our hands, and we will
not consent, because we want to protect the landowners and
taxpayers,'' McKeon added.
</P>
<P>
   The state purchased the land from the Oneidas in the 18th and
19th centuries and the Oneidas, who live in Wisconsin, Canada, and
New York, filed a lawsuit over the transaction in 1974. The U.S.
Supreme Court found in 1985 that the land was seized in illegal
transactions and ruled the Oneidas are entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the federal government sided with the Oneidas and filed
an amended complaint naming 20,000 landowners as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations which began a year ago hit a snag publicly in the
fall over several issues. Oneida Nation representative Ray
Halbritter accused the counties of jeopardizing negotiations by
taking steps to foreclose on tax delinquent Oneida-owned land. The
state and counties accused Halbritter of ruining negotiations by
seeking the federal government's approval to serve liquor at the
Turning Stone Casino.
</P>
<P>
   A three-day gathering at Riccio's Seton Hall Law School office
in January renewed optimism that a settlement would be reached. All
parties said they wanted to continue settlement talks for a few
months longer.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn, who just finished presiding over the Cayuga Indian
Nation land claim trial, which ended in a $37 million recommended
award for that tribe, had ordered lawyers to appear in court Friday
in Fort Myers, Fla., where he was acting as a visiting judge.
McCurn had asked lawyers to argue why negotiations should continue
after Riccio submitted a confidential report detailing the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal that failed Friday, state and federal
governments would have paid the Oneidas $500 million. The deal
would have also allowed the sale of about 1,000 acres of land
somewhere in New York to the Oneidas and would have required the
Indians to promise that people would not be forced from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn asked Friday that all the parties spend another 60 days
negotiating that offer, and all but the state agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Few parties held out much hope for further talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suppose it could always be revived if the state of New York
comes to its senses,'' Riccio said. ''Otherwise, it's going to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a rotten deal,'' said Rocco DiVeronica, Madison County
Board of Supervisors chairman. ''You know how many people have been
working on this, and it ends up being a casino gaming problem and
not a land claim problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision disappointed, but did not surprise, some of
the landowners sued by the Oneidas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't blame the Indians as much as I blame the
politicians,'' said Ronald Siderine, a Sherrill resident. ''This is
something I think could have been settled a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Siderine, said that before building his home in 1990, he
contacted public officials about potential problems with the claim.
They assured him there would be no problems despite the unresolved
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''They let people build houses and start their lives here and
nothing was ever said,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Says He's Weighing Options  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain says he's not ready to ride off into
the sunset just yet, and he won't give up fighting to preserve
Social Security and reform big money politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not bitter. I'm not going to indulge in recriminations.
There's no point to it,'' McCain said in an interview with The New
York Times, published in Saturday's editions, two days after he
bowed out of the race, ceding the GOP presidential nomination to
George W. Bush. ''The game's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said he is hesitant to release his delegates to
the Republican presidential nominating convention until he can
figure out how to push his proposals to reform campaign financing
and use budget surpluses to pay down the national debt and boost
Social Security -- centerpieces of his suspended White House bid --
instead of for deeper tax cuts like Bush wants.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he planned to retain the bloc of 247 delegates he
won so far, including in seven states where he beat Bush, rather
than ''let someone take them away from me'' or release them
himself. He said he wasn't seeking a ''confrontation'' with the
Texas governor or with the Republican party but he wants to keep
his options open, including a possible convention platform fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to go slow and not make a dumb decision,'' said
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said that since exiting the race on Thursday
he has been flooded with letters, faxes and other messages of
support from voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''One way or another, they all say, 'I believe in you,''' McCain
said. ''There are these millions of people out there, a lot of them
people who had never voted before, and I'm not going to desert
them. I'm not going to betray them by saying adios and riding off
into the sunset.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who ended his campaign after losing Super Tuesday
primaries to the Texas governor in New York, California, Ohio and
most other states outside of New England said he does not know
exactly how ''to carry forward this program that attracted so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters on Capitol Hill have been reaching out to McCain
backers, although most Republicans oppose the Arizona senator's
ideas to reform campaign financing by banning so-called soft money
-- funds political parties use for issues ads that essentially help
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where can we work together in the Senate?'' McCain asked,
saying he would ''wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning as a maverick outsider, McCain appealed to
independents and even Democrats as he rolled across the country in
his ''Straight Talk Express'' bus, but Bush dominated the GOP vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain quit, he didn't shut down his campaign
operation, a technicality that keeps his options open, including
stumping the country pushing his issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had no intention of endorsing Bush until he
considered his options.
</P>
<P>
   ''I and my supporters both deserve a pause,'' McCain said,
adding that he will return to the Senate on March 20 after a brief
holiday abroad. ''I intend to address the situation with great
care. The main idea is to go slow. There's a long time until
November.''

<HEADLINE> Romanian Threatens Mining Companies  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romania's environment minister
Saturday threatened to close mining companies that do not respect
the government's safety regulations, a day after 20,000 tons of
heavy metal escaped from a zinc and lead mine in northwestern
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accident, which came six weeks after a deadly cyanide
spill, occurred Friday when melting snow and torrential rains broke
a dam at the state-owned Baia Borsa mine, 235 miles northwest of
Bucharest, sending a wave of zinc and lead-laden waters into Vaser
River.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of dead fish, and water samples
were being measured every two hours, Romanian state radio reported.
The worst floods in 30 years inundated the northwest region, making
work difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mining companies didn't take into account the regulations
we made,'' said Romica Tomescu, the environment minister. ''We will
move to close companies which do not comply with (our) regulations
for safe exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the mine, some 50 workers were mending the 75-foot-wide,
35-foot-high hole that formed in the dam. The governor of Maramures
county, Gheorghe Barlea, said the 2,400 employees at the zinc and
lead mine could lose their jobs if the company cannot come up with
another containment dam.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported that waters in the Vaser, Viseu and the
Romanian section of the Tisza rivers had dangerous levels of zinc,
iron and lead.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at noon Saturday, Tomescu said that heavy metal levels
on the Romanian section of the Tisza had substantially fallen.
Earlier, zinc was nine times higher than allowable levels and lead
was almost twice the acceptable limit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tisza forms a short section of the Romanian-Ukrainan border
and then enters Hungary and Yugoslavia before flowing into the
Danube, a major European waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The pollutants reached Hungarian territory Saturday in the early
evening hours, Hungarian state radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting Hungary might sue Romania, Hungarian Premier Viktor
Orban said: ''Hungary will have to resort to legal action'' if
similar damage cannot be avoided in future.
</P>
<P>
   The latest spill came six weeks after tons of cyanide-laden
waters spilled into a creek from the Aurul gold mine, 60 miles west
of Baia Borsa.
</P>
<P>
   The cyanide flowed into three Balkan rivers and the Danube,
killing fish and other wildlife and temporarily poisoning water
supplies for river communities.
</P>
<P>
   Janos Goenczy, a Hungarian government official said the latest
pollution was especially worrisome because parts of the Tisza which
had not been tainted by the cyanide pollution were now under threat
of heavy metal contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presence of heavy metals means it is a very insidious sort
of pollution, which can cause serious organic changes,'' Goenczy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Svoronos, head of Romania's Danube Delta natural reserve,
said he believed that the ore would not flow as far as the cyanide
because it would settle into the river beds.

<HEADLINE> Groom Rockwell Knows Joke Is on Him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Doomed groom Rick Rockwell says life is too
short to be taken seriously. At least, if the joke's on you.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, who married complete stranger Darva Conger in the
television special ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire'' last
month, returned to the comedy stage Friday ''to make light of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, who had worked as a comedian briefly before making his
money in real estate, calls it ''The Annulment Tour.'' Conger filed
to end the marriage Tuesday, saying the marriage was a fraud and
Rockwell never mentioned ''a history of problems'' with women,
including a restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's Friday show in Tempe sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I hear Darva is very intelligent, she speaks several
languages,'' he said. ''That must explains our vows. I heard 'til
death do us part.' I guess that is Swahili for 36 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell says he remains sincere about why he agreed to the TV
show.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was destiny,'' he said. ''It may not have been destiny
regarding relationships, but instead it gave me a chance to get out
there and do what I love again.''

   The march scheduled for Sunday -- the anniversary of the 1938
Nazi annexation of Austria -- can proceed, the court said. However,
the court refused to lift police orders forbidding the far-right
National Party of Germany from marching through the Brandenburg
Gate, a politically charged landmark in the former Nazi capital.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, about 500 neo-Nazis were allowed through the
gate during a protest against plans to erect a national Holocaust
memorial nearby. That Jan. 29 march, which set off a storm of media
criticism, was believed to be the first demonstration of its kind
through the gate since Nazi troops held their torchlight
processions.
</P>
<P>
   Police initially banned Sunday's planned march as a threat to
law and order, and the ban was upheld by a lower court. The appeals
court overturned the ban on free speech grounds. But in addition to
forbidding marchers from going through the gate, it said they
cannot carry any neo-Nazi symbols or flags.
</P>
<P>
   March organizers say they wanted to protest the European Union
sanctions leveled against Austria because of its inclusion of
Haider's far-right Freedom Party in government. Haider's party
campaigned on anti-immigration platforms and Haider made comments
sympathetic to Nazi labor policies in the past, though he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Several counter-demonstrations and rallies against far-right
extremism were also planned for Sunday.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actress Daryl Hannah passes time on the movie
set by practicing. Not her lines -- her purl.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah is a knitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm working on a movie, I can't really read a book while
I'm sitting in a makeup chair or getting my hair done,'' said the
39-year-old actress, who takes classes at a Studio City boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Knitting, once considered a craft for old ladies in rocking
chairs, is becoming popular with a hipper crowd. Hannah, Julia
Roberts, Hilary Swank and Julianne Moore are all learning the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something very meditative about the repetitive quality
of knitting,'' Hannah told the Daily News of Los Angeles for a
story Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah has yet to master purling -- a complicated inversion of
stitches to produce a ribbed effect -- but said she dreams of
eventually knitting herself a sweater that can accommodate her long
arms.

<HEADLINE> German Accused of Xenophobic Slogan  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A leading conservative politician hoping to become
governor of Germany's most populous state was accused Saturday of
running an ''anti-foreigner'' campaign along the lines of Austrian
far-right leader Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Ruettgers, who served as education minister under former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, adopted a campaign slogan this week calling
for Germany to focus its high-tech efforts on its own ''children
instead of Indians'' -- ''Kinder statt Inder'' in German.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is a reference to Social Democratic Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's recently announced plan to issue work permits
to 30,000 computer experts from India and other non-European Union
countries to ease a shortage of qualified personnel in Germany's
high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers, a Christian Democrat seeking to lead the western
state of North Rhine-Westphalia, has criticized the idea of
bringing more foreigners into Germany, and called for stepping up
the country's own educational efforts.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted charges of xenophobia Saturday from Franz
Muentefering, general secretary of the Social Democrats. Voters in
North Rhine-Westphalia do not want a leader who ''agitates against
foreigners in the manner of Haider,'' he said at a state party
convention in Bochum.
</P>
<P>
   Haider is stepping down as leader of the far-right Freedom
Party, which shares power with the conservative People's Party in
Austria's new government. He has attracted much voter support -- and
criticism -- with his vehement campaigns in Austria against
immigration and EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin appeals court overturned a ban Saturday on a neo-Nazi
march to support Haider. The march is planned for Sunday, the
anniversary of the 1938 Nazi annexation of Austria. But the court
ruled that the marchers from the far-right National Party of
Germany cannot carry neo-Nazi symbols or flags or go through the
Brandenburg Gate -- a politically charged landmark in the former
Nazi capital.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the same convention in Bochum, Schroeder angrily
accused Ruettgers of failing to promote high-tech education during
his term as Kohl's education, science and technology minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now (Ruettgers) believes he can cover up his own mistakes with
anti-foreigner slogans,'' Schroeder said, warning that such
''irresponsible, inflammatory slogans'' could hurt German
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The issue echoes the Christian Democrats' successful campaign
last year in the state of Hesse against the newly elected Schroeder
government's proposal to modernize Germany's blood-based
citizenship law.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives ousted Hesse's Social Democratic-led
government and forced Schroeder to water down provisions allowing
dual citizenship for children born to foreign nationals in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers has denied being anti-foreigner and defended his
position by saying he considered it ''immoral'' to pull the
''intellectual elite'' out from a Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   He has also called for abolishing bilingual education in public
schools, charging it promoted a ''multicultural society'' instead
of integration.
</P>
<P>
   Once dominated by coal mining and steel, North Rhine-Westphalia
in recent years has been transformed into a hub of high-tech,
telecommunications and media businesses centered around cities like
Cologne and Duesseldorf, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The state of 18 million includes a large population of foreign
workers from Turkey and southern and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Muentefering said Ruettgers was resorting to desperate measures
in his bid to unseat Social Democratic Gov. Wolfgang Clement in the
May 14 election. Ruettgers' chances have been hurt by a financial
scandal surrounding the Christian Democrats and their former
leader, Kohl.

<HEADLINE> Glitch, Medical Problem Delay Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A mechanical glitch followed by a medical
emergency forced a United Airlines flight back to Los Angeles --
twice -- before it finally arrived in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The flight departed Los Angeles International Airport for the
third time at 9:52 p.m. Friday and arrived in Maui around 1 a.m.
Saturday, ''about 13 hours late,'' said an airline reservation desk
employee who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 45, carrying 254 passengers, had departed LAX at 8:10
a.m. and was more than two hours into the flight when a
pressurization problem forced it to turn around, passengers told
the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   A second Boeing 767 was located and the passengers took off
again, but that plane was forced to return two hours later, at
around 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were just getting settled on the second flight when
they heard the announcement that the captain was turning back
because of a medical emergency, said Tatiana Regalado, a frustrated
traveler from Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were shocked, you could hear them catch their breath.
They kind of looked at each other, like, 'Is this really
happening?' Then, people started to get angry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency, Regalado said, turned out to be a first-class
passenger with a swelling finger that was being cut by her ring.
</P>
<P>
   Airline spokeswoman Susana Leyva confirmed the flight's two
false starts on Friday, but said she could not specify what
mechanical and medical problems forced the returns.

<HEADLINE> Southern Primaries May Clinch Races  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore should clinch the
Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday, when he is expected to
clean up most of the 566 delegates at stake in six Southern states
holding primaries. For Republican George W. Bush, the countdown to
a majority may take longer.
</P>
<P>
   In some eyes, it's academic because both Bush and Gore are
assured their respective party's nominations. The national
conventions this summer will ratify the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Already they are close to majority strength, according to The
Associated Press delegate count.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the southern primaries on Tuesday, Bush will be 333
delegates shy of the 1,034 he needs to officially lock up the
nomination. There will be 341 GOP delegates at stake, and Bush is
not expected to capture all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will have an easier time locking up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of at least 500 ''super-delegates,'' the vice
president controlled 1,587 delegates heading into the weekend.
Another 270 delegates were at stake at either caucuses or balloting
this weekend in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada -- and Gore
was expected to win nearly all of them.
</P>
<P>
   That should take Gore close to the 2,170 he needs for the
party's nomination even before Tuesday's balloting in Florida,
Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The race between Bush and Gore, meanwhile, remains extremely
close. A Newsweek magazine poll released Saturday gave Bush a 47
percent to 44 percent edged among 803 registered voters surveyed
Thursday and Friday. The 4-percentage-point error margin puts the
race at a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush easily piled up delegates during last week's giant round of
Republican contests, but former rival John McCain emerged
victorious in enough winner-take-all states from New England to
delay a delegate lock until Tuesday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who dropped out of the race after this past week's Super
Tuesday primaries, has 247 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In primaries held Friday, Bush got 28 delegates from Colorado
and 29 from Utah. McCain got 12 and minor candidate Alan Keyes, who
says he won't quit the race despite the inevitable Bush nomination,
picked up one.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is likely to capture some of the delegates at stake
Tuesday, although not many, since Bush is strong in the South and
the two states with the most delegates are Bush's home state of
Texas and Florida, where his brother, Jeb, is governor.
</P>
<P>
   After this week, the next primary, for 74 Republican delegates,
will be in Illinois on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Gore beat Bradley in all 20 states they contested before the
former New Jersey senator quit the campaign last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ''we are placing staff in all states that have primary
elections,'' said Gore's delegate director, Laurie Moskowitz.
''Every Democrat is important to us and we're going to make sure
that the party is united, energized and ready to go in full.''

<HEADLINE> Moscow Mourns Russian Journalist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Thousands of mourners paid respects Saturday to a
taboo-breaking Russian journalist killed in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Artyom Borovik, who was 39, was buried Saturday at Moscow's
historic Novodevichy Cemetery, which was coated with a thick layer
of fresh snow.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who spoke at the service were Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and prominent
liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Borovik died Thursday when a private Yak-40 jet headed for Kiev
crashed minutes after takeoff from a Moscow airport. All nine
people aboard were killed, including prominent oil executive Ziya
Bazhayev.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators examining the plane's black boxes Friday said they
found no immediate evidence of foul play. Security officials had
initially speculated that the plane was brought down by an act of
sabotage aimed at one or both of the well-known men on the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was not destroyed by fire and no remnants of
explosives were found nearby, so a bomb attack was unlikely, Lidia
Glukhova, spokeswoman for the Moscow Transport Prosecutor's Office,
was quoted as saying by the Moscow Times newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Borovik was among the first to break Soviet-era taboos during
the 1980s and later worked for the CBS network's program ''60
Minutes.'' His hard-boiled style and probing reports into
government misdeeds and corruption defined a new role for
journalists in Russia after decades of Soviet censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Bazhayev was to be buried Sunday in his native Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Power for Ex-Colonies  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) -- Visiting the French Caribbean
islands on Saturday, France's president touted a proposed law
giving more power to local governments in far-flung former French
colonies that want more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow you will be real actors and not just smalltime
players'' on the regional stage, President Jacques Chirac told
local legislators on the last day of an official three-day visit
that included the first Franco-Caribbean summit in neighboring
Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law, supported by French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's Socialist Parliament and the islands' leftist-dominated
general councils, would create a congress to discuss how greater
autonomy would work. The law calls for an eventual referendum on
the congress's decisions. It is expected to pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the proposed law would not provide change
rapidly enough to contain a crisis in the islands. Guadeloupe's
regional council president, Lucette Michaux-Chevry, warned Chirac
that the island ''is on the point of explosion, brutally beaten by
rapid change.''
</P>
<P>
   The 800,000 people of Martinique and Guadeloupe have been
battered by increasing labor unrest and unemployment, averaging 30
percent but up to 60 percent among young people in some areas. They
are dependent on massive state subsidies. Up to 70 percent of
Martinique's budget comes from Paris -- keeping the French islands
better off than their neighbors but totally dependent on the money
flowing from Europe, which stifles investment and development.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has been done by France is important, it's great,'' said
Aime Cesaire, founder of the left-leaning Martinique Progressive
Party and the mayor of Fort-de-France.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it is outdated,'' Cesaire said. ''We have to go one step
further. We have to go all the way ... to autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac urged all sides to debate how quickly and to what degree
autonomy should be implemented, saying a ''free, open, democratic
discussion'' is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The French leader makes a private visit to St. Martin on Sunday
before heading back to Paris.

<HEADLINE> Pryor Seeks Restraining Order  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Richard Pryor is taking out a restraining
order against his 38-year-old son, according to a statement
released by the comedian.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, because of Richard Jr.'s unwelcome and
aggressive efforts to seek audience with his father, it was
necessary to prepare requests for restraining orders,'' said
Pryor's lawyer, Lynda Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor's son last month sought conservatorship of his father's
estate. The 59-year-old Pryor is fighting multiple sclerosis, and
his son claims in court papers that his father cannot care for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor's son also claims that Jennifer Lee, a former spouse, has
been draining the comedian's assets without consent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Richard has been and is fully in control of his own
circumstances and voluntarily employes Jennifer Lee on a full-time
basis as his agent and personal manager,'' the senior Pryor said in
the statement. ''He has the utmost trust and confidence in the work
Jennifer does on his behalf.''

<HEADLINE> German Diplomatic Deficit Laid Bare  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany has just learned a painful lesson. Despite
being Europe's biggest nation, its political ambitions are vastly
greater than its pool of top-notch diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Some see the drive to install a German at the head of the
International Monetary Fund as a necessary step toward a greater
global role for Germany that will surely lead to rising tensions
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's pivotal power has been more vocal about its yearning
for clout ever since Helmut Kohl bowed out as chancellor in 1998
and made way for a political generation less burdened by the ghosts
of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   So when its nominee for IMF managing director, Caio Koch-Weser,
pulled out Tuesday, it raised concerns about the state of German
diplomacy -- a craft with few heroes since Otto von Bismarck united
a bunch of squabbling states in 1871 to create modern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The United States bluntly told Germany that Koch-Weser, a deputy
finance minister, lacked prestige. Critics here say Germany has
failed to encourage global-minded leaders after decades of
self-restraint in foreign policy during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our choice of personalities for such posts is not terribly
big,'' said Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman for the
opposition Christian Democratic party. ''There's not enough people
with interest and not enough incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   Possible high-profile candidates all seem to have drawbacks.
Karl-Otto Poehl and Hans Tietmeyer, both former central bankers,
were considered too old. Kohl's last finance minister, Theo Waigel,
is from a conservative party at odds with Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder. Schroeder's own finance minister is needed to spearhead
economic reforms at home.
</P>
<P>
   German media blamed Schroeder for the fiasco, saying he bullied
the European Union into backing his candidate, despite warnings
from Washington that he would be vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a hard time looking beyond the rim of Europe,'' said
Lamers. ''We're stronger now, but unlike the United States, we're
not strong enough to impose anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now some European partners are wary of endorsing Germany's
replacement candidate, Horst Koehler, head of a bank that channels
EU aid to Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it's a question of clout. Whoever succeeds Frenchman
Michel Camdessus as IMF head will face U.S. congressional pressure
for tough reforms at a lending agency that has been heavily
criticized for its handling global financial crises in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives complain that by handing out billions of dollars
in loans to Asia, Russia and South America, the IMF wasted
government money to bail out careless investors. Liberals charge
that the IMF's loan conditions worsen suffering and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based fund also has been accused of lax controls
on loans to Russia after its economy collapsed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's response has been to call for the
IMF to restrict its focus and offer short-term emergency lending to
countries in financial crisis, while weaning others off IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has been operating since the end of World War II when
it was set up by Western powers to help countries in financial
straits. Its sister institution, the World Bank, helps with
development loans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the World Bank was expected to raise most of its money in
U.S. capital markets, a gentlemen's agreement gives the post to an
American. In return, the Europeans name the top IMF post, held by
France for 32 of the last 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge the system is outdated and undemocratic. Harvard
economist Jeffrey Sachs has said the new IMF director should be
from an emerging-market country that has experience with IMF loans
and economic reform programs.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Amgott, a Washington spokesman for the relief agency Oxfam,
said the selection process is purely ''about 19th century
nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Or about 21st-century U.S.-German relations.
</P>
<P>
   As Berlin's assertiveness has grown, so have tensions with the
United States. Whether it's environmental protection, access to
American intelligence or the location of the U.S. Embassy in
Berlin, the two allies have clashed more and more openly since the
end of the Cold War made American protection for Germany obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a leading German weekly has declared the IMF battle ''a
small revolution'' that shows France is no longer the only European
power to challenge U.S. dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany, too, is beginning to emancipate itself,'' Die Zeit
said. ''So it's no wonder that the partnership is straining. And
that is a good thing.''

<HEADLINE> Polls: El Salvador Left Set To Gain  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- After 12 years of war and eight
of peace, El Salvador's former leftist rebels appear to have a
strong chance at finally winning a significant share of power in
Sunday's congressional vote.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front -- known
as the FMLN -- could boost its share of seats in the single-house
congress to 30 or 32 from the current 27. Smaller center-left
parties also may make gains.
</P>
<P>
   The left was battered in last year's presidential race, won by
Francisco Flores of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, which has
governed the country for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   But polls show the Alliance could win less than the 28 seats it
now holds. Those polls, though, are two weeks old, since law
prohibits releasing polling data in the final 15 days before an
election.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 million people are registered to vote for 84
congressmen, 262 mayors and 20 representatives to the Central
American Parliament. Eight parties are participating.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance, known as ARENA, has dominated congress throughout
the past decade, even as the FMLN converted itself from a rebel
force into a political party following a January 1992 peace treaty
that ended a war which claimed more than 76,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ARENA has seen its share in congress drop from 39 in 1994 to 28
in 1997, though alliances with other centrist and rightist parties
have kept it in control.
</P>
<P>
   The FMLN has increased the number of its seats from 21 to 27.
The leftist party also headed a coalition that elected the
capital's mayor three years ago -- its most important triumph to
date.
</P>
<P>
   San Salvador's incumbent, Hector Silva of the FMLN, held a
strong lead in polls over several other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The FMLN proposed temporarily suspending foreclosures and
cutting the country's value-added tax to 10 percent from 13. It
favors an anti-monopoly law that has worried some of the
Belgium-sized country's businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   It has also called for tighter regulation of banks, for broader
access to credit, suspending privatization efforts and for a
tougher anti-corruption law.

in southern Iraq on Saturday, injuring eight civilians, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.

<P>
   The agency did not specify the nature of the targets hit or
their location, but it said the planes flew over sites in the
provinces of Basra, Dhiqar, Muthana, Najaf and Missan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our anti-air missiles and artillery fired at the (enemy) air
formations and forced them to leave our airspace,'' a spokesman for
the Iraqi Air Defense Force said, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials had no immediate confirmation of the
strikes. Their warplanes have struck Iraqi targets frequently in
response, officials say, to Iraqi air defenses opening fire on the
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi agency also said U.S. and British jets entered Iraqi
airspace in the north, but reported no incident. British officials
said they had no comment on any strikes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British planes have been enforcing no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to
protect Shiite Muslims and Kurds from attacks by the Iraqi armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq does not recognize the zones and began challenging the
allied planes in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> National manhunt launched for convicted rapist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) -- A convicted rapist and murder suspect
released without advance warning from a New Jersey prison earlier
this week is the focus of a nationwide manhunt after the address he
left as his next residence proved to be phony.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Bergen and Passaic counties said they would have
done everything in their power to keep Raymond Alves off the
streets, but they were not notified of his release, as required by
law.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Alves, 58, was convicted in 1969 of threatening
to kill a Bergen County teen-ager. Two years later, he was shot in
the stomach by Saddle Brook police while attempting to escape
arrest on charges of violating his probation, according to
published reports.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted in 1977 of two brutal assaults that occurred
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1976, he kidnapped and raped a 16-year-old Clifton
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, he tossed another Clifton teen off a 40-foot
overpass when she resisted his advances. According to Saturday's
editions of The Star-Ledger of Newark, he told the assault victim
that he had raped 15 other girls.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, who was to remain in jail between the two trials, escaped
in January 1977 and was recaptured more than a month later on the
New Jersey Turnpike in Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to 47 years in prison in 1978, but was released
by the state parole board in 1992, authorities said. A short time
later, he was recaptured in Arizona with a handgun in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   His traveling companion in that incident is now on death row in
Florida, according to Marilyn Zdobinski, deputy first assistant
prosecutor in Passaic County.
</P>
<P>
   Alves was returned to New Jersey, where he remained in prison
until Thursday, when his term ended because of credit for time
served in jail and other deductions from his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger reported that according to testimony at his 1995
parole hearing, Alves was a prime suspect in the murders of several
Bergen County females in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have indicated the extent of his dangerousness to the
parole board many times,'' Zdobinski said. ''And there is no doubt
in my mind that he has retained that dangerousness.''
</P>
<P>
   As a convicted sex offender, Alves was required to tell
corrections officials where he planned to live. He claimed he was
moving to Fall River, Mass., but officials said the person living
at that address had never heard of him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bergen County prosecutors charged Alves with failing
to register as a sex offender, an offense that could carry 18
months in prison if he is caught and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carden, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections, blamed the failure to notify prosecutors of Alves on a
''series of clerical errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger reported that officials believe that workers in
the Southern State Prison were late in transferring Alves'
information to the classification unit.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, prison officials are required to notify the
prosecutors 30 days in advance when a sex offender from their
jurisdiction is about to be released.
</P>
<P>
   Passaic and Bergen officials say that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County officials said they received a letter notifying
them of Alves' release the afternoon he left prison. Despite claims
by the DOC that the letter had been sent a week earlier, they said
it was not postmarked until March 8 -- the day before his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be disciplinary action,'' Carden told The Record of
Hackensack in Saturday's editions. ''I don't know against who yet,
but against somebody in the Department of Corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Schwanwede, first assistant prosecutor in Bergen County,
said officials had information that Alves might be headed to either
Atlantic City or Florida.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls GOP Budget Dead End  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused congressional
Republicans of steering the federal budget into fiscal peril with
huge, ''risky'' tax cuts that he said endanger prosperity and
shortchange Social Security, Medicare and education.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the $1.8 trillion agreement reached Friday
between leaders of the House and Senate budget committees embodies
tax cuts as a ''moral issue'' to help working people while
supporting important national priorities such as education and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the stage for battles to come, Clinton used his weekly
radio address Saturday to state the case that tax cuts targeted to
benefit people saving for college or retirement and to reduce the
so-called marriage penalty on two-income households are possible
''if Congress takes care of first things first.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, above all, that means maintaining the fiscal
discipline that has brought us to this point of unprecedented
prosperity,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it also means pushing efforts to pay down the national
debt by 2013, securing the future of Social Security, modernizing
Medicare with a prescription drug benefit, providing more and
better trained teachers and modernizing the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it seems the congressional majority has hardly given
(these priorities) a second thought'' and instead has allocated
''nearly half a trillion dollars to risky tax cuts,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than half our money already spent (on tax cuts), and not
a penny on our most pressing priorities,'' Clinton reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year they went for one big tax cut with one big grab,''
he said. ''This year, they're doing it piece by piece, one tax cut
after another.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Just this week, we saw Republican leaders attach
special-interest tax breaks to what should have been a simple raise
in the minimum wage,'' Clinton said, citing a bill he has now
threatened to veto because of the tax provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the budget process begins, I urge Republican leaders to
change their course and steer clear of a fiscal dead end,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said significant tax cuts are a fair and
essential element of any budget package.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of penalizing hardworking Americans for being
successful, we are now helping them share that success with their
families,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said in the GOP's radio talk that the House-Senate budget
agreement reduces the tax burden on Americans and in no way risks
national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., announced agreement Friday on a framework for a fiscal 2001
budget. They hope to push the measure through their panels this
month and for Congress to complete it by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said the GOP budget will in fact pay down the national
debt by 2013, improve education, protect Medicare, help older
people pay for prescription drugs, bolster the military and
''provide real tax relief for married couples.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a shot at the likely Democratic presidential nominee, he
added: ''President Clinton and the extreme left wing Democrats led
by Al Gore are trying to spend the taxes paid by hardworking
American families like spoiled rich kids in a candy store.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim
Nicholson, asserted that working married couples seeking to avoid a
tax penalty do not represent any kind of ''special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ''Giving them tax relief is not risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP plans for tax cuts and larger increases
in defense spending that Clinton proposed would force cuts in many
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're assuming unrealistic cuts in vital services from
health to environment, so they can either have significant tax cuts
or rely once again on end-of-year gimmicks and shell games,'' said
Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican budget framework, spending on many defense
and domestic programs would total $596.5 billion next year, $10.5
billion more than this year, and boost funds for defense, education
and health. Clinton wants $625 billion, leaving the two sides
almost $30 billion apart.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also envisions $150 billion for tax cuts from 2001
through 2005 and leaves the door open for at least $60 billion
more. Clinton has proposed $99 billion in tax cuts, offset almost
completely by $96 billion in tax increases.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Strongly Back Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Arab officials on Saturday strongly
backed Lebanon in its confrontation with Israel, condemning recent
Israeli airstrikes against the country and ''vicious'' Israeli
threats to destroy Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon without a peace treaty
with Arab states will lead to another war in the region, according
to a newspaper report Saturday. Israel is planning to withdraw from
Lebanon by summer, with or without a wider peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper report came out as ministers of the 22-nation Arab
League were meeting in Beirut, Lebanon's capital. In a joint
statement after a 5{-hour meeting, the ministers strongly condemn
Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. The statement defended the
Lebanese guerrillas fighting there, saying ''the resistance is a
result of the occupation and not its cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was aimed at sending a message to Israel that the
Arab world is solidly behind Lebanon -- a unanimous position that
has rarely been seen in the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has been achieved is a message to whom it may concern
that Lebanon is not left alone in confronting Israel and any
aggression on Lebanon is an aggression against the entire Arab
nation,'' Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement urged Arab countries who have relations with
Israel to reconsider the ties. It urged Arab states previously
committed to helping Lebanon financially to do so, but no immediate
or extra aid was pledged. It also backed Lebanon's efforts to form
an international court to try Israeli war criminals for attacks on
Lebanon and to force Israel to pay reparations for losses in
Lebanon over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The biannual Arab ministers' meeting is usually held at Arab
League headquarters in Cairo. It was shifted here to express
solidarity with Lebanon after Israel intensified airstrikes on the
country to retaliate for guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has given itself until July to leave south Lebanon, where
its troops have been stationed since 1985 with the aim of
protecting northern Israeli towns from cross-border guerrilla
raids.
</P>
<P>
   Hostilities in the region intensified this winter when seven
Israeli soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks in January and
early February. In response, Israel bombed Lebanese civilian
infrastructure on Feb. 8, knocking out three power stations,
wounding 15 civilians and causing $20 million in damage. More
strikes have been threatened if the guerrilla attacks don't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says it will withdraw its troops by summer even without
peace agreements with Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon. Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been suspended since
January. But Syria is opposed to a unilateral withdrawal, which
would weaken its position in talks to recover its Golan Heights,
captured by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the Syrian agenda, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud has
said Lebanon cannot guarantee security along its border after an
Israeli pullout unless the withdrawal is part of an overall Middle
East settlement that also tackled the issue of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper interview ahead of the Arab meeting Saturday,
Lahoud said the 350,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are a
''time bomb'' that threatens peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Al-Hayat newspaper quoted Lahoud as saying that there can be
no peace unless the refugees are allowed to return to their
homeland. He noted that Palestinian guerrillas in refugee camps
here could launch attacks against Israel after a unilateral
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''How will Israel respond? Will they bomb the refugee camps?
Will they reoccupy the country?'' he asked. ''A unilateral Israeli
withdrawal will not work, and will lead to another war.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arab statement later in the day echoed those remarks. The
Palestinians' presence is a ''time bomb that threatened security
and stability'' in Lebanon, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also affirmed the simultaneity of the Syrian and
Lebanese negotiating tracks with Israel and demanded Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights. It blamed Israel for the
stalemate in the Middle East peace and called for immediate
resumption of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Directors Guild Honors Filmmakers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three paranormal tales, a suburban satire and
a journalistic drama were up for top honors Saturday from the
Directors Guild of America -- awards that typically forecast the
best-director choice at the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The 52nd annual DGA awards honor top directors of feature films,
documentaries, commercials and television movies, TV series, soap
operas and children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Film nominees were Frank Darabont for the supernatural prison
tale ''The Green Mile''; Spike Jonze for ''Being John Malkovich,''
a bizarre take on identity and body snatching; Michael Mann for
''The Insider,'' the story of an ex-tobacco executive who blows the
whistle on ''60 Minutes''; Sam Mendes for the dark suburban comedy
''American Beauty,'' and M. Night Shyamalan for the ghost story
''The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Darabont is the only DGA nominee who did not also receive an
Academy Award nomination for best director. Lasse Hallstrom took
the fifth Oscar nod for ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy Awards will be presented March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Only four Directors Guild winners have failed to take home the
Oscar: Anthony Harvey for ''The Lion in Winter'' from 1968; Francis
Ford Coppola for ''The Godfather'' from 1972; Steven Spielberg for
''The Color Purple'' from 1985 and Ron Howard for ''Apollo 13''
from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, last year's Directors Guild and Oscar winner for
''Saving Private Ryan,'' was to receive the guild's Lifetime
Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to guild awards for ''The Color Purple'' and
''Saving Private Ryan,'' Spielberg won for ''Schindler's List,''
and he was nominated for ''Jaws,'' ''Close Encounters of the Third
Kind,'' ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' ''E.T., the
Extra-terrestrial,'' ''Empire of the Sun'' and ''Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lifetime Achievement Award formerly was named for pioneering
silent-film director D.W. Griffith. The guild decided to drop
Griffith's name last year because of criticism over black racial
stereotypes in the director's movies, including the Civil War epic
''Birth of a Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, the last director to receive the guild's lifetime honor
in 1998, was scheduled to present Spielberg's award.
</P>
<P>
   Other past lifetime honorees include Frank Capra, Alfred
Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Ingmar Bergman, Akiro Kurosawa, Woody
Allen and Stanley Kubrick.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Japanese Wives Are Fed Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Most Japanese husbands remain unwilling to do
household chores, and wives are getting fed up, according to a
government survey quoted Saturday by Japanese media.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of 8,000 married women surveyed by the Health
and Welfare Ministry in July 1998 said they handled most of the
housework.
</P>
<P>
   Only half of the wives said they were happy with their husbands'
contribution to housework, down from a 1993 survey in which 60
percent said they were satisfied, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
</P>
<P>
   Husbands made some progress between the surveys. For example, 35
percent of married women said their husbands took out the garbage a
couple of times a week, against 27 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In four out of five households with children under age 6, wives
handled most of the child rearing by themselves, the survey said,
according to Kyodo News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Health ministry officials were not available for comment on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say differing attitudes about the roles of men and women
have prompted many women to delay getting married and having
children. The fall in the birth rate to record lows has prompted
the government to seek ways to make life easier for women.
</P>
<P>
   No margin of error was given in the survey.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Winter Warmest on Record  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This winter has been the warmest on record
since the government began keeping weather statistics 105 years
ago, according to scientists at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing data from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center in
Asheville, N.C., researchers said that seasonal temperatures from
December to February averaged 38.4 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.6
degrees warmer than the previous record, which was set just last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists attributed the warm temperatures to La Nina, a
weather phenomenon related to cooler than normal temperatures in
the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. The researchers couldn't say
Saturday whether the warm winter had any link to a ''greenhouse
effect'' caused by pollution into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last three winters have been the warmest on record
in the United States -- a pattern of warm winters established in
1980, said the scientists. Since then, 67 percent of the winter
seasons have been warmer than the long-term average.
</P>
<P>
   Many states from the northern Plains to New England set records
for the latest date of their first seasonal snowfall, latest date
without a temperature below freezing, longest snow-free period, or
longest period between subzero temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   However, NOAA spokesman Greg Hernandez said the specific
state-by-state temperature data would not be available until
Monday. Only the general trends for the country were immediately
available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an overall warm winter, despite a brief and sudden
cold spell in the Northeast that in part caused severe shortages of
heating oil and soaring prices in late January and early February
in that region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that while eastern states experienced heavy
snowfall in the last two weeks of January, the cold air that came
with it was short-lived. Hundreds of daily maximum temperature
records were broken across the country in February. Many spots from
the Northern Plains to New York set or tied their all-time maximum
temperature records for the month.
</P>
<P>
   Every state in the continental U.S. was warmer than its
long-term average, with 21 states from California to the Midwest
ranking well above normal. Oklahoma experienced its warmest winter
on record, and Kansas, Nebraska, and Montana experienced their
second warmest.
</P>
<P>
   This winter also has been a dry one, the 16th driest on record.
Louisiana reported its driest winter on record, and Alabama and
Mississippi their third driest. New Mexico and Arizona also
experienced much below normal rainfall for the season. The only
regions experiencing a wet season were the northern and central
Rockies and a zone from the central Plains eastward to the Ohio
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, temperatures were the sixth warmest on record,
following the two warmest winter seasons set in the past two years,
the NOAA analysis said.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, precipitation was above average through central and
northern Europe, most of South America, southern Africa, Southeast
Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Australia. Heavy downpours resulted
in catastrophic flooding in Mozambique and other countries in
southeastern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Bus Kills 2 in Egypt, Sparking Riots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Angry villagers clashed with police, hurled
rocks at a passing train and set buses on fire after a speeding bus
killed two schoolgirls and injured three others Saturday, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of three buses racing each other veered off the road and
drove into a group of girls walking to their school in the northern
village of Awlad Seif, 40 miles northeast of Cairo, a police
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers blocked the road for five hours and set the three
buses on fire, he said. Rocks hurled at a passing train injured the
driver and smashed some of the train's windows.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired tear gas and dispersed the rioters after arresting
several people, including the bus drivers, the official said. He
did not provide details about the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Reckless driving claims thousands of lives every year in Egypt.
Traffic figures for 1998 reveal that over 6,000 people were killed
in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar incident March 5, about 3,000 residents rioted
outside Cairo after a speeding car killed a 16-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   The residents clashed with police, set fire to a police van, a
fire engine and a paper factory and blocked railway tracks and
trains for about an hour.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead in Norway Building Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The roof of a public building collapsed
Saturday on up to 60 soldiers during a multinational military
exercise in northern Norway, killing at least one person and
trapping others.
</P>
<P>
   Police said one person was confirmed dead and seven were
injured. At least three people were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The community house in the town of Bardufoss, 750 miles north of
Oslo, was being used by the troops as a command center during the
12-nation Joint Winter military exercise. The roof apparently
collapsed under the weight of snow.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman said he thought most or all of the troops
in the accident were Norwegians. It was not immediately clear if
U.S. troops were involved in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are intense rescue efforts underway'' to reach those
still trapped,'' said Terje Myklevold, a spokesman for the
exercise. A large number of military and civilian rescue vehicles
had arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 soldiers had been brought out of the building, and at
least 12 had made it out on their own, said Kurt Pettersen of the
district police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know of seven injured, four of those with minor injuries,''
Pettersen said. ''The number of missing is in no way certain,
because there could have been visitors who were not listed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also not clear if some of those feared missing had made
it out of the building but had not been accounted for. Witnesses
described the scene as chaotic.

<HEADLINE> Buffett Apologizes for Poor Profits  </HEADLINE>
By MARGERY BECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Billionaire stock market guru Warren Buffett
apologized Saturday for how his company's earnings and stock price
plunged last year -- when the boom on Wall Street turned even
amateur investors into millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's Omaha-based
holding company, dropped 42 percent in 1999, while the stock fell
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had the worst absolute performance of my tenure and,
compared to the S&AMP;P, the worst relative performance as well,''
Buffett wrote in his company's annual report. ''Even Inspector
Clouseau could find last year's guilty party: your chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his consistently high returns, Buffett's portfolio is
often mimicked by other investors. Last fall, Forbes magazine
ranked him the third-richest American, with a net worth of $31
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Berkshire Hathaway earned $1.6 billion, or $1,025 per
share, compared with $2.8 billion, or $2,262 per share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's stock on Wall Street fell nearly $14,000 per
share, to $56,100.
</P>
<P>
   All that in a year when the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was up 19.5
percent, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.2 percent and
the technology-driven Nasdaq soared 85.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire stock has fallen even lower this year -- it closed
Friday at $41,300 per share, down 26 percent since January.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett and partner Charlie Munger are known for investing in
what they know -- low-tech companies like furniture, publishing and
insurance -- and Buffett wrote in Saturday's report that he has no
plans to change that strategy. Among Berkshire's core investments,
Coca-Cola Co., Gillette Co. and Washington Post Co. all were down
or flat for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett said the company has not lost faith in its long-term
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our problem -- which we can't solve by studying up -- is that we
have no insights into which participants in the tech field possess
a truly durable competitive advantage,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   Also among Berkshire's investments are substantial insurance
holdings, including auto insurer GEICO and General Re Corp., one of
the largest reinsurers in the world, which suffered significant
underwriting losses of $897 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett said he did not expect a dramatic improvement in
underwriting earnings and expected that GEICO's underwriting
performance would likely weaken this year. He also said he expected
auto insurers as a group to do worse in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted slower growth in the market, with corporate
profits rising at a rate of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett concluded his letter to stockholders by saying:
</P>
<P>
   ''Berkshire will someday have opportunities to deploy major
amounts of cash in equity markets -- we are confident of that. But,
as the song goes, 'Who knows where or when?' Meanwhile, if anyone
starts explaining to you what is going on in the truly manic
portions of this 'enchanted' market, you might remember still
another line of song: 'Fools give you reasons, wise men never
try.'''

<HEADLINE> Zhirinovsky Launches Presidency Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Outspoken nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky
launched his bid for the presidency Saturday, but his first
campaign trip was marred when his plane had to make an emergency
landing because of a malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The Yak-42 jet carrying Zhirinovsky landed safely on the
airstrip at Novosibirsk, the first in a string of cities in his
campaign tour through spots in Siberia, Russia's NTV television
reported.
</P>
<P>
   A malfunction occurred in the hydraulic system just before
landing, the report said, showing footage of a grim-looking
Zhirinovsky on the dark tarmac. An investigation was under way.
Airport officials said it was not an unusual problem.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky was registered Tuesday as one of 11 candidates for
the March 26 election, after the Supreme Court overturned orders
banning him from the race for not declaring property belonging to
his son.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning by all candidates has been extremely slack because
acting President Vladimir Putin is so far in the lead. He has been
widely expected to win the presidency since he took over the
Kremlin helm from Boris Yeltsin, who resigned Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Zhirinovsky started a campaign tour of Novosibirsk,
Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, Bratsk, Perm, Kazan, and Nizhny
Novgorod, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky, whose anti-Western tirades have gained him
notoriety in Russia and abroad, came in third in 1991 presidential
elections, but has lost much of his following in recent years and
is not expected to fare well this time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Putin held informal talks in St. Petersburg with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Saturday -- his first meeting
with a Western leader since being named acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also met with World Bank President James Wolfensohn to
discuss Russia's flailing economy and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said he is too busy being president to conduct an
election campaign. But his opponents say he has an unfair advantage
because of the daily media coverage he gets as president,
especially from state-run TV channels.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show Putin -- admired for his hard-nosed, pragmatic
image -- getting support from about 60 percent of voters, with his
nearest challenger, Communist Gennady Zyuganov, recording about 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> Funeral Held for Slain Firefighter  </HEADLINE>
By WOODY BAIRD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A firefighter killed in an ambush shooting
while trying to save a burning residence took his last ride on a
fire truck Saturday aboard a pumper named for his father, a
firefighter who also died on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Javier Lerma, 41, died along with another firefighter and a
Shelby County sheriff's deputy Wednesday when a gunman opened fire
on them as they responded to a house fire. The suspected gunman's
wife also was killed. He and a bystander were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Lerma, 41, was carried to his funeral in a gray, metal casket
sitting atop a fire department pumper that bore the name of his
late father, Martiniano R. Lerma.
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis Fire Department honors firefighters killed in the
line of duty by putting their names on firefighting equipment. The
elder Lerma died while fighting a fire in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 firefighters and other police and emergency
workers from around the country lined both sides of the street
through which Lerma's casket was driven to St. Francis of Asissi
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Milton Guthrie, who delivered the funeral sermon,
described Lerma as a dedicated father and family man who answered a
special call to spend his life trying to save others from danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Javier was called out to answer the call of love, to care for
somebody else,'' Guthrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed in the gunfire as they arrived at the burning
residence of Frederick Williams were Deputy Rupert Peete, 45, and
firefighter William Blakemore, 48.
</P>
<P>
   Their funerals were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Stacey Williams, 32, was found dead inside the
residence after the shooting stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 41, who was also a firefighter, was shot and seriously
wounded by police. He has been charged with murder, attempted
murder and arson.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Research Suit Settled for $3.8M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa General Hospital and the University of
South Florida each has agreed to pay more than $1 million to settle
a class action suit contending experimental procedures were
performed on poor pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.8 million settlement, announced Friday, could affect
3,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 medical research suit alleged thousands of pregnant
women weren't told of the risks, benefits and alternatives of
various experiments conducted between 1986 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   USF doctors working at Tampa General gave about 3,000 women with
high-risk pregnancies drugs that the doctors thought would enhance
the lung development of their fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, none of the women claimed they were harmed by the
experiment or that it was ineffective in improving the outcomes of
their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they were never told the drugs were experimental
or that they could choose not to take them.
</P>
<P>
   There was no admission of wrongdoing in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement calls for the hospital and the university each to
pay $1.1 million and a state insurance plan to pay $1.6 million
over a four-year period to about 3,000 people who could collect
from the class action suit.
</P>
<P>
   USF and TGH officials said both institutions have initiated
safeguards sought by the plaintiffs since the suit was filed.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Rally Around Bush  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANALAPAN, Fla. (AP) -- With the highly energized campaign
between Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain in the past,
moderate Republican leaders on Saturday urged the GOP to look ahead
to the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you create the right solutions that make sense, you will
get the support of Democrats. And that's what it's all about,''
said Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, speaking at the Republican
Leadership Council's winter meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Others attending included Michigan Gov. John Engler, New Jersey
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Florida Rep. Mark Foley. The RLC
does not officially endorse any one candidate, though many on the
council have publicly endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who was expected to speak to council members Sunday,
said that although the race between Bush and McCain was intense, it
brought a sense of excitement to the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brought a lot of new people to the polls,'' she said. ''Now
the party is back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who has been mentioned as a possible running mate to
Bush, formally endorsed Bush last Saturday. She said that though
she's honored that her name is out there as a possible vice
presidential candidate, she hasn't given it much thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love the job I have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida's presidential primary only days away, Bush and
Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, will be
campaigning in the state over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   But since the nomination races in both parties have been
effectively settled, voter turnout in Florida's Tuesday primary was
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florida is very important for George W.,'' said Snowe. ''It's
important to make sure we get strong voter turnout. It's absolutely
essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother Jeb is the governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds an early lead over Gore in Florida, according to the
latest Mason-Dixon Poll taken Tuesday and Wednesday. The survey
looked at possible matchups pitting Bush, Gore and different Reform
Party candidates. Bush beat out Gore in matchups which included Pat
Buchanan and Ross Perot as possible Reform Party candidates, but
Gore and Bush were in a statistical dead heat in a matchup where
McCain ran as an independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush reaches out to McCain and McCain's supporters, he will
be a stronger candidate, said Stanford M. Adelstein, who is running
for the state House of Representatives in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ''McCain/Bush was only the opener,'' he said. ''The real race
now begins.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Dead in Norway Building Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The roof of a public building collapsed
Saturday on some 60 soldiers during a multinational military
exercise in northern Norway, killing at least two people and
injuring seven, police and military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two soldiers were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The community house in the town of Bardufoss, 750 miles north of
Oslo, was being used by the troops as a command center during the
12-nation Joint Winter military exercise. The roof apparently
collapsed under the weight of snow.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman said he thought most or all of the troops
in the accident were Norwegians. It was not immediately clear if
U.S. troops were involved in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are intense rescue efforts underway'' to reach those
still trapped,'' said Terje Myklevold, a spokesman for the
exercise. A large number of military and civilian rescue vehicles
had arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 soldiers had been brought out of the building, and at
least 12 had made it out on their own, said Kurt Pettersen of the
district police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know of seven injured, four of those with minor injuries,''
Pettersen said. ''The number of missing is in no way certain,
because there could have been visitors who were not listed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also not clear if some of those feared missing had made
it out of the building but had not been accounted for. Witnesses
described the scene as chaotic.

Ukraine Mine Blast Kills Scores
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A methane gas explosion ripped through a coal mine in
eastern Ukraine on Saturday, killing 80 workers and injuring seven in Ukraine's
worst mine disaster since before 1980. The early afternoon blast at the Barakova
mine in Krasnodon came at a depth of 2,191 feet while 277 people were working in
the mine, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Nearly 200 miners managed to
leave the shaft after the blast, it said. Methane, a naturally occurring
colorless, odorless and highly explosive gas, often seeps out of coal seams and
can build up easily in poorly ventilated mine shafts.

   VALPARAISO, Chile (AP) -- Ricardo Lagos was sworn in Saturday as Chile's

a 62-year-old lawyer who won national fame a decade ago while fighting Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, has pledged to curb a powerful military still
staunchly loyal to the former military ruler. ''This is a fiesta for

election. ''I think Gore came out of the process strengthened and Bush came out
of the process weakened. And that probably puts them on equal ground,'' said
Chicago-based Democratic consultant David Axelrod, expressing the view shared by
analysts in both parties. GOP consultant Ed Gillespie of Washington predicts
''an incredibly tight election'' and said ''both of them have a lot of work to

350,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are allowed to return to their homeland.
Israel has given itself until July to leave south Lebanon, where its troops have
been stationed since 1985 with the aim of protecting northern Israeli towns from

seasonal temperatures from December to February averaged 38.4 degrees

Californians approved a ballot measure that prohibits the state from recognizing
same-sex marriages legally performed in any other state. After the Hawaii

the state's voters later rejected -- 30 states and the federal government passed

<HEADLINE> Columbine Report To Be Detailed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A final investigative report on the
Columbine High School massacre will detail the attack ''shot by
shot'' and confirm that only two gunmen were involved, The Denver
Post reported in its Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on 5,000 interviews, 4,000 leads and 10,000
pieces of evidence gathered after the April 20, 1999 rampage in
which 12 students, one teacher and teen gunmen Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold died.
</P>
<P>
   The Post, while not quoting from the report, listed what it said
were the main findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shot by shot, we know. Minute by minute -- and in many cases
second by second -- we know all that,'' said lead investigator Kate
Battan. ''That's what the final report is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Battan said she knows ''absolutely by whom'' each of the victims
was shot.
</P>
<P>
   The report also confirms that Harris and Klebold acted alone and
killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no one hit by police gunfire,'' said sheriff's
Division Chief John Kiekbusch.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, spokesman for Sheriff John Stone, confirmed the
Post account.
</P>
<P>
   At least one parent was angered by the release of the
information, saying the relatives were told they would see the
report before the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know the difference between this and the actual
report,'' said Connie Michalik, mother of Richard Castaldo, who
remains paralyzed from wounds suffered in the attack. ''I'm just
disappointed with the sheriff's department ... I just don't think
they have treated us with much respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone has declined to give a release date for the final
investigative report. Family members have pushed for its release
prior to the one-year anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Battan also said the report will dispel several myths about the
law enforcement personnel on the scene, although the report will
make no conclusions. Some criticism had been made against the SWAT
teams, saying specifically that teacher Dave Sanders might have
survived if rescuers had reached him sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't have body armor. They didn't have walkie talkies.
They didn't have keys to the school. They didn't have all those
things the myths say they had,'' Battan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scores of volunteers on Saturday helped cleanse the
campus of one more reminder of the tragedy by rebuilding a sidewalk
and a stairway.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp clink of stonemasons' chisels rang across the campus
all morning and afternoon as about 80 volunteers built the stairway
and a set of curving terrace walls.
</P>
<P>
   The old steps were torn up shortly after students were killed
there.

<HEADLINE> Whitney Benefactor Decries Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An art installation portraying Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the company of Nazis at an upcoming Whitney Museum
exhibit has angered one of the museum's largest benefactors, who
says she'll stop giving the institution money.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, ''Sanitation,'' by Hans Haacke, upset 73-year-old
heiress Marylou Whitney so much that she has told the museum
director that in addition to halting donations, she'll quit its
national fund-raising board as well.
</P>
<P>
   The installation piece consists of a wall lined with garbage
cans, each containing a speaker playing audio of marching troops. A
gold-framed reproduction of the First Amendment would be on the
wall, along with six quotations -- three from the mayor -- written in
the Gothic typescript favored by Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's quotations refer to ''Sensation,'' a controversial
Brooklyn Museum exhibit which featured a portrait of the Virgin
Mary with a clump of elephant dung. Giuliani unsuccessfully sought
to stop city funding of the museum because of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, whose mother-in-law, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney
founded the Whitney Museum, told the New York Post in Saturday's
editions she wished that ''they could take the Whitney name off
that museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had intended to make a big contribution to the Whitney in my
will, but not now. This is a horrible work. I can't even call it
'art,''' Whitney told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Director Maxwell Anderson said in a statement that, ''I
regret any discomfort we may cause supporters of the museum in
pursuit of the artistic mission established by Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney in 1930.''

<HEADLINE> Missionaries Chide Canonization Move  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican's decision to canonize 120
Catholics martyred in China challenges Beijing to expand religious
freedom and could raise tensions, the news service of the Vatican's
missionary arm said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church and China have vied for decades for
authority over China's millions of Catholics. Fides, the missionary
news service, said the Oct. 1 canonization of the ''sons of China''
could be seen in Beijing as ''interference in the internal affairs
of China.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The canonization of the Chinese martyrs is a challenge to the
courage of the Beijing government,'' Fides said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The canonizations, which were announced Friday, also serve as a
challenge to ''the courage'' of the Roman Catholic Church, Fides
said. Christians must find out the truth about Catholics allegedly
persecuted for their faiths under communist China, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican named as future saints 120 European and Chinese
Catholics who died during China's 1900 anti-Western Boxer Rebellion
and at other times in the church's evangelization in China.

   Catholic organizations accuse China of taking Catholics into
custody and blowing up churches in an intensified campaign against
Catholics loyal to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Officially atheist China insists it allows full religious
freedom. It legally limits the practice of religion to
state-sanctioned churches.
</P>
<P>
   It has no official diplomatic relations with the Vatican and
says the government -- not the Vatican -- is the governing authority
for Chinese Catholics. Many worship in unsanctioned churches.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Bashes NY Mayor on Education  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Speaking to 1,000 teacher aides on Saturday,
Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's positions
on education and put herself in the company of Vice President Al
Gore as opposing the ''Bush-Giuliani'' team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will you sell off the school board building or invest in our
children's education? Will you resort to teacher-bashing or engage
in problem-solving?'' the U.S. Senate candidate said to tumultuous
cheers from the audience at the New York Hilton hotel in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, her likely Republican opponent, has been highly
critical of the New York City school system and has vowed to sell
Board of Education headquarters, cut the staff, and move the
offices into a smaller, modern building.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added a line that she has taken to saying only in the
last few days: ''I'm proud this November I will be on the ticket
with Vice President Al Gore. He will make education his priority as
president. ... I will work with him, I will fight with him, I will
be by his side as we fix our public schools and put more teachers
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''We know that this is not the priority of the
Bush-Giuliani team. That other team, they want to talk about
gimmicks like vouchers and that's a conversation I'm more than
willing to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Bush both support vouchers. Clinton does not.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has defended his school policies as efforts to reform
the city's much-criticized educational system. He has taken credit
for putting police in charge of school safety, ending tenure for
principals and stopping social promotion for students.

<HEADLINE> Kosovars Return to Divided City  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A few families at a time,
NATO has been discretely returning ethnic Albanians to their homes
in the Serb-dominated zone here, hoping that their quietly growing
numbers will restore normal life to this divided city, officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   French peacekeepers declared that they have now returned 93
people -- a total of 49 families, slipping them across the Ibar
River, which divides Kosovska Mitrovica, and settling them back
home without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Though most moves have been small -- on Friday five families went
home -- the peacekeepers want the consistent trickle of returns to
add up to a larger message against ethnic division.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a negligible amount and it is the beginning of
something bigger,'' said Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, a spokesman for
the French peacekeepers. ''We will move slowly to restoring public
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovska Mitrovica, 25 miles north of Pristina, is one of the
few communities in Kosovo where Serbs continue to comprise a
significant segment of the population. Many Serbs left Kosovo after
NATO's 78-day air campaign, fearing attacks leveled in revenge for
wartime atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of repatriating ethnic Albanians driven from the
apartments in the city has touched off riots and other violence in
the northern part of town -- a Serb oasis where bus lines, postal
communications and other ties to Serbia proper have not been
severed in the aftermath of the war and NATO's intervention.
</P>
<P>
   With tensions still palpable, relief agencies such as the U.N.
refugee agency are expressing concern for the people being sent
home, vehemently pointing out that conditions are far from ideal
for such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think this environment allows for a return that is
sustainable,'' said Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. ''In some cases the conditions to which
they return are worse than where they came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are being resettled into three apartment buildings
alongside the Ibar River. Peacekeepers have strung razor wire
around the complex and have parked tanks in the driveway, creating
an armed camp that residents fear leaving -- even to do the most
basic of errands.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constant security, recent events have proved that
the French cannot be everywhere. In one case, a rocket slammed into
one of three apartment buildings in the complex where the refugees
are being returned. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the rocket attack, there is such a palpable sense of
fear,'' Ghedini said of the apartment residents. ''It has made them
realize how vulnerable they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the top Serb leader in Kosovska Mitrovica, Oliver
Ivanovic, was quoted by Belgrade's independent Beta news agency as
saying that the ''international community has a completely wrong
approach in solving the problems'' in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic expressed fear of attacks coming from the
Albanian-populated neighborhoods against the smaller part of the
city where the remaining Serbs live.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state-run news agency Tanjug reported that
unidentified Kosovo Albanian militants fired on a Serb farmer
Saturday, then finished him off with an axe as he lay wounded in a
wheat field.
</P>
<P>
   Srdjan Peric, 26, and three other Serb farmers were sowing in a
field just northwest of the Kosovo capital of Pristina when the
unknown attackers opened fire. Peric fell wounded while the other
three managed to escape. The attackers came from the nearby ethnic
Albanian village of Mazgit, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be independently confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Arabs Protest Settlements  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Top Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met for
the first time in over a month Saturday to discuss overdue aspects
of the peace process, and Israel beefed up security for fear of
terror attacks aimed at derailing the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat met three times this week in order to get peace talks back
on track -- including a summit with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak agreed that Israel will in the coming days
implement overdue aspects of interim agreements, including a
withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, which had been slated
for Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Israel will release Palestinian prisoners accused
of anti-Israeli activity and open a route for Palestinians to
travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat and his counterpart, Oded Eran, met in Jerusalem late
Saturday to work out an agenda for the negotiations on the 6.1
percent withdrawal, prisoner release and opening of the ''safe
passage,'' Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak also agreed this week that negotiations on a
framework agreement on the thorniest issues between them and on the
scope of an additional West Bank withdrawal will begin after March
20 -- a Muslim holiday -- in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the two sides broke off in early February over
disagreements on what territories would be included in the next two
withdrawals. The Palestinians had demanded that the upcoming
pullout include areas around Jerusalem and that the next withdrawal
be larger than the 1 percent of the West Bank that Israel had
originally said it would offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Haaretz newspaper reported Friday that Barak will, before a
final peace agreement, offer the Palestinians a state in the Gaza
Strip and 50 percent of the West Bank. In exchange, the
Palestinians would agree that Israel could annex 10 percent of the
West Bank where Jewish settlements are located. Officials on both
sides denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians currently control about 40 percent of the West
Bank and hope to oversee 90 percent before the final peace
agreement, which the sides hope to iron out by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Israel beefed up security throughout the country Saturday since
several members of a militant cell that was uncovered earlier this
month have not been apprehended, the army said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five militants in the cell were killed March 3 in a
shoot-out with police in the Israeli Arab town of Taibeh. One was
captured and others are still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some 500 Palestinians and Israelis demonstrated
together in the West Bank cities of Hebron and Qalqilya on Saturday
against the expansion of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlements are one of several thorny issues the two
sides are to address as part of a final peace treaty they hope to
work out by Sept. 13.

<HEADLINE> 136 Charged in Egyptian Riots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's chief prosecutor charged 136 people
Saturday in connection with a recent three-day riot between Muslims
and Christians that left 23 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The religions and identities of those charged was not known, but
Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid said they were facing charges
of incitement, murder, attempted murder, robbery and damage to
property.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Wahid said the Dec. 31-Jan. 2 riots in the southern
Egyptian village of el-Kusheh were not religiously motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The riots began after an argument between a Muslim customer and
a Christian shopkeeper. Most of the dead were Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigations ... did not show any specific religious
bigotry or prove any division in the national unity,'' Abdel Wahid
was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency. His
statement was the government's first report on the riots.
</P>
<P>
   He said ''no religious clergymen or fanatics or defendants of
any political affiliation'' were charged, an apparent reference to
Father Gabriel Abdel Masih, a local Coptic Christian priest.
Prosecutors had earlier accused Abdel Masih of ''leading a gang
which attacked a section of the population, a criminal conspiracy
to kill and destroy properties, attempted murder and possession of
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why Abdel Masih, who said he was innocent, had
been removed from the list of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Wahid did not say whether the defendants will be tried by
a military court under emergency laws or by an ordinary criminal
court. Under Egypt's emergency law some of the charges carry the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Christians, who are mostly Orthodox Copts, comprise 10
percent of the country's 64 million people, and have generally
lived peacefully with the overwhelmingly Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in el-Kusheh, 275 miles south of Cairo, was the
worst in decades, and the government blamed it on ''conflicting
reactions between Muslims and Christians on business matters.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Kusheh came to world attention in 1998 when its Christians
accused police officers of making widespread use of torture during
a murder investigation. The government denied any torture.

<HEADLINE> Opponents denounce ocean sand mining plan  </HEADLINE>
By JOY RUSSELL PEREZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) -- Anger and tears flowed at a public
hearing held Saturday to discuss a proposal to mine sand off the
coast of Monmouth County.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 people, including fishermen, environmentalists, scuba
divers and Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, gathered here at the
Ocean Place Resort and Conference Center to oppose a company's plan
to dredge for sand and gravel 3 to 12 miles off the waters of Long
Branch to just south of Belmar.
</P>
<P>
   Amboy Aggregates Co. of South Amboy is asking the Minerals
Management Service, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the
Interior, for rights to mine the 100-square miles area. Company
officials say they want to mine there because of the area's
high-quality sand, which can be used in construction projects
throughout New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the plan also rejected the company's request for an
environmental impact study to be conducted on the effects of mining
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan goes through, it will become the nation's first case
of a private mining company buying a lease from the government to
mine in federal waters so close to the shoreline, Pallone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, New Jersey is going to be the guinea pig if this
happens,'' said Pallone. ''This proposal has implications beyond
the coast of New Jersey and I've asked Secretary of the Interior
(Bruce) Babbitt to stop this from moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pallone said this plan could open the door for other companies
to mine sand off the coast of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The MMS and the Department of the Interior will ultimately
decide on the proposal, Pallone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake about it. This is environmental rape,'' said
Erik Lougren, a fishermen on the Sea Dragon and member of the
Fisherman's Dock Co-op of Point Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   David Wallace, a representative from the North American Clam
Association, said 80 percent of the surf clams that are harvested
along the Northeast coastal section are taken in and around the
proposed mining area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clams grow in sand. That's the only habitat they grow well
in,'' Wallace said. ''If you go in there and start dredging, you
will kill off all of these clams.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Arthur, a member of the New Jersey Council of Diving Clubs,
was in tears as he spoke of the prospects of not being able to
wreck-dive in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize for the emotion,'' said Arthur. ''As an
experienced wreck diver off the coast of New Jersey, I would like
my child and other children to experience what I have
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 supporters of the proposed mining plan were present at
the hearing. Signs placed on the floor in the back conference room
read: ''It's our shore. Not Pallone's'' and ''Sand don't vote. We
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let the scientists prepare their study and we'll see how it
comes out. We will be bound by that study,'' said Gary Rosensweig,
an attorney for Amboy Aggregates Co.
</P>
<P>
   William Clayton, president of Clayton Sand Co. of Lakewood,
whose company owns half of Amboy Aggregates Co., said the study
should be performed to determine what, if any, effects mining in
the area might have on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe we have harmed the environment when dredging
for material in Ambrose Channel and we are certainly not out to
harm the environment,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Amboy Aggregates Co. has dredged the Ambrose Channel since 1985,
according to company president Richard Rosamilia.
</P>
<P>
   Rosamilia was present for the hearing but refused to speak
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why has it become so unholy for a company to make money?''
Rosamilia said outside the hearing. ''This whole country is based
on harvesting the natural resources. Timber is harvested and oil
companies have been digging for oil. Why is that always bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Rosamilia acknowledged that beach erosion is possible when
mining near the shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''But sand is always moving and it's always being replaced,''
Rosamilia said. ''What we want to take is so minimal. Our process
has less impact on the environment than a beach replenishment
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosamilia said it would cost his company $30 million for mining
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The company could initially earn $1 million a year in profits if
the plan is allowed, Rosamilia said.
</P>
<P>
   The public has until April 10 to send its comments regarding the
proposed mining plan to the Minerals Management Service.

<P>
   Severe storms and possible tornadoes ripped through South,
damaging homes and leaving thousands without power.
</P>
<P>
   At least five deaths were blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy rain and winds blustered into Georgia and Florida
Friday night Saturday morning. Winds blew down tree limbs and
caused some roof damage in Georgia, and funnel clouds were reported
in Jackson County, Fla. No major damage was reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuscaloosa, Ala., officials said a 52-year-old woman died
Friday night when debris from a billboard struck her. In Texas,
four people died in two separate wrecks blamed on wet road
conditions earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Three possible tornadoes were reported in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   One tornado that hit Birmingham suburbs damaged 35 to 40 homes
''pretty severely,'' said Emergency Management Agency spokesman
Mark Kelly. Flooded creeks pushed 14 people out of their homes
Friday night, the Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wind opened the door and started swinging it back and
forth,'' said Jennifer Allen, who sought safety with four others in
a Tuscaloosa convenience store. ''We couldn't see anything. We
thought we were going to fly into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 people in Alabama were still waiting Saturday for
power to be restored, down from more than 30,000 at the storm's

Blast in Ukraine Mine Kills 80
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- In Ukraine's worst mine disaster since before 1980, 80
workers died and seven were injured when a methane gas explosion ripped through
a coal mine in the eastern part of the country. The early afternoon blast at the
Barakova mine in Krasnodon came at a depth of 2,191 feet while 277 people were
working in the mine, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Nearly 200 miners
managed to leave the shaft after the blast, it said. Methane, a naturally
occurring colorless, odorless and highly explosive gas, often seeps out of coal
seams and can build up easily in poorly ventilated mine shafts.

   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The roof of a public building collapsed Saturday on up
to 60 soldiers during a multinational military exercise in northern Norway,
killing at least two people and injuring seven. At least two soldiers were
missing. The community house in the town of Bardufoss, 750 miles north of Oslo,
was being used by the troops as a command center during the 12-nation Joint
Winter military exercise. The roof apparently collapsed under the weight of
snow. A military spokesman said he thought most or all of the troops in the
accident were Norwegians. It was not immediately clear if U.S. troops were
involved in the exercise.

Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, has pledged to curb a powerful military still
staunchly loyal to the former military ruler. ''This is a fiesta for

election. ''I think Gore came out of the process strengthened and Bush came out
of the process weakened. And that probably puts them on equal ground,'' said
Chicago-based Democratic consultant David Axelrod, expressing the view shared by
analysts in both parties. GOP consultant Ed Gillespie of Washington predicts
''an incredibly tight election'' and said ''both of them have a lot of work to
do in the next eight months.''

Columbine Report To Be Detailed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A final investigative report on the Columbine High
School massacre will detail the attack ''shot by shot'' and confirm that only
two gunmen were involved, The Denver Post reported in its Sunday editions. The
report is based on 5,000 interviews, 4,000 leads and 10,000 pieces of evidence
gathered after the April 20, 1999 rampage in which 12 students, one teacher and
teen gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold died.

   BRINY BREEZES, Fla. (AP) -- Robert Conkey, the 77-year-old mayor of Briny
Breezes oceanside mobile home park, has spent $11 in pursuit of re-election. His
83-year-old opponent? He hasn't spent a cent. In fact, Herbert M. Kessman, the
first resident ever to challenge a sitting mayor, returned his sole campaign
contribution, a check for $43. The standoff between the two senior citizens
could be one of the most inexpensive and civil elections in the country. Life is
pretty laid back in Briny Breezes, where 28 citizens in their 90s and three
100-year-olds showed up for a recent community center party. The race gives the
500 or so mostly elderly residents something to talk about.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Sworn In As Chilean President  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALPARAISO, Chile (AP) -- Ricardo Lagos was sworn in Saturday as
Chile's first socialist president in nearly three decades,
promising to fortify a young democracy and help those left out of
its legendary free-market expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, a 62-year-old lawyer who won national fame a decade ago
while fighting Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, has pledged to
curb a powerful military still staunchly loyal to the former
military ruler.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fiesta for democracy,'' a smiling Lagos, wearing a
dark suit and red tie, said Saturday. He took his oath in the
Congress building in this port city as leaders from Europe and the
Americas looked on and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   After the inauguration, he flew to Concepcion, 350 miles south
of here. Before thousands of flag-waving supporters there, he
promised a major effort to fight poverty, and that the provinces
would not be forgotten in development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Poverty and destitution will always be evils that must be
eliminated,'' Lagos said.
</P>
<P>
   He later flew back to Santiago to a welcome by tens of thousands
of people, who lined the streets as he drove to the presidential
palace. As Lagos stepped onto a balcony to speak, the crowd
chanted, ''Trial to Pinochet.'' Lagos did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, he stressed national unity: ''I will be the
president of all Chileans, those in the center, those in the right,
those in the left; civilians and military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos continues the decade-long rule of the Concertacion, a
center-left coalition government that restored democracy in 1990.
He defeated a rightist rival, Joaquin Lavin, on Jan. 16 in the
closest of the three presidential elections since the end of
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos is Chile's first socialist president since Marxist
Salvador Allende, toppled in the 1973 coup that ushered in
Pinochet's 17-year rule. But the new leader does not espouse
radicalism. The Duke University-educated economist promises
improved public education, better health services for the poor and
unemployment benefits in a country intent on building a social
safety net to match its free-market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His main challenge: to restore Chile's economic growth rates to
those enjoyed during the first years after democracy's return.
</P>
<P>
   Chile became the envy of its Latin American neighbors after
trailblazing a free-market path. Gross Domestic Product expanded
7.3 percent a year on average. But last year, the country slipped
into its worst recession since the mid-1980s: GDP fell 1.1 percent
and the unemployment rate doubled to more than 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One in five Chileans, or 22 percent of the country's 14.5
million people, remain in poverty, though that is down from 46
percent in 1987. Lagos has promised 150,000 more jobs in his first
six months in office.
</P>
<P>
   And although per capita income more than doubled from $2,500 in
1990 to $5,700 in 1998, Lagos has said he understands the
''legitimate sense of frustration'' of those left out of the
economic good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the election, we all unite behind the same car to push
with force, and that car is called Chile,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There are positive economic signs. GDP is expected to grow again
by as much as 6 percent this year, and the jobless rate has dropped
to less than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, 61, entered the public eye in 1988, when he worked to
defeat a referendum that would have extended Pinochet's control
until the turn of the century. In a televised debate on the
referendum, Lagos pointed his finger directly into the camera as if
addressing Pinochet personally, calling him a ''liar'' and
''ambitious'' for wanting to hang onto power.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is back home in Chile after spending 16 months in
confinement in Britain fighting attempts to prosecute him for his
regime's human rights abuses. He did not attend Saturday's
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 84 was freed after a medical report determined he was
too ill to be sent to Spain to stand trial. Lagos said he supported
Pinochet's release but made clear he would not interfere if the
Chilean courts decide to try the ailing general, whose regime is
blamed for more than 3,100 deaths and disappearances.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Head Backs Farm Occupation  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe said black
squatters may remain on white-owned farms so long as they are
peaceful, the state-run media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments -- similar to but firmer than other statements
Mugabe has made before about the illegal occupations -- were likely
to harden the standoff between the government and white farmers who
produce the bulk of the nation's marketed crops, including tobacco,
the biggest hard currency earner.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to tribal chiefs in the central city of Gweru on
Friday, Mugabe said the squatters could remain on the more than 400
white-owned farms, despite an earlier police pledge to enforce
private ownership laws decreed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue has now been resolved. It was agreed that they can
remain on the farms as long as they are peaceful,'' the state-owned
Herald newspaper and state television quoted Mugabe as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, blacks, led by veterans of Zimbabwe's
eight-year war of independence, have occupied the properties,
claiming rights to land farmed by descendants of British settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Farmers Union, representing about 4,000 white
farmers, said it would study Mugabe's remarks Saturday before
issuing a response.
</P>
<P>
   The union has sharply criticized the police for not forcibly
removing squatters who have assaulted farmers and their families
and disrupted production on the privately owned land. It said law
and order had broken down in farming districts as ruling party
politicians encouraged the takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups have accused Mugabe of promising free land to
shore up his ruling party's collapsing support before elections in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe suffered a major political blow last month, when voters
rejected a revised constitution he supported that would have
empowered him for the first time to seize white-owned land without
paying compensation. It was his biggest political defeat since he
led the nation to independence in 1980 after a bitter bush war.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mugabe said the government would honor the result of
the referendum, officials have included land seizure provisions in
amendments that parliament will add to the present constitution
when it meets next month.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe told the chiefs that the government would discuss with
squatters' leaders how the occupied land could be demarcated into
plots for the resettlement of their families and other landless
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the whites to learn that the land belongs to
Zimbabweans,'' the Herald quoted Mugabe as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the occupied farms are owned by Zimbabwean-born whites.
Though some inherited land, many bought their farms after the
country won independence from Britain two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 white farmers own about one-third of the productive
land in this nation of 12.5 million people.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton Urges Against Profiling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Black leaders must remember the legacy
of Martin Luther King Jr. and ''get into the trenches'' to fight
racial profiling and attacks on affirmative action, the Rev. Al
Sharpton said Saturday at the finale of a voting rights
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here today to reconnect with the giants that brought us
this far,'' he told about 500 people in the same downtown
Montgomery church where King preached in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton and King's son, Southern Christian Leadership
Conference president Martin Luther King III, spoke at the
conclusion of a weeklong march from Selma retracing the footsteps
of the 1965 march that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 mainly college and high school students completed the
54-mile trek Saturday. Their journey began March 6, the day after
President Clinton joined in the 35th anniversary of the ''Bloody
Sunday'' confrontation at Selma that put the nation's focus on the
voting rights crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not home yet,'' Sharpton said. ''We're not home as long
as affirmative action is being fought in this country, as long as
there's racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very sad day in America when we're trying to dismantle
affirmative action,'' said the younger King.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dorothy Kohlars, a World War I nurse who
became the first woman to win France's National Order of the Legion
of Honor, died Monday in Barstow. She was 104.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlars was born in Hanover, Mass., in 1895 and graduated from
nursing school toward the end of World War I. After joining the
Army Nurse Corps, she served in France in 1918 at an Allied
hospital near the front.
</P>
<P>
   She worked by flashlight. Basic supplies such as bandages often
were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought the world was coming to an end,'' she told the
Riverside Press-Enterprise in 1998. ''I wandered around in the dark
feeling pulses and I once put my hand into an open chest.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned from France in 1919 and was posted to an Army
hospital at Nogales, Ariz., on the Mexican border. She was
discharged in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   She married Murray Kohlars in 1932 and worked as a nurse in
veterans hospitals in Los Angeles and La Jolla until 1943.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband later ran a gas station and rented cabins
near Las Vegas. They later moved to Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 she was awarded the National Order of the Legion of
Honor, one of France's highest honors, for her World War I
contributions. She was the first woman and among the first 100
American veterans to receive the honor.
Jack Mann
</P>
<P>
   LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Jack Mann, a long-time sports reporter who
worked for Newsday, The New York Herald Tribune and Sports
Illustrated, died Saturday. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Mann began his career at the Babylon Leader after a stint in the
Marines during World War II and a year at Columbia, then became
sports editor at Newsday in the 1950s, said his son, Steven Mann.
After working for about a year on the news side at the Detroit Free
Press, Mann was hired in 1963 to cover horse racing for the Herald
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for Sports Illustrated from about 1964 to 1966, when
he took time off to write a book, ''The Decline and Fall of the New
York Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mann worked for the Washington News, the Washington Star
and briefly for the Washington Times, and then for The Evening Sun
of Baltimore. He also wrote for Racing Times.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include six children.
Geoffrey H. Moore
</P>
<P>
   BLOOMFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Geoffrey H. Moore, a world-renowned
analyst of business cycles, died Thursday. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Moore rose to prominence during a 30-year career at the National
Bureau of Economic Research, a quasi-official private body in
Cambridge, Mass., that determines when recessions begin and end.
</P>
<P>
   He served as commissioner of labor statistics during the Nixon
administration and taught at New York University, Rutgers
University, Columbia University and the Colorado School of Mines.
He was also a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, at age 82, he founded the New York-based Economic Cycle
Research Institute, which works to predict inflation.
John Wehle Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- John Wehle Jr., who helped transform
family-operated Genesee Brewing Co. into the nation's fifth-largest
brewer before negotiating its sale in December, died Friday of lung
cancer. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wehle's leadership, Genesee Corp. was transformed from a
brewing business into a diversified company with interests in food
processing, real estate and equipment leasing.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of his father, John Wehle, and his
grandfather, Louis Wehle, Wehle joined the company in 1968, was
named chief executive officer in 1986 and chairman in 1993. He
remained chairman until his death but relinquished the CEO role
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Wehle family owned a controlling interest in the voting
stock of Genesee Corp., a publicly traded company, for nearly 70
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 121-year-old brewery was sold to a New York investment
company that recently launched another regional brewery in
Wisconsin. Platinum Holdings, owner of City Brewing Co. in La
Crosse, Wis., said Genesee Brewing would continue operating in its
hometown. Some of the money-losing brewery's 470 workers will lose
their jobs, but it remains unclear how many.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee produces 1.6 million barrels of beer and ale a year and
had net revenues of $103.3 million in the 1998-99 fiscal year.

   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Reshea Bristol scored eight of her
game-high 21 points in the final two minutes as No. 22 Arizona beat
California 64-58 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Angela Lackey added 13 points for the Wildcats (24-6,
13-5 Pac-10), who finished tied for second in the conference
despite winning just four of their last seven. The 24 wins by the
Wildcats is a school record.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the shaky final stretch, Arizona will likely receive a
fourth straight invitation Sunday to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya Corley scored 18 points to lead California (11-17, 6-12).
Shavaki Jackson added 12 points and nine rebounds for the Bears,
who led for most of the game before being outscored 13-2 in the
final 2:26.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona fell behind by as many as nine in the second half and
trailed 56-51 before Bristol's free-throw shooting helped the
Wildcats avoid the upset. Bristol made all six of her free throws
in the final two minutes and added a layup at the buzzer as Arizona
defeated California for the 10th straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona held the Bears' leading scorer, Paige Bowie, to seven
points on 2-of-13 shooting and forced three turnovers in the final
90 seconds to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats shot just 45.9 percent from the floor against the
Bears, but dominated in rebounds (35-26) and at the free-throw
line. Arizona made 28 of 37 free throws overall compared to
California's 8-of-11 from the line.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jetliner bound for the Los
Angeles area turned back and made an emergency landing Saturday
afternoon after a fake explosive device was found in a carry-on
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Chutes on the MD-80 series airliner were deployed and passengers
slid to the ground, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport spokesman
Bob Parker said. He said two people suffered minor injuries from
the slide and were treated at the scene and released.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the bag was found under a seat and no one on board
the Ontario, Calif.-bound jet claimed it, so the pilots turned
around for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a piece of carry-on luggage designed to look like it has
an explosive inside, with wires and such,'' Parker said, adding
that it was not the type of training device used by the airport. He
did not know which airline or organization would use such a device.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was being treated by Port of Seattle Police as a
criminal investigation, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is, was it left over from a training exercise or
did someone put it on the aircraft with bad intent?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman did not immediately return a call
seeking comment Saturday.

   Three young men were shot as 300 young people left the Beach
High School gymnasium in Savannah about 11:15 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Smalls, 19, died from gunshot wounds at a Savannah
hospital shortly after the shootings. Officials said Smalls was not
a student.
</P>
<P>
   Ramone Kimble, a 16-year-old student at Savannah High School who
was shot in the head, died shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday at
Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, nursing
supervisor Ellen Pinckney said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Jenkins, a 16-year-old Beach High School student, was shot
in the buttocks. He was treated and released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah police arrested Darrell Ingram, 19, Saturday morning
and charged him with two counts of murder and one count of
aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody knows at this point how it got started,'' said Robert
Gilbert, associate superintendent of Savannah-Chatham County Public
Schools. ''It did not happen on the campus ... it happened across
the street, not on school property.''
</P>
<P>
   The dance -- a celebration of the Lady Bulldogs' state
championship victory on March 3 -- was supposed to be restricted to
students only. Officers don't know if the suspect or the victims
attended the dance.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 Okla. 81, No. 13 Texas 65  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A lackluster first half stirred up
Eduardo Najera.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Oklahoma played sluggishly for the first 20 minutes in
their Big 12 semifinals. The Longhorns went to the locker room with
a 32-30 lead, and the Sooners went to the locker room upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coaches jumped on us and told us how we had to play in the
second half,'' said Najera, who responded by scoring 21 of his
career-high 31 points in the second half as No. 15 Oklahoma beat
No. 13 Texas 81-65 to advance to the final Sunday against No. 7
Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team, if we don't play with a lot of emotion, then we're
not very good. I wanted to win this game so badly. This is my last
turn around this tournament and I wanted to win bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera was the driving force in a decisive second-half rally
that carried Oklahoma. He fueled an 18-5 run that started midway
through the second half to send Oklahoma (26-5) into the final
against Iowa State, which beat Oklahoma State 68-64 in the first
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Eduardo in the second half,'' Oklahoma guard Nolan
Johnson said. ''It was with his aggressiveness, attacking them,
that made me more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma beat Iowa State 80-75 in double-overtime during the
regular season, giving the Cyclones one of their four losses.
</P>
<P>
   Najera's previous career high was 29 in December against
Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was an All-American performance,'' Sooners coach Kelvin
Sampson said of Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Najera, who had 28 in a game at Texas on Jan. 15 and has scored
77 points against the Longhorns (23-8) in three games this season,
helped send the Longhorns home disappointed again. The Longhorns
have been to the Big 12 semifinals three straight years, losing
each time. They have not made a tournament final since losing in
the Southwest Conference final to Texas Tech in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma and Texas split their two regular-season games, each
winning at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed in our mental makeup,'' Longhorns coach Pat
Barnes said. ''There was a lot of things I didn't like about this
team. I don't know if it's this time of year, but thank goodness
the season didn't end today, because we weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Johnson and J.R. Raymond each had 16 points for the
Sooners. Chris Mihm had 20 points to lead Texas, and Gabe Muoneke
had 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out intense,'' Mihm said. ''We were just playing to
play. We were lackadaisical. They really got into us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma led 45-40 after a basket by Najera, but the Longhorns
closed to 45-44 on a basket by Ivan Wagner and a pair of free
throws by Muoneke.
</P>
<P>
   But Victor Avila started the decisive run with a jumper, and
Najera banked in a 3-pointer and then scored off a feed from Kelly
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners led 57-47 with 8:16 to play when Johnson won a
fierce scramble for a loose ball and drove for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Then Najera, one of the four unanimous choices for the All-Big
12 team, along with Mihm, took control with powerful inside moves.
He scored three straight baskets, and Oklahoma led 63-50 with 5:40
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners led 67-55 with 4:44 to play when Najera scored
again.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince Readies for Feast  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Crown Prince Abdullah opened one of
the world's biggest slaughterhouses Saturday, where about 600,000
animals are expected to be killed for a Muslim feast to follow the
hajj pilgrimage next week.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day feast, which starts Thursday, marks prophet
Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his son, Ismail. It will be
celebrated throughout the Muslim world with sheep, cows and camels
being slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   The Al-Muaesem slaughterhouse in Mecca, built for about $125
million, comprises four sections that can handle 200,000 animals a
day, an official statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600,000 animals are expected to be slaughtered during Eid
al-Adha, or the ''feast of sacrifice.'' All the meat will be
donated to the poor in more than 27 Muslim countries, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hajj begins Wednesday when pilgrims start gathering on Mount
Arafat, 12 miles from Mecca. They will spend the night there, the
first ritual of the hajj. Muslims believe that Islam's Prophet
Mohammed gave his last sermon 14 centuries ago on Mount Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The other rituals of the hajj will be performed on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday: Pilgrims throw stones at two pillars outside
Mecca and circle the cubic black stone called Kaaba in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Abdullah also inspected a township of 40,000
fireproof tents set up for the pilgrims in Mina, near Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 fire, apparently caused by pilgrims cooking in their
tents, left 343 people dead and about 1,500 injured. Since then
pilgrims have been banned from cooking inside tents, and the
government has launched a program to replace the ordinary tents
with fireproof ones.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2.1 million people are expected to participate this year in
the hajj, which every able-bodied Muslim is required to perform at
least once.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mecca's streets were filled with pilgrims, many of
them sporting small flags of their country on their chests.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi policemen directed people inside and outside the Grand
Mosque, Islam's holiest shrine. Hundreds of thousands enter the
mosque every day during the hajj period.
</P>
<P>
   Police checkpoints around Mecca and neighboring holy areas made
sure only Muslims entered the areas.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of water coolers were set up around Mecca for Muslims
to drink water from the holy well of Zamzam.

<HEADLINE> Hal's Hope Wins Florida Derby  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Before he jumped aboard Hal's Hope
in what would turn out to be the race of a lifetime, jockey Roger
Velez gave 88-year-old owner/trainer Harold Rose a big hug.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such a terrific story,'' Velez said. ''He's been so sick
and the good Lord gave him a horse to keep him going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope lived up to his name Saturday, staving off a
determined run by favored High Yield to win the $750,000 Florida
Derby by a head and keeping the Triple Crown hopes alive for Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Rose knows he's lucky to be around to enjoy his greatest moment
in 30-plus years in the racing business after retiring from the
printing and publishing world in 1968. In August, Rose had
quadruple-bypass surgery but was back at his barn three weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons I got back so quickly is I had Hal's
Hope,'' said Rose, who took out his trainer's license in New Jersey
before moving to south Florida in the early 1970s. ''I knew he was
something special the first time I saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who named the best horse he's ever had after himself,
cheered on Hal's Hope from the stands at Gulfstream Park, pumping
his right arm in the air as his 3-year-old colt crossed the finish
to the cheers of a hometown crowd of 28,003.
</P>
<P>
   The result has Rose dreaming of his return to the Kentucky Derby
after 16 years and Velez anxious to get there for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time I'm going to the Derby with a contender,'' Rose
said, referring to his previous claim to fame, saddling Rexson's
Hope to a 10th-place finish in the 1984 Derby. ''That time I was
going with a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, with Velez aboard for all eight of the 3-year-old
colt's lifetime starts, finished second to High Yield in the
Fountain of Youth Stakes on Feb. 19, losing by 3\ lengths. However,
Rose said his colt bled in that race so he ran him on the diuretic
Lasix on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went right. And now that Rose has the orchids that go
with a Florida Derby victory, he's ready to run for the roses at
Churchill Downs on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''My expectations have been realized,'' Rose said. ''I knew this
was a good horse right from the beginning, and now he's proved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Velez has fought back from problems, too. In the
early 1980s, he battled alcohol dependency and his wife, Patti,
said he had a stroke and was paralyzed on one side of his body for
a time.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope broke on top in the 1[-mile Florida Derby, and
relinquished the lead only once, for an instant at the eighth pole.
High Yield, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, came mighty close to
regaining the edge in the stretch, but never was able to pull
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The two hooked up along the backstretch, leaving the rest of the
10-horse field to fight it out for third. Hal's Hope, a son of 1989
Florida Derby winner Mercedes Won, was along the rail over a track
many trainers said favored speed horses. High Yield, with Pat Day
aboard, slipped inside Hal's Hope, but Velez, riding in his first
Florida Derby, kept his colt in front as the two turned for home.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield made one more move, along the outside, but he wasn't
going to catch Rose's colt. ''Once he gets in front,'' Rose said,
''he's not going to let another horse pass him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Day: ''That was a great horse race.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, winning for the third time in his last four races,
covered the 1[ miles in 1:51 2-5 and returned $15.80, $5.20 and
$3.60. High Yield, the even-money favorite, returned $3 and $2.40.
Tahkodha Hills was third, 10 lengths behind High Yield, and paid
$8.60.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement was fourth, followed by Postponed, Scottish Halo,
Deputy Warlock, Elite Mercedes, Bare Outline and Hades. Hal's Hope
earned $450,000 for Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is kind of a happy ending,'' Lukas said. ''I'm happy for
him. If I was going to lose, I'm glad I lost to that guy. But I'm
not going to pitch him any slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Hal's Hope could be the Blue Grass Stakes or Wood
Memorial, both on April 15, while High Yield is headed to the Blue
Grass.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Trippi, the 4-5 favorite, came from off the
pace and won the $100,000 Swale Stakes by 1} lengths over Ultimate
Warrior to keep him on the road to the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi, ridden by Jerry Bailey, covered seven furlongs in 1:23
2-5 and has won all three career starts. The colt's next race could
be either the Spiral Stakes on March 25 or the Flamingo Stakes on
April 8.
</P>
<P>
   In other races at Gulfstream, 2-1 favorite Beckon the King won
the $100,000 Fort Lauderdale Handicap by 2\ lengths over Kettle Won
and Dancing Guy took the $75,000 Creme Fraiche Handicap by one
length over Yankee Victor.

<HEADLINE> No. 5 Michigan St. 55, Wisconsin 46  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Defense, that's Wisconsin's game. It's Michigan
State's, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in the Big Ten tournament semifinals, the No. 5
Spartans played it better.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a strange world and shots are not always going to go in.
One thing you can do is go out and give great effort and play great
defense,'' Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves said after sparking
the Spartans past the Badgers 55-46.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can stop a team, you are going to win. We feed off our
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans (25-7) watched as the Badgers, who led the Big Ten
in scoring defense this season, cut a 19-point deficit to five in
the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then State clamped down. And in final 5:29, Wisconsin couldn't
make a basket against the suffocating State defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said, 'We need to step it up, here comes the real
Wisconsin,''' Cleaves said. ''I was thinking we need to run some
plays and get some open shots and get the ball to Mo (Maurice
Peterson).''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves had four points and a nice feed to Peterson in the
closing minutes and now the Spartans face a rematch in the title
game against Illinois, which beat Penn State 94-84 in Saturday's
first semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   State beat Illinois 67-50 in last year's league tournament
finals and used it as springboard for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA
tournament, which it parlayed into a trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to worry about our own stuff and doing what we've
always done -- defense and rebounding,'' said Peterson, who led
State with 18 points. State pounded Illinois 91-66 in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves scored 13 Saturday -- shooting just 5-of-13 -- and had
seven assists, and Andre Hutson added 10 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (18-13), confident it will get a bid to the NCAA
tournament, had beaten Northwestern and Purdue on Thursday and
Friday but didn't have enough to stop the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got it down to five but we just ran out of clock,'' Badgers
guard Duany Duany said. ''We wanted to make some noise in this
tournament. We did that. I thought we did a good job of getting
back and making them earn their shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading 34-21 at the half, Michigan State looked like it would
run away in the first five minutes of the second as Cleaves hit a
jumper, Hutson scored six straight points and Peterson swooped in
for a driving layup after a steal and feed from Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   That made it 44-25.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all pretty upset when were down 19. We feel we were a
better team than that and we wanted to show it,'' Wisconsin guard
Mike Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at each other and said: 'Let's get going. This is
enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   So back came the Badgers. Duany made two 3-pointers, the second
capping a 15-2 run that brought Wisconsin within 46-40 with 9:07
left.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson hit a 3-pointer, but the Badgers scrapped back again
and Andy Kowske's follow shot made it 49-44 with 5:29 to go. That
would be Wisconsin's last basket.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves hit two free throws after he was fouled in the lane and
then drove for a basket with 3:40 to go to push the lead to seven.
And after Mark Vershaw missed a layup, Cleaves fed Peterson, who
was fouled and hit two free throws, giving State a nine-point lead
with 2:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's only points in the final 4:07 came on two free
throws by Vershaw, who led the Badgers with 11 points, but shot
just 4-of-14.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be prepared to play defense against them because
they play it well,'' Cleaves said. ''You have to be prepared for
them to be in your face for 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Peterson put it: ''You have to be ready to check and be
checked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans used their superior quickness to beat the Badgers
to loose balls in the first half. Cleaves put the State ahead 34-21
at the half when he banked in a jumper just before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans also beat Wisconsin 56-41 in the tournament
semifinals last year and then won both regular-season meetings this
season, by 17 in Madison and by five in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson played in his 130th game, passing Antonio Smith for the
Michigan State career lead.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An art installation connecting Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and the Nazis at an upcoming Whitney Museum exhibit has
angered one of the museum's benefactors, the New York Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, ''Sanitation,'' by Hans Haacke, upset 73-year-old
heiress Marylou Whitney so much that she has told the museum
director she plans to stop donating money to the museum and will
quit its national fund-raising board.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation will be part of the museum's multi-artist exhibit
beginning March 23.
</P>
<P>
   The installation piece consists of a wall lined with garbage
cans, each containing a speaker playing audio of marching troops. A
gold-framed reproduction of the First Amendment would be on the
wall, along with six quotations -- three from the mayor -- written in
the Gothic typescript favored by Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's quotations refer to ''Sensation,'' a controversial
Brooklyn Museum exhibit which featured a portrait of the Virgin
Mary with a clump of elephant dung. Giuliani unsuccessfully sought
to stop city funding of the museum because of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The other quotations in the upcoming Whitney exhibit are from
Pat Robertson, Jesse Helms, and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, whose mother-in-law, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney
founded the Whitney Museum, told the Post she wished that ''they
could take the Whitney name off that museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had intended to make a big contribution to the Whitney in my
will, but not now. This is a horrible work. I can't even call it
'art,''' Whitney told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Director Maxwell Anderson said in a statement that, ''I
regret any discomfort we may cause supporters of the museum in
pursuit of the artistic mission established by Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney in 1930.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be ''saddened'' if the exhibit leads anyone to
resign from the museum's national fund-raising committee.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Saturday, Giuliani said the Whitney ''is
a private institution and they have the right to do whatever they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the issue of public funding made the Whitney's
case starkly different from that of the Brooklyn Museum of Art
because the former receives little public money while the latter
benefits from substantial government funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the people who are saying that this is wrong and
demeaning,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This demeans, in a very profound way, the meaning of the
holocaust.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Eye Polls, Running Mates  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Triumphant in their primaries, Al Gore and
George W. Bush are testing messages, raising cash, counting
electoral votes and considering potential running mates for what
promises to be a hard-fought presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Gore came out of the process strengthened and Bush
came out of the process weakened. And that probably puts them on
equal ground, '' said Chicago-based Democratic consultant David
Axelrod, expressing the view shared by analysts in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Ed Gillespie of Washington predicts ''an
incredibly tight election'' and said ''both of them have a lot of
work to do in the next eight months.''
</P>
<P>
   In the span of an hour, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley
conceded defeat Thursday to Gore and Arizona Sen. John McCain bowed
to Bush -- leaving only the collection of delegates in one-sided
primaries to cinch their nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In a quick pivot, Gore and Bush began planning for the fall
election.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Sunday's New York Times, Gore set out some
major campaign themes -- portraying himself as a champion of
campaign finance reform and questioning whether Bush had the
necessary experience to be president.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the Texas governor was pushing his tax cut proposal
-- he called it a ''risky tax scheme'' -- because it was the
''personal top priority'' of ''the vast majority'' of special
interests giving unregulated ''soft money'' to the Republiocan
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS: Bush and Gore emerged from primary fights in a dead
heat for the presidency. National polls released after their Super
Tuesday landslides showed the pair even in both head-to-head
matchups and in public perceptions of their political skills.
</P>
<P>
   In actual voting, Gore topped Bush, McCain and Bradley in
California's open primary Tuesday. Exit polls showed that
Californians, given a choice between Bush or Gore, selected the
vice president over the Texas governor 51 percent to 44 percent.
Hispanics, an emerging force in national politics, chose Gore by
more than a 2-to-1 margin in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Though not binding, the balloting was closely watched because
California is the biggest electoral prize in November. Gore almost
certainly can't win the presidency without the state's 54 electoral
votes, analysts say. Republican advantages elsewhere make the state
slightly less critical for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAP: It takes 270 electoral votes to be president. If Bush
can win states claimed by 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, he starts with
a base of 156. The Texas governor hopes to add Louisiana, which
borders his home state, and Florida, where his brother, Jeb, is
governor. New Mexico and Arizona both selected President Clinton in
1996, but could go to Bush in the fall and give him about 200
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not enough.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bush and Gore both will look to the same six battleground
states in their race to 270: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois, Missouri and New Jersey. These states, which award more
than 100 electoral votes, traditionally swing between Democrats and
Republicans, and polls suggest Bush and Gore evenly matched in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUNNING MATES: The battleground states also could be ground
zero for vice presidential candidates, as Bush and Gore look for an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge hails from a swing state with 23
electoral votes, and is a Catholic who believes in abortion rights.
Bush was associated with an anti-Catholic institution in the
primaries, and may see Ridge's contrary view on abortion as a way
to move the ticket to the center
</P>
<P>
   Ridge is almost certain to be on Bush's short list.
</P>
<P>
   Failed presidential candidate Rep. John Kasich could help in his
home state of Ohio. Gov. George Pataki might help Bush upset Gore
in New York, a state no Democrat can afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Geography isn't everything. Retired Gen. Colin Powell is a
certain short-lister because of his popularity throughout the
country. Elizabeth Dole might help court women. Former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney would add gravitas to the ticket. McCain
could court independents. Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating is a
telegenic anti-abortion Catholic who served in the FBI and, as
governor, helped his state cope with the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's list is almost certain to include California Gov. Gray
Davis. If he wants to make a serious run at Florida, Sen. Bob
Graham would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers openly tout former Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin. They say naming Defense Secretary William Cohen, a
Republican, could give the ticket bipartisan appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, a Catholic from Massachusetts, and Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, a Hispanic and former congressman from
New Mexico, are also mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   THE MONEY: Bush spent most of his record-breaking $70 million
haul, but can spend as much as he raises as the nominee-in-waiting.
Gore was more frugal, but accepted federal matching money that
dramatically limits his spending. Both candidates will depend on
their national parties to finance ad campaigns until the
presidential nominating conventions, after which the federal
government gives the campaigns tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   THE MESSAGE: Courting McCain voters, both candidates claim to be
reformers. Polls show Americans are evenly divided on who they see
as the agent of change.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is considered the better candidate to protect Social
Security and improve schools, two top-ranking concerns in the
battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan began his campaign as the middle-of-road
''compassionate conservative'' but reached out to social
conservatives to win South Carolina. ''He needs to get back to
where he was,'' said Gillespie, the GOP consultant and a Bush ally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to inoculate himself against questions about his
1996 fund-raising activities. Even as Bush tried to make the
scandal an early issue, Gore challenged his new rival to accept a
ban on unregulated, unlimited donations called ''soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused, as Gore knew he would, and now donors in both
parties are churning out soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the sidelines are Bradley and McCain, the
vanquished candidates who met in New Hampshire this winter and
vowed that, if nominated, they would ban soft money from the
campaign.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Votes To Ban Same-Sex Marriage  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BUNDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- The West Virginia Legislature voted
Saturday to ban homosexual marriages and prohibit the state from
recognizing such marriages performed in other states.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the 60-day legislative session, the House
approved the measure 96-3 and sent it to the governor for his
signature. The Senate previously passed it unanimously. Gov. Cecil
Underwood introduced the ban, so his agreement is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were concerned we didn't have a statute. We could be forced
into recognizing same-sex marriages from other states,'' Underwood
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow marriage licenses to be issued only to
couples consisting of a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   It would insert onto marriage license applications the phrase,
''Marriage is designed to be a loving and lifelong union between a
woman and a man.'' The bill also prohibits West Virginia from
recognizing homosexual marriages performed in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Smith, co-chairman of the West Virginia Lesbian and Gay
Coalition, said, ''I think this is a really sad day. The main
purpose of the bill is to say, once again, that people who are gay
and lesbian are second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Californians approved a ballot measure that
prohibits the state from recognizing same-sex marriages legally
performed in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hawaii Supreme Court raised the possibility of
same-sex marriages in 1993 -- a prospect the state's voters later
rejected -- 30 states and the federal government passed laws denying
recognition to same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, town meetings have been held to guide state
lawmakers trying to craft legislation following a state Supreme
Court ruling that gays are unconstitutionally being denied the
benefits of marriage.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Stanford 65, Arizona St. 57  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER BERRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Stanford has a share of the Pac-10 title for
the second straight season, but the No. 2 Cardinal had to do it the
hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Jacobsen scored 14 of his 17 points in the second half as
Stanford overcame a sloppy start to beat Arizona State 65-57
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to have this one,'' Jacobsen said. ''We couldn't afford
another loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (26-3, 15-3 Pac-10) had dropped their previous two
games, to UCLA and No. 9 Arizona. The Wildcats beat California
70-61 in Tucson later Saturday for a share of the league title and
the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because of a sweep of
Stanford this season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State (18-12, 10-8) needed to upset the Cardinal to have
any realistic shot at an NCAA tourney bid. For awhile, that looked
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a horrible start with 10 turnovers in the first 10
minutes. Maybe we were nervous,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. ''But we got back on track in the second half. It was gutty
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils likely will wind up in the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think we're one of the top 64 teams,'' Arizona State
coach Rob Evans said. ''We are deserving of making the tournament.
We just got a little tired today. Stanford is big and physical and
they wore us down.''
</P>
<P>
   David Moseley finished with 15 points, all in the second half,
as Stanford and tied a school record with its 15th conference win.
</P>
<P>
   Alton Mason paced the Sun Devils with 13 points and Eddie House
had 11, but only two in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   House, the only senior on a freshmen-filled Arizona State
roster, made just 5 of his 23 shots. Overall, the Sun Devils were
20-of-69 from the field for a season-low 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not my last game,'' said House, six points shy of
becoming Arizona State's career scoring leader. ''I wish we had a
conference tournament. We've had a great second half this season.
We deserve to keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal appeared to be in trouble early with Arizona State
using an 11-0 run to take a 16-6 lead. But Moseley keyed a 15-0
spurt to put Stanford up 21-16 with 6:20 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, Justin Allen and Donnell Knight all sank 3-pointers as
the Sun Devils closed the half with a 9-0 run for a 30-26 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen opened the second half with a 3-pointer from the corner
-- one of seven Cardinal 3-pointers in the second half -- and Michael
McDonald's 3-pointer put Stanford ahead to stay at 34-32 with 18:13
left.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Mendez came off the bench to make a pair of 3-pointers that
capped a 20-6 run for a 46-36 lead with 12:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive 3-pointers from Jacobsen and Mendez made it 55-43
with 9:23 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State closed to 57-50 on two free throws by Knight with
3:06 left, but Jacobsen made three free throws down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jacobson was huge,'' Montgomery said. ''He played 37 minutes.
I asked him if he was tired a couple times and he said, 'Coach, I
want them all the way.' He's a great competitor.''

<HEADLINE> Whitney heiress: she'll stop donations because of Holocaust-themedart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An art installation connecting Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and the Nazis at an upcoming Whitney Museum exhibit has
angered one of the museum's benefactors, the New York Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, ''Sanitation,'' by Hans Haacke, upset 73-year-old
heiress Marylou Whitney so much that she has told the museum
director she plans to stop donating money to the museum and will
quit its national fund-raising board.
</P>
<P>
   According to the museum, Ms. Whitney is one of about 60 members
of the museum's national committee, each of whom contributes about
$5,000 to the institution annually. She also hosts an annual
luncheon in New York on behalf of national committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanitation'' will be part of the museum's multi-artist exhibit
beginning March 23.
</P>
<P>
   The installation piece consists of a wall lined with garbage
cans, each containing a speaker playing audio of marching troops. A
gold-framed reproduction of the First Amendment would be on the
wall, along with six quotations -- three from the mayor -- written in
the Gothic typescript favored by Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's quotations refer to ''Sensation,'' a controversial
Brooklyn Museum exhibit which featured a portrait of the Virgin
Mary with a clump of elephant dung. Giuliani unsuccessfully sought
to stop city funding of the museum because of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The other quotations in the upcoming Whitney exhibit are from
Pat Robertson, Jesse Helms, and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitney, whose mother-in-law, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney
founded the Whitney Museum, told the Post she wished that ''they
could take the Whitney name off that museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had intended to make a big contribution to the Whitney in my
will, but not now. This is a horrible work. I can't even call it
'art,''' Whitney told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Director Maxwell Anderson said in a statement that, ''I
regret any discomfort we may cause supporters of the museum in
pursuit of the artistic mission established by Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney in 1930.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be ''saddened'' if the exhibit leads anyone to
resign from the museum's national fund-raising committee.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Saturday, Giuliani said the Whitney ''is
a private institution and they have the right to do whatever they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the issue of public funding made the Whitney's
case starkly different from that of the Brooklyn Museum of Art
because the former receives little public money while the latter
benefits from substantial government funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the people who are saying that this is wrong and
demeaning,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This demeans, in a very profound way, the meaning of the
holocaust.''

Fake Explosive Device Found on Jet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jetliner bound for the Los Angeles area
turned back and made an emergency landing today after a fake explosive device
was found in a carry-on bag. Chutes on the MD-80 series airliner were deployed
and passengers slid to the ground, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
spokesman Bob Parker said. Parker said the bag was found under a seat and no one
on board the Ontario, Calif.-bound jet claimed it, so the pilots turned around
for Seattle. ''It's a piece of carry-on luggage designed to look like it has an
explosive inside, with wires and such,'' Parker said, adding that it was not the
type of training device used by the airport.

   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A methane gas explosion ripped through a coal mine in
eastern Ukraine today, killing 80 workers and injuring seven in the former
Soviet republic's worst mine disaster in decades. The early afternoon blast at
the Barakova mine occurred at a depth of 2,191 feet. The Emergency Situations
Ministry said 277 people were working in the mine. Nearly 200 miners managed to
leave the shaft after the blast. Vitaly Ageev, senior duty officer at the
ministry, said 80 miners were killed and seven were hospitalized after being
rescued from the mine, in Krasnodon, about 530 miles east of Ukraine's capital,
Kiev. All of the workers in the mine were accounted for.

   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The roof of a public building collapsed Saturday on up
to 60 soldiers during a multinational military exercise in northern Norway,
killing at least two people and injuring seven. At least two soldiers were
missing. The community house in the town of Bardufoss, 750 miles north of Oslo,
was being used by the troops as a command center during the 12-nation Joint
Winter military exercise. The roof apparently collapsed under the weight of
snow. A military spokesman said he thought most or all of the troops in the
accident were Norwegians.

connection with a recent three-day riot between Muslims and Christians that left
23 people dead. The religions and identities of those charged was not known, but
Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid said they were facing charges of
incitement, murder, attempted murder, robbery and damage to property. Abdel
Wahid said the Dec. 31-Jan. 2 riots in the southern Egyptian village of
el-Kusheh were not religiously motivated. The riots began after an argument
between a Muslim customer and a Christian shopkeeper. Most of the dead were
Christian.

rivers and ruin the soil also provide jobs in a country where there aren't many.
Baia Mare gained international infamy when cyanide spilled from a nearby
reservoir on Jan. 30, sending poisonous water gushing into the Tisza and Danube
Rivers, killing hundreds of tons of fish. On Friday, a dam at a state-owned zinc

<HEADLINE> Can Hillary take a joke? Reporters' show mocks her and Rudy  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Can the first lady take a joke?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question as Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the
Inner Circle show, an annual spoof on local politics staged by New
York City reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The show is renowned for its rollicking tastelessness and
outrageous jokes. Over the years, politicians ranging from Bella
Abzug to Mario Cuomo have been so offended by the show they never
came back.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday night event also marked the first time Clinton has
been in the same room with her Republican rival, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, since the two began campaigning against one another for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One scheduled gag features the Hillary character taking a subway
to Shea Stadium in Queens ''where I can watch my favorite team, the
New York Yankees!''
</P>
<P>
   When a rider tries to explain that the Yankees actually play in
the Bronx in Yankee Stadium, Hillary explains her confusion by
responding: ''Sorry ... We live in Chappaqua now, you know. That's
Indian for ''The Land of Separate Bedrooms.'''
</P>
<P>
   She then asks for directions to Times Square, adding: ''My
husband wants me to pick up a few things for him at the Virgin
Megastore.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was invited to attend the roast as a guest of the Daily
News and sat at the newspaper's table with publisher Mort
Zuckerman. As she walked past Giuliani, she wished him well in his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor -- who sat one table away with his press aides and some
deputy mayors -- welcomed the first lady. But later, Giuliani told
reporters ''I'm very, very encouraged that we are drawing a lot of
out-of-towners to this performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the event, Giuliani said of the first lady, ''I hope that
as someone who isn't from New York that she doesn't miss the
jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's overall plot features a hapless Hillary (played by
Court TV anchor Sheila Stainback) being hauled off to jail for
campaigning in Times Square, while Rudy (WNYW-Fox morning anchor
Jim Ryan) picks on homeless people. President Clinton shows up, but
instead of bailing out his wife, he springs Jennifer Lopez and
leaves Hillary in the slammer with rap mogul Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   The Lopez character wears a skimpy dress like the sensational
frock the singer wore to the Grammy Awards. In real life, Sean
''Puffy'' Combs and Lopez were recently detained following a
shooting in a Times Square nightclub. Lopez was later released
without being charged, but Combs was indicted for gun possession
and attempted bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor traditionally follows the reporters' show with a spoof
of his own. Clinton's aides had asked if she could put on a skit
too, but the Inner Circle declined, citing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some politicians have found the reporters' show
so offensive that they walked out in the middle or never returned.
Abzug, when she was serving in Congress, was reduced to tears one
year when her stout figure was mocked. U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel
walked out in a huff when then-Mayor Ed Koch donned an Afro wig.
And former Gov. Cuomo was angered by a scene that poked fun at his
Italian heritage. He never attended again.
</P>
<P>
   But mayors have traditionally risen to the occasion and
delivered their own outlandish rebuttals. David Dinkins rode into
the room on a live horse. And in 1997, Giuliani appeared --
unforgettably -- in full drag.
</P>
<P>
   The $400-a-head black tie dinner at the New York Hilton raises
money for local charities including homeless shelters, soup
kitchens and educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani wore a tuxedo. Clinton was dressed in a floor-length,
long-sleeved black satin gown.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 Oklahoma 81, No. 13 Texas 65  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG HORST, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A lackluster first half stirred up
Eduardo Najera.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Oklahoma played sluggishly for the first 20 minutes in
their Big 12 semifinals. The Longhorns went to the locker room with
a 32-30 lead, and the Sooners went to the locker room upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coaches jumped on us and told us how we had to play in the
second half,'' said Najera, who responded by scoring 21 of his
career-high 31 points in the second half as No. 15 Oklahoma beat
No. 13 Texas 81-65 to advance to the final Sunday against No. 7
Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team, if we don't play with a lot of emotion, then we're
not very good. I wanted to win this game so badly. This is my last
turn around this tournament and I wanted to win bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera was the driving force in a decisive second-half rally
that carried Oklahoma. He fueled an 18-5 run that started midway
through the second half to send Oklahoma (26-5) into the final
against Iowa State, which beat Oklahoma State 68-64 in the first
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Eduardo in the second half,'' Oklahoma guard Nolan
Johnson said. ''It was with his aggressiveness, attacking them,
that made me more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma beat Iowa State 80-75 in double-overtime during the
regular season, giving the Cyclones one of their four losses.
</P>
<P>
   Najera's previous career high was 29 in December against
Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was an All-American performance,'' Sooners coach Kelvin
Sampson said of Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Najera, who had 28 in a game at Texas on Jan. 15 and has scored
77 points against the Longhorns (23-8) in three games this season,
helped send the Longhorns home disappointed again. The Longhorns
have been to the Big 12 semifinals three straight years, losing
each time. They have not made a tournament final since losing in
the Southwest Conference final to Texas Tech in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma and Texas split their two regular-season games, each
winning at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed in our mental makeup,'' Longhorns coach Rick
Barnes said. ''There was a lot of things I didn't like about this
team. I don't know if it's this time of year, but thank goodness
the season didn't end today, because we weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Johnson and J.R. Raymond each had 16 points for the
Sooners. Chris Mihm had 20 points to lead Texas, and Gabe Muoneke
had 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out intense,'' Mihm said. ''We were just playing to
play. We were lackadaisical. They really got into us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma led 45-40 after a basket by Najera, but the Longhorns
closed to 45-44 on a basket by Ivan Wagner and a pair of free
throws by Muoneke.
</P>
<P>
   But Victor Avila started the decisive run with a jumper, and
Najera banked in a 3-pointer and then scored off a feed from Kelly
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners led 57-47 with 8:16 to play when Johnson won a
fierce scramble for a loose ball and drove for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Then Najera, one of the four unanimous choices for the All-Big
12 team, along with Mihm, took control with powerful inside moves.
He scored three straight baskets, and Oklahoma led 63-50 with 5:40
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners led 67-55 with 4:44 to play when Najera scored
again.

   ''He gave us a huge lift because some of the looks we were
getting we weren't knocking them down,'' coach Mike Krzyzewski said
of his top reserve, who missed four games with his illness. ''You
see that ball go in the basket and it helps you on the defensive
end.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the team that we've had most of the year,'' he added.
''So, we're trying to get into the mode again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy, 4-for-5 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free-throw
line, had plenty of help as Duke picked up its 3-point shooting in
the second half, making nine long-range shots after starting
6-for-20.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just really confident right now,'' said Dunleavy, who is
10-for-12 from the field in two tourney games, including all seven
3-point tries. ''I've got fresh legs, I'm shooting the ball well
and the shots are going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Battier led the way with 18 points, while Jason Williams
had 16 points and 11 assists and Nate James 14 points. James was
the key jump shooter in the second period, making four 3-pointers
over the final 10:21.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our veterans played like veterans today,'' Krzyzewski said.
''Nate didn't score a point in the first half, and then all of the
sudden he gets 14 in the second. He didn't wait until the next game
to make his adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Howard had a season-high 19 points for the fifth-seeded
Demon Deacons (17-14).
</P>
<P>
   ''I want our team to feel that they got better today,'' Wake
Forest coach Dave Odom said. ''When you can play at the top of the
heap for as long as we did with as much effort, execution and
commitment as we did, you've got to feel you got better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils trailed by a point at the break and by four
early in the second half before going on an 11-0 run to take
command. Williams started the run with a 3-pointer, and after four
straight missed shots, Dunleavy made a long 3-pointer as Duke built
the lead to 50-43.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, a 3-pointer by James increased the margin to
10 with 8:26 left, and Duke was on its way to its eighth straight
win against the Demon Deacons.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 36 minutes it was a dead even game,'' Odom said. ''But as
we all know there is win-time in basketball played at this level,
and there was about a four-minute stretch there that they decided
the game. Some of the things were acts of commission by them and
acts of omission by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke made an ACC tourney record 17 3-pointers in a 31-point
first-round win Thursday night against Clemson, but started 1-for-6
from long range against the Demon Deacons to fall behind by as many
as eight.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed about six minutes midway through the half
to repair a ripped net on Duke's end after a follow shot by
Battier. But the stoppage didn't slow down the Demon Deacons, who
went up 26-18 on a pair of free throws by Darius Songaila and ended
up shooting 54 percent for the half.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy kept Duke close, scoring 12 points in 11 first-half
minutes as Wake Forest led 37-36.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils were 3-3 this season when trailing at the half,
but improved to 36-1 over the last two years against ACC
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've won a lot of close games so there's the impression of
some type of dominance, and there is none,'' Krzyzewski said.
''We've just won close games. I would hope people would always
think we're good for the ACC.''

<HEADLINE> Ammo Removed From Doctor's House  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities on Saturday removed the last
of 27 canisters packed with plastic explosives and other hazardous
materials from the home of doctor suspected in an assassination
attempt on his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as health inspectors cleared the home of Dr. Larry Ford,
who killed himself March 2 as police sought to question him, 250
residents of 52 nearby homes were allowed to return home, ending a
four-day evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just ready to go home,'' said resident Karen Crellin,
who was evacuated with her husband and their two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 49, shot himself to death a day after police searched his
home as part of the investigation into the wounding of James
Patrick Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is chief of Biofem Pharmaceutical Inc., a biomedical
company formed to market female suppositories to prevent sexually
transmitted diseases. He was shot in the cheek by a masked gunman
Feb. 28 outside the company's Irvine headquarters, but survived.
The gunman has not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have charged the alleged getaway driver, Dino
D'Saachs, 56, of Altadena, with conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, D'Saachs described his longtime friend Ford as a
caring man.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me once he could never be a pediatrician because it
would hurt him too much to see a child cry,'' D'Saachs told the
Orange County Register in a jailhouse interview.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford's death, a police search uncovered 21 canisters
buried beneath a false floor at his home. They contained firearms
and thousands of rounds of ammunition, including machine gun
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Six more canisters were found under a concrete slab on the side
of the house, beneath pool chemicals and trash cans. All have been
given to the FBI, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Ford told the Register and the Los Angeles Times
that the infectious disease specialist had gathered intelligence on
biological matters for the federal government. The South African
Embassy in Washington is investigating reports that Ford advised
the South African Defense Force on chemical and biological weapons.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Democrats Make History on Web  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT THOMSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Although busy computer connections and other
glitches frustrated some voters in Arizona's Democratic primary
Saturday, a record turnout was still certain as the party completed
the first binding election for public office using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The state's voters had a choice of using traditional paper
ballots or computer terminals at most of the 124 polling sites.
Mail in ballots were also available. Even without a competitive
race, more than 35,000 people -- three times as many as participated
in 1996 -- had cast ballots in early Internet voting completed
Friday. An additional 20,000 mail-in ballots also were cast.
</P>
<P>
   But with Vice President Al Gore having the nomination assured
and his rival, Bill Bradley, out of the race, the story became more
about how Arizona Democrats were voting to allocate 31 delegates
and not for whom, although Indiana businesswoman Heather Anne
Harder was also on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 234 Democratic delegates were being decided this
weekend in Arizona, Michigan and Minnesota. The three states have a
total of 295 delegates, including at-large delegates not selected
by primary or caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan caucuses Saturday, Gore had 15,854 votes to 3,117
for Bradley with all 135 caucus sites reporting and all mail-in
ballots counted. That translated to at least 107 delegates for Gore
and 7 for Bradley, with the allocation in three congressional
districts unavailable Saturday night as voters chose 129 of
Michigan's 157 total delegates.
</P>
<P>
   While not as groundbreaking at Arizona's Internet voting,
Michigan Democrats allowed mail voting for the first time and more
than 75 percent of the caucus ballots were cast by mail.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 of 111 precincts reporting after the first of two days
of Minnesota caucuses, Gore had 74 percent of the votes to 12
percent for Bradley in contests for 74 of the state's 91 total
delegates. However, a candidate has to get at least 15 percent of
the votes cast in a congressional district to win any delegates and
Bradley had not reached that threshold anywhere Saturday. Were that
pattern to hold true Sunday, Gore would get all 74 of the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona party officials were excited about the turnout,
expecting the highest number of ballots since Arizona switched from
a nominating convention to a primary in 1984. ''What a nice problem
to have, the place being busy,'' state Party Chairman Mark Fleisher
said. ''Not too many elections have had that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's vote was a glimpse at the future, said Phil Noble,
president of PoliticsOnline, a South Carolina-based company that
provides Internet tools for politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are millions of people who want to participate and
they're telling us the Internet is the way they want to
participate,'' Noble said. ''What Arizona proves is it's going to
happen a lot faster than anyone imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   But the future didn't arrive without some glitches, usually
associated with the large number of people participating.
</P>
<P>
   Ute Brady of Scottsdale, a native of Germany who exercised her
first vote since becoming a U.S. citizen, wasn't able to vote
online at Scottsdale Community College because of the heavy volume.
But she said since it was her first election, she preferred using a
paper ballot anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Millie Cunningham of Phoenix, also had problems. She tried
repeatedly to log on from home to cast her vote, but she said all
she ever got was a busy message or a blank computer screen. She
finally decided to cast a paper ballot the old fashion way. ''It
sounds so easy to do. I wanted to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Burns, 63, a Phoenix engineer, said he found no
problems and would like to see the Internet used in general
elections.

<HEADLINE> US, Colombian Writers Meet Castro  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- American writers Arthur Miller and William Styron
and Colombian literary great Gabriel Garcia Marquez discussed
everything from World War II to the battle over 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez during a dinner with Fidel Castro that stretched into
early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, three of the most famous writers of the 20th century made
a pilgrimage to the former residence of another literary giant --
the late Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was stimulating and provocative -- and quite long,'' Styron
said of the dinner meeting with the Cuban president. ''It was a
very exciting occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He talked about everything in the world,'' Miller added in an
interview with Associated Press Television News during a tour of
Hemingway's former residence, the ''Finca Vigia,'' now a carefully
restored museum on the outskirts of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Styron are in Cuba for a trip aimed at increasing
contact between American and Cuban intellectuals. They were to meet
Sunday with Cuban writers, actors and playwrights before returning
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They also met with a leading Cuban human rights activist,
Elizardo Sanchez, to hear his views on civil liberties in the
communist country. They also visited Ricardo Alarcon, president of
Cuba's National Assembly, and Castro's point man on Cuban-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Marquez, who arrived separately in Cuba before the
Americans, is a frequent visitor to Cuba and a personal friend of
Castro. The Nobel prize laureate is known best for his novel ''One
Hundred Years of Solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was accompanied by his wife, photographer Inge Morath.
</P>
<P>
   The 85-year-old playwright is probably best known for the
Pulitzer-Prize winning ''Death of a Salesman'' and Tony-Award
winning ''The Crucible,'' which looked at anti-Communist witchhunts
in the United States during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans especially remember Miller as a former husband of the
late actress Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Styron came with his wife, poet Rosa Styron. The 75-year-old
novelist is author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''The Confessions
of Nat Turner,'' as well as ''Sophie's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the delegation was Bill Luers, president of the U.S.
United Nations Association and a former State Department official
who during the Carter administration negotiated the opening of the
U.S. Interests Section in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy had been closed since Havana and Washington
broke diplomatic relations in 1961 and the interests section
allowed the United States to represent American interests here
under the flag of the Swiss Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation also includes: Wendy Luers, member of the board
of directors of the National Endowment for the Arts and president
of The Foundation for a Civil Society; renowned literary agent
Morton Janklow and his wife, Linda Janklow, president of the
Lincoln Center Theatre.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Daughter Garners Support  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore's eldest daughter rolled across
western Tennessee on a bus tour Saturday to get out the vote in the
Democratic stronghold and garner support for the vice president in
his home state's primary balloting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping at a union hall where Gore supporters served coffee and
donuts, Karenna Gore Schiff said there are three reasons to vote
for her father: ''He's a visionary, he's a principled fighter, and
he's a policy pioneer. If you need a fourth, he's a really great
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a few jabs at her father's Republican opponent, Texas
Gov. George Bush, including his father for calling Gore ''Ozone
Man'' because of his views on environmental protection and global
warming. Gore talked about the environment before it was a ''cool''
thing to do, said the 26-year-old Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore has all but wrapped up his nomination, Schiff
said the Tennessee primary was important and that her father wants
to have a big Democratic turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my family's home state and it's also a real
battleground,'' said Schiff, adding that she wanted especially to
get young people to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of six states with presidential primaries
Tuesday. Gore's opponent, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
dropped out of the race and endorsed Gore this past week after
having lost to Gore in each of the primaries held so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make a good showing, because Al Gore is ours,''
said Marianne Wolff of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Although born in Washington, D.C., where his father, Albert Gore
Sr., represented Tennessee in Congress for 32 years, Gore as a
youngster spent many summers in the state and later worked as a
journalist in Nashville -- where Schiff was born -- and he still has
a farm in the state
</P>
<P>
   When his presidential campaign ran into early trouble last year,
Gore abruptly moved his campaign headquarters out of Washington and
to Nashville. At all seven stops, Schiff said that move was key to
his recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore supporters on Saturday marveled at Schiff's skill on
the campaign trail. ''I think she's Al's secret weapon,'' said
Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, who is a third-year law student and lives with her
husband and 8-month-old son in New York City, has become a favorite
stand-in for the vice president in his campaign and has organized
several fund-raisers. She was the host of his Super Tuesday
celebration in New York and introduced her father when he
officially announced his campaign because her mother was too
hoarse.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently whether the Gore family's political torch was
destined to pass to Schiff, the vice president marveled at her
aptitude for the family business. ''I have no idea what options
she'll consider or discard in the future, but I'm very proud of
her,'' he said. ''She really has perfect pitch, or very nearly
perfect pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said she has no immediate plans to run for office
herself, but like a good politician didn't rule it out. She said
she always wants to stay involved in politics -- at a stop in
Jackson she asked 4-year-old Brennan Marshall, who was wearing a
''Future President'' T-shirt, whether she could work for his
campaign. He shyly nodded a yes.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff was filling in once again for her mother this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore was to have toured West Tennessee, a traditionally
strong region of the state for Democrats, as part of a
get-out-the-vote strategy, but she decided to stay home in
Washington after her son injured an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   So, Schiff took over her mother's schedule, canceling her own
bus trip which was to have taken her through the Republican
bastions of East Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her bus left Memphis on the far western border of the
state and headed toward small towns that have cropped up near
cotton fields and farms on the flatlands west of the Tennessee
River, before meandering toward the hills of Middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   She wrapped up the trip with a brief rally 11 hours later at her
father's national campaign headquarters in Nashville, where she
made her final pitch for Tennesseans to go to the polls Tuesday.
She said her father needs every vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he's even taking my vote for granted,'' she said
with a laugh.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Temple 65, St. Bonaventure 44  </HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Sixth-ranked Temple finally got to celebrate
an Atlantic 10 championship instead of watching the other team do
it.
</P>
<P>
   A year after coach John Chaney made his players sit in tears and
watch Rhode Island celebrate a last-second victory in the A-10
final, the Owls beat St. Bonaventure 65-44 Saturday for their first
conference title since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always had my team sit there and watch the other winner,
even with tears in their eyes,'' Chaney said. ''I think it's
important to do that. It tells you what you're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a final push for a high seed in the NCAA tournament, the
Owls (26-5) looked dominant one moment and vulnerable the next.
They led by as many as 28 points in the first half, stumbled in the
second and finally got a smile out of Chaney, their dour leader,
when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought his team deserved a No. 1 seed when the NCAA
pairings are announced Sunday night, Chaney said, ''I'm not much
into it. I know that we've earned (one of) 64, and that's what I've
been saying since I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournament MVP Quincy Wadley led Temple with 16 points, and Mark
Karcher had 15. Star point guard Pepe Sanchez failed to score and
missed his only two shots, but had eight rebounds and seven
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're granted a No. 1 seed, then so be it,'' Wadley said.
''We're going to take all comers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Temple's first A-10 championship since 1990, when the
Owls were led by Mark Macon. The Owls tied UMass with their fifth
conference title, also winning in 1985, '87, '88 and '90.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a more talented team,'' Chaney said. ''This team has
more depth. But I dare say that they're not as smart as the
others.''
</P>
<P>
   David Messiah-Capers had 12 points and hit 4 of 5 from beyond
the 3-point arc for the Bonnies (21-9), who are likely headed to
the NCAA tournament despite the lopsided loss. It was only the
second time in school history that the Bonnies made it past the
second round of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly feel we deserve to be in the tournament with what
we've done, winning eight of our last 11 games,'' Bonnies coach Jim
Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure, hindered by shot-blocker Caswell Cyrus' bout
with the flu, finished with its highest victory total since going
21-8 in 1977-78.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had two good games and one bad game,'' Bonnies point guard
Tim Winn said. ''We're ready for the next stage, whatever that may
be.''
</P>
<P>
   For such a long title drought, Temple's postgame celebration was
fairly subdued. Much of their early lead disappeared during a 17-5
run by the Bonnies that infuriated Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who spent a long time on the bench next to Chaney in
the second half, seemed unfazed by his coach's rantings. After
Sanchez threw away a behind-the-back pass, Temple's ornery coach
slammed his clipboard on the floor -- with the Owls leading 34-6.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Chaney if celebrating was better than watching the
other team do it, Sanchez said, ''I've lost so many times, I'm used
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney finally relaxed when the tournament trophy was awarded to
the Owls, joking with Wadley and other players. Perhaps the victory
will help him forget Temple's four straight losses to UMass in the
A-10 title game in the 1990s, as well as last year's 62-59 loss to
Rhode Island on Lamar Odom's buzzer-beating 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonnies didn't score until more than five minutes in, when
Peter Van Paassen put in a layup at the 14:53 mark to cut Temple's
lead to 9-2. Van Paassen also got the Bonnies' first rebound, an
incredible 10:45 into the game. To that point, the Owls
outrebounded St. Bonaventure 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   The normally cold-shooting Owls were 8-for-12 on 3-pointers in
the first half while the Bonnies missed 10 of their first 11 shots
and 23 of 28 in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the romp was even evident on the referees' faces.
After Lynn Greer hit his second straight 3-pointer to give the Owls
a 29-4 lead, referee Joe DeMayo walked by the press table and
rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The next trip down the floor, Wadley hit a 3-pointer to make it
32-4 and shook his head in disbelief as he backpedaled down the
court.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Bonaventure made it respectable -- and gave Chaney
something to be sour about -- with a 17-5 run spanning the last five
minutes of the first half and the first four minutes of the second.
Patricio Prato's 3-pointer cut it to 39-23 with 15:55 left. The
Bonnies got no closer than 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure's 12 points in the first half was the
third-lowest total in any half in tournament history. The record is
10 by George Washington in 1994 and West Virginia in 1992 -- both in
semifinal games against Temple. It was the fewest points in a half
of an A-10 championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls placed three players on the all tournament team --
Wadley, Karcher and Sanchez. Winn and UMass' Monty Mack were the
others.

<HEADLINE> Fake Explosive Found on Jet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines flight attendant was stunned
Saturday to reach into a child's backpack for crayons and find what
looked like an explosive device, prompting an emergency U-turn and
landing at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had quite a shock indeed,'' said airline spokesman Jack
Evans, explaining the device actually was a training aid being used
by Alaska's security firm to conduct a routine test in the airport
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Chutes on the MD-80 series airliner were deployed and passengers
slid to the ground after the emergency landing around 3 p.m.,
airport spokesman Bob Parker said. Two people suffered minor
injuries from the slide and were treated at the scene and released.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, 8 or 9 years old, was by chance carrying a backpack
identical to the one used in the test, Evans said. The boy laid his
pack on a security checkpoint conveyor belt at the same time as the
''passenger'' in the test put the identical bag on, and the boy
picked up the wrong bag on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was traveling unaccompanied on Alaska Flight 444, which
departed Sea-Tac for Ontario, Calif. at 2:06 p.m. with 83
passengers and five crew members aboard. About 30 minutes into the
flight, the boy asked the flight attendant for his bag so he could
use his crayons, and that was when she discovered the device, Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane immediately turned back. The Port of Seattle Police
department's bomb squad was called to the scene and determined the
device was a dummy, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were being put on other flights.

<HEADLINE> Swingley Claims Lead in Iditarod  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KALTAG, Alaska (AP) -- Defending champion Doug Swingley set a
blistering pace down the Yukon River on Saturday to reclaim the
lead in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley, from Lincoln, Mont., covered the 42-mile stretch of
trail from Nulato to Kaltag in a little over three hours, arriving
at 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kaltag is about 350 miles from the Iditarod finish line in Nome.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gebhardt of Kasilof drove his 10 dogs out of Nulato at 9:27
a.m., and Swingley followed 23 minutes later. Both mushers made
only brief stops at the Yukon River village.
</P>
<P>
   From Kaltag, the race continues 90 miles through the Nulato
Hills to Unalakleet on the Norton Sound coast.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Boulding of Manley left Nulato at 2 p.m. Saturday. Six
other mushers -- including former winners Jeff King of Denali Park,
Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, Martin Buser of Big Lake and Rick
Mackey of Nenana -- were all into Nulato by mid-afternoon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Another nine mushers were on the trail from Galena to Nulato.
That group includes Mitch Seavey of Seward, Tim Osmar of Clam Gulch
and DeeDee Jonrowe of Willow.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey said while Swingley's team was strong, it is not as
dominant as it was last year, when it powered away from the field
and won by more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just got another dog team, like the rest of us,'' he told
KNOM radio. ''They seem to be making good time, but maybe he's
taking a lot out of them. He's trying hard to win.''
</P>
<P>
   King said the contenders would be sorted out from the pretenders
by the time the race reached the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll find out on the (Yukon) river who's really going to be
in this race or not,'' he said before leaving Ruby. ''Historically,
the first team to Unalakleet wins the Iditarod, and we're awful
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Swingley has said he considers Swenson his main competition this
year, and predicted that when Swenson's team will pick up speed on
the Yukon. Swingley said he had gotten a good look at Swenson's
dogs and thought they had a lot of drive.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one mushers began the race, which had its ceremonial
start at Anchorage on March 4. Seven mushers have scratched so far.
Shane Goosen of Wasilla, David Straub of Willow, Rich Bosela of
Anchorage and Nelson Shughart of Newtown, Pa. all dropped out of
the race in McGrath late Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The race purse is $525,000, with the winner taking home $60,000
and a new pickup truck. Prize money will be paid to the first 30
finishers.

Fake Explosive Device Found on Jet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines flight attendant today reached into a
child's backpack for crayons and found what looked like an explosive device,
prompting an emergency U-turn and landing at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport. Airline spokesman Jack Evans said the device was a training aid being
used by Alaska's security firm in the airport terminal. The boy, 8 or 9 years
old, laid his pack on a security checkpoint conveyor belt at the same time as
the ''passenger'' in the test put the identical bag on, and the boy picked up
the wrong bag on the other side.

Blast in Ukraine Mine Kills 80

<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Eighty workers died in a coal mine in eastern Ukraine
Saturday when a methane gas explosion occurred at a depth of 2,191 feet. The
Emergency Situations Ministry said 277 people were working in the mine. Nearly
200 miners managed to leave the shaft after the blast. The mine was in
Krasnodon, about 530 miles east of Ukraine's capital, Kiev. All of the workers
in the mine were accounted for.

Clinton Plans Short Stay in Pakistan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juggling U.S. foreign policy interests and distaste for
the military regime, President Clinton will spend only five hours in Pakistan
during a visit this month. This contrasts with a five-day visit to India,
traveling widely in the country and paying homage to India's landmarks and
democratic ways. It is a message that cannot be lost on the government of Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in October in Pakistan and has failed to set
a sure timetable for democracy.

Scientists: Winter Warmest on Record
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This winter has been the warmest on record since the
government began keeping weather statistics 105 years ago, according to
scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The
scientists attributed the warm temperatures to La Nina, a weather phenomenon
related to cooler than normal temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific
Ocean. The researchers couldn't say Saturday whether the warm winter had any
link to a ''greenhouse effect'' caused by pollution into the atmosphere.

Zimbabwe Head Backs Farm Occupation
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's state-run media Saturday reported
President Robert Mugabe as saying black squatters may remain on white-owned
farms so long as they are peaceful. The comments were likely to harden the
standoff between the government and white farmers who produce the bulk of the
nation's marketed crops, including tobacco. Squatters have occupied the
properties, claiming rights to land farmed by descendants of British settlers.
Mugabe has been accused of promising free land to shore up his ruling party's
collapsing support before elections in April.

Saudi Crown Prince Readies for Feast

killed for a Muslim feast to follow the hajj pilgrimage next week. The four-day
feast, which starts Thursday, marks prophet Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his
son, Ismail. The hajj begins Wednesday when pilgrims start gathering on Mount
Arafat, 12 miles from Mecca.

Whitney Heiress To Halt Donations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An art installation connecting Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Nazis at an upcoming Whitney Museum exhibit has angered one of the museum's
benefactors, who says she'll stop giving the institution money. The piece,
''Sanitation,'' by Hans Haacke, upset 73-year-old heiress Marylou Whitney so
much that she has told the museum director that she'll quit its national
fund-raising board as well. The installation consists of speakers playing audio
of marching troops, a reproduction of the First Amendment, and six quotations --
three from the mayor -- written in the Gothic typescript favored by Adolf
Hitler.

John Chaney made his players sit in tears and watch Rhode Island celebrate a
last-second victory in the A-10 final, the Owls beat St. Bonaventure 65-44 today

<HEADLINE> Capitals 4, Devils 2  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ulf Dahlen scored the tie-breaking goal with
18:18 left and Olaf Kolzig stopped 33 shots as the Washington
Capitals rebounded from a rare loss to beat the New Jersey Devils
4-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals scored on their first two shots, then went more
than 36 minutes without a goal before Dahlen skated to the bottom
of the right circle and sent a wrist shot between the legs of
goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Konowalchuk scored into an empty net with 37 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing in Philadelphia on Thursday, the Capitals are
6-1-1 in their last eight games, 24-6-6 since Dec. 22 and 14-1-3 in
their last 18 at home. The stretch enabled Washington to catch the
Florida Panthers atop the Southeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Deron Quint and rookie Scott Gomez scored for the
Devils, who outshot the Capitals 35-20. New Jersey got both its
goals in the opening 8:02.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Nemchinov missed a second-period penalty shot for New
Jersey, 1-3 against Washington this season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Dale Hunter had his No. 32 retired by the
Capitals in a 10-minute ceremony. The sellout crowd had barely
settled down when Washington got the fans back out of their seats
by scoring twice in the opening 4:31.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Simon got his 24th goal at 3:26 after Adam Oates sent him
a centering pass from the behind the net, and Joe Murphy quickly
added his 10th from between the circles.
</P>
<P>
   Quint, acquired from Phoenix on March 7 and making his debut
with the Devils, made it 2-1 at 5:09 by beating Kolzig with a shot
from the left side of the crease. Gomez tied it with his 18th goal.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Jay Pandolfo had a breakaway late in the period
with Washington on the power play, but Kolzig stood his ground and
cast aside the shot.
</P>
<P>
   A similar scenario occurred midway in the second period.
Nemchinov stole the puck in his own end and was awarded a penalty
shot after being pulled down from behind by Sergei Gonchar at the
end of a breakaway. Kolzig proved to be just enough of an obstacle,
as Nemchinov hit the left post on the penalty shot.

<HEADLINE> Gore Shows New Strength in Polls  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore has gained ground in the
polls, locked in a close presidential race with Republican George
W. Bush and considered a strong leader by more than half of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Saturday night had
Vice President Gore at 48 percent and Texas Gov. Bush at 45
percent. A Newsweek poll released Saturday had Bush at 47 percent
and Gore at 44 percent, a difference also within the poll's error
margin.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-Post poll was taken Thursday through Saturday of 1,218
Americans and 999 registered voters and has an error margin of plus
or minus 3 percentage points for each sample. The Newsweek poll was
taken Thursday and Friday of 803 adults and 603 registered voters
and had an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points for
each sample.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a 16-point lead over Gore in the ABC-Post poll in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-Post poll showed Gore has gained from independents and
moderates shifting from Bush, and there was a decline in Bush's
support among Democrats. Gore led by 12 points among women, Bush by
eight points among men.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who view Gore as a strong leader increased
to 55 percent, from 41 percent in January, though Bush was still
rated higher in that area.
</P>
<P>
   About three-fourths in the poll saw Bush as very intelligent,
about the same number who felt that way about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was favored over Bush on a wide variety of issues from
Medicare, foreign affairs, gun control, health care to Social
Security. Bush and Gore were close on taxes, the economy, education
and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds said they were satisfied with the choice of
candidates they had after the primaries -- the highest level
registered in the last two presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, who gave Bush a strong challenge in the GOP
primaries, would fare well in a three-way matchup with Gore and
Bush, according to the Newsweek poll.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-way race, McCain got 32 percent, Bush 35 percent and
Gore had 28 percent in the Newsweek poll. In June 1992, Ross Perot
had a similar showing of strength in polls matched against
President Bush and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-Post poll showed Gore and Bush tied for first in a
three-way match, with a third of the vote each, and McCain behind
them with about a quarter of the vote.

<HEADLINE> Lightning sets two houses ablaze in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Lightning strikes set two New Jersey houses
ablaze within 45 minutes of each other Saturday night, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first incident occurred at about 8 p.m. in South River,
Middlesex County, when a bolt of lightning struck a house at 5
Ridge Rd., and started a small fire.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, and firefighters from South River and nearby
East Brunswick quickly extinguished it, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:45 p.m., lightning struck a house in Hightstown, Mercer
County, and set it ablaze, too. The fire at 254 Stockton St. was
confined to the attic. Firefighters were still on the scene as of
10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lightning struck the gutter and went through the nails right
into the wood, and started the wood and rafters on fire,'' said
Fire Chief John Archer.
</P>
<P>
   He said firefighters had a difficult time reaching the fire,
which mainly burned behind the walls of a finished attic area.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said lightning starts several house fires each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that unusual,'' he said. ''We usually get two or
three a year.''
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, he said, a lightning strike sparked a fire
that heavily damaged a house elsewhere in the borough.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms swept across much of the state Saturday night, and
lightning was reported in numerous areas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service predicted thunderstorms would
continue throughout the state overnight before ending Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service's Mount Holly office also reported pea- to
marble-sized hail from Swedesboro in Gloucester County to Florence
Township in Burlington County. Hail also briefly covered the ground
in Gloucester Township and Cherry Hill in Camden County.

<HEADLINE> Hillary can take a joke; reporters show mocks her and Rudy  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The first lady can take a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered how Hillary Rodham Clinton would react during the
Inner Circle show, an annual spoof on local politics staged by New
York City reporters. But Clinton responded with laughter at many of
the jokes, even those at her expense.
</P>
<P>
   The show is renowned for its rollicking tastelessness and
outrageous jokes. Over the years, politicians ranging from Bella
Abzug to Mario Cuomo have been so offended by the show they never
came back.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday night event also marked the first time Clinton had
been in the same room with her Republican rival, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, since the two began campaigning against one another for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   During an intermission, Giuliani and Clinton bumped into each
other backstage as they greeted the cast. Clinton said to Giuliani,
''I hear you're the star.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani answered, ''We're gonna see, we're gonna see. I like
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to see it,'' Clinton responded.
</P>
<P>
   One scheduled gag featured the Hillary character taking a subway
to Shea Stadium in Queens ''where I can watch my favorite team, the
New York Yankees!''
</P>
<P>
   When a rider tried to explain that the Yankees actually play in
the Bronx in Yankee Stadium, Hillary explained her confusion by
responding: ''Sorry ... We live in Chappaqua now, you know. That's
Indian for 'The Land of Separate Bedrooms.' '' Clinton laughed
heartily afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Her character then asked for directions to Times Square, adding:
''My husband wants me to pick up a few things for him at the Virgin
Megastore.'' Clinton grimaced slightly at the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was invited to attend the roast as a guest of the Daily
News and sat at the newspaper's table with publisher Mort
Zuckerman. As she walked past Giuliani, she wished him well in his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor -- who sat one table away with his press aides and some
deputy mayors -- welcomed the first lady. But later, Giuliani told
reporters ''I'm very, very encouraged that we are drawing a lot of
out-of-towners to this performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the event, Giuliani said of the first lady, ''I hope that
as someone who isn't from New York that she doesn't miss the
jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's overall plot featured a hapless Hillary (played by
Court TV anchor Sheila Stainback) being hauled off to jail for
campaigning in Times Square, while Rudy (WNYW-Fox morning anchor
Jim Ryan) picks on homeless people. President Clinton showed up,
but instead of bailing out his wife, he sprung Jennifer Lopez and
left Hillary in the slammer with rap mogul Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   The Lopez character wore a skimpy dress like the sensational
frock the singer wore to the Grammy Awards. In real life, Sean
''Puffy'' Combs and Lopez were recently detained following a
shooting in a Times Square nightclub. Lopez was later released
without being charged, but Combs was indicted for gun possession
and attempted bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with Stainback backstage and the
reporter-turned-actress pointed to her own blond wig, asking,
''This is a little like it, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded, ''I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor traditionally follows the reporters' show with a spoof
of his own. Clinton's aides had asked if she could put on a skit
too, but the Inner Circle declined, citing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some politicians have found the reporters' show
so offensive that they walked out in the middle or never returned.
Abzug, when she was serving in Congress, was reduced to tears one
year when her stout figure was mocked. U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel
walked out in a huff when then-Mayor Ed Koch donned an Afro wig.
And former Gov. Cuomo was angered by a scene that poked fun at his
Italian heritage. He never attended again.
</P>
<P>
   But mayors have traditionally risen to the occasion and
delivered their own outlandish rebuttals. David Dinkins rode into
the room on a live horse. And in 1997, Giuliani appeared --
unforgettably -- in full drag.
</P>
<P>
   The $400-a-head black tie dinner at the New York Hilton raises
money for local charities including homeless shelters, soup
kitchens and educational programs.

<HEADLINE> Bruins 5, Canadiens 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Brian Rolston scored the game-winner in the
third period as the Boston Bruins beat Montreal 5-3 Saturday night,
snapping the Canadiens' three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston, playing his third game since being acquired Monday in
the trade that sent Ray Bourque to Colorado, redirected Darren Van
Impe's pass from behind the Canadiens' net past Jose Theodore for a
power-play goal 2:13 into the third, breaking a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game that Rolston tallied a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton added his 19th into an empty net in the final
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mann, Shawn Bates and Antti Laaksonen also scored for
the Bruins, who have two wins and a regulation tie in three games
since trading Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Darby, Martin Rucinsky and Shedon Souray scored for the
Canadiens, who lost for just the fourth time in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal appeared to have tied the game 4-4, but Sergei
Zholtok's goal with 3:45 left was disallowed. Referee Terry Gregson
penalized Montreal's Shayne Corson for interfering with goalie Rob
Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   Since falling to 12-24-5-1 on Jan. 7, the Canadiens have 40
points in 30 games (18-8-2-2) to climb back into the playoff
picture in the Eastern Conference.

<P>
   Montreal's Dainius Zubrus had two assists, returning to the

   The Canadiens lost team captain Saku Koivu, who left the game

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace scored seven of his
24 points in the final 4:32 as the Portland Trail Blazers ended a
three-game losing streak with a 99-94 victory over the Detroit
Pistons on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss by the Pistons came on the night they were celebrating
the 10th anniversary of their 1990 NBA championship -- won at the
expense of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen added 18 points for the Blazers, while Grant Hill
scored 30 and Jerry Stackhouse 22 for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first for interim head coach George Irvine, who
was 2-0 after replacing Alvin Gentry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons trailed 44-43 at the half even though just four
Detroit players scored in the first 24 minutes. Detroit's reserves
failed to score in a combined 45 minutes, and starting center Terry
Mills also was shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Mikki Moore finally got the Pistons reserves going with seven
points late in the third. Five of them came in a 7-0 run that
helped them take a 68-64 lead at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Portland quickly narrowed the gap to 70-69, but didn't go ahead
until Detlef Schrempf's 3-pointer made it 81-79 with 5:35 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded the lead until Pippen's 3-pointer and two free
throws by Wallace gave Portland a 92-88 edge with 1:49 left.
Wallace missed his first free throw, but got a second chance after
a lane violation call on Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse was fouled on a 3-point attempt, and hit all three to
make it 92-91. A free throw by Wallace gave Portland a two-point
lead, but Hill turned the ball over and Pippen turned it into a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   After a 3-pointer by Stackhouse made it a one-point game again,
Wallace missed, giving the Pistons a chance to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill missed a layup with 11 seconds left, and Portland got
two free throws each by Schrempf and Pippen to account for the
final score.
</P>
<P>
NOTES: The Pistons had a ceremony at halftime to honor their 1990
NBA championship team, who beat Portland in five games in the NBA
Finals. The highlight was a re-enactment of the play that set up
Vinnie Johnson's series-winning jumper with 0.7 seconds left in
Game 5. This time, Johnson's shot bounced off the rim. ... Bonzi
Wells scored 12 points in his first career game against the
Pistons. Detroit drafted Wells with the 11th pick of the 1998
draft, but traded him to Portland before his rookie season. ... Due
to the lockout, this was the first meeting between Detroit and
Portland since Nov. 20, 1997.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Iowa St. 75, Texas 65  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Desiree Francis scored 19 points to lead
No. 10 Iowa State to its first Big 12 tournament championship with
a 75-65 victory over Texas on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Welle added 17 points and 10 rebounds and Megan Taylor had
16 points for the top-seeded Cyclones (25-5), who finished second
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Longhorns (21-12) couldn't shake early shooting
woes that saw them hit just 26 percent of their first-half shots
and trail 31-21 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   They got to 40-31 on Edwina Brown's basket with 15:58 to go. But
Iowa State scored the next 10 points, four each by Taylor and Tracy
Gahan.
</P>
<P>
   Gahan finished with nine points, eight rebounds and seven
assists while committing only one turnover.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-0 run was part of a 20-6 run that padded the Cyclones'
lead to 60-37 on Welle's two free throws with 8:05 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State led by as many as 24, 74-50, before Texas closed with
a 15-1 run in the last 2:13.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns shot 47 percent from the field in the second half,
but still finished at 36 percent (28-for-77).
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose selection as the tournament's MVP was booed by the
pro-Iowa State crowd, led Texas with 23 points and 11 rebounds. She
hit just 9-of-25 shots from the field, and 10 of her points came in
the last 3:13, when the game was out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Cook added 10 points for Texas, the first No. 6 seed to
reach the finals in the tournament's four-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was joined on the first team by Iowa State's Francis,
Welle and Amy Frese and by Nebraska's Nicole Kubik.
</P>
<P>
   The near-capacity crowd of 9,130 broke the previous record of
8,127, set last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Boris Mironov scored a short-handed goal as
the last-place Chicago Blackhawks beat Florida 5-2 Saturday night,
sweeping the two-game season series and knocking the Panthers out
of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Anders Eriksson and Bob Probert ended long scoring droughts, and
Jocelyn Thibault had 22 saves to give Chicago its first win in the
third game of a five-game road trip. The Panthers, 1-5-1 in their
past seven home games, fell two points behind Washington into
second place in the Southeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Marha finished off a 2-on-1 break by slipping the puck
past Mike Vernon 12:23 in to give Chicago a 2-1 lead. Blair
Atcheynum set Marha up for his seventh goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mironov drilled home a long slap shot to make it 3-1. Alexei
Zhamnov received his 300th career assist on Chicago's ninth
short-handed goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Probert scored his second goal -- first in 32 games -- just 55
seconds in to give the Blackhawks a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksson snapped a 52-game streak with a slap shot just inside
the blue line that gave Chicago a 4-1 advantage at 11:37 of the
second. It was also Eriksson's second goal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Whitney split two defensemen before nudging the puck through
Thibault's pads for his 25th goal, cutting Chicago's lead to 4-2
with 58 seconds left in the second. Pavel Bure got an assist as did
rookie Brad Ference, who notched his first NHL point in his second
game.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nylander's 19th goal over a prone Vernon sealed the
victory with 4:04 remaining. Chicago outshot Florida 15-3 in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, coming off a rugged 4-3 victory in Tampa Bay
Saturday, fell to 11-6-1 in the second game of back-to-backs.
</P>
<P>
   Michal Grosek, acquired Friday from Buffalo, was unable to make
his Blackhawks' debut because his equipment got lost en route to
Miami.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- John Amaechi scored a career-high 31 points
Saturday night, leading the Orlando Magic to a 110-107 victory over
the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   George McCloud's 3-pointer with 1:09 remaining pulled the
Nuggets within three, the Magic's smallest margin since early in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After both team's traded scoreless possessions, the Nuggets had
8.4 seconds left to tie the game, but Chris Herren's 3-point
attempt missed.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, which got 35 points from Antonio McDyess and 25 from
McCloud, held the Magic without a field goal for the final 4:27.
</P>
<P>
   Amaechi scored 17 points in the third quarter, helping Orlando
maintain a double-digit advantage for most of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Denver pulled within four points with 20 seconds remaining, but
Amaechi's layup to close the third quarter scoring blunted the
rally. His scoring total shattered his previous career high of 25,
set Feb. 7 against Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Armstrong added 23 points for the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a career-high 34 minutes in place of Nick Van Exel,
Herren finished with eight assists, but missed all three of his
field-goal attempts. Van Exel played just 13 minutes before he was
ejected with two technical fouls with 3:35 left in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel disputed a foul call and was immediately given both
technicals. Orlando hit four consecutive free throws off of the
foul calls, which came during a 10-0 run that pushed a 50-47
advantage to 13 points. The Magic led 63-52 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes Orlando's Ron Mercer, acquired in a February trade with the
Nuggets, missed his third straight game with a high ankle sprain.
Of the five players involved in that deal, only Denver's Chris
Gatling played. ... Tariq Abdul-Wahad missed his fourth consecutive
game with a sprained wrist, while Orlando's Johnny Taylor and
Chauncey Billups are both on the injured list.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 4, Senators 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Yanic Perreault scored twice in a
22-second span early in the second period to lead the Toronto Maple
Leafs to a 4-2 win over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas also scored twice for the Leafs in a game billed as
the biggest of the season by both clubs. Andreas Dackell and Sami
Salo had goals for the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Joseph made 40 saves to earn his 32nd victory.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated, emotional meeting between two of the
league's hottest teams was key to the outcome of their Northeast
Division race. The teams have one more meeting on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators trail the Maple Leafs by seven points with a game
in hand. Ottawa had a season-high, seven-game unbeaten streak
(5-0-2) snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs have won five straight and have only one loss in nine
games. Toronto is trying to capture its first division championship
in 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard was taken to hospital with a
suspected damaged orbital bone. He was clipped under the right eye
by Marian Hossa, who was assessed a double high-sticking penalty in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wheeled out of the corner and beat Ottawa goalie Ron
Tugnutt (18-12-8) on Toronto's second shot at 3:29. Defenseman
Dmitry Yushkevich assisted, earning his ninth point in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault was left unattended twice early in the second period
and scored both times.
</P>
<P>
   He one-timed a Sergei Berezin pass at 2:14, then beat Tugnutt
from close range at 2:36 for his 15th and 16th goals.
</P>
<P>
   Dackell got the Senators back in the game 10:48 into the period,
drilling a rebound past Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas struck again during a two-man advantage, with 3:20
remaining in the period, on a pass from Perreault. Salo cut the
Leafs advantage to two goals with a power-play goal at 7:41 of the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa outshot Toronto 42-25.

Fake Explosive Device Found on Jet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines flight attendant was stunned today to
reach into a child's backpack for crayons and find what looked like an explosive
device, prompting an emergency U-turn and landing at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport. Chutes on the MD-80 series airliner were deployed and
passengers slid to the ground after the emergency landing, airport spokesman Bob
Parker said. The boy, 8 or 9 years old, was by chance carrying a backpack
identical to the one used in the test. The boy laid his pack on a security
checkpoint conveyor belt at the same time as the ''passenger'' in the test put
the identical bag on, and the boy picked up the wrong bag on the other side.

standoff between the government and white farmers who produce the bulk of the
nation's marketed crops, including tobacco. Squatters have occupied the
properties, claiming rights to land farmed by descendants of British settlers.
Mugabe has been accused of promising free land to shore up his ruling party's

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An art installation connecting Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Nazis at an upcoming Whitney Museum exhibit has
angered one of the museum's benefactors, who says she'll stop
giving the institution money.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, ''Sanitation,'' by Hans Haacke, upset 73-year-old
heiress Marylou Whitney so much that she has told the museum
director that in addition to halting donations, she'll quit its
national fund-raising board as well.
</P>
<P>
   According to the museum, Ms. Whitney is one of about 60 members
of the museum's national committee, each of whom contributes about
$5,000 to the institution annually. She also hosts an annual
luncheon in New York on behalf of national committee members.
</P>
<P>
   The installation piece consists of a wall lined with garbage
cans, each containing a speaker playing audio of marching troops. A
gold-framed reproduction of the First Amendment would be on the
wall, along with six quotations -- three from the mayor -- written in
the Gothic typescript favored by Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's quotations refer to ''Sensation,'' a controversial
Brooklyn Museum exhibit which featured a portrait of the Virgin
Mary with a clump of elephant dung. Giuliani unsuccessfully sought
to stop city funding of the museum because of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, whose mother-in-law, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney
founded the Whitney Museum, told the New York Post in Saturday's
editions she wished that ''they could take the Whitney name off
that museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had intended to make a big contribution to the Whitney in my
will, but not now. This is a horrible work. I can't even call it
'art,''' Whitney told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Director Maxwell Anderson said in a statement that, ''I
regret any discomfort we may cause supporters of the museum in
pursuit of the artistic mission established by Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney in 1930.''

<HEADLINE> Saturday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Kerry Ligtenberg, slowly making his way back from
ligament
replacement surgery, pitched a hitless eighth inning Saturday as
the Atlanta Braves routed the Florida Marlins 9-0 in a split-squad
game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Right now, everything doesn't really feel normal ... games and
pitching doesn't feel normal,'' said Ligtenberg, who converted 30
of 34 save chances two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week against Detroit, he pitched in a game for
the first time this year. With John Rocker suspended for the first
two weeks of the season, Atlanta is looking for bullpen help
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the biggest thing is I need to get out there a little
bit more and try to get into the flow of things,'' Ligtenberg said.
''Throwing BP or throwing on the side is one thing, but getting
into the game that's a totally different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga hit a pair of two-run homers and Tom Glavine
pitched three scoreless innings in the game at Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Braves were in Tampa, where the World Series
champions followed up on their sweep of the Braves last October
with a 23-7 rout of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter went 4-for-4 with a homer and five RBIs in the first
meeting of the teams since then. Atlanta sent a traveling squad
that included Ozzie Guillen, Randall Simon, Quilvio Veras and
Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can understand where they're coming from,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ''When we have a spilt squad, we're going
to keep our guys home. People pay to see who they want to see.
That's not too surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has won three straight and four of five after starting
spring training with six consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   At Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Pedro Martinez pitched one
scoreless inning in his native country, but Jeff Bagwell hit a pair
of two-run homers to give the Houston Astros a 4-3 win over the
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nice to see my people again,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Craig Paquette hit a three-run homer and drove
in four runs in the St. Louis Cardinals' 9-6 win over Los Angeles,
dropping the Dodgers to a major league-worst 1-10.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody likes losing any game,'' said Chad
Kreuter, who homered for the Dodgers. ''But it's easier, I guess,
to accept it in spring training where you're not running out your
'A' teams on an everyday basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Dodgers renewed third baseman Adrian
Beltre's contract for $330,000. Dodgers chairman Bob Daly said he
will continue negotiating with Beltre's agent, Scott Boras, on a
three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The players' association has filed a grievance to have
arbitrator Shyam Das declare Beltre a free agent because the
Dodgers signed the infielder before he turn 16, which is against
baseball's rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as we're advancing in the negotiations, we're going to
continue to negotiate,'' said agent Scott Boras, who added that he
wasn't confident a deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>

and play the game,'' Tatis said.

<HEADLINE> St. John's Barkley Plays in Big East  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Erick Barkley's leave of absence turned out to
be strictly temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The St. John's point guard, who said he was walking out the
night before, walked back in on Saturday night, leading the Red
Storm to the Big East Conference tournament championship with an
80-70 victory over Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was in the middle of St. John's victory, scoring 19
points. He started the game by hitting the first two baskets for
the Red Storm and ended it with four straight free throws that
sealed Connecticut's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Then he led cheers by the sellout crowd saluting the victory. He
was selected to the all-tournament team for the second straight
year.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours earlier, all that seemed unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley reportedly got into a confrontation with tournament MVP
Bootsy Thornton at halftime of the semifinal game against Miami. He
was late returning to the bench and after the game stormed out of
Madison Square Garden saying he was taking a leave of absence from
the team.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, he had a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no doubt in my head. I wanted to go back to the
shootaround and apologize and go back to where we left off,''
Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Jarvis welcomed his point guard back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a family,'' he said. ''We had a little family dispute
last night. One of our family members probably redefined what a
leave of absence is. It's going back to your bed, having a good
night's sleep and then coming back and helping your team win the
Big East championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said he met with the team at the shootaround and asked
the players what he should do about Barkley's walkout and return.
Chudney Gray, who is Barkley's backup at point guard, said the team
should forgive him and move on and that's what the Red Storm did.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who was suspended twice this season because of NCAA
rules infractions, said he was angered by reports of still another
investigation into his eligibility. After reports of questions
about his SAT scores, he said he would not play in the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enough was enough with the NCAA,'' he said as he celebrated
the championship with his teammates on the Garden floor. ''They can
look into whatever they want. I'm innocent as a bird. Let them
look. I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, the Red Storm's leading scorer at 16.4 points per game,
was suspended for three games by the NCAA in early February for
exchanging vehicles with a family friend. After an appeal, that
punishment was reduced to two games.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29, St. John's was forced to declare Barkley ineligible
and he missed that night's victory over Seton Hall. The NCAA
requested further information regarding payment of part of
Barkley's tuition at Maine Central Institute for the 1997-98
academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was reinstated on March 3, Barkley must give back
$3,500 of his tuition, which is approximately $22,000. The
restitution is for the amount St. John's said Barkley received from
Riverside Church, a New York AAU program for which he played. He
can donate the money to a charity of his choice, and has until his
eligibility expires to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the reports of the SAT investigation and the locker
room confrontation with Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was emotional after St. John's won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got a lump in my throat, but I'm not going to cry,'' he
said. ''Finally, St. John's has a championship and I've got a
championship. It feels great. I've put all this behind me and I'm
going to try and continue playing basketball for St. John's.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Cardinal Offers Apology  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA VOZZELLA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Cardinal Bernard Law apologized Saturday for
Catholic failings as old as American slavery and as modern-day as
sexual abuse by priests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I seek with you God's forgiveness for the faults of Catholics
throughout the history of this archdiocese,'' Law said in a
cathedral packed with parishioners, Jews, blacks and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us kneel before God and acknowledge with sorrow the
failures of the past and implore forgiveness for our own sins and
shortcomings.''
</P>
<P>
   The apology came as Roman Catholic leaders from across the
country, taking their cue from Pope John Paul II, express regret
for failings as old as the 2,000-year-old church.
</P>
<P>
   The church has been reflecting on its history during its Jubilee
year, and the pope and others have decided to voice apologies for
past and present sins during the season of Lent, a period of
penance.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome on Sunday, the pope plans to express regret for the
Crusades, the Inquisition and other ''faults of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   While some critics have complained that the gestures are too
little, too late, there was only praise from those attending Law's
prayer service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston's South
End neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a wonderful step forward on the part of the church
to try to create greater reconciliation between the Jewish and
Catholic communities,'' said Rabbi Samuel Chiel of Temple Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
   Imam Taalib Mahdee, a Muslim leader, called the apology ''a
blessing of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We pray that his prayers are answered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, Law and other recounted Catholics'
complicity in slavery, sexual abuse by priests, racism,
anti-Semitism and the treatment of women.

<HEADLINE> 4 Deaths Blamed on Southern Storms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Severe storms and possible tornadoes ripped through South,
damaging homes and leaving thousands without power.
</P>
<P>
   At least four deaths were blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy rain and winds blustered into Georgia and Florida
Friday night Saturday morning. Winds blew down tree limbs and
caused some roof damage in Georgia, and funnel clouds were reported
in Jackson County, Fla. No major damage was reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuscaloosa, Ala., officials said a 52-year-old woman died
Friday night when debris from a billboard struck her. In Texas,
three people died in two separate wrecks blamed on wet road
conditions earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Three possible tornadoes were reported in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   One tornado that hit Birmingham suburbs damaged 35 to 40 homes
''pretty severely,'' said Emergency Management Agency spokesman
Mark Kelly. Flooded creeks pushed 14 people out of their homes
Friday night, the Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wind opened the door and started swinging it back and
forth,'' said Jennifer Allen, who sought safety with four others in
a Tuscaloosa convenience store. ''We couldn't see anything. We
thought we were going to fly into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 people in Alabama were still waiting Saturday for
power to be restored, down from more than 30,000 at the storm's
peak, said Alabama Power spokesman Sandy George.
</P>
<P>
   In Fayetteville, Ark., winter weather forced the University of
Arkansas football team to cancel its first spring practice
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 104, Suns 99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Erick Strickland scored 12 of his career-high 36
points in the fourth quarter as the Dallas Mavericks snapped a
six-game losing streak with a 104-99 victory over the Phoenix Suns
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns learned earlier in the day that forward Tom Gugliotta
is out for the season with torn ligaments in his left knee.
Gugliotta was injured in the fourth quarter of Friday night's loss
to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley added 22 points for the Mavericks, including a
3-pointer with 59 seconds left, putting Dallas in front for good.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Robinson's 29 points paced the Suns, who won five of
their previous six and five of seven on the road. Shawn Marion
added 18 points for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 99 after Penny Hardaway made one of two
free throws, Finley connected from the top of the key for a 102-99
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd of the Suns, who had 19 points, 10 rebounds and nine
assists, was called for an offensive foul and fouled out with 54
seconds remaining. Strickland missed both free throws, but
Phoenix's Marion shot an airball with 22 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas continued its late-game jitters from the free-throw line
when Finley missed two foul shots with 17 seconds left. But
Mavericks rookie Greg Buckner blocked Hardaway's jumper and Finley
hit two free throws with 6.6 seconds left for the final scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bradley had 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Dirk Nowitzki
added 15 points for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix held an 81-77 lead early in the fourth quarter, but
Strickland scored eight of Dallas' next 12 points as the Mavericks
assumed an 89-83 advantage with 5:48 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson converted a three-point play on the Suns' next
possession, then Robinson hit a 3-pointer with 4:42 left to tie it
at 89.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns took a 77-73 advantage into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix held a 51-50 halftime lead despite Strickland's 23
first-half points.
</P>
<P>
Notes: At halftime, the Mavericks retired the No. 22 of the team's
leading career scorer, Rolando Blackman, who set 50 team records
during his 11 years with Dallas. He joined Brad Davis as the only
Mavericks players to have their jerseys retired. ... The crowd of
18,187 was Dallas' fifth home sellout of the season. The previous
three came during the 12-game stay of Dennis Rodman, waived by the
team last week. ... Phoenix lost three of its four games to Dallas
in the season series that concluded on Saturday night. ...
Strickland's previous career high was 31 points.

mom and dad and every fan out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when she accepted the female vocalist award, Elida was in
tears. ''It is such an honor to be here receiving this, and I have
been dreaming about this all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise was the first award won, finally, by singer Jay
Perez, who had been nominated for male vocalist for the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time and if my grandma was here, she'd say
''long overdue!'' and I have no speech, I really didn't expect
this,'' he said. ''But this goes out to all the fans ... without
you we are nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the crowd at the Alamodome gave a rousing
response to the two young actresses who are to play Selena as a
little girl in the upcoming ''Selena Forever'' musical.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Suspect May Be in Baltimore Area  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The man accused of killing four people and
kidnapping his girlfriend four days ago returned to his
neighborhood Saturday after traveling to Virginia and coercing a
man into driving him home, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Joseph Palczynski stole weapons in Virginia and may
be armed with a .22 revolver.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, police dogs re-searched the area east of Baltimore
where Palczynski lived, after finding the man who drove him from
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been on the run since Tuesday night, when police
say he shot and killed three people while kidnapping his
girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, from an apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth shooting death occurred Wednesday as he tried to steal
a car, police said. Whitehead escaped Wednesday night and
Palczynski disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Palczynski broke into a Virginia home and stole a
12-gauge shotgun, a .22-caliber revolver and a van, said Baltimore
County Police Maj. Brian Uppercue.
</P>
<P>
   After the van broke down, Palczynski went to the home of William
Terrell in Woodford, Va., to ask for help. When Terrell refused to
take him to Baltimore for $100, Palczynski drew the revolver,
Uppercue said.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's wife notified police after the men left for Baltimore.
When police found Terrell, he told them Palczynski left on foot,
Uppercue said.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski will likely face charges for kidnapping Terrell and
breaking into the Virginia home, Uppercue said. He said Terrell
will not face any charges and would be allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Palczynski's mother made a wrenching plea on
Baltimore television stations, begging her son to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please, Joseph, I know you're tired, I know you're weary and I
know you're sorry for what you've done,'' Patsy Long said. ''I
don't want you hurting no more people, because when you hurt people
you hurt me, and you cannot hurt me like this, Joseph, no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Long told her son, ''I will get you help. We have doctors here.
I have a good doctor for you. I promise you, nothing's gonna
happen. You get rid of that gun you have. I don't want you to have
no more pistols, I don't want you hurting nobody, Joseph.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Shot to Death in Rural Mo. Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Mo. (AP) -- A man suspected of fatally shooting four people
following an apparent domestic dispute at a rural eastern Missouri
home took his own life Saturday night in a grocery store parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Leonard, 36, shot himself once in the chest with a
high-powered rifle after he apparently spotted a highway patrol
helicopter hovering overhead, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers were in the process of surrounding Leonard's vehicle
when the shot was fired, said Wentzville Police Chief Robert
Noonan.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the four victims were not released. Five young
children inside the house, including three of the suspect's, were
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened at about 10:45 p.m. Friday in a heavily
wooded area just outside of Cuivre River State Park, about 60 miles
north of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln County Sheriff Jim Johnson said a man walked in with a
hunting rifle and began arguing with his wife. The couple was not
divorced, but she apparently was with another man, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman shot his wife, the man and another couple at the
house, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The five children, all 9 or younger, spent the night with
counselors from the Missouri Division of Social Services. They were
with relatives Saturday.
