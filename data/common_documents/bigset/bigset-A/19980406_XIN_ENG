<HEADLINE> 76 Child Labor Projects Launched in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- With a view to eliminating child
labor, 76 child labor projects have been launched in India for
rehabilitation of nearly 150,000 children, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted Labor Ministry sources as saying that a massive
countrywide survey and an awareness generation program have also
been launched to tackle the age-old social evil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The projects include establishment of special schools to
provide the children withdrawn from employment with basic needs
like non-formal education, vocational training and supplementary
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
These projects were launched as part of the multi-pronged
national policy on child labor announced by the Indian government
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Stating that India was the first country to enter into a
contract arrangement with the international program for
elimination of child labor in May 1992, the sources from the Labor
Ministry said the program has been renewed up to December 1999.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Indian children have benefited so far through the
program which includes releasing working children from work and
rehabilitating them through education and skill training.

<HEADLINE> Number of Poor in Pakistan Reaches 42 Million: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of the poor in
Pakistan reached 42 million in 1995 against 23 million in 1965,
said the latest report on human development in South Asia prepared
by the Islamabad-based Human Development Center.
</P>
<P>
However, the percentage of the poor has decreased from 40
percent in 1965 to 30 percent in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of the poor in the 1990s was seen as
revival of the trend of the 1970s which saw rapid population
growth and low economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The new report, being launched on Monday, has given a new
definition of "poverty", namely "poverty of opportunities", which
is more agonizing and devastating than income deficiency in the
short and long run.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that though less than one-third of
Pakistanis are income-poor, nearly one-half suffer from "poverty
of opportunities".
</P>
<P>
The report emphasizes that poverty cripples the capabilities
and opportunities of a significant proportion of population in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Pakistan's population now stands at 140
million.
</P>
<P>
The report made some important conclusions which include:
</P>
<P>
-- The rural-urban gaps seem to be closing, but gender gaps in
the poverty of opportunities are expanding.
</P>
<P>
-- The poor are increasingly frustrated, as the gap between
human capabilities and human opportunities is widening.
</P>
<P>
-- The pace of economic growth has determined the pace of human
opportunities. These slowed down in the 1970s and now in the
1990s, as poverty reduction was slow.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that even in the face of economic downturn
of the 1990s, Pakistan can engineer a breakthrough in human
development and poverty alleviation by re-aligning its priorities,
by mustering popular support for tough but essential reforms, and
by adapting the strategies used successfully in other countries.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials to Inquire Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security officials
said Sunday that they intend to inquire a Hamas leader about his
claim that the Palestinian Preventive Security Service (PSS) was
behind the death of Hamas bomb maker Muhi Sharif, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Aziz Rantisi, leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement) in Gaza, told Arabic service of the
radio earlier that the PSS had arrested Sharif and tortured him to
death.
</P>
<P>
In order to hide the evidence, Rantisi said, the PSS planted
his body in a booby-trapped car before detonating it in the West
Bank city of Ramallah last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Rantisi's remarks have embarrassed both
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and other Hamas leaders, who
insisted that Israel assassinated Sharif. Rantisi himself was
trying to backtrack from his charges.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of Sharif's killing is still a
mystery. Israel has also categorically denied any involvement in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamas reiterated its warning of revenge attacks for
Sharif's death at rallies in Gaza on Saturday and Friday, which
were attended by thousands of Palestinians. Hamas leaders
threatened attacks not only in Israel, but also against Jewish
targets outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the PNA had asked Hamas to refrain
from carrying out attacks against Israel, but this has been
rejected by Hamas.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Seeks New Solution to Ethnic Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
held a two-day round-table meeting with leaders of 11 major
parties and a citizens' association to seek a new solution to the
ethnic problem in the country, the newspaper Rilindja reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which ended in Skopje Saturday night, failed to
produce a joint statement as expected because the participants
could not reach consensus on how to solve the ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
The political leaders representing the ethnic Albanians of
Macedonia disagreed with passages in the current Constitution on
relations between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
A presidential release said the meeting was important to the
overall stability and prosperity of the country and the democratic
development of ethnic relations.
</P>
<P>
The release described the meeting as being conducted in a
constructive atmosphere in which opinions of various parties as
well as their disagreements were respected. This, all parties
believed, was also one of the positive results of the meeting, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that the disagreements in political
views should not hinder the pursuit of a new solution to the
ethnic problem, a solution which is in line with international
standard and acceptable to all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the release said, all participants had showed a
political willingness to seek for harmonious ethnic relations and
an end to hostility.
</P>
<P>
The release further said the participants deemed it necessary
to continue and deepen such dialogues in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are about 450,000
Albanians in Macedonia, accounting for one fourth of the country's
total population.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, some ethnic Albanians in Macedonia ran into clash
with police when they raised Albania's national flag on a formal
occasion.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Patients Drawn to Chinese Acupuncture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Patients from various
national states said they have been cured from some diseases
through the use of acupuncture, an oriental traditional medical
practice, the Ethiopian News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report spoke highly of the Chinese medical team who are
working in Ethiopia, saying they have cured patients who had been
suffering from arthritis, muscle contractions and nerve disorder.
</P>
<P>
Belaynesh Kilil, a resident in Addis Ababa, was quoted as
saying that she had been paralysed below her knee for two years
but was later cured by the Chinese through their acupuncture
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Walking again without help, for me, is to be born again," she
marveled.
</P>
<P>
Another patient named Tadelech Assefa, who had been bed-ridden
for the last six years because of nerve problems, told the news
agency that she has been able to walk again thanks to Chinese
acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
Over 23,000 patients have received treatment since the Chinese
physicians began operation at Adama Hospital in Nazreth, some 90
km southeast of the Ethiopian capital in 1992, and 60 percent of
them had been cured, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, patients are now drawn to the
hospital from as far as northern Ethiopian cities as well as
neighboring countries like Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Carry out Peace Agreement Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudan will start on Monday to
carry out a peace agreement reached between the government and
several former rebel groups, a Sudanese official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a coordinating council for the southern provinces
set up under the agreement will be headquartered in the day in
Juba, capital of Eastern Equatoria Province and the government
stronghold in the war-torn south, council chairman Ryak Mashar
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Rebels have been fighting since 1983 against the Islamic
government to press for increased autonomy for the southern third
of Sudan, which is mainly African, Christian and animist.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Sudanese government signed with seven minor
rebel factions the Khartoum Agreement, which offers a referendum
for the south after a four-year transitional period, a federal
system of government and an amnesty to rebels.
</P>
<P>
It also establishes the Coordinating Council during the
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
But the major rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
has rejected the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mashar said the council will endeavor to expand the circle of
peace and work on development projects, including building new
roads and river canals, in the south.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the coming days, he will visit Egypt, Uganda
and Nigeria to brief the countries' leaders on the Sudanese peace
developments.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges U.S. to Make Public Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Sunday called on the United
States to make public its proposal aimed at breaking the deadlock
in the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should "clearly" announce its position, since "Israel
is widely believed" to try to "cover up its negative position and
the subsequent dangers," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said
after his meeting with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
"This ambiguity will obstruct progress, lead to the circle of
procrastination and maintain the status quo, as is sought by the
Israeli policy," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly outlined an initiative calling on
Israel to withdraw its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank
over 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between PNA President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to win their acceptance of the
proposal. But he went home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said the withdrawal scope is unacceptable and urged
the U.S. not to go public with the plan. Meanwhile, the PNA has
reportedly accepted in principle the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Moussa and Erekat examined Israel's
attempts to obstruct the announcement of the U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Cairo has not been informed about the official
U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
But "we have read reports and statements that the U.S.
initiative would not be launched... We are in touch with American
officials and we are examining this issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also PNA minister of local government, said the U.S.
reluctance to go public with its plan will send a negative signal
to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Now that Arafat "has positively dealt with U.S. efforts to
revive peace during Ross' visit to the region, any attempts to
play a waiting game will only encourage Netanyahu to ignore the
signed agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the U.S. chooses not to announce its plan,
Netanyahu would continue his hardline policy on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. should not fall into the trap," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Wants ECOMOG to Be African Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean High Commissioner to
Nigeria Joe Blell said Sunday that the west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) should be transformed into an all-Africa one.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG should be a model and a take-off point for an African
peacekeeping initiative in view of its efficiency and success in
resolving crises in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Thus it should be transformed into an African high command to
tackle problems within the continent, said Blell, quoted by the
News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S.-sponsored African crisis response intiative,
Blell said, "An African rapid development force in the continent
without Nigerian participation would be a failure, given
Nigeria's antecedents in peace keeping."
</P>
<P>
He called on all countries to give ECOMOG maximum support in
their mop-up operation in Sierra Leone, while appealed the United
Nations to ensure smooth integration and rehabilitation of the
war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the countries that pledged support and
assistance for the reconstruction and rehibilitation of Sierra
Leone not to renege on their promises.
</P>
<P>
Blell declined to make any comment on the sacked junta's
number two and leader of the rebel group Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), Foday Sankoh, who is reported to be detained in
Nigeria, saying that "only the two heads of state can speak on
the matter".
</P>
<P>
The envoy said though all those who took part and supported
the illegal military regime would be tried, "I don't know about
Sankoh, even though he tacitly supported the junta".
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the junta seized power in the coup to ousted the
legitimate government last May, more than 6,000 RUF rebels allied
with the junta forces.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of the junta forces and RUF rebels are now still
engaged in fighting with ECOMOG and allied pro-government civil
defence groups in the eastern part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Child Sex Problem Serious in N. Tanzanian Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Child sex has become a
serious social problem in northern Tanzanian region of Arusha, a
research conducted by the Tanzania Women's Association (TAMWA)
has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has been been a major reason for the problem, which is
threatening the future of girls and boys in the trade, said
participants at a one-day workshop in Arusha at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The participants, discussing a research which was concluded
last October by two TAMWA members, disclosed that Mto Wa Mbu,
several kilometers off the Arusha town, is a "training center" of
child sex workers who later engaged in professional prostitution
in areas around Namanga, Simanjiro, Arusha and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The 46-page research report was completed by Khadija Riyami
and Angela Mpendu, who were also journalists, from Daily News and
Radio Tanzania respectively.
</P>
<P>
The research report said that the children are being exposed to several
sexually transmitted diseases, because the child sex workers are
not extremely conscious of the threat of AIDS and use of condoms
were decided by customers.
</P>
<P>
The woman organization has suggested the children be educated
on the advantage of condoms, especially at a time when AIDS is
spreading at a threatening speed.
</P>
<P>
"If serious efforts are not taken to educate community on use
and advantage of condoms, AIDS is likely to spread fast in the
region," the organization warned.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, participants urged the police to act to stop
child-sex in the region, according to a report reaching here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The research has also pointed out that child-sex workers are
willing to abandon their trade, provided they are offered an
alternative job to do.

PARIS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji Sunday
met with former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and
former French Prime Minister Raymond Barre separately at the
Marigny state guest house in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Zhu briefed them the economic situation in China, the major
measures to be taken in the coming several years by the Chinese
government to reform the country's economy, as well as his views
on and the measures to be taken by the Chinese government to react
to the Asia financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Both d'Estaing and Barre said that France is closely watching
the development of China, and pays great importance to the role
being played by China in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
They said that the three major characteristics of the Chinese
economy are the most impressive: stable growth, continuous opening
and lasting stability.
</P>
<P>
They also praised China for not devalueing the Chinese yuan,
which they said had exerted a good impact on Asia and world
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The two French political leaders also said that France and
China should strengthen cooperation not only in economic field,
but also further coordinate their stands on international issues.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his appreciation for the enthusiasm of d'Estaing
and Barre over the development in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also visited the new National Library of France and the
elegant Rodin Museum in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and his wife Lau An took a photo before a statue of French
writer Honore Balzac in the garden of Rodin Museum, and praised
his conductor for making an excellent explanation of the art works
of August Rodin.

<HEADLINE> Only Africans Can Transform Their Continent: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The transformation of Africa should
be by Africans themselves and not by developed nations, the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"After more than 30 years of independence by most countries on
the continent, there is no justification to blame the state of
underdevelopment on the developed nations," said Bill Musoke,
UNFPA representative in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the west partly contributed to the
state of backwardness, Musoke said Africans must be held
accountable for their actions which sometimes bordered on
treachery and abuse of trust by the rulers.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, population and environmental problems, if neglected,
would continue to undermine economic growth, democracy and peace
on the continent, he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to the news agency report, many African countries
attribute the problems to industrialized nations, saying that
while the developing nations are asked to slow down their
population growth, developed nations have failed to make
sacrifices as evidenced in their consumption patterns.
</P>
<P>
While 97 percent of future population is expected to occur in
the third world, the industrialized countries of the west, with
only 20 percent of the global population, consume two-thirds of
all global resources, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the process, they produce four-fifths of all global
pollutants and waste, with no attempt to slow down, thereby
destroying the environment.
</P>
<P>
But Musoke said the views held by developing nations would not
reverse the situation if Africans themselves did not change.
</P>
<P>
"Let us help ourselves by acquiring technology, by investing
in education and learning to save," he advised, adding that
although there were millionaires on the continent, some of them
lacked wisdom.
</P>
<P>
Although population was a concern of all, the issue could be
solved only when individuals resolved that it was in their
interest to have manageable family sizes, Musoke said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Holds Talks with Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan held talks
with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud
Abbas Sunday on the latest developments of the Mideast peace
process, Jordan's official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, Secretary-General of
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee,
briefed King Hussein on the results of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's recent talks with U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis
Ross.
</P>
<P>
Abbas informed the king of the U.S. ideas to push forward the
peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track and remove
obstacles facing it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly outlined an initiative calling on
Israel to withdraw its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank
over 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ross shuttled between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to win their acceptance of
the proposal. But he went home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said the withdrawal scope is unacceptable and urged
the U.S. not to make public the peace plan. Meanwhile, the PNA has
reportedly accepted in principle the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
On his part, King Hussein expressed satisfaction over the
U.S. proposal as well as the Palestinian positive response to the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abbas conveyed Arafat's thanks and appreciation to
the king for his supportive stands to the Palestinians, especially
those he adopted during his recent meetings with U.S. officials in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein Saturday night came back home from the U.S. where
he paid a several-week visit starting from March 12.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, he held talks with U.S. officials and called
for activating the U.S. role with the view to achieving peace in
the Mideast region and enabling the Palestinians to regain their
rights and establish their independent state on their national
land.
</P>
<P>
Abbas arrived here Sunday afternoon and had met Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul-Salam Majali before his meeting with Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged to Control Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will face the problem of
mass emigration if its population should double in the next 20
years as being projected, the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way stopping Nigerians to move to where they
think life is better," said Bill Musoke, representative of UNFPA
in Nigeria, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said the current annual population growth rate of 2.9
percent was too fast to cope with existing resources in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Health Ministry said earlier that the country's
annual population growth rate already decreased from 3.2 percent
in the 1980s to 2.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the UNFPA official argued that although the size of
Nigeria can accommodate at least three times its present
population, the issue was not with number but with quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
He cited lack of quality education for children, shortage of
decent apartments as well as food insecurity and unemployment in
the country to support his argument.
</P>
<P>
He urged the planners to address the issue so that the next
doubling time after 2015 would be longer, giving more time to
plan, train, build on the existing infrastructures and
effectively manage resources.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's population is estimated at more than 100 million,
the largest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A census in 1991 showed a population of 88.5 million, the 10th
largest in the world at that time. This accounted for 19.2
percent of the total sub-Saharan population, with a density of
95.8 persons per sq km.

<HEADLINE> Any Coup Plans Will Be Squashed: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Any sinister plans to topple
South Africa's government by disgruntled whites will be squashed,
South African Press Association (SAPA) Sunday quoted President
Nelson Mandela as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am completely in control of the situation in the country. I
have complete control over the security forces," Mandela said in
an interview with a Sunday Afrikaans newspaper, Rapport.
</P>
<P>
The interview came after a judicial commission of inquiry
dismissed last week a military intelligence report as
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence report claimed that there was a coup plot
against the government by senior African National Congress (ANC)
officials.
</P>
<P>
The report implicated Chief of Staff of South African National
Defense Force (SANDF), Siphiwe Nyanda, and Mandela's ex-wife,
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, among other ANC officials.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "It was nothing new to me, because when I
received the report, I immediately noticed that there was not one
white implicated in the alleged plot."
</P>
<P>
"And these (implicated) are top generals which are in line to
take over the command structure when the time arrives for the old
guard to retire. This looked very suspicious to me and so I asked
the judges to investigate."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had called in SANDF Chief Commander Georg
Meiring, Defense Secretary-General Pierre Steyn, Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi,
Defense Minister Joe Modise and Deputy Intelligence Minister Joe
Nhlanhla, and discussed the report with them.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought there were other groups planning to
topple the government, Mandela said, "Some people are unhappy
with the present dispensation. We are aware that there is a lot
going on."
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the whites lost their political power,
they still held enormous influence.
</P>
<P>
He said he has told the government and the ruling ANC to treat
the white minority with respect, as an integral part of the
community which must be involved in decision making.
</P>
<P>
It is widely speculated by local media that the future of top
leaders of the SANDF, including Meiring, was cast in doubt after
the commission released its findings this week.
</P>
<P>
But Joel Netshitenzhe, head of the government communication
service, said Sunday that he could not confirm or deny reports
that a purge of the SANDF's senior ranks was imminent.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Mandela on the matter was likely to be made
within the next few days, Netshitenzhe said.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA to Support Nigeria's Next Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) Sunday pledged support for Nigeria's next census expected
to be conducted in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Bill Musoke, UNFPA representative in Nigeria said the fund
would undertake the training of personnel and supply equipment,
while the involvement of the fund was expected to boost the
credibility of census results.
</P>
<P>
However, Musoke said political will and commitment was needed
in a conducive environment before a meaningful census exercise
could be conducted, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Musoke, other needs include a substantial amount of
money, an up-to-date map of Nigeria, and willing and committed
officials.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the last census conducted in Nigeria in 1991 as
one of the "most well planned, well organized and most
scientifically executed in the whole region."
</P>
<P>
The 1991 census showed a population of 88.5 million, listing
the country as the 10th largest in the world at that time, which
accounted for 19.2 percent of the total sub-Saharan population,
with a density of 95.8 persons per square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA participated in the last census and made a substantial
input towards its success.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rebuts U.S. Alarm at Terrorism in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Sunday slammed the
U.S. statement warning its nationals against possible terrorist
attacks in Egypt as "hasty and unjustified," Egypt's Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"Security conditions all over Egypt and particularly in Cairo
are stable," Presidential Political Advisor Osama el-Baz was
quoted by the MENA as saying Sunday. He noted that the U.S. should
correct its statement quickly.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian rebuttal came after the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and
the U.S. State Department issued a statement on Friday, saying
that the American interests in Cairo might be the targets of
terrorist attacks in the near future and warning its citizens
traveling to or residing in Egypt to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
"Jumping to conclusions that the U.S. interests of nationals in
Egypt might be jeopardized is entirely unjustified," the Egyptian
official said.
</P>
<P>
"A major country like the U.S. should not adopt positions based
on unfounded allegations," Baz said, expressing the hope that the
U.S. would change its stance quickly.
</P>
<P>
In February, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo revoked a similar travel
warning, issued on the heels of the terrorist attack last November,
in which six Muslim militants killed 58 foreign tourists and four
Egyptians in the southern Egyptian tourism city of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Egypt has been trying to repair its marred image of
a safe tourist heaven and working hard to resurrect its
multi-billion-dollar tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Building Permits Rise to 8-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The value of building permits in
February for non-residential construction reached its highest
level in eight years, Statistics Canada reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This jump, combined with a much smaller rise in residential
building intentions, helped to push the overall total for building
permits to over 2.9 billion dollars (2 billion U.S. dollars), also
nearly an eight-year high.
</P>
<P>
In February, non-residential permits soared 30.5 percent from
January to 1.4 billion dollars, their highest level since June
1990.
</P>
<P>
"This increase more than offset the declines in the sector
during the previous two months," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the value of housing permits rose just 2.1
percent to 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Canadian municipalities issued a total of more than
2.9 billion dollars in building permits in February, the highest
level since March 1990.
</P>
<P>
The two-month total for January and February this year was 12.7
percent higher than for the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac met
visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji Monday at the Elysee
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he was pleased that Premier Zhu visited France soon
after he took office, and he was glad to receive him.
</P>
<P>
He said that France considers it of great importance to develop
comprehensive relations with China, not only because of political
and economic reasons, but also because of cultural and historical
values.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Sino-French Joint Declaration on establishing a
comprehensive partnership signed last May by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and President Chirac is a driving force behind the
durable development of bilateral relations, and it has exerted
some impact on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the joint declaration, China will continue to
develop its relations with France on a strategic height to
contribute to world peace, stability and prosperity," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Zhu reviewed the trade relations between China and
France. They observed that bilateral trade volume hit a record
high last year.

<P>
Zhu said the Sino-French trade relations have been fruitful and
have a broad potential for greater development.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reaffirmed France's support for China's efforts to join
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
As for the second Europe-Asia meeting (ASEM2) last week in
London, Chirac and Zhu agreed that the meeting was a success.
</P>
<P>
They said that as long as Asian countries pool their efforts,
they will eventually overcome the financial crisis occurring in
some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his appreciation for the sympathy and support
shown by France at the ASEM2 to the Asian countries suffering from
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France respects the efforts by China to
maintain financial stability in Asia and to prevent the situation
from worsening.

Zhu also met with French National Assembly speaker Laurent
Fabius Monday at the official residence of the speaker.

<HEADLINE> EU to Sue Member States for Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission decided
Monday to take legal action against some European Union (EU)
member states for failing to prevent water pollution.
</P>
<P>
The commission, an executive body of the EU, is sending
warnings to Britain, Portugal, Finland and France, while preparing
to take Spain to the European Court of Justice for disregarding
the commission's regulation concerning pollution by nitrates.
</P>
<P>
The commission requires EU member states to carry out
monitoring of surface water and groundwater to identify and
designate vulnerable zones for pollution caused by agricultural
sources.
</P>
<P>
Member states are required to report to the commission on the
implementation of this measure, which is aimed at reducing water
pollution by nitrates.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that Britain, Portugal, Finland and
France failed to draw up the necessary action programs for the
polluted waters in their territory, whereas Spain had failed to
submit to the commission the implementation report.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials consider "unacceptable" the fact that 13
of the 15 EU member states are currently the subject of
infringement proceedings.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Easter Egg Made in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The world's biggest Easter
egg was built this weekend in an eastern South African town to
help raise fund to develop the area, African Eye News Service
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Piet Retief, in Mpumalanga Province, broke the
Guiness book of world records by building the 7.5-meter-high egg,
weighing just over 4,000 kilogram, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The move was designed to encourage donations to the business
development in the town and it would hopefully raise about 20,000
Rand (3,976 U.S. Dollars) to kick-start a job creation project,
Piet Retief rotary club president Barry Symington said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Then we'll continue with other fund raising projects for as
long as it takes to help alleviate unemployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
It took four days and about 70 people to build a 1,000
kilogram supporting steel structure for the egg, which was
covered with 22,000 kilogram of polystyrene.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six boxes of spaghetti were used to pin 810 kilogram
of marshmallow eggs to the polystyrene and 20 kilogram of icing
sugar was used to decorate the entire ensemble.
</P>
<P>
The egg broke the world record by 0.4 meters and was approved
by the town's health inspector for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
The egg, now bereft of its marshmallow chocolates after
children tucked in with glee, will be on display at Van Reibeeck
Park until Saturday.

<HEADLINE> No Major Reform in University Entrance Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China will make no major reform of
the entrance examination of its institutions of higher learning,
an official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yuanqing, vice minister of Education, said there will be
some small changes of the exam subjects on a trial basis, but
China will be very cautious when reforming the entrance exam
system.
</P>
<P>
China abolished the university entrance exam during the
Cultural Revolution (1966-76). However, the entrance exam was
resumed in 1977 in response to an instruction by Deng Xiaoping to
modernize the educational sector.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Chinese families have the goal of sending their
children to university, and the competition is intense every year.
</P>
<P>
The national unified entrance examination is given every summer
to include five subjects. Zhou said the ministry may reduce the
subjects tested to three -- mathematics, Chinese and foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
Universities will be granted the right to choose an additional
one or two subjects for supplementary examination from among
politics, history, physics, chemistry, biology and geography, Zhou
said. However, the basic exam principle will remain unchanged, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The reform is intended to alter the score-oriented educational
mechanism in high schools by easing students' burdens and allowing
universities have more freedom in selecting freshmen applicants.
</P>
<P>
China has more than three million students in its 1,000
universities and colleges, and 70 million middle school students.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese armed forces will follow the policy of

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy: Sanctions Affect Iraq Harshly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-imposed sanctions have
harshly affected Iraq economically, culturally and socially,
Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy,
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shah, former India's permanent representative to the U.N. from
1995 to 1997, made the remarks at his first press conference
since his arrival here on March 22 to facilitate communication
between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said there are about 1 million Iraqi children
suffering from malnutrition, and the hospitals are totally devoid
of equipment and medicine necessary for chronic diseases. As a
result, chronic diseases started to increase without any effective
controlling system.
</P>
<P>
"That has to be averted urgently," Shah said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq's education also suffered from the lack of
equipment and unavailability of teachers, and an entire generation
of Iraq children born after the 1991 Gulf war had not gone to
school.
</P>
<P>
He said that though he had not the chance to visit some places
in Iraq, he met many humanitarian staff in Iraq. Through his talks
with them, he had an idea about the effect the sanctions had on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Regarding U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler's remarks
that the work of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarming Iraq can be finished in one year, Shah said "that is
something all of us must pay a lot of attention to."
</P>
<P>
He said since his arrival he had met Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, Foreign Minister Saeed al-Sahhaf, Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan and Health Minister Omed Medhat
Mubarak to discuss how to improve Iraq-U.N. relations.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy said there will be subsequent visits to Iraqi
presidential sites according to the agreement over arms
inspections signed by Annan and Aziz late February which averted a
possible U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But "where they will be, when they will be and how many they
will be" will be decided on the basis of the report of initial
visits, Shah said.
</P>
<P>
From March 26 to April 2, a U.N. special group of senior
diplomats and experts from UNSCOM carried out the first round of
inspections to the eight Iraqi presidential sites and found no
prohibited materials.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment whether it is useful for the United States to
maintain massive force in the Gulf region, Shah said that he is a
representative of the U.N. and his job is to follow up the
progress of disarmament issue in Iraq, and that the U.S. military
presence in the Gulf is a matter of the U.S. government and it is
not his concern.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the U.S. military armada in the Gulf
region has not affected his job which is monitoring the
disarmament issue and oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the oil-for-food program, he said he had
discussions with the Iraqi side and the U.N. Sanctions Committee,
and that Iraq had presented some thoughts and ideas about this
subject.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes these exchanges will lead to more
appreciation of the Iraqi needs and more flexibility in approving
contracts signed between Iraq and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing the United States of blocking, through
its representative in the sanctions committee, the approval of its
contracts concluded with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions imposed since Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 can not be lifted unless U.N. weapons experts
verify that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Singaporean, Malaysian Aid Hoped to End L/C Problem in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
hoping that Singapore's 3 billion U.S. dollar aid and Malaysia's
500 million U.S. dollar aid to Indonesia, aimed at guaranteeing
Indonesia's letters of credit (L/Cs), would help put an end to the
country's import problems.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that (Indonesia's) clogged up credit line could soon
be solved," Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said here Monday following a
90-minute meeting of the Economic and Financial Resilience Council
at the Bina Graha presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Since monetary crisis hit Indonesia eight months ago, foreign
banks have been rejecting Indonesian L/Cs, thus stalling the
country's imports.
</P>
<P>
"We hope (Singapore and Malaysia's) financial aid could be
cleared before the (second tranche of 3 billion U.S. dollars from
the ) International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) aid is disbursed," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the IMF have been discussing a number of points
in an economic reform package tied to the Fund's 43 billion U.S.
dollar aid aimed at bailing the country out of its crisis.
</P>
<P>
The IMF gave its first tranche of 3 billion dollars to
Indonesia in December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the second tranche of 3 billion dollars was delayed
pending a review of the progress made by the Indonesian government
in implementing the IMF-prescribed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing Indonesia-IMF talks which started March 18,
Ginandjar said, "principally, all problems have been discussed. We
hope the results of the discussion would be announced to the
people so they could follow the economic reforms (that have been
agreed upon)."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges Removal of All Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Monday called for the
removal of all the cross-border trade barriers in southern
African to boost trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lands Minister Samuel Miyanda said here that a lot of business
women in the region fail to compete on the global market because
of a number of the trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar on equity and economic empowerment of women,
he stressed the need for women to have access to productive
resources in the region if they are to succeed in business.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that women who produce more than 65 percent
of goods in the region, should also be given access to credit
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's commitment to the participation
of women in national development.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, acting Secretary General of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Erastus Mwencha
said COMESA is committed to leveling the playing field so that
women can participate freely in trade.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the gender gap in Africa is one of the barriers
to free trade as women do not have easy access to credit.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Economic Commission for Africa of the United
Nations Robert Okello said women are an important source of
national development.
</P>
<P>
However, Okello said that women are still discriminated
against when it comes to trade all over the world.

<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European

the sustainability of continuing economic and structural reforms
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Firm Chosen as Advisor for Privatizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Financing Group-Hermes has
been chosen as the financial advisor for Jordan's Privatization
program of its cement factories.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Jordan Times on Monday, the
program involves selling 33 percent of the government's equity in
the Jordan Cement Factories Company (JCFC) to a strategic investor.
</P>
<P>
An identified government source was quoted as saying "The
Egyptian firm was chosen for the experience it possessed in the
privatization of cement companies in Egypt and also for its market
strategy and experience in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Hermes would help the Jordanian government sell its 33 percent
out of a total of 49 percent stake in JCFC to a foreign partner in
line with the privatization process stipulated in the government's
economic restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
It was selected from among 10 firms, including the famous
Merril Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers, which submitted
requests to work as the government's adviser in the privatization
process of JCFC.
</P>
<P>
Hermes gave "the best offer from all the bids that entered the
contest," said the official. The Egyptian firm led the selling of
1 million shares of Amira Cement Company in Egypt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
JCFC recorded 11.9 million Jordanian dinars (about 16.8
million U.S. dollars) in net profits in 1997 but the results were
considered as far from the government's expectations.
</P>
<P>
It has been on a list of major firms whose shares the
government has decided to sell to foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Railway Construction, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Greater efforts will be made to
build railways in the next few years to meet the needs of rapid
economic growth and the continuous improvement of people's living
standards, according to Railways Minister Fu Zhihuan.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, 250 billion yuan will be poured into
railways, Fu said, to build key lines which will have a vital
bearing on China's economy and regional development.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the length of operational railways is expected to
increase to 68,000 kilometers (km) from 65,000 km
currently. That figure should surpass 70,000 km by 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
The combined railway transport capacity in southwest China will
be doubled in the five-year period, he said, with a railway
network basically formed.
</P>
<P>
Fu said the money-losing railway sector will begin to generate
profits after three years of arduous effort. Railway enterprises
then will be granted the authority to manage themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Railway departments are being required to improve service and
increase train speed as part of the effort to actively participate
in market competition. More travelers have turned to highways or
air travel for faster or more comfortable service in recent years,
Fu said.
</P>
<P>
Railways transported 917 million passengers last year, a
year-on-year decrease of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that 600,000 railway employees will be laid
off to increase the industry's productivity.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, China built a number railway arteries
such as the Beijing-Kowloon and Nanning-Kunming lines, as well as
many short-distance routes.
</P>
<P>
Work on railway electrification has also been
accelerated. Statistics show that, by the end of last year, the
country had nearly 12,000-km electrified railway lines.

</P>
<P>
About 87 percent of the funds from military property sales will

special air transportation funds will be used to purchase housing
for servicemen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senior SDP Official Against Revising Peacekeeping Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official in Japan's
Social Democratic Party (SDP) expressed opposition Monday to a
bill that would allow Japanese peacekeepers to use weapons for
self-defense only when ordered to do so by a commander.
</P>
<P>
Tadatoshi Akiba, the SDP's policy board chief, told members at
the party's headquarters that revising the law of cooperation in
U.N. peacekeeping operations would involve problems with Japan's
Constitution, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposed revision would relieve individual Japanese
peacekeepers of the burden of deciding whether to use a weapon to
defend themselves in overseas missions. Instead, commanders in the
field would be given the responsibility for deciding when
peacekeepers should use weapons.
</P>
<P>
The SDP, one of two non-cabinet allies of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), opposed the revision over concerns
that it would contradict Japan's war-renouncing Constitution which
bans "the use of force" overseas.
</P>
<P>
The SDP chief also said his party would draft a plan by summer
to reduce the total land area used by U.S. military bases
throughout Japan, not just the Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, Japan's southernmost island prefecture, accounts for
only 0.6 percent of Japan's land area, but it has 75 percent of
the U.S. military bases located in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Young Chinese laid-off workers
should be more creative in seeking new job opportunities, urged
participants at a forum on re-employment.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Youth Daily, young workers should
blaze new trails in finding jobs, and even become their own
bosses, said Pan Guoli, chairman of the Jialin Group, a private
business in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Baoqing, who initiated a service company in central
China's Henan Province with an initial investment of 20,000 yuan
(about 2,500 U.S. dollars), said that young people must be brave
and create new jobs for themselves.
</P>
<P>
People could find jobs in the service sector, said Li Zhigang,
from the Gas Company in Jilin City, Jilin Province. In the past,
Chinese workers did not highly regard jobs in the service
sector. But the service sector will create many new jobs for
job-seekers, said Tian Xiuhai, chairman of the Tianjin Donghai
Liquefied Gas Company.
</P>
<P>
Only 26 percent of China's workers are in the service sector,
which shows the great potential for new jobs in the sector,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities appear from time to time, said Zhuang Hongwei, a
well-known Shanghai young woman who created a chain of food stores.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Boosted by encouraging economic
fundamentals, the benchmark Composite Stock Index on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange (SSE) ended at a 10-month high of 1,306.38 points
today, up 1.58 percent from the previous session.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in more than 10 months that the composite
index has overshot the hallmark of 1,300 points.
</P>
<P>
The SSE-30 index, based on 30 blue chips that are selected from
more than 300 A shares for domestic investors on the bourse, was
up 0.9 percent to finish at 3,899.34 points.
</P>
<P>
Of the 433 shares listed on the Shanghai exchange, 315 went up

Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference and an interest reduction on March 25.

<HEADLINE> Dog Registration to Begin in Beijing on May 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Dog registration in the Chinese
capital will begin on May 1 and end on June 30, according to
today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, people who registered their dogs in
1997 must have them examined and receive the proper shots before
receiving certificates for 1998, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Dog owners in restricted areas must get clearance with local
public security departments, showing licenses and registration
cards for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997, the number of dogs in
the Chinese capital was 85,591, a drop of 6 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of dogs dropped by 60 percent compared with the
figure before a government regulation strictly limiting
dog-raising went into effect on May 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Beijing Youth Daily said that the local dog
control office has focused its attention mainly on preventing dog
bites this year, since such cases increased by 13 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Double Budgetary Allocation for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz said on Monday that the government plans to raise the
existing budgetary allocation for education from 2.3 percent of
gross domestic product to four percent in the next five years to
2003.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a launching ceremony for the 1998 Human Development
Report, Aziz said that "we are committed to persistently increase
budget allocation for education, in particular for elementary
education, exempt such allocations from budgetary cuts if any,
improve utilization and make education funds non-lapseable."
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the new education policy unveiled by
the government last month contains the same elements as have been
highlighted in the report, including eradication of illiteracy,
universal primary education, and promotion of technical and
vocational education.
</P>
<P>
Aziz expressed his believe that the new Human Development
Report will receive utmost attention regarding the education
sector which, he said, has already been the top priority of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate has not improved much and proportion of
dropouts and repeaters and teacher absenteeism remained high, he
said, adding that physical facilities are inadequate and quality
of education is poor.
</P>
<P>
The government was paying special attention under the Social
Action Program to these areas, said Aziz. A system of community
involvement was being devised to ensure proper use of funds,
monitoring of progress, improvement and upgradation of facilities
and enhancement of the quality of education, he added.
</P>
<P>
The education sector needed to be looked in a comprehensive and
integrated manner, said Aziz. While the focus should be on primary
education, other levels have also to be given due recognition, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that raising the level of literacy would
require formal as well non-formal approaches.
</P>
<P>
Non-formal approaches will not only supplement the formal
institutions but these are considered to be cost effective,
convenient and oriented to targeted groups, in particular women,
adults and workers, he observed.

<HEADLINE> 24 Chinese Athletes Caught for Doping Offences in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 24 Chinese athletes
were caught for doping offences in 1997, the Chinese Anti-doping
Committee (CAC) of the Chinese Olympic Committee announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CAC said in a statement that 3,540 tests, including 1,893
out-of-competition checks, were taken last year and 21 turned out
to be positive.
</P>
<P>
The other three were also regarded as dopers since two were
caught for cheating in tests and the third for giving banned drugs
to other people on purpose.
</P>
<P>
"All these 24 athletes and their coaches had been punished by
the sports federations involved according to the international and
domestic rules," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 24 offenders, 13 were from track and field, seven
from weightlifting, one each from wrestling, boxing, cycling and
boating. And 18 of them were women.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the positive urine samples were collected during the
Chinese Eighth National Games in Shanghai last October. But the
positive results were not confirmed until March 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
The best-known of them was Xiong Qiying, who won the women's
long jump gold medal with 7.01 meters in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The three delegations, Shanxi, Guangxi and Sichuan who won the
Fair Play Award in the National Games, had been stripped of the
honor because of their doping-involved athletes, the statement
added.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Pilotless Plane in Operation for Weather Observation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first self-controlled,
pilotless plane for meteorological observation has become
operational in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a key state scientific research project, was
developed by the Jiangxi Research Institute of Meteorological
Science.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wanyou, director of the institute, told Xinhua today that
the plane is 1.8 meters long and 0.6 meter in height, and weighs
12 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The mini-plane can carry 3 kilograms of payload. Its flying
radius is 300 kilometers and it can fly continuously for
four-to-eight hours.
</P>
<P>
The plane has a global positioning system, and performs
self-navigation and self-piloting functions. It also has a digital
exploratory apparatus and a ground data receiving and processing
device. The plane collects data on temperature, pressure,
humidity, and wind direction and velocity.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Bolin, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said the performance of this small plane puts China among world
leaders in pilotless plane applications.
</P>
<P>
China expects to use pilotless planes for several major
scientific research programs this year.
</P>
<P>
Special balloons have been widely used for meteorological
observation. However, they are limited in use and costly.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli Prime Minister Offers Thoughts on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said today that he has devoted most of his life to
advancing peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Although I have resigned from governmental posts, I haven't
given up my efforts in this respect," the visiting 75-year-old
Peres said this in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Peres, the chief architect of Israel's policy on peace in the
Middle East, served as the country's prime minister three times.
He has also served as minister of the Israeli departments of
immigrant absorption, transport and communication, information,
defense, interior, religious affairs, foreign affairs and
finance.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate his efforts on advancing the Middle East peace
process, Peres was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 along
with Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
It would be much better if the artillery, wire mesh and
soldiers stationed at the borders could be replaced with
factories, schools and department stores, he said, adding that
this is just what he has been pushing since his resignation from
the posts of Chairman of the Labor Party and head of the
opposition in June of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Three months after his resignation, Peres set up the Center for
Peace. With 12 staff members and 50 student volunteers, the center
has been designated to advance economic, cultural, health and
technological exchanges between Israel and Arab countries. So far,
50 projects have been started.
</P>
<P>
"Shifting from politics to economics, I have moved from danger
to peace," Peres said, adding that only with economic construction
as its center of work instead of politics, can a country realize
peace.
</P>
<P>
China is just a good example of it, he said. Since China
turned to economic construction 20 years ago, it has not only
enjoyed domestic stability, but also solved successfully
the issues of Hong Kong and Macao. I believe it can also solve
successfully the issue of Taiwan in the future.
</P>
<P>
The former Israeli prime minister pointed out that the current
peace process in the Middle East is only a "slight move."
</P>
<P>
He described Sino-Israeli relations as a "success" since
diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in
1992. China is not only a big market in an economic sense, "it is
also a great country of our time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has supported world peace wholeheartedly," said Peres,
who is also the honorary president of the Council for the
Promotion of Israel-China Relations.
</P>
<P>
Peres, born in Poland and raised in Israel, was educated at New
York University and Harvard University in the United States. He
has written such books as "The New Phase," "David's Sling" and
"Tomorrow is Now."

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns Against Rise in Lifestyle-related Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- By the turn of the century, health
experts worldwide face a grand battle against lifestyle or
behavior-related diseases, which is seen to dominate the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued here Monday by Dr. S. T. Han, World
Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific regional director, in
connection with the observance of the World Health Day and the
50th founding anniversary of the WHO Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Han said there are some features of health transition which
will be difficult or impossible to control, and they include "the
shift from communicable to non-communicable disease, the rise in
lifestyle-related diseases, and the threat of emerging and
re-emerging diseases."
</P>
<P>
Less infectious diseases but more of lifestyle or behavior will
dominate the 21st century as a result of being better off, the WHO
official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that lung cancer and heart diseases will rise
because of smoking, more people will have high blood pressure due
to high salt/fat diet and more accidents will occur as people
drink while driving.
</P>
<P>
Since these are man-made diseases, he pointed out that man can
control or contain them by removing the factors.
</P>
<P>
But, individuals adopting healthy lifestyles or behavior are
not enough and there is a need for strong support from governments
through formulation and implementation of health policies, Han
said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Trade Ministers to Meet In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A two-day preparatory meeting of
ministers of trade of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
African Economic Community (AEC) started in Harare Monday to
prepare for a WTO meeting, among others.
</P>
<P>
The African trade minister meeting on April 8-9 in Harare will
make preparation for the second ministerial meeting of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva next month, a local source
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 experts from over 30 African countries will
attend the meeting which is the first of African ministers of
trade following the inauguration of the AEC in Harare last June.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, S. Makhan, Assistant Secretary-General
of the OAU defined the three major objectives of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The first objective is to review proposals for the
establishment and the working modalities of an AEC
inter-governmental mechanism for the discussion and coordination
of trade policy in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said in this regard, it is necessary to bear in mind the
provision of the technical committee on trade, customs and
immigration in the treaty establishing the AEC.
</P>
<P>
The second objective is to prepare for the forthcoming
ministerial conference of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The third is to review all matters of interest to Africa in
the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Africa now needs a permanent inter-governmental
forum for the coordination of trade policy. Globalization and
liberalization are posing new demands and challenges to Africa
but also offering new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The AEC inter-governmental forum on trade policy will
constitute a chain to facilitate African effective participation
in the multilateral trading system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Stresses Agricultural Cooperation with Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
stressed agricultural cooperation with Canada today, saying
there's great potential in this area.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Lyle Vanclief, Canadian minister of
Agriculture, Wen said bilateral cooperation in various areas,
especially in agriculture, has been advancing smoothly since the
two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Wen said he hoped that long-term and stable cooperative links
would be set up between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the many cooperative projects which have
already been carried out relating to processing farm products and
trade as well as agricultural science and technology, and said
Vanclief's visit should further stimulate such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vanclief said Canada and China share many similarities in
agricultural development, which provides both sides with
opportunities to conduct mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada have signed 20 agreements related to animal
and plant quarantines since the establishment of the Joint
Committee on Agriculture in 1985. They have also launched 26
cooperative projects in such areas as animal husbandry and
agricultural education. Many key agricultural provinces of
both countries have established cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Vanclief and his party are visiting China at the invitation of
China's Ministry of Agriculture. He met with vice-minister of
agriculture Wan Baorui earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Uniform Customs Documents Due by July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The regional Transit Coordination
Authority has resolved to harmonize all customs documents for
transit goods among its five member countries by July 1 this
year, The East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said a ministerial meeting held recently in the
port city of Mombasa concluded that a unified customs
documentation system would speed up the movement of cargo on
transit.
</P>
<P>
The system will also reduce cases of diversion of goods into
domestic markets other than those they are destined to, according
to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Silas Kanamugire, Acting Coordinator of the authority, was
quoted as saying at the meeting that "we want member states to
have a coordinated numbering system and uniform documents which
will enable transporters to move across the borders at the
shortest time possible."
</P>
<P>
Besides streamlining customs documentation, the authority also
seeks to harmonize joint border controls between the adjacent
border posts of member countries.
</P>
<P>
Kanamugire noted that "we expect to cut down the trucks' turn
around time by at least 50 percent once the joint control is
implemented."
</P>
<P>
On average, trucks spend one week between Kenya and Uganda
border posts while undergoing customs and other related checks.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, officials from the adjacent border posts
are required to do the inspections at the same time on one side
of the border line.
</P>
<P>
The authority comprises Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo which are the main users of
Kenya's port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The authority was established in 1985 to implement the
Northern Corridor Transit Agreement which is aimed at
facilitating access to and from the sea for landlocked member
states through port Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The 2,100-kilometer-long Northern Corridor highway stretches
from Bujumbura in Burundi, through Kigali in Rwanda, across the
Getuma Bridge on the Uganda-Rwanda border to Kampala, then to
Malaba on the Kenya-Uganda border via Nairobi to the port.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Takes Davis Cup Tie From Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Host Belgium twice came from
behind to beat the Netherlands and win its Davis Cup tie in the
first round of the world group competition.
</P>
<P>
Christophe van Garsse sealed the hard-fought victory on Monday
when his match against Sjeng Schalken resumed.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian replacement was leading the second of the reverse
singles 6-4, 6-4 and 3-6 when play was put off due to darkening
daylight on Sunday after the two teams had played their doubles
and the first reverse singles.
</P>
<P>
A recharged van Garsse seemed to be closing on victory after he
took three games in a row without allowing one in the fourth set
on Monday. But he surprisingly conceded the next six games to
allow of a tie-breaking decider.
</P>
<P>
Van Garsse, who replaced Johan van Herck, was just in time to
find the form he played with the day before and wrapped up the
fifth and last set 6-3 to seal off the match for Belgium by
breaking a serving game of Schalken.
</P>
<P>
The disheartening Dutch simply could not hold on as he
committed a double fault to let go the match.
</P>
<P>
It was Belgium's third win against the Netherlands in their
five Davis Cup encounters.
</P>
<P>
The two teams last met in 1994 when the Dutch side whitewashed
the Belgians in the three-day contest.
</P>
<P>
Filip Dewulf, a specialist on clay, was the toast of the host
team as he won both of his singles matches to twice put the
Belgians back on equal footing with the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf, ranked 54th on the ATP tour, won both singles in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Belgium next meets in the quarter-finals the winner of the
United States-Russia tie that was also postponed to Monday due to
a first-day wash-out by rain in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The United States now lead Russia 2-1.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Introduces Inter-Bank Offered Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Financial transactions in the
Nigerian monetary system takes a new dimension as from Monday,
with the introduction of the Nigerian Inter-Bank Offered Rates
(NIBOR).
</P>
<P>
The NIBOR, fashioned after the popular London Inter-Bank
Offered Rates (LIBOR), was introduced by the Money Market
Association of Nigeria (MMAN), an umbrella body of treasurers of
banks and other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Before NIBOR, the only reference rate for the economy was the
Central Bank of Nigeria's Minimum Rediscount Rate which has not
been changing with realities of rate movement in the market.
</P>
<P>
NIBOR is expected to give a better reflection of interest rate
movement in the economy and would serve as a benchmark for
players in the Nigeria money market.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to give a credible guide to the
international investment community on interest rate movement in
Nigeria and the average return for funds placed in its banks.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of NIBOR, banks are expected hereafter
to quote rates plus or minus the reigning NIBOR rate while
interested non-bank financial dealers are expected to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
The NIBOR currently has 12 member banks, but according to
Alhaji Deda Atta, Vice-President of MMAN, only eight banks'
reference rates will be used in determining the NIBOR benchmark,
while the two highest and the two lowest will be discarded with.
</P>
<P>
The NIBOR rates will be reviewed from time to time to conform
with market forces and will be published weekly in both national
and international media, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
The rates for this week are as follows: seven days - 19.090
percent, 30 days - 21.00 percent, 90 days - 22.304 percent, 180
days - 23.3886 percent, 270 days - 23.9886 percent, 365 days -
24.4886 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set up Tourist Zone for Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will set up an exclusive
tourist zone (ETZ) soon at its attractive spots to give a boost to
the country's nascent tourism industry, The Independent newspaper
said Monday quoting tourist officials.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a board meeting of the Bangladesh
Parjatan Corporation (BPC), the country's major tourism service,
held in Dhaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ETZ, like the export processing zone, has been planned for
picturesque sites like Khagrachhari, Bandarban, Rangamati,
Sondadia and Inadia Island of Cox's Bazar (all these places are
located in southeast of Dhaka) with all modern facilities for
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Singapore had already visited the spots to
assess prospects, BPC Chairman Khandker Rashidul Hoq said, adding
"efforts are being made to set up a three-story motel at
Khagrachhari and Bandarban with assistance of the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government has also planned to invest 2 billion taka (43.5
million U.S. dollars) to build more hotels, restaurants, and other
tourist facilities in the country's southeastern hill districts.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is steadily developing since the government
attaches importance to it.
</P>
<P>
Over 182,000 tourists came to this South Asian country last
year, representing an increase of about 10 percent over that of
the previous year, and foreign exchange earnings from the sector
during the first seven months of 1997 were recorded at 1.123
billion taka (24.4 million dollars against 1.4 billion taka (about
30.4 million dollars) during the whole year of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Russia Bids to Sell MiG-Fighters to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia has become the latest
country to enter a bid to supply South Africa with MiG fighters,
local daily Business Day reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia would submit this week a tender to Amscor, the
state-owned arms producer in South Africa, to sell the country
with 24 MiG AT twin-engine fighter trainers.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-designed and manufactured jets are equipped with
French engines and avionics, the Pretoria-based Russian embassy
was quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Nikolay Andreez, senior official of Moscow Aviation Production
Organization, said last week that Russsia's tender would include
an offset proposal exceeding the value of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
This would include the production locally of MiG AT components
and avionics and the final assembly and testing of the aircraft.
Russia also offered to establish a technical support center which
could service all MiG aircraft on the continent, Andreez said.
</P>
<P>
Indirect offset included a proposal for a joint venture in
space for earth remote sensing with benefits for the geological
and geophysical sectors.
</P>
<P>
By accepting the tender, South Africa would significantly
benefit from Russian technology transfers and increased export
opportunities to Russia, Andreez said.
</P>
<P>
To date, several countries, including Germany, Sweden and
Britain had submitted proposals to South Africa for the
replacement of outdated and aging military equipment, including
trainer jets.
</P>
<P>
The South African Air Force plans to replace its Impala fleet
by 2005 and would need about 24 new aircraft.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and 12
others injured Monday in a nationwide strike in Nepal, the Home
Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told Xinhua that one truck driver died of stone
injuries in Chitwan district and a bus passenger was killed in
Butwal of Rupandehi district.
</P>
<P>
Nine passengers, one bus driver and two policemen were injured
in the strike and some of them were in serious condition, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 118 people were detained by the police for
attempting to stone buses, trucks and other vehicles, he added.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the United People's Front, the
political wing of the ultra-leftist guerrillas, to protest the
continued neglect of its 40-point demand by successive
governments.
</P>
<P>
The demands include scrpping of the Indo-Nepal Mahakali
Integrated Development Treaty, control of corruption, end of
feudal system, distribution of the rich people's land to the poor
and the landless, equal rights for women to parental property and
the establishment of a republican state.
</P>
<P>
Few vehicles were seen on the streets and most of the shops
were closed on Monday across Nepal, affecting the normal life of
residents, another source said.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened in the capital city to prevent
unpleasant incidents, but some were detained by the police, the
Home Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-leftist guerrillas have stepped up their campaign of
"people's war" in recent months and about 135 people have been
killed since the people's war was launched in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Nepali government is trying to hold
dialog with the guerrillas.

close at 1549.93 points on Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Can Run Nigerian State-Owned Firms: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors may acquire not
less than 40 percent of the equity of Nigeria's public sector
enterprises set for privatization and may be permitted to run
such enterprises if they have the technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Finance Minister Anthony Ani at a
meeting of industry leaders, bankers and private sector operators
at the weekend in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
In conceding about 40 percent equity of the public enterprises
to foreign investors, the government is aware that the investors
would want to get involved directly in the day-to-day running of
such firms, Ani said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Nigerians should not be taken aback if and
when the investors decide to run the firms.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the bids of core strategic investors would
have to go through scrutiny and evaluation by consultants and
investment bankers to be appointed by the government.
</P>
<P>
A national committee on privatization would decide on the
foreign partners after taking into consideration Nigeria's
national interest and other critical factors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government announced in this year's budget the
privatization of key state-owned firms in telecommunications,
electrical power and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The move has reportedly sparked off interests from businesses
in the U.S., Britain and other nations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Not Free from External Threats:PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Monday Malaysia's economy was not free from
external threats due to globalization and the borderless free
market system.
</P>
<P>
He said thus far, Malaysia could still defend its sovereignty
but whether it could be sustained depended on the people's
readiness to make sacrifices in their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to learn from the practice of sacrifice as
rendered to us by Islam to protect the religion, race and
country," he said in his message in conjunction with the
celebration of Haji Aidil Adha Festival Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said although Malaysia could take pride with the progress
achieved so far, nevertheless it was still far from the level
which could guarantee national resilience.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir reminded Malaysian Muslims not to tarnish the image of
Islam by resorting to irresponsible actions driven by lust, saying
they should strive to maintain the prevailing unity and avoid
disunity and enmity among themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said the progress attained by Malaysian Muslims thus far
proved that there were not less capable than others.
</P>
<P>
"We have contributed our bit for the redemption of the Muslims'
integrity... let us not mar our image and that of Islam solely
because we believe we are the majority and protected in our
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also expressed his sympathy to the sufferings of
Muslims in Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chechnya and Kosovo in
Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism to Boom During Songkran Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Songkran Festival, the
traditional Buddhist New Year, will boost tourism in the country
hard hit by economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis will not prevent many Thais from going out
to celebrate the holiday which lasts five days starting from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies and hotels said hotel rooms at major provincial
destinations have been fully booked.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable ... it is booming more than the New Year
and Chinese New Year," said Siriluck Burapaichit, marketing
manager of N.S. Tour and Travel Corporation in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared 75 air-conditioned buses for group-tour
customers, compared with only 40 coaches each for last new year
and Chinese New Year," she said.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge has surprised many in the travel industry, who are
now benefiting from the weakened baht as Thais who used to go
abroad have opted to travel in their own country instead.
</P>
<P>
The government has launched a campaign urging Thais to "travel
at home" and buy locally-made goods.
</P>
<P>
The campaign contributed to the domestic tourism boom, Siriluck
said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International said all domestic flights between
April 1 and April 17 have been fully booked since late last month.
Many bookings are by foreign tourists, as the airlines offered a
free domestic connection to international passengers arriving in
Thailand on its flights.
</P>
<P>
But for many Thais, this year's Songkran might not be as costly
as before because the economic slump curbs the annual pre-Songkran
"arms race" -- a reference to the purchase of high-powered water
guns. Thais spray water onto each other during the festival in a
show of good luck and happiness.
</P>
<P>
Spending on high-powered water guns has plunged by at least 80
percent as pay cuts and redundancies bite hard into spare cash.
</P>
<P>
Turnover is low, even though distributors have cut their profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
"Sales are down by 80 percent this year," said a major importer
of the Chinese-made guns in Sampheng, Bangkok. He predicted the
downturn and ordered only 10 percent of last year's volume.
</P>
<P>
Sales of other Songkran products have also dropped sharply,
including the traditional fragrant water used in ceremonies paying
respect to elders.
</P>
<P>
A source at Nam Ob Thai Nang Loy Co, the major producer of
fragrant water, said that in previous years orders began arriving
in late February, but very few early requests were received this
year. "Our sales have dropped by at least 50 percent this year,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Appearance of Earliest Human Ancestors Dates Two Million Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Research on stone tools discovered
in Wushan County, in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing, has
provided further proof that the ancestors of modern man appeared
in the Three Gorges area along the Yangtze River some two million
years ago, or one million years earlier than former estimates.
</P>
<P>
The latest discovery substantiates the 1996 paleontological
determinations by scientists from the University of Iowa, Beijing
University and Institute of Geology of Chinese under the Academy
of Sciences. Paleontologists at that time determined the age of
the fossilized remains of a human tooth, part of a lower jaw bone
and fossils of 120 backbones of various animal species discovered
in Wushan County.
</P>
<P>
Last November, an archeological team headed by researchers from
the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and
the National Library unearthed a cache of stone tools in the same
county which yielded the discovery of the fossils of Wushan Man.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts claim the crudely chipped stone implements are
the earliest tools used by ancient beings.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Stronger Pushed by Gold Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A sharp rise in the price of gold
pushed the Australian dollar higher Monday but gains were
restrained as the Japanese yen remained under pressure.
</P>
<P>
The local unit ended the session at 66.06 U.S. cents, from
65.73 cents late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia Treasury Manager Paul Macarounas said the
local currency was caught between the strong gold price and the
weak Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, gold bullion closed at 309.05 U.S. dollars per
ounce, 5.65 dollars higher than the previous close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said the Australian dollar was trapped in a fairly
tight range at present and would likely be capped just above 66
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
In the long term the weight of the weak yen and Japan's
economic circumstances would probably be depressive influences on
the currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank of Canada senior economist Su-Lin Ong said the
Australian dollar continues to be a proxy for Asian sentiment,
particularly given that Japan is Australia's largest export
market.
</P>
<P>
With the possibility of Japanese yen remains under pressure,
there may be further downside to the Australian dollar," Ong said.
</P>
<P>
Locally Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia holds its
monthly board meeting and traders will be keeping a close eye on
their screens for any announcement on monetary policy the
following morning.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has in the past moved to alter interest rates
the day after the board meeting but most analysts expect the
bank's rates-on-hold stance to remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended the local session at 88.94 from
88.35 against Japanese yen, and at 1.2175 from 1.2166 against
Deutsch marks.

<HEADLINE> Australia Announces Appointments of Senior Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chris Barrie, an Australian
vice-admiral with Bachelor of Arts and Master of Business
Administration degrees, was appointed Monday by Australian Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan as the new chief of the nation's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Barrie was among the four senior officers promoted to higher
posts to replace the senior soldiers, who will be retired in the
middle of this year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The retiring soldiers are General John Baker, chief of the
Australian Defense Force, General John Sanderson, chief of the
Australian Army, and Air Marshal Les Fisher, chief of the
Australian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Admiral Chris Barrie, 52, currently Vice Chief of the
Defense Force, will be appointed the chief of Defense Force, and
promoted to Admiral, McLachlan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Barrie, who will lead the Australian armed forces of 577,000
for about two years, entered the Royal Australian Naval College in
January 1961 and assumed his current appointment as vice chief of
the Defense Force in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
"In his own time Vice-Admiral Barrie has obtained a Bachelor of
Arts degree with a special focus on international relations and
politics. He was awarded a Master of Business Administration
degree in 1996 by (Australia's) Deakin University," the Australian
Department of Defense said in a career profile of the new chief.
</P>
<P>
Air Vice-Marshal Doug Riding, 54, currently Head of Systems
acquisition (Aerospace), will be appointed vice chief of the
Defense Force and promoted to Air Marshal, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Riding, who joined the Royal Australian Air Force as an aircrew
cadet in June 1962, has extensive fighter aircraft operational
experience following his service in several units in Australia,
Malaysia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Major General Frank Hickling will replace General Sanderson as
chief of the Army and promoted to Lieutenant general, and Air
Vice-Marshal Errol McCormack, 56, currently deputy chief of the
air force, will be promoted to replace Fisher as chief of the air
force, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"All appointments will be for two years effective on the date
of retirement of their respective predecessors," said the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Australian Car Sales to Hit New Record: Chamber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Federal Chamber of
Automotive Industries Monday forecast a record year for new
vehicle sales in 1998 after demand for cars and trucks rose to
record levels in March.
</P>
<P>
In its latest sales bulletin VFACTS, the chamber said 68,545
new passenger cars and commercials were sold last month, the best
ever result for the month of March.
</P>
<P>
That prompted the chamber to forecast a total market for the
year of 740,000 units up from the previous best of 722,427 sold in
1997.
</P>
<P>
It also took first quarter sales this year to 181,845, up 14.5
percent or 23,024 units compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The March result was up 10.4 percent up on the 62,105 vehicles
sold in February and up 19.3 percent on the 57,474 units sold in
March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Most segments contributed to the improvement over the first
three months with sales in the upper-medium market up by 8.8
percent, in the medium car segment by 10.2 percent, the small car
segment by 14.1 percent and the light car segment by seven
percent.
</P>
<P>
Holden was the top-selling car company in March, heading Toyota
and Ford in the sales race. The three companies are subsidiaries
of major American and Japanese car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Holden retailed 14,228 vehicles for a 20.8 percent market
share, compared to 13,520 for Toyota, or 19.7 percent, and 10,647
for Ford, or 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the first quarter Holden also led the way with 34,691
units for 19.1 percent of all sales, compared to 33,387 units, or
18.4 percent for Toyota, and 27,308 units, or 15 percent for Ford.
</P>
<P>
Of those companies only importing cars into Australia, Hyundai
continued to do best with sales of 4,034 units last month for a
three-month total of 12,062.
</P>
<P>
However, that was well down on the 16,447 the company had sold
at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai was followed by Nissan with sales of 3,693 units last
month and 9,737 for the first quarter, and Mazda with sales of
2,415 units last month and 7,056 units for the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Calls for More French Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji Monday
called on French enterprises to be more engaged in China, as the
country is the best for investment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I think China is the best place for investment in Asia. But
it is up to you to decide. Don't lose this opportunity," said
Zhu when addressing more than 200 heads of French enterprises
at a breakfast organized by France's national employers'
association CNPF.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that France played a very positive role at the ASEM
meeting held in London last week, because President Jacques Chirac
expressed deep sympathy and support to the Asian countries now
undergoing a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"But we challenge you to make more and more investment in
China as the best way to support China," Zhu said, adding China's
"political and economic situation is very stable, its currency is
stable, and its government is reliable and strictly sticks to its
promises."
</P>
<P>
He said that France can play a big role in participating in
China's modernization of its state enterprises, including the
small and medium-sized enterprises in the vast countryside of the
country, which make up one third of its public-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that China views high-tech information industry as one
priority of its development strategy, as it is one of the leading
forces for a modern economy.
</P>
<P>
In this field, he said, French information enterprises can play
a major role.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also said that opening its financial and
insurance market is a fixed strategy of China, but it will take
time to fully open the market.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis in other Asian countries will not affect
the speed of opening up in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu was warmly welcomed by French entrepreneurs who gave him
a long ovation after he ended the speech with "Merci."

<HEADLINE> World Fastest Woman Race Attracts Top Three Sprinters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, China, April 6 (Xinhua) -- All the top three world
women 100-meter medal winners including American Marion Jones
have signed contracts to take part in the world fastest woman race
scheduled for May 12 in Chengdu, southwestern city of China,
announced the organiser here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuanqing, vice president of the Chinese Athletics
Association, said at a press conference that besides world champion
Jones, Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine, world 200m champion and
100m runner-up, and Sevatheda Fynes of Bahamas, world 100m bronze
medallist, will participate in the race.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever sets a new world record in the race, she will be given
one million yuan Renminbi (about 120,000 US dollars) as a bonus,"
Wang announced.
</P>
<P>
Wang also revealed that American Olympic 100m champion Gail
Devers is still discussing some details with the Chinese side
before making her mind whether or not to come."We are still
waiting her to make her final decision, " added Wang.
</P>
<P>
Susanthika Jayashinghe of Sri Lanka, 200m silver medallist at
last year's world championships in Athens, is still among the
invitees although the most promising Asian girl has involved
in a controversial drug scandal recently.
</P>
<P>
Wang refused to expose how much the appearence fees prepared
for those foreign stars, but a reliable source unveiled that the
fee for Jones is about 40,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese sprinters spearheaded by Li Xuemei, who ran a
10.79 seconds last October at the Chinese National Games, will
challenge the foreign big names in the showdown.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, if Li wins the race, she will get 100,000
yuan Renminbi (about 12,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official also pointed out after the race, all
sprinters have to take a doping test.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was originally planned to stage last
Monday, but due to the unsettlement of Devers, it was delayed one
week later.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Send Delegation to DPRK Next Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea announced Monday that it
will send a five-member delegation to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) next Saturday for talks on improving
inter-Korean ties.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is an apparent response to the proposal by the
DPRK on April 4 to hold talks at the vice-ministerial level, made
over the hot-line telephone between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We will send a five-member delegation headed by the vice
unification minister to discuss how to improve inter-Korean ties
and matters of mutual concern, including supply of fertilizer to
the North," said Chung Won-shik, chairman of the Korean National
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK last Saturday suggested that the vice-minister talks
be held in Beijing, China on April 11 to discuss issues related to
food and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
Through the Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency,
Hyundai Corp and other channels, the DPRK required the South to
provide the North with 200,000 tons of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
On the meeting venue, South Korea told the DPRK over the
hot-line telephone between the two sides that the meeting site
could be any place on the Korean peninsula, including the truce
village of Panmunjon.
</P>
<P>
"We will accept the date of the talks as your side proposed,
but we think it is desirable to hold the talks at any point on the
Korean Peninsula that is convenient to you," said Chung.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming talks will be the first direct inter-Korean
meeting since South Korea's new government was sworn in on
February 25.
</P>
<P>
Since President Kim Dae-jung's inauguration, South Korea has
made a series of proposals to improve inter-Korean ties, including
exchange of special envoys and reunion of separated families.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, South Korea lifted the ban on South Korean
investment in the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Killers of Hamas Activist Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian senior official
said on Monday in the West Bank city Ramallah that the Palestinian
police have arrested five people suspected of killing Hamas
bombmaker Muhei Eddine Sharif about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The official said that one of the men has confessed that he
planted explosives in Sharif's car, which exploded on March 29 in
an industrial zone of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat has been informed of the result of investigation,
which will be made public later Monday.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of Sharif's death on March 29 have remained a
mystery. Palestinian security officials said that Sharif was shot
to death before being dumped his car, which was rigged with
explosives.
</P>
<P>
But there is no immediate information about whether the
suspects killed Sharif before the explosion and for what reason they
carried out the operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported that in the probe of Sharif's
death, Palestinian police also found weapons, large amount of
explosives and a bomb factory in the self-rule territories.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas has blamed Israel for
murdering Sharif, who was believed to be the mastermind of two
suicide bombings in Jerusalem last year, which killed 25 Israelis
and wounding 200 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel has categorically denied any involvement in the
incident and insisted that Sharif was killed in the explosion
when he prepared for a terror attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's denial, Hamas has vowed to avenge Sharif's
death, declaring that they would attack Jewish targets both in
Israel and abroad.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Expanded Agricultural Cooperation with Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Agriculture Wan
Baorui expressed hope today for expanded Sino-Canadian cooperation
in farm produce processing and related science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Wan made the comments during talks in Beijing with Lyle
Vanclief, Canadian minister of Agriculture and Agri-Foods, and
stressed the importance of agricultural cooperation between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
China will gradually realize the integration of production,
processing and sales in ongoing agricultural development, said
Wan. He also noted the broad prospects for cooperation in food
processing, especially projects featuring a high proportion of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Wan pointed out that China emphasizes the development of
science and technology in the agricultural sector due to the
relatively tight land resources resulting from a large population
and limited natural resources.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to expand exchanges with Canada in related areas to
jointly develop and apply new technology, said Wan.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have signed some 20-odd agreements related to
animal and plant quarantines since establishment of the joint
committee on agriculture in 1985. They have also joined in some 26
cooperative projects in wide-ranging areas, including planting,
animal husbandry and agricultural education. Numerous key
agricultural provinces of both countries have established
cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Vanclief pointed to the solid foundation the two countries
enjoy in terms of agricultural cooperation. He said Canada will
encourage more investors to join in food processing projects in
China and will continue to support cooperation in terms of
science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Manila Asks for Foreign Help in Anti-forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is asking
Australia, Canada, the United States and other foreign nations to
help the country put up an anti-forest fire program, a senior
civil defense official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fortunato Dejoras, executive officer of the National Disaster
Coordinating Council (NDCC), said that the Philippines made this
call during a meeting here Monday with the three countries and
some Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking fire experts from other countries to help us
draw up a program so the Philippines will have the capability to
address successfully our fires," Dejoras said.
</P>
<P>
Dejoras said the country needed today technical assistance
rather than fire equipment, because "we do not have any program to
combat forest fires if these occur anew."
</P>
<P>
But he said that the forest fires in southern Palawan province
have been controlled except for four small fires still raging in
the towns of Rizal and Quezon.
</P>
<P>
Dejoras said firefighters are still in the fire-struck
mountains to extinguish the embers in these places to prevent the
fires from flaring up again.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires had raged in Palawan province for more than two
weeks, destroying at least 2,000 hectares of grassland and forest
and displacing 125 families. Three people were killed in the
combat against the fires.

<HEADLINE> South Korea May Face Economic Recession, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea could face a grand
recession in 1999 even if it carries out large-scale economic
restructuring, the government-run think-tank Korea Development
Institute reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
If the country fails to implement early structural reforms, its
economic growth will drop to minus 2 percent, causing a prolonged
economic recession like the one that had plagued Latin America,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that despite large-scale trade surplus, the
nation's gross domestic product (GDP) this year will plunge to
minus 1 percent as the domestic demand is expected to plummet by
some 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's current-account surplus in 1998 could surpass 25
billion U.S. dollars due to the won's drastic depreciation and
sharp reduction in imports resulting from declining domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
The consumer prices are expected to keep a 9 percent growth
rate in spite of an upswing of foreign exchange rate this year.
The unemployment rate will stand at 6 percent, with the jobless
number hitting 1.3 million, said the institute.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has to restructure its economy, shut down ailing
financial institutions and open its markets to foreigners this
year in accordance with an agreement signed last December with the
International Monetary Fund for a bailout loan of 57 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> State Development Bank Channels Loans to Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The China State Development Bank
(SDB) has channeled loans totalling 123.8 billion yuan (15.5
billion US dollars) to the nation's major power plant construction
projects since its establishment four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The loans have significantly promoted the development of the
country's power industry.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources report that the output capacity of the projects
receiving SDB loans will reach 9.39 million kw once the facilities
enter operations in 1998. Related plants will account for some
80.3 percent of the nation's increased power output capacity.
</P>
<P>
The successful completion of a number of key state power
projects has largely eased problems related to the country's power
supply, with the facilities contributing greatly to national
economic development, according to an SDB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The SDB has paid great attention to financing energy, water
conservancy and various other infrastructure projects, with
special emphasis placed on the construction of the state's key
projects in related sectors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that between 80-90 percent of the country's
thermopower and hydropower projects have used SSB loans, with
loans from the banks accounting for close to a third of the
country's total investments in the power generation sector.
</P>
<P>
The SDB spokesman said his bank will continue to support the
construction of large power plants with good market potentials and
prospects for profitability.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 3 Wounded in South Lebanon Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was killed and
three others wounded in two roadside bomb blasts Monday morning in
south Lebanon, the Lebanese National Broadcasting Network (NBN)
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The first blast occurred at around 8 a.m. local time (0500 GMT)
near the village of Adaisi in the western sector of the
Israeli-occupied south Lebanon, and the second at round 9
a.m. (0600 GMT) near the village of Merkiby in the same area.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Lebanon's security sources as saying that two
Israeli armored personnel carriers were also damaged when they
passed by the blast sites.
</P>
<P>
The details of the bombings are not immediately available,
neither is there any claim of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
This was the second such attack in a week. Six Lebanese
civilians, reportedly relatives of members of the South Lebanon
Army who help Israelis control the south, were killed and one
seriously wounded on March 31 when a roadside bomb blew off their
van.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 allegedly aimed to protect its northern areas from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, its occupying troops and posts in the south have
become targets of resistance forces, Hezbollah, or Party of God in
particular, who are trying to dislodge them from the country.

<HEADLINE> Israel Markets Satellite to Foreign Clients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industries
Ltd. (IAI) is searching for foreign partners to market its
still-grounded Amos HP communications satellite, The Jerusalem
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that IAI is holding talks with several Western
companies, including Boeing Co. and Mobile Communications Holding
Inc. (MCHI), to market the satellite.
</P>
<P>
Zeev Nahmoni, IAI's vice-president and deputy general manager
of IAI Electronics Group, was quoted as saying that the company
has changed its strategy following a marketing study and is trying
to go after companies instead of countries.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, IAI launched the Amos I communications satellite
on an Ariane 4 rocket in a geosynchronous transfer orbit and has
filled four of its seven active transponders, largely with Israeli
and government vendors. The satellite has nine transponders
overall.
</P>
<P>
The Amos HP, in contrast, was meant for a foreign client and
has been marketed in such countries as Columbia and Vietnam
without success. Its aim was to convince developing countries to
purchase a small, low-cost communications satellite in the
vicinity of 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But there are two obstacles. One is its price, which is higher
than the competitors entering the small satellite market; the
other is IAI's relative inexperience in commercial satellites.
</P>
<P>
IAI's review of its Amos operations came after the company
lost a tender issued by the U.S. Lockheed Martin
Telecommunications for a small satellite. Lockheed was seeking a
small satellite to complement its A-2100 series and as a
competitor to the successful Hughes Communications 376 model.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed turned down IAI's offer citing its high price, and
chose an Indian consortium as the winner. The Indian entry came in
with a much lower bid than any of the other companies in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
IAI executives said the future of the Amos HP lies with
finding a strategic partner, because the company itself cannot
provide the generous financing required to sell satellite to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
An IAI study of the direct broadcast satellite market showed
that the company lacks sufficient financing and achievements to
sell the Amos HP. But except the Amos HP, other Western companies
do not have a reasonable answer to the Hughes' 376 model.
</P>
<P>
So IAI is seeking to reach an agreement with one of these
companies to compete with Hughes's 376 model and is holding talks
on joining Boeing's 288-satellite Teledesic program and MCHI's
17-satellite Ellipso system.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Studying US African Peace-keeping Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Nigeria's National
War College are currently studying the initiative sponsored by
the United States to provide training on peace keeping operation
to some African soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the study, carried out in the Center of Peace,
Research and Conflict Resolution of the college, is to find out
the real facts behind the initiative, according to a leader of
the center.
</P>
<P>
Provost of the center, (retired) Maj.-Gen. Charles Ndiomu,
while briefing a team of Ghanaian visitors, said the initiative
had not been endorsed by the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile prominent Africans who met at various fora had
expressed reservations about the move, he said, quoted by the
official newspaper New Nigerian Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, what African countries need in terms of
peace keeping is logistics support since many of them have been
involved in one peace-keeping mission or the other in many parts
of the world for some time.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the study, also being conducted in conjunction
with some organizations in Africa, real facts behind the
initiative would be revealed with a view to highlighting its
implications on Africa, the provost said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposed its African Crisis Response Initiative two
years ago, under which some African countries, including Senegal,
Uganda, Malawi, Mali, Ghana and Ethiopia, have signed up for
training by American military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has expressed its hope that an all-African
peace-keeping force could be built with the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) as the nucleus.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader Denies Accusing PNA of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the radical
Islamic group Hamas leader in Gaza, has denied that he blamed the
Palestinian National authority (PNA) for the murder of Hamas
bombmaker Muhei Eddine Sharif, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi issued his denial on Sunday in a public statement and
during questioning by the Palestinian police, who summoned him to
the Gaza headquarters of PNA police chief Ghazi Jabali.
</P>
<P>
In previous interviews with The Jerusalem Post and Israel
Radio, Rantisi reportedly accused PNA security services of being
responsible for the death of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, however, Rantisi attacked the articles,
saying "I did not blame the PNA, but only Israel." He said the
story was fabricated to "divide the ranks of Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Rantisi's contention that the Israeli media distorted his
remarks has been accepted by the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of local newspaper Haaretz, a source in
the PNA condemned the Israeli press for what it termed erroneous
and vague reporting which has lead to unnecessary tension between
the PNA and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of Sharif's death are still a mystery.
Palestinian security officials said that Sharif was shot to death
before he was moved to a rigged car, which exploded later in an
industrial zone of the West Bank city of Ramallah on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Israel has categorically denied any involvement in the
incident and insisted that Sharif was killed in the explosion
when he was preparing for a terror attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's denial, Hamas has vowed to avenge Sharif's
death, declaring that they would attack Jewish targets both in
Israel and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, China, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Kim Taek Soo
beat Denmark's Allan Bentsen to win an international competition
in Suzhou, China's Jiangsu province Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Kim, a penholding paddler, defeated Allan Bentsen 21-12, 19-21,
22-20 and 21-19 in the men's singles final of the first
international meet in China which experimented with a larger table
tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles final, China's Wang Nan beat South
Korea's Ryu Ji Hye 21-17, 22-20 and 21-10.
</P>
<P>
Balls with the diameter of 4 centimeters are used instead of
the usual 3.8 centimeter ones stipulated by the sport' governing
body the International Table Tennis Federation for major events.
</P>
<P>
The larger balls are heavier and spin slower, which could
improve the TV coverage of the sport and make it more attractive
to spectators.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF President Xu Yinsheng said on Sunday that his
organization would analyze the data gathered through the
competition before making any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen top players from around the world took part in the
event, which had only men's and women's singles.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Tamoxifen Effective in Treating Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A study carried out by the
National Cancer Institute of the United States has shown that the
drug tamoxifen is effective in reducing the rate of breast cancer
by an estimated 45 percent for women at increased risk.
</P>
<P>
It appears that tamoxifen, an antineoplastic that block the
estrogen receptors on cancer cells, reduced the rate of expected
breast cancers from 1 in 130 women to 1 in 236 women during the
study period, according to a letter sent to the participants in
the study.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,000 women in the United States and Canada
participated in the massive, 68-million-dollar study which was
launched in 1992. They were considered at higher risk of cancer
because of family history, precancerous breast lesions or age.
</P>
<P>
The participants were randomly assigned to five years on either
dummy pills or tamoxifen. A code masked their therapy so no one
would know which they were taking.
</P>
<P>
The women underwent intensive medical monitoring, filled out
detailed questionnaires on lifestyle and mental health, and had
frequent meetings with their own and study doctors. They will
continue to be followed for at least two more years.
</P>
<P>
Because of the dramatic findings in the first three and a half
years, researchers have now decided to let those in the placebo
arm choose to take tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen has been used to treat breast cancer for 20
years. But it is associated with increased risks for cancer of the
uterine lining and for dangerous blood clots that can lodge in the
lungs. That is why the study had been under intense scrutiny and
criticism. Although it is believed that uterine cancer is far
easier to detect early and cure than breast cancer, enrolement in
the trial was temporarily suspended in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Medical recommendations for using tamoxifen to prevent cancer are
still being developed, says the letter to the participants, noting that
there is no evidence that taking the drug for more than five years is
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are still analyzing the data, the letter says, to
better understand the potential risks of using tamoxifen as a
prevention medicine.
</P>
<P>
While mortality rates of breast cancer patients in the United
States have been falling thanks to earlier detection and better
treatment, incidence rates continue to climb. More than 180,000 new
cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed this year in the country. A
growing number of American women will discover through genetic testing
that they are predisposed to breast cancer. Yet until now, the only
way to prevent it was to remove healthy breasts.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Exports to UK Shoot Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya exported goods worth 19.6
billion Kenyan Shillings (about 326 million U.S. Dollars) last
year to the United Kingdom (UK), compared with 12.3 billion
Shillings (about 205 million Dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times Monday quoted Peter Muthoka, Chief Executive
of the Export Promotion Council, as saying Sunday that the amount
of exports to the UK indicated a 59.3 percent increase last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the council showed a steady rise in the
volume of trade between the two countries over the last five
years with Kenya's exports increasing from some 106 million
Dollars in 1992 to about 326 million Dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rise, Muthoka said trade fairs and expositions
organized by his council had played a role in the penetration of
Kenyan exporters into the UK market in particular and the
European Union in general.
</P>
<P>
He noted that nine Kenyan companies participated in the latest
Food and Drink Exposition held in Birmingham, UK, from March 15
to March 18.
</P>
<P>
The fair availed Kenyan exporters of a chance to understand
the general regulatory environment and new technological
innovations in the European market, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Kenyan produce exhibited at the fair
attracted considerable interest with business generated at Kenyan
stand during the three days amounting to 40 million Shillings
(about 700,000 Dollars) of confirmed orders.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is exploring
diplomatic relations with Iraq, Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco
Boni confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he told Xinhua that there is no specific timetable
for talks at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"A senior Foreign Ministry official visited Iraq last year to
meet with the Iraqi authorities," Boni was quoted by The Star

</P>
<P>
Iraq is one of the few countries that South Africa has not
taken up relations with since South Africa's first all-race
elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has good relations with Iran, Libya and Cuba,
which are bitter enemies of the United States. Iraq is another
arch-rival of Washington.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to South Africa,
South African President Nelson Mandela asked Clinton to sit down
with enemies to negotiate. He said he would not betray friends
that had helped the country during the apartheid era.

"This also means we must always place priority on safeguarding
China's interests, as well as promoting the modernization drive
and realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that maintaining an overall sense of diplomacy
is the necessity and the result of development
situations. Diplomacy in a broad sense includes diplomatic work in
wide-ranging fields such as politics, economics, science and
technology, culture, military affairs and people-to-people
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang addressed the diplomatic style of New China created by
late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai by noting that
Premier Zhou was the founder of Chinese diplomacy, while Deng
Xiaoping enriched the contents and improved the style.
</P>
<P>
He said the third generation of Chinese leadership with Jiang
Zemin at the core will further develop the diplomatic style under
newly emerging circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Tang described Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister for the
previous decade, as a model who has practiced and symbolized the
diplomatic style of new China.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned six particular aspects for the diplomatic style --
independence and self-reliance; strict adherence to principles and
seeking common ground while reserving differences; standing firm
on principles while adopting flexible strategies; negotiating on
an equal footing with reason and emotion; speaking out with a
sense of justice and confronting powers without fear; constantly
forging ahead; and maintaining an earnest pragmatic approach while
seeking truth.
</P>
<P>
Tang studied English linguistics and literature at Fudan
University, and Japanese at the Beijing University, two of China's
most prestigious institutions of higher education.
</P>
<P>
He worked in China's embassy in Tokyo prior to returning to
Beijing to work as deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's

<HEADLINE> Maize Output to Be Low in 6 SADC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Maize output in six Southern
African Development Community (SADC) states, including Zimbabwe,
is expected to be down owing to the adverse effects of delayed
rains and dry spells in February, the Herald daily said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is only in four countries -- Angola, Malawi, Swaziland and
Zambia -- where forecasts have an increased output. Rainfall in
these countries was normal to above normal.
</P>
<P>
The latest SADC food security report said a regional maize
deficit of between 850,000 tons and four million tons was
projected for the 1998/99 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
The private sector is expected to handle the maize shortfall
in most countries.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary maize production forecasts, suggest that Angola
will have a 26 percent improved harvest, increasing to 462,000
tons from a harvest of about 370,000 tons. Malawi's is expected
to be up by 1.84 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is expecting a lower maize harvest of between 1.41
and two million tons as the area planted decreased by close to 20
percent due to fears of an El Nino-induced drought.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's maize harvest for this season is forecast to be
at 7.3 million tons, a drop of 19 percent compared to last year's
harvest of nine million tons.
</P>
<P>
Flooding following incessant rains may reduce yields in
Tanzania whose production may be down by about 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Drafts Housing Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to release a
national reform plan for residential housing in April or May this
year, according to today's issue of Beijing-based Outlook.
</P>
<P>
The government will end the practice of welfare housing
distribution nationwide in the latter half of this year and
encourage people to purchase their own houses, according to Zhao
Chen, director of the State Council's Leading Group for Housing
Reform.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan calls for increasing the ratio of accumulated
housing funds to 30 percent of monthly incomes following the
abolishment of the current welfare housing distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Increased accumulated funds will make it easier for prospective
homeowners to obtain mortgage loans from banks and rent for
welfare housing will be raised by a wide margin to replenish
accumulated funds, the Outlook says.
</P>
<P>
A report in today's edition of China Daily noted that, with the
exception of a few cities, prices for economy apartments in the
range of 1,000 yuan per sq.m. are well with the reach of many people.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to subsidize families with lower
incomes.
</P>
<P>
Luxury commercial apartments for the small group of prosperous
individuals will account for about 15 percent of total available
housing.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take measures to curb skyrocketing
real eatate prices so as to counter increasing complaints in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Housing reform and related consequences will highlight the real
estate sector's role as a new driving force for the nation's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The article cited statistics showing that housing covering 300
million sq.m. was completed during 1997 at a cost of 300 billion
yuan. Endithem

<HEADLINE> OAU to Assess Angola's Threats to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Organization of
African Unity and the United Nations Security Council chairman
will be in Zambia to assess the country's security situation in
relation to the recent threats of a standoff with Angola.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's leading independent newspaper the Post Monday quoted
Foreign Minister Keli Walubita as saying with Zambia National
Broadcasting Corporation that the officials will be in Zambia
within the next two weeks to assess the situation for their
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Walubita, however, maintained in an interview Sunday that all
is well between Zambia and Angola, a regional military power.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Angolans that Zambia remained committed to
ending the fighting between Angola's former rebel movement of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the
Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Manuel Augusto
claimed at a press briefing in Lusaka that Zambia has been
harboring UNITA soldiers at Maheba refugee camp in Solwezi,
capital of Zambia's North Western province which borders
UNITA-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Augusto further claimed that Zambia is being used to ship arms
into Angola by UNITA forces and indicated that it will face an
Angolan military retaliation if the practice cannot be stopped.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba denied the
Angolan ambassador's accusations and said that Angola can come to
Zambia for relevant investigations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's new Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said he is "fully confident of fulfilling his duties
in order to meet expectations of the people, the government and
the Party".
</P>
<P>
Tang, 60, was quoted as saying in today's People's Daily he
"will study hard, work diligently, maintain a disciplined clear
mind, practice a cooperative work style, forge ahead and pursue
unremitting efforts to a better job".
</P>
<P>
Tang said he will do his best no matter how demanding the job
might be in the future
</P>
<P>
However, the new foreign minister said he "fully understands
the great pressure and heavy responsibilities of the position".

China faces both unprecedented opportunities and serious
challenges accompanying increasing multipolarization and
accelerating economic globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Tang stressed his ministry must form
comprehensive cross-century diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"We must engage in unremitting efforts to implement Deng
Xiaoping's diplomatic strategies, seize opportunities and explore
new approaches to do a better job," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
The new government has not only inherited the past but is also
ushering in the future, said Tang, adding that the ministry must

</P>
<P>
Diplomacy requires that "we proceed on solid ground and
maintain a farsighted approach for the future", Tang said,
adding that related factors along with a comprehensive sense of
diplomacy represent the keys "for fulfilling duties beyond this
century".
</P>
<P>
"This means we must create a sound international environment in
order to realize China's goals oriented to the 21st century, peace
and regional stability in particular," said Tang.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike Called in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide strike, called for
Monday by the political wing of the ultra-leftist guerrillas, is
affecting the normal life in the capital city of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The United People's Front called the strike in protest against
the continued neglect of its 40-point demand by successive
governments.
</P>
<P>
The demands include scrapping of the Indo-Nepal Mahakali
Integrated Development Treaty, control of corruption, end of
feudal system, distribution of the rich people's land to the poor
and the landless, equal rights for women to parental property and
the establishment of a republican state.
</P>
<P>
Air in the capital city turns much cleaner Monday as few
vehicles are seen on the streets, and the majority of the shops
are closed.
</P>
<P>
Rickshaws become the only transportation means available to
tourists and government employees.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said it took him about one and half
an hour to go to office on foot. His boss just stayed at home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security has been tightened in the capital. Armymen
are posted together with policemen at some crossroads, and police
vehicles are patrolling on the streets.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-leftist guerrillas have stepped up their campaign of
"people's war" in recent months.
</P>
<P>
About 135 people have been killed since the people's war was
launched in February 1996.

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to introduce an
innovative management and operations system geared to the
socialist market economy for its culture and arts sectors,
according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Sun Jiazheng called on 2,600 art troupes
nationwide to carry out reforms which will enable them to survive
financial burdens, shrinking markets and the lack of competitive
spirits.
</P>
<P>
The time has come to reform outmoded practices in the sector,
said Sun, adding that troupes should promote more and better
performances for the public, especially for the nation's 800
million rural residents.
</P>
<P>
Sun said China will also improve art education in some 150-odd
art colleges and schools.
</P>
<P>
China will expand cultural exchanges and cooperation with
foreign countries and introduce Chinese civilization to the world,
while at the same time helping Chinese artists and audiences enjoy
foreign culture and art.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Likely to Reduce Annual Development Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The size of Bangladesh's annual
development program (ADP) for the current fiscal year (July
1997-June 1998) will possibly be reduced by 10 billion taka (about
217.4 million U.S. dollars) from the original 128 billion taka
(about 2.8 billion dollars), the national news agency BSS reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The planned downsize of the ADP is due to slow implementation
of projects, deficit in revenue earning and low disbursement of
foreign assistance, BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The ADP fund was envisaged at 74.83 billion taka (about 1.63
billion dollars) and foreign aid at 53.17 billion taka (about 1.16
billion dollars). Some 1,240 projects have been planned to be
implemented under the ADP.
</P>
<P>
Only 42 percent of ADP was achieved during the first eight
months of the fiscal year as against the target of 66.66 percent,
BSS said quoting sources from the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Performance in implementing the projects was much slower than
the previous two fiscal years, the sources said, adding that
during the first eight months of the last two fiscal years, the
achievements were 48 percent and 46 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The revenue earnings from the national board of revenue (NBR)
sector might face a deficit of 8 billion taka (about 174 million
dollars) during the fiscal year, according to NBR sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign aid disbursement might be 5 billion taka
(about 109 million dollars) less that it was envisaged.
</P>
<P>
"With all these deficits, there is no way but to downsize ADP,"
said a senior official from the Finance Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Bank of Ceylon has
granted over 198 million Rs (3.2 million U.S. dollars) to launch
self employment projects for youth under a Credit Scheme of Small
and Medium Enterprises Assistance.
</P>
<P>
The scheme initiated in October last year has funded 186
projects to commence and expand small scale ventures.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has launched 98 projects in the Western Provinces
while there are 27, 17, 8 and 36 industrialists in the
North-Central, the Sabargamuwa, Uva and the Southern Provinces

</P>
<P>
The youth have shown a keen interest in the scheme and there is
a growing interest among them to start ventures such as paddy
milling, food processing, fishing and light engineering.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has helped to reduce the country's acute
unemployment problem. The loans are granted under relaxed terms
and conditions for any enterprise which is economically viable and
technically feasible, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to credit assistance, the Bank provides enterprise
development consultancy services and has already conducted a
series of training programs in 1997 with more than 3,000 small

<HEADLINE> Improvements Scheduled for Packaging Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest between
100-200 billion yuan over the next few years to reequip its food
and packaging industries, as well as an additional 80-100 billion
yuan for the ongoing "Vegetable Basket" project, according to
today's People's Daily (Overseas Edition).
</P>
<P>
China's packaging industry grew by an average annual 29 percent
between 1991-1995 in spite of the fact that some 80 percent of
products remained at levels significantly lower than in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China's over 4,000 packaging
enterprises handle some 3,000 types of products in 40
categories. The sector currently employs over 500,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
However, China's packaging industry generates annual losses of
some 14 billion yuan due to the fact that 20 percent of related
enterprises operate with obsolete technology.
</P>
<P>
Experts point to vast potential of China's packaging industry
which currently operates at an overall technological level far
behind levels in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The industry plans to fulfill national and environmental
protection requirement for the next 10-15 years by reducing waste,
increasing efficiency and expanding recycling efforts.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Fossilized Dinosaur Eggs Found in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Spanish paleontologists have found,
in the northwestern part of the country, some 2,000 fossilized
dinosaur eggs dating back about 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Unearthed by workers on a road project near the city of Lerida
in Catalonia, the fossils were the third largest finding of the
kind after those in Australia and China, said media reports here.
</P>
<P>
Working carefully to excavate the fossils, the paleontologists
are planning to send up to 30 of the eggs to a research institute
for further archeological study to pinpoint their age.
</P>
<P>
They are reportedly repairing two eggs for public exhibition
possible in at least six months.
</P>
<P>
They have also discovered footprints left by gigantic reptiles
in Catalonia and La Rioja, of northern Spain, indicating that the
animal roaming across the area in the Mesozoic Era had four feet,
a big tail and a long neck.

<HEADLINE> India's Supercomputer Could Test Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- With the development of a
"Teraflop" supercomputer, India is now capable of reliably and
rapidly testing nuclear weapons without physical exploding them,
The Statesman quoted scientists as saying here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Center for Development of Advanced Computing
(CDAC) unveiled the Param 10000', a 100 gigflops machine whose
indigenously developed open-frame architecture readily allows it
to be scaled up to the rarefied world of teraflop computers, it
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, only the United States and Japan have been able to
produce teraflop-range machines which can carry out a thousand
billion mathematical operations per second. Europe has a program
to produce a Teraflop machine but is yet to produce one.
</P>
<P>
The brains behind India's supercomputer revolution has as its
main goal the simulation of nuclear tests and stockpile simulation
of nuclear weapons, the paper quoted scientist Vijay Bhatkar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to carry out physical testing of nuclear
weapons since computer simulations can actually be better than the
real thing, the scientist said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Extends Deadline to Resell Fighters to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed to
extend the deadline for the Thai air force to find a third country
to buy eight U.S.-made f/a-18 fighter jets, Thai Supreme Commander
Gen. Mongkol Ampornpisit said.
</P>
<P>
He said Frank Claimer, the U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary,
agreed in a telephone conversation to move the deadline from March
31 to April 30, Monday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
This would allow the Thai Air Force more time to find a third
country to take over the 392-million-dollar jets for which it has
no budget to buy.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Air Force had signed a contract with the U.S. to buy
the jets but scrapped the contract later for lack of funds. It
paid a 74.5-million-dollar deposit to the U.S. for withdrawing
from the deal.
</P>
<P>
The proposed resale would enable the Thai Air Force to claim
the deposit from the third country.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has reportedly expressed intention to buy the jets.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Privatize Transport Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Ministry is
trying to hasten the privatization of the loss-ridden Bangkok Mass
Transit Authority (BMTA).
</P>
<P>
Under the privatization plan, the BMTA will have to scale down
its operation by 20 percent, or keep the number of buses still in
operation at around 2,000 buses. The BMTA's direct ownership of
buses was originally set at 4,000.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of a 1996 cabinet resolution which envisaged
privatization of a number of state-owned firms, a Transport and
Communications Ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
The BMTA's share in the city bus service will be reduced to 20
percent while the rest will fall into private hands, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
If the privatization plan helps salvage the BMTA from the red,
there is no need to transfer the authority which is currently
under the Transport and Communications Ministry to the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration's jurisdiction, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Once the plan materializes, the Transport and Communications
Ministry will set up a working group to figure out how the BMTA
should be managed in compliance with government polices, said the
source, quoted by Monday's Bangkok post.

<HEADLINE> Weapons, Ammo Confiscated From Private Hands in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Military and police forces in
Bosnia have confiscated large numbers of weapons and ammunition
left in the hand of private citizens.
</P>
<P>
The efforts, the NATO-led Multinational Stabilization Force
(SFOR) said Sunday, began in early March by authorities of the two
entities in Bosnia and would last through April 15.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina had seized, by the end of March,
826 cannons, 2,530 mortars, 942 rockets and 2,344 kilograms of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they captured a total of 4,954 anti-personnel
mines, 508 anti-tank mines, 12,052 hand grenades, 1,930 pieces of
small firearms, and 443,800 rounds of small-calibre bullet.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR said the campaign, code-named "harvest," might extend
beyond mid-April as civilians could possibly hand in more weapons
they kept for the Bosnia civil war that ended in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China and the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) are preparing to initiate a new round of
family planning in the latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The program, which will be carried out at a cost of 20 million
US dollars, will include a 14 million US dollar family planning
designed to promote reproductive health in 22 counties in central
and western China, according to Cong Jun, director of the
International Relations Department under the State Family Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Project goals include reducing the prebirth mortality rate to
25 percent and reproductive tract diseases by 20 percent, as well
as increasing related education courses for youngsters by some 70
percent, according to Cong.
</P>
<P>
She added that at least five contraceptive methods will be
available for people of child-bearing age in project areas in
order to ensure they have the opportunity to make an informed
choice of the most suitable method.
</P>
<P>
The concept of reproductive health was introduced during the
International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in
1994. The conference promoted reproductive rights and worldwide
improvements of related health care matters.
</P>
<P>
"China is a signatory of the program of action adopted during
the conference," said Cong, adding that "China's great efforts to
provide high quality family planning services and promote
nationwide reproductive health care clearly indicates the
government's commitment to implementing the program of action."
</P>
<P>
China and the UNFPA commenced cooperation in 1980, with three
rounds of cooperation completed by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
While the previous three rounds of cooperative programs
involved funding of some 50 million US dollars, the current 14
million US dollars project represents the largest amount dedicated
solely for family planning.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Property Sector may Stay Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ailing property sector
has not shown any positive signs of recovery and will continue to
be sluggish until the end of the year, property research agency
The Burwood Report Indonesia has said.
</P>
<P>
The monetary crisis, which has hit Southeast Asia since early
July last year, has greatly destroyed the country's property
sector, resulting in decreasing sales and forcing many developers
out of business.
</P>
<P>
A prediction by the Burwood on Sunday said that total
investment in the property sector this year would only reach 14.44
trillion rupiah (1.7 billion U.S. dollars), 50 percent of its
initial target of 30 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Burwood's research shows that monthly investment in the
property sector indicated a decreasing trend since July. It
dropped to below 1 trillion rupiah per month in the past three
months, from an average of 3 trillion to 4 trillion rupiah before
the currency crisis hit the country.
</P>
<P>
The property sector has been the worst hit by the economic
turmoil, which has seen the rupiah plunged to as low as 17,000
against the U.S. dollar from 2,400 per dollar in July. currently,
the rupiah is traded at about 8,500 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The plunging currency has made it impossible for companies to
service their unhedged overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have, so far, shown no interest in the
property sector, especially in the office, apartment, retail and
residential sub-sectors due to the various constraints.

<P>
The LAMMP quickly responded that Iran was the second role in
the "puppy show" of the ruling party, saying the assassination
plot was "questionable" regarding to why the assassin wants to
kill Ramos at the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Manila Times even quoted some police officers
as saying that Iran had fled to Malaysia several years ago and was
too sick to accept a contract such as killing Ramos. Previous
reports even said Iran had already died.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the ruling party is trying again to discredit him
by dragging him inside the second plot. In addition, he said, the
ruling party is also trying to divert the public's attention from
a series of land sale scams in which the country lost billion of
pesos.
</P>
<P>
Last week, former board member Arturo Trinidad of the
Philippine Public Estate Authority (PEA) accused Ramos of ordering
the award of a 157-hectare reclaimed land from Manila Bay in 1994
to Malaysia's Amari Coastal Bay Development Corporation despite
the higher price offered by a South Korean company.
</P>
<P>
Former Senate President Ernesto Maceda insisted that 400
million pesos (more than 10 million U.S. dollars) of the 1.6
billion pesos (40 million dollars) in commissions paid by Amari
went to the coffers of the ruling party in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Trinidad also charged Ramos with awarding three other land
deals at lower prices to three domestic firms, one of them the SM
Shoemart, the largest player in the retail sector. Former PEA
board director Cesar Drilon confirmed the accusation.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos denied the accusation, saying that he did not
have a hand in the Amari deal. Ramos refused to cancel the deal
which had been probed and approved by Congress. Meanwhile, he said
Trinidad was "an unstable individual" who was fired by him and was
currently being investigated for graft and other charges.
</P>
<P>
Ramos dismissed Trinidad's allegations as "political
propaganda" as his aides accused the LAMMP of using the former PEA
officials to prop up its election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that no matter whether the assassination threats
and the land deal stories are true or not, their timing showed
that they are possibly election-motivated and are part of the
local election culture.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- With barely 35 days to go before
the May presidential polls, election campaigns are now heating up
in the Southeast Asian country of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Candidates posters are seen everywhere, numerous rallies were
held with speeches and promises, and campaigning vehicles are
strolling through streets with loudspeakers shouting "vote for
me."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the battle for the presidency would be
fought mainly between the candidates of the ruling Lakas-NUCD
party and the united opposition, the Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (LAMMP). To get the upper hand, both parties recently
stepped up their efforts in contesting against each other.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a former senior police officer of the
Presidential Anti-Crime Commission headed by Vice President Joseph
Estrada suddenly announced that Estrada ordered him on three
occasions in 1992 to have President Fidel Ramos assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Commander of the Presidential Security Group
(PSG) Avelino Razon confirmed Berroya's allegation, saying Berroya
reported to him about the plot in 1992, but failed to present
further evidence and witnesses as requested.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said Berroya's information was very important and must be
investigated because he was "an insider" and a long-time close
friend of Estrada, the standard bearer of the LAMMP. The
Philippine National Police said it wanted Ramos to go single to
probe the vice president.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Berroya's allegation was "a black propaganda" and
part of the ruling party's "smear campaign" against him because he
leads in all public opinion surveys. He added that he had Berroya
arrested four years ago for his involvement in a kidnapping case.
</P>
<P>
However, the PSG soon announced that no evidence has been found
linking Estrada to the alleged slay plan against President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Hardly has the assassination story subsided when the other
rises. A couple of days later, the PSG said a professional killer
has been seen stalking President Ramos in recent months. Then the
PSG strengthened the security for the president.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was identified as Eduardo Iran, the second
most-wanted man in the country. The PSG tried to arrest him, but
failed because he was very "slippery" and had a strong back-up
group.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference last Wednesday, Ramos confirmed
the assassination threat, but added that he would continue his
style of reaching out to the people and let the police authorities
to look into who are behind the assassination plot.

MADRID, April 5 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's ruling body,
fined Spanish club Real Madrid 1.3 million Swiss francs (866,000
U.S. dollars) following controversy at their European Cup
semi-final match last week.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA also ordered them to play their next two home European
games 300 kilometers away from its home field at the Bernabeu
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Real, who beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in the first leg match,
were fined 300,000 Swiss francs for taking over an hour to replace
a goal that collapsed due to fans pulling at the hoarding it was
attached to.
</P>
<P>
The remaining one million Swiss francs was fined to punish
Real for selling too many tickets for the match.
</P>
<P>
About 85,000 tickets were sold while only 72,000 were permitted
for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
UEFA ruled that the match should not be replayed because it
stated that "the delay caused by the replacement of the goal had
not given an advantage to either side."

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever, a cholera-like
disease, has killed 21 people and infected thousands more in
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, since the beginning of this year, a
report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients continually increases from day to day,
Indonesian Christian University Hospital administrator Mugiono was
quoted as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains
in the joints and backs. The cholera-like disease, known locally
as "muntaber" causes vomiting and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, Chairman of the Indonesian Medical Association (IDI)
Dr. Merdiaz Almatzier Sunday night confirmed fears a dengue fever
epidemic is likely to occur in parts of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said the cause of the disease is not just related to
stagnant waters in which mosquitoes can breed, but is also related
to a low standard of living conditions, particularly in big cities
such as Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"What we have been doing over the past few years is breaking
the cycle of the spread of the mosquitoes through routine spraying
of abate (a form of insecticide) in all neighborhoods in Jakarta.
But because environmental quality is not that good in our
neighborhoods, the mosquitoes spread easily," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever claimed 56 lives and infected 5,624 people in
Jakarta in 1995, the latest year for which complete official
figures are available, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China destroyed some 742,000
obsolete cotton spindles during the first quarter of this year, or
98.9 percent of the targeted figure for the period.
</P>
<P>
However, textile officials noted that a large number of spindles
destroyed during the period were surplus items and thus the second
quarter will involve an arduous effort to reduce additional
spindles.
</P>
<P>
China launched a national spindle reduction campaign early this
year in a bid to raise the efficiency of the textile industry and
help related firms turn losses into profits.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Shanghai, Tianjin and Dalian, as well as Jiangsu,
Guangdong, Liaoning and Hebei provinces have announced three-year
plans to improve their textile sectors.
</P>
<P>
National plans call for the sector to destroy 10 million
obsolete cotton spindles by the year 2000, in addition to
transferring some 1.2 million textile workers to various other
sectors.

YANGON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is holding an exhibition on
firewood substitute fuel in a drive to carry out the extensive use
of the substitute fuel.
</P>
<P>
The week-long exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of
Forestry and the Ministry of Science and Technology, began here
Sunday to help implement the project in forest conservation.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, Monday's The New

production of firewood substitute fuel to prevent depletion of
forests.

Myanmar designated the year 1995 as the Firewood Substitute
Fuel Application Year and the related projects have been able to
be implemented to some extent since then.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources which cover about 51
percent of its land area. The country has established a total of
21,328 hectares of plantations since the launching of a three-year
greening project in the dry zone of the central part in 1994,
which covered nine districts of three divisions.

<P>
FUZHOU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
worked out a detailed plan to accelerate the pace of housing
reform this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the local government, the province will stop
distributing housing as a form of welfare.
</P>
<P>
Newly built housing will be sold to employers at cost. The fund
formerly allocated for building housing will be distributed as
subsidies for individuals to buy houses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rents will be raised by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
The secondary housing market will be opened to individuals this
year. Individuals obtaining property rights will be allowed to
sell their houses on the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
A preferential tax policy will also be adopted encouraging
individuals to buy housing.
</P>
<P>
The province now has idle housing floor space of 3.3 million
square meters, of which 2.6 million square meters are
residential. On the other hand, the province has 130,000
households with per capita floor space below six square meters.
</P>
<P>
The province invested 14.5 billion yuan last year in real

<HEADLINE> Foundation Begins Helping Urban Laid-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide poverty-lifting
organization is emphasizing assistance to urban laid-off workers
after nine-year arduous efforts of rural poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation for Underdeveloped Regions of China started the
boost with a sum of money received from a US-based charity group,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The problem of laid-off workers is unavoidable in the country's
reform and economic development. However, they need help from the
whole society, said Wang Yuzhao, vice-president of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Hera Y Li, president of Super Nu-life System Inc. yesterday
donated 12 million yuan, or 1.4 million US dollars, to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
The money is planned to go to families of Beijing's laid-off
workers and elderly who have difficulties in their lives, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Charity Federation will run the five-year projects
with an annual 2.4 million yuan worth of donations from Li.
</P>
<P>
A considerable part of the fund will be used to pay school fees
for the children of laid-off workers, said Hua Ke, director of the
foundation's Liaison Department.
</P>
<P>
This year will see 190,000 laid-offs in Beijing, 80 percent of
whom are expected to be re-employed within one year, said Shang
Lidan, director of the Professional Skill Development Division
with the Beijing Labor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Some 130,000 out of last year's 170,000 laid-off workers have
already got new jobs, Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Li contributed products worth 10 million yuan last year to the
foundation to run vocational training programs for children in
poverty-stricken areas in some provinces from 1997 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The foundation, however, still stresses its major role for
battling poverty in rural areas, Hua said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Spain rallied from 1-2
behind to beat Brazil 3-2 in a Davis Cup World Group first round
tie in Port Algere, Brazil, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's reverse singles, Carlos Moya sealed Spain's victory
with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-2 win over Fernando Meligeni after Alex
Corretja had levelled the tie by upsetting French Open champion
Gustavo Kuerten 6-3 7-5 4-6 6-4 in three and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
Corretja, ranked seventh in the world, seemed almost unaffected
by the Brazilian fans but had to fight all the way against a tough
opponent.
</P>
<P>
Corretja squandered a 3-1 lead in the third set before dropping
his serve twice as Kuerten pulled a set back.
</P>
<P>
Corretja then regained his composure in the fourth set to keep
Spain in the tie.
</P>
<P>
Moya took full control of the match against Meligeni, forcing
his Brazilian opponent onto the defensive with deep, accurate
forehands.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Student Activity for Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's "Birds' Week" is helping
to keep students occupied while ensuring the safety of birds and
other wild animals, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Students from the capital's major universities strolled through
downtown streets during the weekend, handing out copies of a
leaflet -- "Loving Our Homeland, Protecting Wild Animals." They
invited people to fill out questionnaires to gauge their awareness
about issues regarding the protection of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
These activities were part of a week-long campaign in Beijing
designed to enhance urban dwellers' awareness of the protection of
birds and other animals.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the students' efforts, Beijing residents'
enthusiasm for protecting birds and other wild animals has been on
the rise, Lin Wenyi, Beijing's vice-mayor, said while joining the
students to prepare for the start of Birds' Week.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the municipal government designated the first week of
every year's April as Bird's Week.
</P>
<P>
All bird species in Beijing, except sparrows, are under various
levels of protection, according to the vice-mayor.

<HEADLINE> 98 Million U.S. Dollars Saved Through Commodity Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The commodity inspection bureau in
east China's Fujian Province has secured 98 million U.S. dollars
through import commodity checks during the last six years.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the bureau seized 1,000 batches of
unqualified imports worth 200 million U.S. dollars and provided
certificates for institutions and enterprises to seek compensation.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has dealt with appraisals for 1.8 billion
U.S. dollar worth of imports and tracked down 300 million dollars
of over-quoted equipment to save 82 million U.S. dollars for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, one of the pilots in China's opening-up drive, has
emphasized the importance of import inspections. The qualification
rate of imports through the port of entry increased from 77.9
percent in 1989 to 97.13 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is now committing an even-greater effort to stepping
up service for export commodity inspections on the province's
products entering the international market.
</P>
<P>
Recently, it started to work with Japan's inspection standards
on imported live eels to be authoritative in providing export
certificates, which led to Japan's ending restrictions on
importing live eels.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Halts Additional Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
has put on hold all foreign borrowing plans with its international
reserves expected to reach a "comfortable" 10.8 billion U.S.
dollars by end-June, the Philippine newspaper Manila Standard said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Valdepenas, member of the central bank's monetary
board, was quoted as saying the central bank has in fact already
suspended plans for the 1.5 billion dollars loan syndication, 250
million Europeso bond float and the 200 million deutschemark bond
issue.
</P>
<P>
Valdepenas said the government securities which were being
issued to domestic banks were enough to fulfill the financing
requirements of the government from April to September this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been aiming to build up its gross
international reserves (GIR) to 11 billion dollars by end-June so
that there would be a "comfortable" level of dollar reserves when
a new administration assumes office after the May general polls.
</P>
<P>
The central bank last week got a 750-million-dollar loan from a
consortium of 15 foreign banks. The proceeds of the club loan
would be remitted to the central bank on April 8.
</P>
<P>
The government also completed its issuance of 500 million
Eurobonds to the international market last Friday in London in
another bid to boost its GIR, which has dropped to 9.3 billion
dollars last month.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has asked the government to
increase its GIR to 12 billion dollars this year, which is
equivalent to about 1.9 months worth of imports.
</P>
<P>
The GIR refers to the foreign-denominated assets of the central
bank like gold, currencies, equities and deposits with foreign
banks and government securities which are used to pay for the
country's imports.

<HEADLINE> Belgians Plow Back to Tie Dutch in Davis Cup Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Belgium plowed back to
equal footing with the Netherlands in their Davis Cup World Group
first-round tie on Sunday after Filip Dewulf won the first of the
reverse singles.
</P>
<P>
The equalizing match, that came after both sides changed horses
in the middle of stream after the day's doubles rubber, turned out
to be more like a morale-booster.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's reserve Christophe van Garsse led the tie-breaking
fifth match against Sjeng Schalken with scores at 6-4, 6-4 and 3-6.
</P>
<P>
The match was called off due to darkening daylight and drizzle
and is scheduled to resume on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian-Dutch tie was first delayed by rain on Friday and
then match was interfered with gusts of wind and light rain on
Saturday, forcing organizers to pack the doubles and reverse
singles into a busy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf, ranked 54th on the ATP tour, gave the weekend home
crowd something to cheer about as he routed Dutch substitute John
van Lottum 6-4, 6-0 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Van Lottum was playing in place of Dutch Davis Cup ace Jan
Siemerink who earlier won a singles match and the doubles rubber
together with Jacco Eltingh.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires in Southern Philippines Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires ranging on a southern
Philippine island for weeks have been put under control by fire
fighters with the help of helicopters and cloud-seeding aircraft,
a Philippine newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires, which were first spotted March 15 by a
military aircraft, had ravaged about 20,000 hectares of grassland
and forests in Palawan province, killing three people and
displacing some 125 families.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from Palawan Governor Salvador Socrates, the
Manila Times said most of the forest fires on Palawan island were
under control.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 50 separate fires that erupted in the Palawan
mountains in the past two weeks, only a few are still burning and
most of them are only surface fires.
</P>
<P>
According to Socrates, only the previous year's second-growth
trees were destroyed by the fires but the province's virgin
forests are intact.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department estimated agricultural and property
losses in the province at 480 million pesos (12.6 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, forest fires in the provinces of Benguet, Antique,
Negros Occidental and Davao del Sur are still raging.
</P>
<P>
The government will hold Monday a conference with
representatives from other countries in Southeast Asia to
determine the form of assistance that could be extended to the
Philippines in fighting the forest fires.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Plans to Use More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region plans to use 168 million U.S. dollars in
overseas investment this year.
</P>
<P>
An official document shows the total investment includes 128
million U.S. dollars in overseas loans and 40 million U.S. dollars
in direct foreign investment, 33 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, which borders eight countries including Russia and
India, reported a combined import and export volume of 6.2 billion
U.S. dollars in the last five years, with imports growing an
average 6.9 percent each year to reach 3 billion U.S. dollars for
the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Xinjiang has accounted for more than
one-fourth of China's cotton output in the last four years and has
an estimated 2.4 billion tons of proven oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The central government of China has during recent years
increased its support for economic growth in the central and
western parts of the country, directing to those areas more than
60 percent of the loans granted by international financial
institutions and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
Experts from authoritative departments believe that the market
potential of central and western China, Xinjiang in particular,
will be considerably greater than that of the eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
As China's state-owned enterprise reform enters a critical
stage, businesses in Xinjiang need more overseas investment and
advanced technology and management expertise for enterprise
restructuring and renovation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Xinjiang has also beefed up its effort to
attract overseas capital and improve its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, Xinjiang has, through the launching of
economic and trade fairs, signed 815 cooperative projects with
overseas investors, with actual utilized overseas investment
totaling more than 1.15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has poured into China in huge amounts since
the country launched a market economy drive in the late
1970s. However, Xinjiang and many other interior Chinese provinces
and regions used to be largely neglected by overseas investors
because of their geographical location and a shortage of
preferential policies to attract overseas investment.

BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Johan Museeuw of host Belgium won
Sunday's Tour des Flandres World Cup classic cycling race for a
record-tying third time in 6 hours 47 minutes 41 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Museeuw, who also won the tour in northwestern Belgium back in
1993 and 1995, became one of the four riders who have won the race
three times in its 82-year history.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Belgian averaged 40.77 kilometers an hour for
the 269-kilometer race from Bruges to Meerbeke, the second on this
year's circuit after the Milan-San Remo race.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion pedalled away from the leading pack
after 30 kilometers, opening up a 30-second lead on a climb
through the town of Tenbosse, and building a 57-second gap with
five kilometers to go from the chasing pack.
</P>
<P>
At 46 seconds behind were Italy's Stefano Zanini who finished
fourth in the previous World Cup race and another Belgian Andrei
Tchmil. The former Russian cyclist finished fifth in the
Milan-San Remo World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Fourth and fifth places went to Emmanuel Magnien of France and
Peter van Pegegem from Belgium. Magnien was runner-up at the
Milan-San Remo race.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls Mubarak on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had telephone conversation with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak Sunday to seek Egypt's help in breaking the stalemate in
the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the call to extend greetings to Mubarak for the
upcoming Muslim Greater Bairam which begins on Tuesday, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Mubarak on the current situations in the peace talks
and urged him to persuade Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat to be more flexible in the negotiations on
Israel's troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Palestinian side would agree to
begin as soon as possible the final status talks after Israel
finishes the troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's move is believed to be aimed at soothing the
strained ties between the two countries due to the deadlock in the
peace process. Egypt has voiced its dissatisfaction with Israel's
hardline policy, which it has accused of stalling the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The current standstill in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
lies in the scope of Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has said to accept in principle a United States peace
plan calling on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West
Bank. But Israel has said the plan is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has also urged the U.S. to make public its plan in a
bid to exert pressure on Israel to stop footdragging in the
proposed troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone conversation, Netanyahu again denied that
Israel had any involvement in the death of Hamas bomb maker Muhi
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or Islamic Resistance Movement, has accused Israel of
killing Sharif and vowed to avenge his death by launching terror
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Starr Under Pressure to End Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr is being urged by the White House and its allies to end his
four-year inquisition of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Following this week's dismissal of Paula Jones's sexual
harassment lawsuit, White House advisers went on morning
television Sunday to argue that the decision by Arkansas Judge
Susan Webber Wright, a Republican appointee, vindicated Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Starr's investigation began as an inquiry into the failed
Whitewater land deal in Arkansas in the early 1980s, but has
expanded to include accusations that Clinton urged former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky to lie under oath about their alleged
affair.
</P>
<P>
White House adviser Rahm Emanuel said Starr's investigation
"reeks of politics... seethes politics out of every pore." He told
NBC's "Meet The Press" that Americans want less, not more
information from Starr.
</P>
<P>
On ABC's "This Week," his White House colleague Paul Begala
suggested Starr had a major conflict of interest because he
continues his private legal work for major corporations, including
some that are fighting the administration.
</P>
<P>
Begala said, Starr is "working voluminous hours for big
tobacco, General Motors and Meineke Mufflers. Normally, a
distinguished counsel would set aside their outside interests."
</P>
<P>
White House communications director Anne Lewis told CNN's "Late
Edition" that Clinton's political opponents "cannot best him on
the field of ideas" and have used right-wing millionaires to fund
campaigns that smear the president's personal life.
</P>
<P>
Paula Jones' lawyers said their client might appeal Wright's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
John Whitehead, president of the right-wing Rutherford
Institute that is paying Jones' legal bills, told "Fox News
Sunday," "My opinion is the... institute really wants to appeal
this case." But he said Jones must decide for herself how another
possible two years of legal action might affect her family.
</P>
<P>
Donavan Campbell, Jones's Texas-based attorney, told "This
Week" he had submitted enough evidence to show Jones' suffered job
discrimination and a hostile work environment after she rebuffed
Clinton, but, "the judge just disagreed with us."
