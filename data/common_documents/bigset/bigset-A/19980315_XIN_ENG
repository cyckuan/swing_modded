<HEADLINE> EU Pressing World Cup Organizing Committee Over Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert is still pressing the French
Organizing Committee (CFO), the body responsible for distributing
World Cup football match tickets, to free up more seats for
non-French fans.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting Thursday between CFO representatives and
officials of the European Commission, the EU's executive body, the
commissioner told the European Parliament in Strasbourg that the
organizers were still dragging their feet over his calls to allocate
the remaining 110,000 unsold tickets to supporters from other EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the EU executive might decide to send a formal
"statement of objections" to the seat allocation system if the CFO
did not bow to pressure by early in the week beginning March 16.
</P>
<P>
Commission competition officials have been in talks with the CFO
for several weeks over complaints that the ordering method
established for individual fans to obtain match tickets to the
French World Cup discriminates against non-French citizens.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive believes that the CFO is abusing its dominant
market position with its distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically the commission may impose fines for such breaches
of community law, but officials have hitherto been playing down the
punitive options and seeking a practical solution to the problem,
according to an informed EU source.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert suggested to the parliament's plenum Thursday that the
"wise thing to do" would now be to reserve the still-unallocated
110,000 tickets exclusively for non-French customers since France
had already absorbed 37 percent of the total seats available.
</P>
<P>
"We want to compensate -- as far as it is still possible -- for
the discrimination already suffered by the other European
countries," the commissioner told the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the CFO still wants to be able to sell them to
all-comers, including French enquirers.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Visits U.S. on Arafat's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official said
Saturday that it was upon Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
request that King Hussein of Jordan was paying an official visit
to the United States starting from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked for the king's interference in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks that had been stalled since March
1997 due to the Israeli government's hardline policy, Jordan's
Deputy Prime Minister for Services and Minister of Information
Abdullah Nsour told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Upon the Palestinian leader's demand, Hussein would use his
"good offices" with U.S. President Bill Clinton in a bid to
breathe new life into the Middle East peace process which was now
facing many difficulties, he added.
</P>
<P>
The king and Clinton are scheduled to hold talks in Washington
on March 19, Nsour said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein will reiterate Jordan's stand that the peace process
should be put back on track through honoring the signed agreements
between the Israelis and Palestinians, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's visit came after he concluded a six-day Arab tour
which included talks with the leaders of Egypt, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan paid visits to Ramallah, West Bank and Tel
Aviv on Monday and Tuesday for talks with Palestinian and Israeli
officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hussein will also exert efforts to procure more
U.S. aid for Jordan. The U.S. aid for the kingdom in the fiscal
year of 1998 is estimated at around 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been an active mediator in the Middle East peace
process. It had helped hammer out the Hebron accord between the
Palestinians and Israelis at the beginning of last year, under
which Israel promised to evacuate most of the occupied land in the
West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Declares Indian Official Persona-non-grata </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
Saturday declared P.N. Nair, an official of the Indian High
Commission, persona-non-grata in the wake of a spate of terrorist
bombings in the country, which have claimed the lives of many
innocent persons.
</P>
<P>
"P.N. Nair was found indulging in activities incompatible with
his official status," said a press release issued by the Foreign
Office Saturday night, adding that he has been asked to leave
Pakistan within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Deputy High Commissioner was summoned to the Foreign
Office on Saturday and told that the government of Pakistan had
incontrovertible evidence of the involvement of P.N. Nair in acts
of espionage and subversion, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Deputy High Commissioner was further told that
Indian intelligence agencies were actively sponsoring acts of
sabotage and terrorism in Pakistan, which had not only led to
tragic loss of life but were also a blatant violation of the U.N.
Charter and international norms proscribing terrorism, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, the release said that a strong protest had
been lodged by Pakistan with the government of India at the
organized and symptomatic campaign of terrorism launched by Indian
intelligence agencies against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also briefed heads of the missions representing
the five Permanent Members of the U.N. Security Council on Indian
sponsored terrorist acts in Pakistan and called for universal
condemnation, the release said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Transportation
Omar Miskawi Saturday denied Israeli reports on secret talks
between Lebanese and Israeli officials, Egypt's Voice of the Arabs
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is in no need to have secret talks with Israel,"
Miskawi told the Cairo-based radio, adding that Lebanon and
Syria will hold consulations in Damascus later Saturday on the
latest developments in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
As for the Israeli proposal on implementing U.N. Resolution 425
in return for security safeguards, Miskawi said that Lebanon has
not received anything in this regard whether directly or
indirectly.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon still insists on the necessity of implementing
U.N. Resolution 425 unconditionally," he added.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted in 1978 after Israel first invaded
Lebanon calls on Israel to withdraw its forces from Lebanon
without delay.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recently that
Israeli troops were prepared to withdraw from south Lebanon on
condition that Beirut cooperates on security arrangements in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985 to
protect its northern towns from across border attacks by Shiite
Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas fighting to end Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Launched in Zimbabwe to Fight Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Freedom From Hunger
Campaign (ZFFHC), together with the Ministry of Education, Sport
and Culture, Saturday launched a campaign to fight drug abuse
among school children.
</P>
<P>
The campaign called, Youth Against Drug Abuse, is aimed at
promoting awareness among youths, particularly students, on the
dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the campaign, youths will be encouraged to speak out on
drug abuse and find ways of preventing themselves from abusing
drugs and live healthy life-styles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony here, ZFFHC Executive
Director Joyce Chikara said her organisation would facilitate
various anti-drug programs that include launching awareness and
educational campaigns through quiz competitions, essay writing,
drug forums, poetry and dramas.
</P>
<P>
''Drugs have been drafted into the lives of innocent and
unsuspecting youths under the guise of pleasure, relief of
boredom, prescriptions of courage prestige and the in-thing
syndrome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
She said researches carried out between 1990 and 1994 in
secondary schools in Harare and other places showed a disturbing
prevalence of the use of tobacco, alcohol, inhalants and cannabis
by students.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor of Harare Alderman Edward Mapuranga urged local
authorities, the government, non-governmental organisations and
the private sector to work together to resolve the problem which
he said, is destroying family ties and derailing production in
industry and commerce.

<HEADLINE> Spain Retaliates Against EU Production Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain has "totally rejected" the
production quota of olive oil set for it by the European
Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive body, in the
commission's draft proposals to reform the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the quota, Spain will only be allowed to produce
600,000 tons of olive oil per annum for the next three years. The
figure only constitutes 60 percent of Spain's capacity, according
to European Report, a newsletter published in Brussels Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive is expected to unveil its proposals for the
next wave of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on March 18,
including a draft regulation on the Common Market Organization for
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
Whereas before the olive oil quota was given as an EU total,
the commission's proposals due to be published on March 18 will
introduce the concept of Maximum Guaranteed Quotas (MGQ) on a
national basis.
</P>
<P>
Under the MGQ system, savings on small producers' aid and
consumption aid will be translated into tonnage and distributed
appropriately among the member states involved.
</P>
<P>
Thus Ita will probably be awarded 501,172 tons, Greece 339,038
tons, Portugal 43,915 tons and France 3,065 tons, bringing the EU
total to 1,562,400 tons.
</P>
<P>
Barring the largest producer, Spain, the Mediterranean
countries are by and large satisfied with their potential quotas.
</P>
<P>
When the commission's proposal is unveiled on March 18, these
countries would potentially have had a blocking vote of 30, enough
to sink the draft regulation.
</P>
<P>
However, the maneuver of converting the EU maximum quota to
specific national MGQs may have the effect of breaking up the
possible alliance, thereby increasing the likelihood of success of
reforming this stubborn sector.
</P>
<P>
Spain produced 947,000 tons of oil last year, over a third more
than it will be allowed next year. In view of the disparity,
Spanish Agriculture Minister Loyola de Palacio said the "fair"
guaranteed maximum quantity should be 781,200 tons.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said that the extra
oil being consumed in Northern countries was being offset by a
falling demand in producer countries, namely Spain, Portugal and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The commission believes that 600,000 tons is justified,
considering that "there is currently a stock of 180,000 tons of
olive oil in the EU that can't be sold."
</P>
<P>
Spain has retaliated by claiming that it can sell the extra oil
on world markets, where demand is slowly but surely increasing.

LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers holding a two-day informal meeting in Edinburgh Saturday
dismissed the idea of kicking Yugoslavia out of this year's
football World Cup finals as a sanction on Yugoslavia over the
Kosova crisis.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen, who is attending

football team if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic failed to
open talks with Kosovans on the autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany all
raised objections to the move.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told a news conference
that a World Cup ban was not within the competence of the EU while
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said political sports
boycotts had not produced the desired results in the past.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said that the idea had
been dropped by the six-nation Contact Group at its meeting in
London last Monday.

But the meeting urged Milosevic to open negotiations or face
further sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Heralds Changes in Iran's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Saturday heralded major changes in the country's economic
management system, the evening daily Etelaat reported.
</P>
<P>
"We should reconsider our economic management, both in
domestic and foreign fields," Khatami said in an interview with
the state-run television, which would be broadcast later Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on the government's plans on how to change
the country's economic management system, but underlined the
importance of competition to spur creativity in the economic
sector.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his government was intent on
invigorating economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
He assured the nation that the government would create
stability and security for investments and production, and through
boosting investment security, it would encourage private
investment in the stimulus projects.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, government spokesman Ataollah Mohajerani
announced that the government has decided to ease its control
over state-own companies and would transfer state-owned companies
to private and cooperative sectors.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed economic issues as the most urgent ones facing
the country, saying that "we can not achieve desirable progress in
political and cultural fields without a balanced economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government attached special attention to
economic issues, saying that over one third of the government's
high-level meetings focused on economic issues since the
government came to power last August.
</P>
<P>
Despite all kinds of problems the country is facing, Khatami
expressed optimism over the future of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
With a sharp reduction of oil incomes in 1997 due to oil price
drops, the Iranian government was facing some serious economic
problems such as budget deficit, high inflation, unemployment and
price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian people expected Khatami to make major economic
reforms to improve their economic status following the
government's achievements in its foreign policies, particularly
after the improvement of relations with regional states and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Economists here hold that Khatami's government would focus its
efforts on encouraging investments of the private sectors in
non-oil fields in order to reduce the country's dependence on oil
incomes.

<HEADLINE> New Lebanese Group Launches Attack on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A newly-established Lebanese
anti-Israeli group Saturday launched its first attack on Israeli
forces to commemorate 20 years of Israeli occupation, the
official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Lebanese Brigades of Resistance to Israeli
Occupation (LBRIO) said one of its units early Saturday morning
attacked an Israeli post inside its occupied south Lebanon with
heavy guns and missiles.
</P>
<P>
The assault destroyed the post's artillery emplacement and
some infrastructure and wounded some Israeli soldiers, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that other two units also took part in the attacks on
Israeli posts on the edge of the occupied security zone.
</P>
<P>
The LBRIO, founded last November by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, also announced that from Saturday on,
it formally entered the battle field to resist Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah had said the
aim to set up the LBRIO is to make it possible for the largest
number of people to participate in the struggle against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the declared aim to protect its
northern towns and villages from cross-border guerrillas attack,
Lebanese anti-occupation resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been continuing in the south.

OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal government
had a surplus of 3.3 billion dollars (2.3 billion U.S. dollars)
for the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, said reports
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus represents a 10.7 billion dollar turnaround from a
deficit of 7.3 billion dollars reported for the first 10 months of
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Rising revenue, falling program spending and lower interest
rates helped engineer the turnaround, according to the Finance
Department.
</P>
<P>
Compared with a year earlier, government revenues were up 6.2
billion dollars to 119.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, spending was off 3.4 billion dollars to 79.5
billion dollars, and debt charges were down 1 billion dollars to
36.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The surplus, which was forecast in February's budget, will
allow the government to increase spending, cut taxes and balance
the budget for this fiscal year, which ends this month.

forces sowing terror in parts of the northwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
In issuing slanderous and baseless allegations that the
Rwandan army has massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians, Amnesty
International "is serving the interests of those who decimated up
to one million people in 1994," the army spokesman Emmanuel
Ndahiro told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International released a press statement on Friday in
which it accused the army of killing several hundreds of
civilians for the January-February period.
</P>
<P>
Reports published by Amnesty International since the Rwandan
Patriotic Front took over power in 1994, have always been
characterized by bias and tendentious allegations which throw
doubt on its commitment to the defense of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty seems to be another hand of the insurgency and
therefore is pushing the arguments and the agenda of the
criminals who are continuing the genocide," Ndahiro observed,
accusing Amnesty International of being the mouthpiece of Hutu
hardliners.
</P>
<P>
For Rwandan authorities, it is no surprise that Amnesty
International is making up new reports shortly before the visit
by the U.S. President Bill Clinton later this month.
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty International is part of international lobbies
championing the cause, if any, of diehard Hutu extremists,"
Ndahiro alleged.
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unacceptable that at a time some people are
trying to associate with Rwandans in the process of recovery from
the aftermath of the genocide, Amnesty International is busy
mud-slinging the Rwandan government," he noted.

<HEADLINE> East Africans Urged to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian Minister of
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Saturday called on
east Africans to strive to bring about political, economic and
social development in the area.
</P>
<P>
In his message to mark the second anniversary of the East
African Cooperation, Jakaya Kikwete, who is also the current
chairman of the Permanent Tripartite Commission, told a cocktail
evening party in Arusha, north Tanzania, that great success has
been recorded in a number of objectives set out by the EAC over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The three member states of EAC, namely Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda, have laid down a strong foundation for steering the
cooperation to greater heights of prosperity in accordance with
the EAC Development Strategy 1997-2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged the private sector to play an active
role in the realization of a single market and the investment in
the area.
</P>
<P>
"Our governments are committed to create a favourable economic
environment to facilitate the role of the private sector,"
Kikwete pledged.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Expects Resumption of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has said that there are possibilities that
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash would be brought back to the
negotiating table, Cyprus News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that this depends very much on the position
the U.N. Security Council and Europe will adopt.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks in an interview with London Greek
Radio before the upcoming visit to the region by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Advisor for Cyprus,
Diego Cordovez.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez has announced in New York that he will travel to
Cyprus next Tuesday for talks with two Cypriot communities'
leaders on resumption of the bicommunal negotiations. He will
also visit Athens and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said if Denktash does not seriously consider the
appeal of the U.N. Security Council, then the next step would be
both the U.N. secretary-general and the Security Council to
consider whether they can continue the U.N. chief's mission
of good offices.
</P>
<P>
They will also have to consider what measures should be taken
against the Turkish Cypriot side, if it does not respond
positively.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Friday expressed concern over the
"high level of tension" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Abdoulie Momodou Sallah of Gambia, who chaired a
Security Council meeting Friday, said the members of the council
call upon both parties to take practical steps necessary to
move the negotiating process forward in an effective manner.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Cyprus problem is entering a phase in which
Denktash cannot any longer declare he will not negotiate unless
the U.N.-led peace talks are held between two "independent
states", as the Turkish Cypriot leader has said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash announced recently that the Turkish Cypriots will
not participate in the U.N.-led peace negotiations and Cyprus'
accession talks with the European Union (EU) unless his breakaway
state unilaterally declared in 1983 in Turkish-occupied northern
Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-led peace talks between the two
communities' leaders were held last summer, but the talks ended
in failure due to Denktash's refusal of further negotiations
following EU decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has ordered suspension of bicommunal contacts since
last December in retaliation to the EU Luxembourg summit's
reaffirmation of its decision to start accession talks with
Cyprus on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third in the wake of a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 24 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- About 2.8 million people
in Tanzania are at the risk of contracting the malaria epidemic,
according to a report by the Ministry of Health and the World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Guidelines for Epidemic Preparedness for
Malaria in Tanzania," says that 10 percent of the country's
population are suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
The report was made available here Friday at the start of a
10-day workshop on epidemic preparedness and control of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, jointly organized by the Ministry of Health and
the WHO, is being attended by district medical and health
officials from 20 districts in 10 regions.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss guidelines for preparedness for
malaria in Tanzania and exchange experience in handling the
epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
They will also make trips to selected villages where they will
have practical training such as spraying insecticide.
</P>
<P>
Malaria may break out in the regions of Mbeya, Iringa, Dodoma,
Singida and Kagera, Kigoma, Kilimanjaro, Tanga, Arusha, among
others, the workshop was told.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 10,110 Tanzanians contracted malaria,
2,281 of which died of the communicable disease, statistics
indicated.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Warm-up in Relations With Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid increasing signs of improved
relations with Sudan, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Saturday voiced pleasure over the recent detente between the two
Nile neighbors, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy with the amelioration in Cairo-Khartoum ties
which are proceeding very positively," Moussa told reporters after
receiving a copy of credentials of new Sudanese Ambassador to
Egypt Ahmed Abdel Halim Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will hold talks with his Sudanese counterpart Mustafa
Ismail in Cairo on March 23 on the sidelines of meetings of the
Arab League Council, the Sudanese ambassador told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Goweili met with Sudanese
Minister of Trade Osman el-Hadi, who is now visiting here.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed ways of increasing the volume of trade
exchange between the two countries, said Goweili after the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sudanese minister proposed purchasing new
Egyptian railway coaches and equipment as part of a plan to
upgrade the Sudanese railways.
</P>
<P>
After a hiatus of more than three years, Egypt resumed the
river Nile navigation from the Egyptian High Dam to the Sudanese
port of Halfa in mid-February, a move hailed by both sides as a
sign of improving relations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt accused Sudan of sheltering Egyptian militants bent on
installing a strict Islamic state in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Cairo said Khartoum supported an attempt to kill President
Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in 1995. Sudan denied the charge and
blasted Egypt for letting in members of Sudanese opposition
groups.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Reach Agreement on Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers meeting in the Scottish capital Edinburgh Saturday
reached agreement on opening accession talks with Cyprus after
France moved its hurdle out of the way.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the final press conference after two-day informal
talks, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose country is the
current EU president, said, "We now have agreement on how to
proceed with Cyprus at the meeting of the 31st (March)," when the
15-nation bloc will kick off its planned accession talks with
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The British presidency proposal does not make a joint
Greek-Turkish Cypriot delegation a condition for negotiations, nor
does it make the resolution of the division of Cyprus an explicit
condition for accession.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, French President Jacques Chriac said that the
EU should freeze its accession talks with Cyprus if the divided
island failed to form a joint delegation for the membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece had also threatened to block the entire EU
accession process if Cyprus was frozen out of the EU enlargement
process.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to meet the French concerns, Britain amended the
EU opening statement as "our objective remains a united Cyprus"
instead of saying "our objective means the accession of a united
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine gave the French green
light to the EU agreement early Saturday after having an emergency
telephone consultation with top French leaders on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Vedrine noted that it was "neither desirable nor
realistic" that Cyprus be admitted while it was still divided,
since that would only reinforce the division of the island.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos voiced his country's
satisfaction to the agreement by saying, "It is now a reality in
the text that the beginning of the negotiations, the conduct of
the negotiations, the conclusion of the negotiations and
ratification will proceed in the same way for all countries."
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's session, the EU foreign ministers also discussed
fresh EU efforts in revitalizing the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is due to start a Middle East tour from Sunday, told
the press conference, "There was unanimous agreement that we
should make clear that we do not support expansions of
settlements."
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary also noted that he had no
intention of canceling his planned visit to the Har Homa site in
Arab East Jerusalem despite strong opposition to this particular
visit in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I should make that clear in the course of my visit by visiting
Har Homa," Cook said, adding the EU minister supported a British
presidency initiative of building confidence in the Middle East
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Debt Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada's net indebtedness to
foreigners is increasing, hitting a record 339 billion dollars
(237 billion U.S. dollars) last year, said a report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, foreign debt is shrinking as a proportion of
the country's gross domestic product (GDP), according to the
Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada figures showed that Canada's gross liability
to foreigners -- foreign investment in Canada -- reached 889
billion dollars at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
And Canadian investment in foreign countries was 550 billion
dollars. The difference between the two was 339 billion dollars,
up 2.5 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
But thanks to strong growth in the Canadian economy, foreign
debt now occupies a smaller share of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, foreign debt was 39 percent of its GDP,
compared with a recent peak of 45 percent in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Hold Joint Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Armed forces from the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states began a joint military exercise
Saturday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a bid to further
strengthen cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
The GCC joint exercise, code-named "Pennisula Shield-6," is the
sixth since it was launched in 1983, the UAE's official Wam news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, which are being held under a decision by the GCC
defense ministers at the end of last year, are aimed at "improving
combat capabilities of GCC troops...and acquainting the troops
with the most advanced arms," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It gave no further details of the war game, but said earlier
that "a number of naval, ground and air forces" and GCC's
collective troops "Pennisula Shield," established in early
1990, were involved.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a political, economic and defense alliance formed in
1981 groups the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and
Oman.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, the regional bloc's members have sought to
improve their self-defense capabilities through holding military
exercises and purchasing advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the GCC defense ministers approved two military
projects including setting up a common radar network for naval and
air surveillance and an early warning system covering all the GCC
states, as well as raising the strength of the "Pennisula Shield"
from 4,000 to 25,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, due to their relatively limited human resources, the
GCC states still remain heavily reliant on foreign military
presence to protect their security.
</P>
<P>
The United States deploys some 20,000 troops and 30 combat and
support ships in the region.

<HEADLINE> E. African Countries Share Lot in Cooperation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) - The East African
Cooperation (EAC) nations have achieved tremendous progress in
confidence building and policies harmonization on a wide range of
sectors, the EAC Executive Secretary said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Francis Muthaura, the EAC Executive Secretary, in his
statement to mark the second anniversary of EAC, said that a high
consensus has been reached among the member states Tanzania,
Kenya and Uganda in regional integration, mutual benefit and
equitable development strategy.
</P>
<P>
"The convertibility of the currencies of the member states
has, for example, harmonized macro-economic framework and
promoted the movement of goods, services and factors of
production with the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura, whose secretariat is based in Tanzania's northern
city of Arusha, said that a tripartite agreement on avoidance of
double taxation has been put into practice and a tripartite road
transport agreement and an inland waterway transport agreement
will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"These measures have boosted cross border trade and investment
in the region," he said, adding that plans have been made to pool
and share resources in the energy, transport, communications and
others sectors.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed upgrading of the cooperation into a treaty
level, Muthaura said he expected the treaty will give a new
impetus to institutionalization of a deeper and wider political
and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary disclosed that a donors' two-day
meeting, co-sponsored by the European Union and the World Bank,
was planned on May 25 in Arusha, hoping donors will fund an
ambitious 4.5 billion U.S. Dollars road network in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, a lot still remains to be done," Muthaura noted, "but
all indications show that we are moving on the right track on the
base of the gains over the past two years."

KUWAIT CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Mohammad Kharrazi Saturday expressed satisfaction in Riyadh, the
capital of Saudi Arabia, with the progress made in the
Iranian-Saudi ties, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who arrived in the Saudi capital Saturday for a short
visit, said upon arrival that the leaders of the two countries are
convinced that bilateral ties must be boosted on the basis of the
mutual understanding at the Islamic and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
He also delivered a letter from Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami to Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz. But he declined to reveal the
content of the letter.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian president Akbar Rafsanjani paid a two-week visit
to the kingdom earlier this month, during which he held wide-scale
talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on boosting bilateral
ties and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two countries agreed to set up a joint
committee aimed at looking into means to upgrade bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two largest Gulf oil producers strained
following the Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979. However,
bilateral ties have been warming up since last year when Iran
started to make initiatives to reconciliate with the Gulf Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi visited Saudi Arabia last November as part of a Gulf
tour to deliver invitations for the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) summit held in Tehran last December.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister is scheduled to leave for Doha,
Qatar, Sunday to attend the 25th session of the foreign ministers
of the OIC due for March 15-19.

JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A man was seriously hurt
Saturday in an explosion in the northern Israeli town of
Afula, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the explosion occurred suddenly when the
man was examining a cardboard box, which he spotted in a
public park outside the bus station of the town.
</P>
<P>
In the explosion, the man lost both hands and his eyes
were also injured.

Police suspected that Palestinian terrorists placed the box
with explosive in the park. Afula is only 10 kilometers away
from the Palestinian city of Jenin, where terrorist cells have
been uncovered in the past.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened at a time of tense situation in
the territories after three Palestinian workers were shot
death at an Israeli check point near the West Bank city of
Hebron.

<P>
Following the shooting incident, scores of Palestinians have
been injured in the clashes with Israeli soldiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid Saturday accused the United States of meddling with
other countries' internal affairs when it brands Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein as a "war criminal."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid was speaking to reporters a day after the
U.S. Senate voted to urge the creation of a United Nations
Tribunal to try Saddam Hussein as an international war criminal.
</P>
<P>
"Such matters which constitute interference in domestic affairs
are categorically rejected," he said before leaving here for Doha,
Qatar, to take part in the meetings of the foreign ministers of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) due to open on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his pre-departure statement, Abdel-Meguid said he will seize
the opportunity of the OIC meetings to push for a solution
to the Libya-West dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader will invite the Seven-Man Committee of Arab
countries on the Libya crisis to coordinate stances prior to a
U.N. Security Council meeting on the Libya case in New York on
March 20.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Arab countries have to capitalize on a ruling the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) made in favor of Libya and
work toward lifting sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
The ICJ 15-member bench decided on February 27 that it has the
jurisdiction to try the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a Pan-Am plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed air, arms and diplomatic
embargoes against Libya in 1992 to back up the U.S. and British
demands to try them in either country, which Libya refused.

The statement, published in the memory of the 20th anniversary

Beirut's struggle to take over the occupied area, Wam said.
</P>

Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in south

<HEADLINE> Farmers Reassured by Policy to Prolong Land Contract System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the birthplace of
China's rural reform voice their support to the policy of
extending farmland contract system for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The message from farmers in Xiaogang Village, in Fengyang
County of east China's Anhui Province, was brought to the ongoing
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) by He
Chengguo, mayor of Chuzhou City which has jurisdiction over
Fengyang County.
</P>
<P>
In his Government Work Report, Premier Li Peng reiterated the
central government's policies on stabilizing the rural household
responsibility contract system with renumeration linked to
production and extending farmland contract term for another 30
years.
</P>
<P>
"The farmers feel reassured," NPC deputy He Chengguo said. He
had personally went to solicit opinions from farmers in the
Xiaogang village before he came to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The name of the Village has related most closely to China's
rural reform since an event that occurred there 20 years ago when
farmers lived during the period of the People's Commune.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, needy and farmers in Xiaogang divided farmland
owned by the collective among individual households, with 18
elderly villagers fingerprinting on a certificate of security.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the villagers were very pleased to get in one good
harvest after another.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and opening to
the outside world, summed up the experience of these villagers and
termed it as a "responsibility contract system with renumeration
linked to production", and then spread the system to other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The certificate with 18 red fingerprints on it is now being
kept in the China History Museum in Beijing, giving evidence to
the first step of the country's reform.
</P>
<P>
The contract system brought about miraculous changes among
Chinese farmers. Despite grave natural disasters every year in
some places, there have been consecutive good harvests, with the
state having abundant grain reserves and and rural households
storing surplus grain.
</P>
<P>
According to NPC deputy Liu Shiming from central China's Henan
Province, where a large proportion of its population are engaged
in agriculture, there used to be absurdities spreading in his home
town that contracted farmland would be taken back and managed by
the collective. And many farmers had relaxed their efforts in
farming.
</P>
<P>
"Farmland is our lifeline and hope. If we farmers have our own
land to till, we're holding a stable rice bowl in our hands," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Li Bingliang, another NPC deputy from Hebei Province, north
China, said the contract system can be applied to either one
household with relatively low productivity or contractors doing
mechanized farming.
</P>
<P>
"The system remains the most popular among the farmers," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, NPC deputy Fang Zhaoxiang, deputy secretary of Anhui
Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) who
takes charge of agricultural affairs, said his province has for
the second time taken the lead in extending all farmers contract
farmland for another 30 years after the central government set
forth the policy.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session in Eyes of a Staffer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A welcome change has occurred in
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's highest legislative
body, said Guo Yongqing, who has served as a bulletin editor for
eight straight years.
</P>
<P>
During the First Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) in session here since early March, he can no longer
found any quiet "meeting sitters", in reference to any deputies
who just listen to others speak and do not utter a word themselves
during panel discussions, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
"When I worked for the NPC session for the first time in 1991,"
he recalled, "I felt at ease with my job since quite a number of
deputies simply do not speak at NPC panel discussions."
</P>
<P>
"But I was extremely busy in recent years, because a growing
number of deputies vied with each other to air their views and my
workload became increasing heavy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Guo sends recorded speeches of his delegation member to the
conference bulletin editing center before 11:00 PM every day. And
then its editing staff will print these speeches at night and hand
them out to every NPC delegation early next morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he acknowledged, there has also been a drastic
change with regard to the contents of deputies' speeches.
</P>
<P>
"During the Seventh NPC session, one third of the deputies
briefed the session merely on the general situation of their own
work units and few related the work of their units to the
government work report submitted for discussion," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas at the current session, all deputies, including those
from among workers and farmers, have focused their attention on
such heated topics as institutional restructuring, development of
China's central and western regions and supervision over the
implementation of state laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Guo also pointed to an interesting change in the
opening remarks of deputies.
</P>
<P>
In the past, many began their talks with the remark, "I've come
here for the sole purpose of learning from my fellow deputies,"
and the word "learning" was used with the highest frequency.
</P>
<P>
Today, the introductory remarks have changed a great deal. Some
deputies started by simply saying, "I'll say something on behalf
of the people," while some others would say, "I want to make some
proposals" before elaborating on their main topics. A number of
impetuous deputies hit home right on the theme, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the mood in NPC session, changes have also been
reflected in the voices of deputies and looks on their faces. Guo
recalled that seven years ago, many read their prepared speeches
meticulously and in a solemn manner.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, "the ongoing session is alive with an
enthusiastic atmosphere with repeated applause and laughters," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Previously, when senior officials from government departments
come to join in panel discussions, deputies would discuss issues
in the related fields they take charge. For instance, if an
official from the Ministry of Fiance came, provincial and local
financial officials would naturally dwell on the relevant finance
topics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, even with the presence of the above mentioned
officials, deputies from China's rural areas may still deal with
financial matters while deputies who represent entrepreneurs, too,
can set forth proposals or suggestions on agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
The three reasons behind these changes, Guo said, are that NPC
deputies have a stronger sense of involvement in administration
and discussion of state affairs, NPC sessions have become more
democratic, and the market economy has helped broaden the vision
of NPC deputies.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes EU Foreign Ministers' Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
welcomed a Saturday agreement reached among European Union (EU)
foreign ministers on terms for opening accession negotiations with
Cyprus as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides commented on a local
private TV Sunday that the EU foreign ministers' accord helps
Cyprus overcome yet another barrier toward a smooth start of
accession negotiations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The informal EU foreign ministers' meeting in Edinburgh
unanimously decided that Cyprus-EU accession talks will begin as
scheduled, on March 31, even if Turkish Cypriots reject an offer
to join the Cyprus government's negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that accession negotiations will eventually
act as a leverage to make Turkey curb its intransigent stand,
which has reached its highest levels, and open the road for
Cyprus' reunification," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any retrogression or sign of weakness on the
part of the EU in using this leverage "would harm the interests of
the EU itself."
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the recent statements by Diego Cordovez, the
U.N. chief's special advisor for Cyprus, that the island's
accession course in a way complicates a Cyprus settlement,
Kasoulides expressed his disagreement.
</P>
<P>
"What the Security Council should do is to remain firm to its
decision that the direct peace talks on Cyprus should start from
the point they stopped in Glion, Switzerland, last August," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations between two
Cypriot communities' leaders were held last summer in U.S. and
Switzerland respectively, but they ended in failure due to Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's refusal of further negotiations
following a EU decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash announced recently that the Turkish Cypriots will not
participate in the U.N.-led peace negotiations and Cyprus'
accession talks with the EU unless his breakaway state is
recognized.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared the breakaway Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus in 1983, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have mainly failed in
their peace efforts in the past 24 years for reuniting the divided
island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation.

Rudolf Ropek from Czech Republic and Gunilla Svard from Sweden
came out temporary leaders respectively for the men's and women's
divisions after the fourth race of the 10-race orienteering series
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ropek finished the 3-kilometer race first with a time of 11
minutes and 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's Chris Terkelsen followed in the second place at 11:52

In the women's race, Sabrina Meister of Switzerland covered the
same course in 15:17, seven hundredth of a second ahead of
Norway's Hanne Staff. Another Norwegian Elisabeth Ingvaldsen came
in third with a time of 16:04.
</P>
<P>
Svard, who got disoriented midway in the race, finished a
disappointing 14th.
</P>
<P>
The race drew a total of 47 orienteers from 20 countries and
regions. The tour's six remaining races will be held in various
European cities from May to August.

<HEADLINE> 47 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 47 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the military
operations staged by the Turkish security forces over the past
three days in southeastern Turkey, an official statement said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of the Emergency Regional
Rule said that the security forces started the air and ground
military operations against the PKK militants in the Besteler and
Dereler regions of Sirnak province bordering Iraq on March 12.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three PKK rebels were killed during the first two-day
clashes between the government troops and the PKK guerrillas in
the regions, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that 24 PKK militants more had been shot dead in the
armed clashes in the same regions on Saturday evening and Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, three soldiers of the security also died in the
clashes over the past three days, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly called on the international community to
ban the PKK activities and accused neighboring countries of
deliberately aiding the outlawed organization.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war for
autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey, which has claimed
over 28,000 lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Erkal Bektas from Turkey's General Staff accused some
countries, especially Russia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Greece and Cyprus
of "continuous support to the PKK".
</P>
<P>
He said that "despite Ankara's massive efforts to curb the
terrorists activities, these countries have been supporting the
PKK".
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 or 3,000 PKK militants, who have sheltered
themselves in northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, often cross
into the Turkish territory from northern Iraq and attack military
and civilian targets in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Rockets On Course Towards League Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Army Rockets took a step
closer toward its fourth successive league title after troucing
Beijing Ducks 105-78 in the first leg of the best-of-three
semi-finals here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ducks chased the powerful Rockets hard in the first leg by
hitting six three-pointers but faded in the second, which
eventually turned out to be score sprees of the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
Chinese national center Wang Zhizhi and Li Nan scored a
game-high 29 points apiece for the Rockets while the Ducks' Zhang
Jindong led the game with five three pointers.
</P>
<P>
In paper the Ducks still have chances to advance into the
finals with two legs left but realistically only mirachels could
save them from being knocked out.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Hunters fought back from behind to beat the visiting
Shandong Flaming Bulls 70-63 in the other semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Flaming Bulls, who finished second in the regular season,
have the first half lead 37-33 evaporated by making several fatal
errors in the dying minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Pandas were pushed to the verge of relegation after
losing to Air Force Eagles 69-66, remaining winnless after three
rounds in the double round-robin playoffs for the ninth and tenth
places between the last four finishers of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang Lions suffered the same fate as the Pandas, flopping
to Zhejiang Squirrels 82-57.

<HEADLINE> Additional 150,000 Beijing Households to Use Natural Gas in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- About 150,000 Beijing households
will give up coal and begin using natural gas this year, pushing
the number of natural gas users in the capital to 700,000
households, or one-third of the city's total population, according
to Beijing's Public Utility Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's gas sources could not meet the demand for Beijing's
rapid development in recent years. More than 100,000 families are
waiting to hook up with natural gas every year.
</P>
<P>
Last September, natural gas from northwest China's Shaanxi and
Gansu provinces and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was transported
to Beijing. By the end of the year, more than 550,000 Beijing
households had become natural-gas users.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's Public Utility Bureau, more than 700
million cubic meters of natural gas will be transported to Beijing
from northwest China in 2000. And, by that time, Beijing's
natural-gas users will increase to one million households.
</P>
<P>
Seven hundred million cubic meters of natural gas can replace
1.8 million tons of coal, experts said, adding that the annual
emission of sulphur dioxide and dust will be reduced by 27,000
tons and 21,000 tons, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Co. to Launch Fund for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss financial co., Trigone
Capital Finance, will this May launch an investment fund for
Africa to mobilize investment capital into the continent's least
developed countries, the Zimbabwean News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fund is an outcome of a seminar organized by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the U.N.
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) last year to mobilize
the private sector to encourage foreign investment into least
developed countries on the continent.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Polycom, the world's leading
producer of equipment for audio and video conferences, presented a
newly developed product today in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The product, an advanced long-distance audio and video
telecommunications system in the world, introduces the Internet
into the system, which combines the functions of projection,
scanning, annotations and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
With its 2.5-kilogram video recorder-size view-station, it
enables users to keep focusing on the meetings rather than tuning
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
"China provides a huge potential market for our corporation's
new product, given its daily increasing foreign or domestic
cross-regional business and trade activities," said Jeff Hurmuses,
director-general of the Asia Pacific branch of Polycom today.
</P>
<P>
The corporation's products first entered the Chinese market
last year and constitute a 20 percent market share in the
Asia-Pacific region, he said, adding that the corporation will set
up a representative office in Shanghai by June.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Family Planning, Environmental Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today vowed
to curb environmental deterioration in the coming 15 years and
bring an obviously better ecological appearance to the country in
another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing reshuffle inside governmental bodies at all levels
must not weaken or even affect the efforts of family planning and
environmental protection, Jiang said at a high-profile meeting
concerning the country's work on family planning and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"Family planning and environmental protection are of vital
importance to sustainable economic growth while having a bearing
on the existence and development of our next generations," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a significant endeavor for us, not only in this century
but also in the coming 21st century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China has met the goals of controlling population growth for
eight straight years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The country also had a low rate of birth, death and population
growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Many local authorities have closed down small businesses which
consumed too much energy and produced heavy pollution.
 In addition, the environment near the Huaihe River has improved
after pollution-check efforts in recent years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, family planning and environmental protection are
strenuous and long-time jobs, he added. The country has a jumbo
population and a poor environment, which cannot be changed in a
short period, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The population growth has yet to be controlled in rural areas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, ecological disturbances and environmental
pollution still remain a factor in many areas, he said, even some
undergoing hazardous environmental deterioration, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The family planning policy in populous provinces,
poverty-ridden areas and among migrant people should be strictly
carried out, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on education and contraceptive measures, governmental
bodies should combine the policy with enhancing the economy, with
helping people get rich through honest labor and with developing
happy and harmonious families, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas especially should integrate birth control with
support to poor people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Various local authorities must prevent the environmental and
ecological balance from deteriorating, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials must properly deal with the relationship
between economic development and environmental protection. They
must not sacrifice the environment to short-term economic
increases, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Those serious environmental problems which do great harm to
people must be solved first, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pollution in some river valleys, regions and cities resulting
from harmful industries badly affect local residents' health, he
said. Any excuse for delaying overhauls and shutdowns must not be
considered, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
All localities must ensure that all businesses meet the
national standards for discharging pollutants, although the effort
might be arduous, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by state leaders such as Li Peng,
Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing.

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China must attach great
importance to family planning and environmental protection upon
which are based economic development, social progress and people's
happy lives, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), made the remarks at the meeting on family planning and
environmental protection held here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao,
Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The departments of family planning and environmental protection
have not been weakened but strengthened in the ongoing State
Council restructuring drive, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's restructuring will cut almost half of the
State Council's departments to raise government efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the move shows the central government is paying
great attention to family planning and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"China will go a long way and must work arduously to implement
its family planning policy, and no slight change will be allowed
to this fundamental policy which will keep focusing on rural and
migrating populations," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The family planning work should adapt itself to the market
economy, gradually making most people consciously adopt the means
of contraception, Li said, stressing that scientific research
should be strengthened to develop and spread contraceptive means
and medicine, which are scientific and convenient to use.

<TEXT>
<P>
As to environmental protection, Li said that equal attention
should be paid to both the prevention and treatment of
environmental pollution and the protection of the ecology, which
are of great significance for sustainable development and for
future generations. Governments at all levels should strive to do
a good job in environmental protection while trying to develop
local economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the governments should give priorities to the
environmental protection drive, stepping up pollution treatment
efforts in key regions and river valleys. The Huaihe River Valley
had initially reached its goal of all industrial polluting sources
meeting discharge standards early last year.
</P>
<P>
All industrial polluting sources in the Taihu Lake Valley
should reach discharge standards this year, with water-pollution
treatment efforts to be stepped up in the Liaohe and Haihe rivers,
Chaohu and Dianchi valleys, he said.
</P>
<P>
A group of obsolete resource- and energy-consumed or seriously
polluting equipment should be eliminated in the economic
restructuring drive, Li said, adding that companies which exceed
pollution standards and have no hope of being treated should be
closed down without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
Financial input should be increased for the development of
science and technology in the field of environmental protection,
he emphasized, adding that attention should be paid to the
adoption and application of technological fruits to rapidly
develop the environmental protection industry.
</P>
<P>
The state has formulated a large number of laws and regulations
concerning environmental protection, and focus should be shifted
to law enforcement, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting were Peng Peiyun, State Councillor
and minister of the State Family Planning Commission, and Song
Jian, State Councillor and head of the Environmental Protection
Committee of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Environment Issues Top NPC Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Activities of the ongoing session
of China's top law-making body show that Chinese lawmakers are
paying greater attention to the protection of resources,
environment and ecology amid rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
A common understanding reached by lawmakers and high-ranking
officials alike is that China must make concerted efforts to
protect the environment and natural resources and curb a worsening
of the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to officials handling motions for the First Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the current session
has received 830 motions, more than 120 of which concern
legislation on resources and environmental protection, next only
to economic matters in number.
</P>
<P>
The biggest number of motions calls for accelerated legislation
to bring under control pollution in rivers such as the Yangtze,
the Yellow river and the Huaihe river and put an end to ecological
worsening and soil erosion in the upper reaches of the Yellow
River and the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Air quality in cities is another concern among NPC deputies.
Many motions call for amendment to relevant laws to minimize
pollution from cars and coal burning. Many other motions concern
the construction of nature reserves and the protection of water
resources, energy, farming environment, and marine resources.
</P>
<P>
A hightened environmental awareness has also been evident at
group discussions attended by NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
Liu Benren, an NPC deputy, said: "The drying up of the Yellow
River in its lower section and serious pollution of the Huaihe
River have sounded alarm to the whole nation."
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also the boss of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Group,
urged prompt action to protect water resources in and along the
Yangtze to bring a clean river into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneur, together with managers of more than 30 large
enterprises, advocated clean production to minimize discharge of
polluting materials and industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Li Bo from Inner Mongolia put forward a proposal, urging
the central government to make resources and environmental
protection an important yardstick for assessing the performance of
officials.
</P>
<P>
Deputies expressed appreciation that, in his government work
report, Premier Li Peng for the first time says environmental
protection is to receive top priority for state funding in the
future, on a par with agriculture, forestry, water conservancy,
energy, transport and telecoms.
</P>
<P>
"This speaks of the determination of the government to protect
environment, ecology and resources and to pursue sustainable a
development," a deputy said.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion with deputies from Beijing, Li Peng reiterated
the importance of environmental protection, urging local
governments to put environmental protection on their work agenda
as an important item.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji at a group discussion called for
stopping tree cutting.
</P>
<P>
"People should become tree planters instead of tree cutters to
create happiness for our future generations," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 middle schools in
Beijing have started puberty classes with the help of experts from
Beijing's Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The class offers students information on sex, physiology and
psychology to help them form knowledgeable concepts of love,
marriage and family, said Liu Zhiyi, headmaster of a middle school.
</P>
<P>
Liu said more than 4,000 students in his school have received
puberty education. His school also has set up a psychological
consulting center.
</P>
<P>
Parents said their children understand more about their
physiological and psychological changes during puberty, and the
relationship between boys and girls are more harmonious.
</P>
<P>
The 13 middle schools in the Dongcheng District have included
puberty education in their research project, and many young
teachers were trained to give puberty classes.
</P>
<P>
Gu Siben, an official with Beijing Education Commission, said
they are encouraging more middle schools to offer puberty
education, and that teachers should be qualified.

<HEADLINE> Local Officials Support Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Some local officials attending
the ongoing session of China's top legislature as deputies say
they will not set obstacles for reform of the country's financial
system to protect local interests.
</P>
<P>
The new round of financial reform will free commercial banks
from being a coffer for central and local governments and enable
them to decide what projects to finance purely on the basis of
economic merits.
</P>
<P>
Under the former central planning system, bank loans tended to
go where the government directed, and local economies relied too
much on bank loans, which resulted in a rise of bad loans and poor
fund circulation for all the major state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Local officials concur that, without reform, banks will
continue to suffer from such problems, nor will they be able to
play their role as economic regulators.
</P>
<P>
With the market playing an increasingly important role in other
aspects of the economy, banks should likewise meet the needs of a
market economy, says Chai Songyue, Governor of Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
Instead of cutting off sources of funding for local economic
development, bank commercialization will instill new vitality into
further economic growth, he says.
</P>
<P>
"With less government interferences," Chai explains,"banks
will be able to provide loans in accordance with market rules,
thus helping to improve the economic structure."
</P>
<P>
Zhou Gongshun, deputy Party chief of Anqing city of Anhui
province, explains that commercialized banks will help prevent
redundant construction by financing only promising projects and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He admits that it will take some time for governments and
banks to get accustomed to a new financial system.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Guangda, Party chief of Zhuhai city in
Guangdong province, reform will help foster a good financial
environment.
</P>
<P>
"Well-run businesses won't lack bank loans, while the
government's responsibilities are to build an investment
environment and better serve businesses," he says.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Gang, governor of the Guangdong branch of the People's
Bank of China, the central bank, points out that reform also
requires commercial banks to set up a whole set of control systems
and to operate in accordance with financial laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Reform measures taken in the last few years have laid a
foundation for ongoing fundamental changes, he adds. "Government
interference in bank operation is getting less and less, and a
modern financial system in line with a socialist market economy is
taking shape gradually," he says.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Urged to Use Electricity As Main Energy Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A lawmaker today urged Beijing to
replace coal with electric power as the main source of energy for
heating and cooking, to put an end to air pollution in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC), China's top legislature, in session here since early March,
said Beijing has become one of the world's most polluted
metropolises because of its irrational energy consumption
structure.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing, which burns 30 million tons of coal each year for
heating and gas supply, is one of the top coal consumers in all
capital cities around the world," said Qu, who is also chairman of
the NPC Environment and Resources Protection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sulphur dioxide and smog released from coal burning have become
major causes of Beijing's worsening air pollution, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, Beijing should fund the construction of a
large thermal power plant in a big coalfield in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, which will supply clean electricity for
household heating and cooking in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has planned to enable one
million local families to use natural gas as main energy by the
year 2000. However, Qu held that China's annual gas resources are
limited and it is impossible to replace all coal consumption with
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
"The annual natural gas supply for Beijing will reach 1.5
billion cubic meters at most, which implies that there is still a
shortage of some 3 million tons," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He proceeded to advocate that all Chinese cities start to promote
the use of unleaded gasoline in local motor vehicles to curb air
pollution caused by auto exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has banned use of unleaded gasoline since January 1
this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cabinet Approves New Mossad Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet Sunday approved
the appointment of former Mossad deputy head Ephraim Halevy as new
Mossad director, and Northern Commander of Israel Defense Force
(IDF) Amiram Levine as its deputy.
</P>
<P>
This was announced after Sunday's cabinet meeting presided over
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The meeting also discussed
the tense situation in the Palestinian territories following the
Israeli soldiers' killing of three Palestinians on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mossad is Israel's state intelligence and spy organization. As
the new head, Halevy is in charge of managing the entire
organization, while Levine is responsible for operations and
special assignments.
</P>
<P>
On March 4, Netanyahu appointed Halevy as the Mossad head and
Levine as its deputy after the resignation of former Mossad head
Danny Yatom.
</P>
<P>
Yatom resigned on February 24 after the state-appointed
committee suggested that he be responsible for the failed
assassination attempt on Hamas (Islamic resistance movement)
leader Khaled Mashaal in Amman, Jordan, last September and last
month's arrests of Mossad agents in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Halevy was born in England in 1934 and immigrated to Israel
with his parents in 1948. He studied law at the Hebrew University
where he was active in religious activities.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Mossad in 1961. While he had served in the
operation division of the Mossad, most of his career was spent in
Tevel, the unit responsible for liaison and political work with
parallel groups in Switzerland, a center of international
diplomatic activities.
</P>
<P>
Halevy also was sent on many missions to forge ties with
countries with which Israel did not have formal diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, he was appointed deputy head of the Mossad, a post in
which he served for five years.
</P>
<P>
During this period, he was tapped by the then prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin as his special envoy to King Hussein of Jordan. As
such, he was one of the key players in paving the way for the
peace treaty between the two countries. Rabin also used him for
other special missions.
</P>
<P>
When Danny Yatom was appointed as Mossad head in 1996, Halevy
joined the foreign service to become Israel's ambassador to the
European Union (EU), based in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Heartland of Arctic Polluted, Scientists find </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The industrial pollutants have
penetrated into the heartland of the Arctic region, researchers
said here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the heavy metal element lead contained
in snow in the heartland of the Arctic Circle was caused by
industrial pollution, a group of Chinese scientists announced in a
new issue of Chinese Science Bulletin published today.
</P>
<P>
The research, conducted by a group with the Lanzhou Institute
of Glaciology and Cryopedology under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, also showed that lead pollution in the North Pole area
comes mainly from Eastern Europe, the central and far eastern
portions of Russia and western part of North America.
</P>
<P>
"Two air masses reaching the Arctic Ocean may be the main
source for the pollution," a researcher said.
</P>
<P>
The first air mass comes from Eastern Europe and central Russia
where industrial pollution is concentrated. The second air mass
brings pollutants from North America and Russia's far east region.
</P>
<P>
The study indicates that the lead isotopes in the heartland of
the Arctic matches that of the Eastern Europe and the western part
of North America, scientists noted.
</P>
<P>
"Such heavy metal elements as lead in snow is often used by
scientists as an indicator for air circulation, which
comprehensively reflects the time and intensity of pollution," a
researcher explained.
</P>
<P>
So far, according to researchers, scientific data on lead in
the heartland of the Arctic are very rare.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the research was based on snow samples
taken by China's first Arctic scientific expedition team in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Extremely strict pollution-preventing measures were taken
during the sampling, scientists said, and the whole laboratory
test process was conducted under an extremely clean environment.

on Jewish settlers to avoid more violence.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who chaired the weekly
Cabinet session, said the worsening situation in the West Bank
was caused by the killing of three Palestinian workers by Israeli
soldiers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu demanded the settlers living in the divided
flashpoint city Hebron obey orders from the Army and not take the
law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Friday night's violent clash between
settlers and Palestinian residents in Hebron when the settlers
entered the Palestinian-ruled areas to stage protests. Seventeen
people, including eight Palestinian journalists, were injured by
rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Hebron's Israeli police intended to question several settlers
who led the Friday protest. The protest organizers claimed that
the settlers were not properly protected by the soldiers and they
decided to stage the protest after shots were fired at a Jewish
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army's Chief of Staff Lipkin Amnon Shahak toured
Hebron Sunday morning, as officers defended the soldiers against
the charges by Hebron settlers. Division commander of Israeli
troops in the West Bank Yitzhak Eitan said the Friday clash in
Hebron was provoked by the settlers. He added that there was full
cooperation between Israeli troops and Palestinian police in
quelling the rioting.
</P>
<P>
Following five days of widespread violent clashes, in which
dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, the situation in the
West Bank was relatively calm on Sunday. However, Israeli
security forces remained on high alert against new violence.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of three bombings in some Israeli cities in the
past days, Israeli police across the country were also put on
high alert against possible bigger terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a small explosion occurred outside the Old City in
East Jerusalem, injuring four Palestinians. Saturday evening, a
man in the northern town Afula lost his both hands in an
explosion at the central bus station.
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, police in the coastal city Netanya tried to
determine whether a small explosion that blew off a youth's hand
in a nightclub was a terror attack. The young man claimed that
the bomb was hidden in a bag that he found outside the club and
brought inside.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police are suspecting that Palestinian militants are
launching a new wave of terror attacks that is different from the
past. In the past, Palestinian terrorists usually launched
suicide bombings in crowded areas in Israel, inflicting heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
But as Israel has beefed up security around the country and
made it more difficult to perpetrate suicide bombings, police
believed that the terrorists have changed tactics by using
smaller bombs to cause massive disruptions in public
areas.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ministers to Visit Mozambique on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A top-level South African
Ministerial delegation is to visit Mozambique this week to
discuss the arrest of a South African foreign affairs department
official for alleged arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has asked the Mozambican
government for an urgent meeting to discuss the arrest of Robert
Mcbride, expected on Tuesday, the Sunday Independent reported.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad are to meet the Mozambican interior
minister, Mufamadi's office was quoted as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision that the government would approach the Mozambican
authorities directly was taken after a lengthy meeting Friday
involving Mufamadi, Pahad and members of the intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
Mcbride, a deputy director on the Asian desk in the Foreign
Affairs Department, was arrested Monday in Mozambique's border
town Ressano Garcia for alleged illegal arms dealing.
</P>
<P>
During a visit by his wife and South African high commissioner
to Mozambique Mangisi Zitha Friday, Mcbride reportedly denied
smuggling weapons to South Africa or any other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he had gone to investigate gun smuggling on his own
initiative and was sorry for embarrassing the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South African and the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) officials had distanced themselves from Mcbride,
saying he was on an unauthorized private visit to Mozambique at
the time of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
They said the Mozambican law should take its course in the
matter.

<HEADLINE> UAE Holds International Defense Technology Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- An international defense
exhibition was opened here Sunday morning with over 200
exhibitors from more than 20 countries displaying the latest
advances in defense technologies and related fields.
</P>
<P>
The defense show, entitled the Triple International Defense
Exhibition (Tridex) will last for four days and it covers a total
area of over 25,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the exhibition "will specifically cater to
those traditionally rapid-paced (defense) sectors, allowing newly
developed products and services to be showcased to the
international defense community almost immediately after they
become available."
</P>
<P>
The Tridex played a "complementary role" to the Abu Dhabi
International Defense Exhibition, one of the world's largest arms
show which is held every two years, they said.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has invited official visitors
like chiefs of staff and other armed forces commanders from over
50 countries, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, the two biggest weapons
providers to the UAE and other Gulf Arab states, are the major
exhibitors of the show.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Privately Run Companies Eye Infrastructure (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that, by the end of 1997, China had more than
28 million self-employed businesses with registered capital of 250
billion yuan and 800,000 private companies involving six million
employees and registered capital of 340 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
They are mostly engaged in commerce, trade and processing
industries.
</P>
<P>
In the present-day buyer's market, however, the processing
sector witnesses fierce competitiveness, low profit rate and high
risk rate.
</P>
<P>
But infrastructure investment seems to have a higher and more
stable profit picture.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure has long been the bottleneck of China's economic
development. There is an investment-hunger in this field because
the government cannot afford to invest all by itself while foreign
investors seldom venture into the area.
</P>
<P>
An opportunity is thus left for privately run companies to
exploit this untapped field.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has stipulated a comparatively loose
policy on such enterprises to help them re-choose what to do after
they had summed up enough capital from commercial, trade and
processing activities.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,
which was held last September, offered more opportunities for
these enterprises. A report delivered at the meeting stated that
the private-run economy is an important part of the socialist
market economy. Many local governments have stipulated regulations
accordingly that allowed these enterprises to expand their
businesses into more areas.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that, with looser control over the private
enterprises, they will surely branch into more investment fields.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Three farmers in east China's
Shandong Province have invested 12 million yuan to build a
630-meter railway as part of a trend toward private investment in
building infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more private-run firms have shifted
their arena from commerce, trade, and processing industry to
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Mingliu Company in Quanzhou, a city in east China's Fujian
province, has invested 250 million yuan in building a 1,530-meter
bridge across the Jinjiang River. The bridge was put into
operation a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In another case, the Rongbin Group in Xiamen, a city in Fujian
Province, has decided to invest 200 million yuan to build a bridge
across the Xiangjiang River in Changsha, capital of central
China's Hunan Province. To date, one-third of the investment has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
"It is a trend for private-run enterprises to invest in
infrastructure," said Li Ding, director of the Society of Chinese
Private-run Economy. He said that infrastructures should become
the major industry for some private-run companies.
</P>
<P>
In China, the private-run economy involves rural companies,
share-holding enterprises in which the state has no stake,
private-owned enterprises and the self-employed, according to Tong
Dalin, deputy director of the Society of China's Restructuring.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Lebanon have declared
their rejection of any conditioned Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This came during Saturday's meeting here between Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and his Lebanese counterpart Elias
Hrawi. The meeting coincided with the 20th anniversary of the
issue of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 which calls for
Israeli troops withdrawal from south Lebanon without delay.
</P>
<P>
Both sides insisted on not having talks or meetings with the
Israeli side, and on giving no guarantees in return for an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, stressing that the U.N. resolution
should be carried out without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed to withdraw from south Lebanon to exchange
for Lebanon's security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the Damascus summit drew
up a joint strategy stressing the inseparability of the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks of the Middle East peace process, the two
countries' commitment to the overall and fair peace option and the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese summit came just a week before the arrival
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Lebanon within a Mideast
tour, that will take him to Egypt, Israel, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi arrived here Saturday for an official visit to Syria.

<HEADLINE> Army Kills 15 Armed Infiltrators in C. Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army killed 15 armed
infiltrators in Kayenzi Commune of Central Gitarama prefecture
Friday morning, radio Rwanda, monitored here, reported in Kigali
late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Major Emmanuel Ndahiro confirmed the report and
indicated that 10 assault rifles were also seized. There was also
many casualties among the infiltrators, he said.
</P>
<P>
''The operation in which the infiltrators were killed followed
tips by local residents who had learned about the attack,''
Ndahiro told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan military official expressed satisfaction about the
high level of collaboration between the residents of Gitarama and
security forces which helped to rout out about 3,000 armed Hutu
insurgents who raided some communes, north of Gitarama town.
</P>
<P>
''In some cases, local residents netted infiltrators, disarmed
them, and handed them over to the authorities,'' security sources
in Gitarama said.
</P>
<P>
This was the case in Nyakabanda commune where the local
population arrested 11 armed infiltrators and handed them to a
nearby military post.
</P>
<P>
On February 28, about 3,000 armed Hutu insurgents had attacked
the communes of Bulinga, Nyakabanda, Rutobwe, and Nyabikenke in
Central Rwanda from neighboring southern Gisenyi prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Following the intervention of the army, the infiltrators
scattered in hills and swamps of the region.
</P>
<P>
This led to ongoing mop-up operations in which the population
is playing an important role.
</P>
<P>
Security forces in Gitarama announced Thursday that an
adjutant of the former Rwandan government forces (ex-FAR) was
among the infiltrators captured in such operations.
</P>
<P>
A notorious commander of the armed infiltrators code-named
''Ninja'' was also killed in clashes, the RNA claimed in a
special dispatch to Xinhua Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some e-FAR soldiers and the notorious ''Interahamwe''
militiamen are behind the waves of violence in northwestern
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
According to revelations by those captured in the fighting,
the raid on Central Rwanda was just an adventure.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts say that these raids were triggered by
intense pressure exerted on them by the Rwandan army in the
northwest and serious logistical problems relating to food
shortages, and the growing anger of the population which was
weary of their terror.
</P>
<P>
Some of the infiltrators captured affirmed that it was out of
desperation that they launched the attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Regional
Bureau for Industry and Commerce received more than 500 complaints
from local consumers during an event here today marking the
International Consumers' Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
This response shows that local consumers are learning to
protect their legitimate rights and interests, an official with
the bureau told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The official disclosed that the region reported more than 1,400
complaints in the last three years, with an annual increase of 20
percent. More than 4 million yuan was retrieved for 1,200
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The official said that, in the past, local consumers usually
remained silent when they bought cheap, fake and shoddy goods,
attributing this to low purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Currently, complaints raised by local consumers cover not only
big commodities, but also small ones.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, local industrial and commercial bureaus and
technical supervision departments have annually strengthened
publicity about related laws on March 15, International Consumers'
Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
This year, the region established 42 complaint stations and
publicized 120,000 copies of related materials.
</P>
<P>
An association for the protection of the rights and interests
of local consumers is scheduled to be established soon, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> W. Bank to Offer $480m Loan to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is to offer 480
million U.S. Dollars loan to help Mozambique develop its basic
infrastructure and personnel training and private sector during
the three years between 1998 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Domingo, a Sunday paper published here Sunday quoted James
Coates, the bank representative to Mozambique as saying that the
sum has doubled the figure during the 1995-97 period.
</P>
<P>
Coates said the decision for the new loan was made in response
to the rapid developing economy and infrastructure in Mozambique,
and a support for the country's agriculture, education and
industry.
</P>
<P>
The pre-condition for the loan, according to the World Bank,
is a stable macro-economy, a policy framework backing
agricultural investment and a continued policy of privatizing
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank provides the loan to support Mozambique in
carrying out its three development corridors of Maputo, Beira and
Nacala in southern, central and northern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Mozambique and Uganda have become examples
of good economies in Africa. By the end of last year, Mozambique
had registered a growth rate of six to eight percent, and an
inflation rate of six percent, the lowest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has offered the country more than one billion
U.S. Dollars in 30 loans since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cities Mark International Consumers' Rights Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Major Chinese cities have
announced new measures to handle an increasing number complaints
by consumers of the country.
</P>
<P>
A consumer complaint network went into operation today in
Xiamen, one of the country's four Special Economic Zones in east
China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The complaint network covers seven branches of the city's
Bureau for industry and Commerce and 35 local industrial and
commercial offices with a special telephone number: 96315.
</P>
<P>
The aim of establishing the network is to protect consumers'
rights, fight against the production and sale of fake and shoddy
goods, commercial fraud and various economic criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, more than 100 department stores established a new
method called "fair balance" to protect the rights and interest of
consumers. The method will be introduced to all local department
stores and chain stores within the year, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality has established a
special court to protect the legitimate rights and interests of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Related regulations have been worked out to standardize trials
in consumer cases.
</P>
<P>
Other cities such as Beijing, Shijiazhuang and Jinan have all
opened similar telephone hot lines to handle consumer's complaints
or have established service centers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over the past decade China has passed more than a
dozen national laws and regulations designed to protect consumers'
rights in addition to similar regulations adopted by provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
This year, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
is focusing its attention on protecting the rights of consumers in
rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Promote Tourist Attractions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- About 40 Southern African
companies will this week market their tourist attractions at a
three-day convention to be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, South
African Press Association reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This platform would for the first time be open to all
countries in the region, and not only South Africa, said Southern
African Travel Mart (SATM) General Manager BP Tan.
</P>
<P>
The SATM, which runs from Monday to Wednesday, would see
Southern African countries promoting themselves as tourist
destinations among 70 buyer companies from Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hotels, game lodges, nature reserves, tours, and coach or car
hire services are among the attractions to be marketed. Countries
to be represented included South Africa, Malawi, Mauritius,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
South Africa gained about 1.26 billion Rand (252 million U.S.
Dollars) in tourism income from Far East Asia and the Middle East
between January and August last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, 103,238 Asian nationals visited
South Africa, out of a total of more than four million tourists
to the country, according to South Africa Tourism Board figures.
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur was reportedly positioning itself as an Asian
travel hub. Malaysia is the second largest investor in South
Africa (1.8 billion Rand in 1996). Its investments were mainly
concentrated in property development and the tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President to Visit U.S. Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will soon pay a visit to the U.S. for talks with President Bill
Clinton on propelling the Mideast peace process and boosting
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassador in Washington Ahmed Meher was quoted in
local newspaper Al-Akhbar as saying Sunday that the date of the
visit will be set through contacts between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
Meher confirmed an Egyptian proposal on cutting down its
20-year use of U.S. aid, saying Egypt draws up a working paper on
the alternatives of reducing the aid and will forward it to the
U.S. administration soon.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt reckons the U.S. aid could not continue forever," he
said, adding that the aid helped construct Egypt's infrastructure
projects and enabled the American companies to carry out projects
outside the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Daniel
Kurtzer said earlier that the suggested reduction of U.S. aid to
Egypt goes in line with the success of Cairo's economic reform
program.
</P>
<P>
"The economic aid had fulfilled its aims during the past
phase," the U.S. diplomat told a press conference here last
Thursday. He said talks on cutting down aid allocated to Egypt
will start within five months.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has proposed to the Clinton administration to reduce the
annual 815-million dollar economic aid it gets from Washington,
before Israel presented a plan to cut the economic aid it receives
from the U.S. in return for increasing the military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Israel receive annual American military and economic
aid after signing a U.S.-brokered peace deal in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Washington promised to allocate 2.1 billion dollars for Egypt
in 1998 and 3 billion dollars for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aid has been more a controversial topic than a welcome
one for the Egyptian public who fear that the U.S. aid has exposed
the innermost information of the Egyptian society to America and
accelerated its economic dependence on the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aid has infiltrated into almost every economic sector
in Egypt, providing grants even to the People's Assembly and Shura
Council themselves.
</P>
<P>
If the aid is cut off, the government should seize the chance
to adopt a new approach of greater self-reliance in implementing
economic development projects, said some legislators.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic assistance to Egypt amounted to 21 billion
dollars between 1975 and 1996. It used to take the forms of
repayable loans and unrepayable grants before most of it was
offered as grants since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Elders Accuse U.S. of Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Elders in northern Nigeria have
accused the U.S. of interfering in Nigeria's internal affairs by
trying to dictate who should emerge as the west Africa country's
civilian president in August.
</P>
<P>
A statement to this effect was issued Saturday in Kaduna by
the Northern Elders Forum, following the remark made by the U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs that the
election of Nigeria's military leader, General Sani Abacha would
be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"It is sheer double standards typical of the United States of
America to oppose the candidature of a career military officer to
seek an elective office in Nigeria while at the same time
lobbying General Collin Powell, the retired Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff of the American Armed Forces to seek
nomination... during the 1996 American presidential election,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to General Abacha's transition to civil rule
program, a civilian government will replace his military
government in October, following a presidential election on
August 1.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether Abacha should contest or not has been
an issue of controversy both within and outside Nigeria, as the
transition program draws to its end.
</P>
<P>
Elders, or traditional rulers have a great influence in
Nigerian politics, while the north has produced most of the
Nigerian leaders since its independence in 1960.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Shelters "Wanted" Mobutu Officials: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 120 high-ranking
officials of the former Zairean regime headed by Mobutu Sese Seko
are living in South Africa, local daily the Sunday Independent
quoted a confidential intelligence report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the 120 Zairean officials, most of whom were senior
soliders or civil servants, 102 are on a "wanted" list issued by
President Laurent Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in
connection with the looting of state coffers.
</P>
<P>
Of the four most wanted by Kabila, three are generals who
arrived in South Africa with two extremely heavy suitcases on an
illegal flight in May last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The former Zairean generals were allegedly carrying diamonds
and millions of U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The presence in South Africa of so many of Mobutu's former
officials, many of whom have dual citizenship along with
property, investments and families in South Africa, was
continuing to cause problems in the relationship between the DRC
and South Africa, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, the head of the Intelligence
Committee, told a press conference this week that a special task
force was established to look into a number of allegations,
including National Intelligency Agency (NIA) complicity in the
generals' departure from former Zaire, now the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The task force, which visited the DRC twice during its
investigations, was made up of representatives of the NIA, the
South African secret service, the ministry of intelligency, the
departments of foreign and home affairs and the police.
</P>
<P>
As part of its probe, the task force checked the log-sheet of
every flight into South Africa over a period of several months,
verified the details of every passenger and cargo load on those
flights and compiled a list of exiled Zaireans living in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mapisa-Nqakula declined to say how many members of the Mobutu
regime had sought refuge in South Africa. However, she admitted
deficiencies in the border control system, corruption in the
departments of foreign and home affairs, and the low level of
accountability required of NIA and secret service agents under
current legislation.
</P>
<P>
Mapisa-Nqakula said the task team's report "identified
weaknesses in border control, and security measures at some of
the airports were not properly enforced..." There were virtually
no means of effectively monitoring the movement of foreign
nationals.
</P>
<P>
"This has led to some of them exploiting that loophole by
engaging in... illegal activities." However, Mapisa-Nqakula said,
a process of correcting this was under way. She said new
legislation aimed at boosting the accountability of state agents
would be tabled in parliament this year, and the question of
diplomatic immunity would also be examined.

<HEADLINE> New Male Contraception Device Developed in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A new kind of male contraception
gadget which tends to be easily accepted by men of various
cultural backgrounds has been developed in Xi'an, provincial
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The new invention has been granted state patent rights for
practical technologies, and the products are soon to be
available. The functioning of the new device, which is as big as a
beeper, is achieved through changing the habitat of sperm to stop
spawning or lead to the quick termination of new ones, said Yang
Xiyong, the device's inventor.
</P>
<P>
The gadget can be placed in the users' underwear, where it
transmits pulses into the body to autonomic nerves which change
the sperm's habitat.
</P>
<P>
Clinical researchers have found the new gadget convenient to
use and, while functioning, it is safe, reliable and reversible.
</P>
<P>
One hour of use ensures one month's successful contraception,
researchers said, and a man can restore his reproductive
capability two months after halting the gadget's use.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC not to Contest Overturn of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) has said it would not contest a
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) court bid to overturn
amnesties granted to 37 top ANC officials.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Saturday after a meeting of the ANC's
subcommittee on truth and reconciliation, chaired by Vice
President Thabo Mbeki, the ANC recommitted itself to cooperating
fully with the truth and reconciliation process, City Press paper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The TRC launched an application on the Cape Town High Court
Friday to overturn the amnesties granted to 37 senior ANC
officials last November by the TRC's amnesty committee, which
enjoys autonomy from the rest of the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Among the 37 are Mbeki, Defense Minister Joe Modise, Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo, Justice Minister Dullah Omar, Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj and Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan.
</P>
<P>
TRC chairman Desmond Tutu said in court papers that the
amnesties were invalid "by virtue of at least four
irregularities", including failure to make full disclosure of the
offenses and to identify specific acts.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said it would try to avoid a situation where the
process is turned into a "political football", adding that it
would approach the court application in a non-adversarial manner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Party (NP), the country's biggest
opposition party, said Saturday it would not withdraw its own
court bid to overturn the blanket amnesty as requested by the
TRC.
</P>
<P>
The NP launched the action on Thursday, claiming the amnesty
committee had been biased toward the ANC in granting the pardons.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty committee is entitled to pardon those guilty of
human rights crimes provided full disclosure of the offenses is
made and a political motive is proven.

CANBERRA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Damien Marsh has set his sights
on this year's Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games after winning the
200-meter final at the Australian track and field championships in
Melbourne on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Marsh, who had long been plagued with an
Achilles heel injury, clocked 21.34 seconds to beat teenager

<HEADLINE> Market Liberalization Should Be Cautiously Pursued: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The pace of liberalization
in key industries, where the capacity of Southeast Asian countries
to compete against global giants was weak, must be carefully
calibrated, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding what the logic of liberalization might suggest,
national security considerations might require that certain
strategic industries continue to remain in the hands of nationals,
he said in his keynote address at the three-day 8th Southeast Asia
Forum which opened here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts to redress the economic situation in Southeast
Asia must take into account the fundamental security and
well-being of the society.
</P>
<P>
He said prescriptions for recovery, especially those coming
from abroad, rarely factored in this "supreme" consideration as
they were often laden with the logic of pure economics.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the immediate concern now was to restore
confidence in the markets and stabilize exchange rates with
measures such as sound macro-economic policies, improving
corporate and public sector governance and curbing excessive
credit expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said the affected countries in Southeast Asia must be
prepared to subordinate some of their national programs to the
overriding objective of economic rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has brought ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) members closer and helped to minimize differences
among them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also touched on the issues such as the illegal
flow of migrants stemming from the economic situation in the
region, the forest fires in the region and the situation in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia, he expressed hope that free and fair elections
would be successfully held there and that all impediments to the
admission of that country into ASEAN would be removed.

<P>
LANZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
raised 10.45 million yuan to help poverty-stricken workers at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Extending a helping hand to laid-off or impoverished workers is
at the top of the provincial government's agenda, which is of
vital importance to the country's reform, development and
stability, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Financial and labor departments in Gansu have allocated 23
million yuan to set up re-employment funds at the provincial
level. Other local governments have collected 85.19 million yuan
in relief funds.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also extended pension and
unemployment insurance to 2.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
Apart from financial aid, Gansu has established more than 1,800
agencies to help laid-off workers in seeking new jobs. Thirty
re-employment markets opened in cities like Lanzhou, Tianshui, and
Baiyin to help more than 10,000 laid-off workers find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has set up 122 re-employment service centers to help
laid-off workers from financially troubled enterprises. About
98,000 laid-off workers have found jobs, and the re-employment
rate is at 50 percent in the province.

ROME, March 14 (Xinhua) - Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro was hospitalized Saturday evening for a heart checkup,
the president's office announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro, 79, entered Rome's Gemelli hospital because of "the

symptoms and doctor's recommendations."
</P>
<P>
He canceled a trip to Israel and Syria, originally scheduled
for March 15-20.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Israeli Compliance With Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook has urged Israel to implement all signed agreements with the
Palestinians to bring the peace process back on track, an Arabic
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Al-Ahram on the occasion of his
Cairo visit slated for Sunday, Cook said that Britain supports
full and unconditional implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli
agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Israel ought to urgently and substantially redeploy its troops
in the West Bank," he added, adding that it is hard to achieve any
progress towards the final stage negotiations due to the "mistrust
between the parties concerned in the region."
</P>
<P>
Cook, starting a tour of the region which brings him to Egypt,
Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and
Lebanon, is carrying a European plan to revive the stalled Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, among other things, calls for Palestinian
commitment to Israel's security demands, and urges Israel to
implement a significant troops redeployment and halt settlement
operations. It also urges support to the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
The British official told the daily that the Middle East peace
process tops Britain's priorities during its tenure as the
rotating chairman of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"Britain pursued, and still, contacts with the parties
concerned, European states and the U.S. to achieve progress in the
peace process in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process have been deadlocked for
nearly a year over Israeli construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem. The U.S. mediation has failed to revive the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cook described Britain's relations with the Arab world as
"well-grounded" as the two sides have historical land trade links
besides the dialog at political level.
</P>
<P>
Cook also hailed the sound relationship with Egypt, which will
be the first stop of his six-leg tour, and said President Hosni
Mubarak is playing a significant role in maintaining stability in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Talks with the Egyptian leaders will cover the latest
developments in the Middle East and the situation in the occupied
lands especially following the Hebron demonstrations as well as
the Iraq crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between the two countries amounts to 1
billion U.S. dollars annually. Britain is also Egypt's second
largest foreign investor with investments standing at 1 billion
sterlings (1.67 billion dollars).

Saturday in fighting in Mankulam, Northern Province, a military
release here said Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The release said advancing government troops who are carrying
on the operation "Jaya Sikuru" (Sure of Victory), confronted a

state.
</P>
<P>

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's largest commercial
center, Shanghai, plans to raise its share of the commercial
turnover in the gross domestic product (GDP) mix from 11.4 percent
to 13 percent in three years, said Deputy-Mayor Feng Guoqin.
</P>
<P>
Feng addressed a recent meeting on commerce, saying that retail
sales will increase from last year's 132 billion yuan to 180
billion yuan in 2000 and the operating floor space for retail
business will increase from the present 10 million square meters
to 13 million.
</P>
<P>
He said Shanghai has sustained a 15 percent annual increase in
retail business for five consecutive years in a buyer's
market. However, the competition in prices indicates that the
commercial mix needs to be improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Feng said that the building of commercial streets in major
residential and downtown areas will be the main focus. Meanwhile,
the city will step up the development of commercial services and
commodity wholesale outlets.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Practical Option in Wake of "Soft Landing" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Due to the impact of the recent financial crisis in Southeast
Asia, China's export prospects are rather stark this year, and
apparent sluggish sales are also haunting the country's domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, economists noted, it has become an
inevitable option for the government to resort to expanding
investment demand to help vitalize the market and support
essential economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In fact, conditions are already ripe for an appropriate
increase of investment, as inflation has been reduced to the
minimum level since the beginning of the reform and opening-up
drive two decades ago, they said.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC deputies from the economic circles agree to the
government's decision to continue carrying out the appropriately
tight fiscal and monetary policy, but suggest that this policy be
appropriately readjusted according to new domestic and global
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
They hold that the Chinese economy has accumulated some
strength through its "soft landing", and that various basic
economic factors nowadays are favorable for an investment growth.
</P>
<P>
Money supply will be adequate with a huge national deposit pool
and largely expanded channels of direct financing, stocks and
bonds markets in particular.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, possibilities of a shortage of production means or
consumer goods are very small, which means that investment will
not stimulate inflation; and cheap price of building materials,
equipment and labor has provided a golden opportunity for
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
It has become quite obvious that the Chinese authorities have
decided to place emphasis on economic restructuring and
sustainable development while increasing investment.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts are unanimous that investment in
infrastructure, energy and transportation sectors, industries
supported by high and new technologies and technical upgrading of
enterprises will undoubtedly pave the way for China's future
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, measures like developing urban residential housing
market and stepping up industrialization of the agricultural
sector will expectedly turn people's savings deposits, which have
totaled 5,000 billion yuan and have been expanding by 800 billion
yuan annually, into huge domestic consumption and develop the
potential market in the vast rural areas, they added.
</P>
<P>
In view of the lesson of past economic overheating, they said,
the government will keep a tight control on high-grade real estate
projects and prevent any capital from flowing into areas of
redundant production, just as the top banker Dai warned:
"Resoluted efforts must be made to prevent resurgence of bubble
economy."
</P>
<P>
With the absence of a self-restrainable investment system
guided by the market in China today, a senior official with the
central bank further noted, macro-control departments of the
government must follow closely every move of economic development,
so as to avoid any rapid economic decline or rebound.
</P>
<P>
While it is not easy to achieve high growth and low inflation
for the economy, observers further noted, it will be harder still
to maintain sustained growth after the "soft landing" and with a
buyer's market.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the current situation, China's decision-makers
have made a truly realistic and wise option," they commented.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Practical Option in Wake of "Soft Landing" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Although it's still too early to
predict any change the Chinese government will introduce to its
"appropriately tight" fiscal and monetary policy implemented in
recent years, initial signs indicate that this "appropriately
tight" policy tends to be a little more flexible and lenient.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the ongoing session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), the top legislature, deputies of
all social sectors hold that maintaining an annual economic growth
of no less than eight percent is of vital importance to China's
future development.
</P>
<P>
They also reach consensus that a feasible option for China to
promote its economic growth, which has shown some inclined signs
of cooling down, is to increase investment and expand domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
At a recent press conference hosted by the current NPC session,
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, said China is expected to increase its overall money supply
by 18 percent this year, two percentage points higher than in the
previous year, and that the investment in fixed assets for 1998
will also increase by 270 billion yuan (32.5 billion US dollars)
and this figure will possibly be higher in the course of
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"An appropriate growth in investment and money supply is aimed
at expanding domestic demand in support of economic growth," the
top banker explained explicitly.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that China's goal of an eight percent economic
growth for 1998 is realistic and feasible, difficulties are still
involved in achieving it, and special attention should be paid to
signs of subsiding slowdown in economic growth, according to a
number of noted figures in the economic circles.
</P>
<P>
A senior analyst with the central bank noted that a sustained
economic growth should move on smoothly at the platform of "soft
landing" and any possible "landslide" should be guarded against at
present, because an economic landslip once occurs, it will exert
an unnegligible negative impact on China's development over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
In line with China's modernization plan, which prompts the
world's most populous nation to catch up with the
moderately-developed nations in mid next century in terms of
degree of affluency, a fairly-high growth rate should be
maintained in the stage of its economic takeoff.
</P>
<P>
China scored an average annual growth of 11 percent during the
Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) and, in the past few
years, as a result of macro-control measures over the heated
economy, which reduced the rate of inflation down from 21.7
percent to merely 0.8 percent last year, the country's economic
growth rate was also lowered to 8.8 percent in 1997 from 13.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to seek an average economic
growth of seven to eight percent a year during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Japan Agree Reforms Need Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Japan Sunday agreed
on the need for flexibility in the implementation of some aspects
of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) program to end the
monetary crisis in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during more than two hours of talks
between visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
Indonesian President Soeharto here, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed on the importance of the reform
program in Indonesia in cooperation with international financial
institutions based on mutual agreement, said Alatas.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia in mid-January signed a new agreement with the IMF to
carry out sweeping economic reforms in return for an IMF-led
bailout package of more than 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan pledged to provide special assistance within the
bilateral framework, apart from the five billion U.S. dollars
worth of loans provided by Japan to the IMF rescue package, Alatas
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say how much Japan promised to give.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral assistance is in the form of providing food and
procurement. Japan also facilitates "trade insurance" for
Indonesian staples importers.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hashimoto, who arrived here Saturday
evening, expressed his concern over the impact of the current
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also expressed confidence that President
Soeharto would take a brave step to overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Japan says it is still committed to the IMF bailout. Hashimoto
invited Indonesia to establish cooperation with the international
financial institutions and friendly countries in efforts to end
the crisis so that Indonesia could continue its development.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is the first foreign leader to meet Soeharto since he
was re-elected as the Indonesian president for the seventh term.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed Indonesia's problems in
implementing the economic reforms program, such as issues of
foreign debts, the rupiah (national currency) exchange rates
against the U.S. dollar as well as the IMF-plus program (Currency
Board System).
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was due to leave for Tokyo later on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> "Titanic" Surpasses "Star War" as Top-Selling Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, March 14 (Xinhua) -- "Titanic" surpassed "Star War"
Saturday evening as the top domestic money-earner of all time,
according to a Hollywood spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt we passed the record today," said Blaise Noto,
spokesman for Paramount, which co-produced the 200-million-dollar
film with the 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
Going into Saturday, the shipreck saga claimed receipts of
458.2 million dollars and was projected by industry estimates to
have grossed at least 7 million dollars more by Saturday
evening. This gave it a total of more than 465 million dollars,
thus breaking the all-time domestic mark of 461 million dollars
set by "Star War".
</P>
<P>
U.S. film industry experts pointed out that it took five
re-release for "Star War" to make that kind of money, while
"Titanic" is steaming in the same direction on its first time out.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, "Titanic" already holds the record for returns with
receipts in excess of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
"Titanic" has been the nation's No.1 film for 12 straight weeks
and Hollywood experts estimate it will hold that position for at
least next two weeks since another highly publicized movie
"Primary Colors" opens in a week.
</P>
<P>
But if "Titanic" wins the best picture Oscar at March 23's
Academy Awards, the experts believe, it will continue to be the
No.1 film for much longer period in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Nike to Lay Off Workers Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Nike Inc., the world's largest
sports shoe maker, is planning to lay off workers at home and abroad
in the coming weeks, according to reports from Portland, where the
company's headquarters is based.
</P>
<P>
Nike Inc. will cut about 250 employees in Oregan and another 200
elsewhere in the country starting next week, The Oregonian reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reduction amounts to less than 4 percent of Nike's domestic
workforce of 11,600. Industry sources had estimated the company would
eliminate about 1,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Nike is expected to announce job reductions overseas on coming
Wednesday, the newspaper said, adding that at least 700 international
employees could be fired.
</P>
<P>
This is the third layoff in recent Nike history. It cut 269 jobs in
1987 and 459 jobs in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Nike spokesman Lee Weinstein said there would be "a
global reduction in force in the course of the next few weeks" because
the Asian financial crisis has been cutting into Nike's profits and
battering its stock.
</P>
<P>
He said Nike was experiencing higher-than-anticipated order
cancellation rates in the Asia Pacific region, and that aggressive
pricing of close-out inventories, particularly in Japan, had hurt
revenues and gross profit margins.
</P>
<P>
Nike has a total of 21,800 employees worldwide by the end of last
year and the company terminated earlier this week 300 temporary
workers, mostly at its headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Staff Playing Important Role in Foreign Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese staff members are
playing more important roles in foreign agencies registered in
China.
</P>
<P>
Larry Wang, program manager of human resources from Lucent
Technologies (China) Company Ltd., said that working staff members
of his company's personnel department are all Chinese, and the
Chinese manager has the right to select new employees.
</P>
<P>
Wang, born and raised in China, took his current post after
graduation from the enterprise management department of Hubei
Polytechnical University.
</P>
<P>
Foreign agencies registered in the country commonly fill
mid-rank jobs with Chinese employees.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 100 of the 20,000-plus Chinese
staff members in 5,000 foreign agencies in the capital hold posts
of deputy general manager or higher.
</P>
<P>
These Chinese staff members are beneficiaries of the local
human resources strategy of international companies with branches
in China.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wong, human resources manager for Henkel Asia-Pacific
Ltd., a German company with its China headquarters in Hong Kong,
said that the aim of transnational companies' local policies in
human resources is to show that their investment in China is for
the long haul and not a short-term action.
</P>
<P>
He said the company, which has invested 300 million
U.S. dollars to establish 17 joint ventures in the country's
chemical industry, plans to help Chinese staff members fill at
least 50 percent of the firm's mid- and high-ranking positions
within five years.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign agencies introduced the local policy to save money
on salaries, welfare and housing.
</P>
<P>
Many transnational companies have launched personnel training
programs to train locally hired personnel.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Henkel and Shanghai Communications University
cooperated on a training class. So far, more than 500 people have
attended the class.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Halt Foreign Exchange Supply to Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
decided to stop supplying foreign exchanges to Iranian travelers
due to a reduction of the country's foreign exchange incomes.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News Sunday quoted informed
sources as saying that the country's banking system would not sell
foreign exchanges to Iranian travelers as of the beginning of the
next fiscal year (to start on March 21) until further notice.
</P>
<P>
According to the present regulation, every Iranian traveling
abroad can buy 300 to 1,000 U.S. dollars according to his or her
destination from the banking system with a rate of 3,000 rials
against one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts blame the drop in oil revenues as the main reason
behind the government's move to stop selling foreign exchanges,
Iran News said.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil revenue during the 11 months of the current
fiscal year (to end on March 21) stood at 14.3 billion dollars,
while the government's budget projected an income of 17.7 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of oil revenue has caused a budget deficit of
4.57 billion dollars in the current fiscal year and will raise the
deficit to 11.4 billion dollars in the next fiscal year, some
Iranian officials said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from London said that Iran's foreign

<HEADLINE> Survey: Shanghai Residents Say "No" to Discount Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
nearly 70 percent of the residents in east China's Shanghai
municipality have a negative attitude toward discounted consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey by the municipal social economic survey team
revealed that only 30 percent of the 500 households surveyed are
willing to buy discount goods frequently while the other 70
percent first consider whether they really need the goods and the
quality of the goods.
</P>
<P>
Statistical experts said the results indicated a more mature
consumer attitude as residents pay more attention to their real
needs and commodity quality, rather than prices.
</P>
<P>
It also means that the residents have more money in their
pockets, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
As China has entered a period of a "buyer's market," businesses
are facing more fierce competition for consumers. To woo more
customers, discounting was in vogue in recent years in large
cities such as Shanghai and Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Decrease Orchard Are Because of Glut of Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in central China's
Henan Province slashed the area devoted to growing fruit by 12.2
percent in 1997 compared to 1996, in response to the oversupply of
fruit on the market.
</P>
<P>
This is the first drop since 1991. The decrease is also a
reaction by increasingly market-savvy farmers toward fluctuations
in the market, said market experts.
</P>
<P>
Fruit from Henan are sold in many parts of country. Over the
past few years, orchards in the province had been expanding
rapidly, but the growth rate greatly exceeded the rise in fruit
consumption by rural and urban residents.
</P>
<P>
As a result, fruit growers' interests had been harmed because
of falling prices due to oversupply. Last year, the average fruit
growers' income in the province reportedly fell 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Henan, a leading agricultural production base in China,
produced 2.69 million tons of fruit last year, with a marked
increase in quality, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Local officials were urged to give fruit farmers more guidance
in planting and inform growers of market situations for farm
products.
</P>
<P>
Fruit growers have started to increase investment in scientific
technology while adjusting their investment structure and
decreasing the area of orchards, said local sources.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Phulbari Transit Route Remains Idle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A good dream has turned out a
fantasy. This is the sad fact facing the Phulbari alternative
transit route, which Nepal had clamored for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
Except the convoy of three trucks which moved along the route
to Bangladesh on the inauguration day on September 1, 1997, the
route has remained idle for the last six months.
</P>
<P>
The route runs 71 km from Kakarbhitta, Nepal's eastern gateway
to India, through Phulbari in northeastern India to the
Bangladeshi border town of Banglabandh.
</P>
<P>
Then it stretches another 580 km to the Mongla port in
southwestern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Nepal had sought this transit route as an alternative to the
Calcutta port since 1978. It was reported that each year Nepal
loses millions of rupees in demurrage as chartered vessels
sometimes have to wait for several days to dock in the overcrowded
Calcutta and Haldia ports of India.
</P>
<P>
But India did not agree to the request until last June when
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral visited Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The land-locked Himalayan kingdom cheered to the news. It was
widely accepted that the new transit route would be sure to boost
Nepal's trade with Bangladesh and other countries as it offers a
short-cut access of Nepali products to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
However, except the three trucks carrying pulses on the
inauguration day, no other vehicles ever rumbled on the route.
</P>
<P>
Calcutta remains the choice.
</P>
<P>
Chandi P. Shrestha, spokesman for Nepal's Ministry of Commerce,
explained that first of all the route was new, but impractical
operating modalities also contribute to the poor use of the route.
</P>
<P>
He said the route can be used only on Saturdays and Sundays,
official holidays for Nepal and Bangladesh, so traders have to
wait sometimes four to five days before they can enter Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Visa is required as well for entering Bangladesh, he told
Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Ananda Raj Mulmi, president of the Federation of Nepalese
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, agreed.
</P>
<P>
Since visa facility is not available for them, local traders
had to come to Kathmandu to get the visas, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are other obstacles. The infrastructure in Bangladesh is
poor, roads are not in good condition, and bridges have to be
built, he said.
</P>
<P>
And the tariff for the Nepali traders is too high, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Then comes the payment system problem. Due to no access to U.S.
dollars, goods are purchased in local currencies.
</P>
<P>
Under the operating modalities, only pilfer-proof container
trucks can use the Phulbari transit route. The Nepali government
now only allows the government-owned companies to use the route,
but they do not have enough containers and the capacity of the
containers is very small, Mulmi said.
</P>
<P>
"Now the time has come for the government to permit the private
sector to provide service of containers," he said.
</P>
<P>
As Phulbari lies in the so-called "chicken neck" area which is
sensitive to India, the container trucks must be escorted by
Indian security troops and can move only in the daylight.
</P>
<P>
Mulmi said the Indian security troops can monitor, but not all
the time.
</P>
<P>
He said the Mongla port is the cheapest, yet the facilities
there are unavailable due to very little use.
</P>
<P>
But he is confident of the future. Bangladesh is short of
agricultural products, it imports them even from Latin America.
"Bangladesh thinks the Nepalese products are very good, so we see
a lot of chances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Ambassador to Nepal Krishna V. Rajan said that in the
spirit of sub-regional cooperation among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India
and Nepal, the transit route was worked out through trilateral
efforts. But some practical problems need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"We knew it could take some time before the route really
becomes attractive and viable," he said. "New modalities will need
to be worked out for the Nepali citizens to utilize the route."
</P>
<P>
"That's why the intention was to have a start on an
experimental basis and see and learn from the experience," he
added.
</P>
<P>
India has extended Nepal's use of the Phulbari route after the
six-month trial period expired. And commerce secretaries of the
two countries will meet in New Delhi later this month to review
the operating modalities.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what's the best can be done in order to ensure that
commitment of India to provide a good and viable alternative
transit route to and through Bangladesh for Nepal is productive,"
the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the central issue is whether the business
community is seriously interested and motivated, and if so, then
other things like more investment in roads and bridges will follow
quickly.
</P>
<P>
And some practical measures will follow in India to address the
problems faced by the Nepali traders, he said.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Cracking Down on Tax Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The economic powerhouse of
Guangdong Province in south China recovered more than 5.4 billion
yuan in tax fraud in the last three years, accounting for 6.2
percent of total local tax revenue, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial tax departments have dealt with 130,000 tax
violation cases during the period since the central government
adopted the revenue-sharing system in 1994, said Chen Jiaji,
deputy director of the local Tax Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The sum equals to the total annual tax revenue of four or five
medium-size cities in the province, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
By last year, Guangdong had set up 179 agencies with 1,767
officers to check on tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Tax departments have taken such measures as demanding overdue
taxes, fees, fines and confiscations to rectify tax-collecting
deficiencies and increase revenues, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Local tax bureaus have established a good reputation with the
public in settling major tax cases. The tax-evasion cases
involving the Zheng Wenyou Traditional Chinese Medicine Tumor
Hospital and a Japanese-funded golf company in Shenzhen had
attracted widespread attention and greatly promoted local tax
collection.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks Investment in Water Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has appealed to people to invest in the rehabilitation of the
rundown water supply facilities in the capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The government, in cooperation with the World Bank, is seeking
investors to repair the rusty pipes to avert a water crisis in
the city, said Minister of Water Pius Ng'wandu Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing the press on this year's Water
Week which will start Monday, The Guardian paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The water ministry and the World Bank are planning to overhaul
the old water system in the region at a cost of 600 million US
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to invite people to buy shares," the newspaper
quoted Ng'wandu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since the government cannot afford to spend so much money, it
is high time that people joined hands to invest in the water
sector, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"If common people can buy shares of the Tanzania Oxygen
Limited, why can't they do the same to water which is very
important to their daily life?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
There is also a need to increase water supply in Dar es Salaam
as only 35 percent of the water released from both Lower and
Upper Ruvu are able to reach people in the town, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The last time when the regions's water system was repaired was
in 1989 during the course of harnessing the upper Ruvu river.
"This did not increase our water supply," he said, "it only
maintained the installed capacity of water."
</P>
<P>
"Most donors are prepared to rehabilitate the water system but
not to increase its capacity," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that all regions in the country will
evaluate the safe water supply systems and how to improve
services in this sector, as "underground water is a hidden
resource."

<HEADLINE> Business Increase In Shanghai Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Waigaoqiao Free Trade
Zone expects a 20 percent increase in its GDP this year, from the
nearly six billion yuan last year, and an industrial output
increase of 30 percent, from last year's 6.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Waigaoqiao port handled 490,000 standard containers last year,
up 150,000 from the 1996 figure, and it is expected to rise to
600,000 this year. The port ranks second in China after Shanghai
in terms of container business.
</P>
<P>
The zone plans to have 350 million US dollars worth of overseas
investment this year in 300 new overseas-funded projects. By the
end of February, the zone had 2,100 overseas-funded projects,
involving nearly 2.9 billion US dollars in total investment.
</P>
<P>
The zone did 2.7 billion US dollars worth of foreign trade in
1997, over 700 million US dollars of which was in exports, more
than two times the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output value in the zone rose 125 percent over 1996
to 6.4 billion yuan last year, as a result of the speedy
development of the processing trade.
</P>
<P>
There are now 39 multinationals investing in the processing
trade in the zone, with 81 companies involved in the business.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Condemns DDT Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco industry and
environmental organizations have slammed the Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare for importing 10,000 tons of the lethal
chemical DDT for use in its malaria control programs.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for the Ministry Paulinus Sikhosana confirmed to the
Sunday Mail weekly that his ministry had procured 10,000 tons of
10 percent DDT to curb the high malaria incidence in most parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the concentration used for malaria control had in the
past been 75 percent DDT, the weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Banned in the western world, DDT was also a restricted
pesticide in Zimbabwe under the hazardous substances and articles
act of 1996. It was not banned locally, as it is registered for
public health use.
</P>
<P>
Sikhosana added that the World Health Organization still
recommended the use of DDT for malaria control for indoor
residual spraying, and countries like Botswana, Namibia and South
Africa still used the chemical for malaria control.
</P>
<P>
However, tobacco farmers complained that the hazardous
pesticide would affect their business as all tobacco with traces
of DDT or any other chemical was not acceptable in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco research board said it had identified two
small-scale farmers in the Nyanguza resettlement area with
unacceptable pesticide residue levels in the tobacco sent on the
floors. Upon investigation it was established that this had been
caused by the malaria-spraying exercise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
DDT in large quantities was known to cause cancer while the
1960s studies proved that it had led to the fall in the numbers
of birds, as it caused thinning of egg shells.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Environment 2000 condemned the procurement of
DDT, saying its use might have far-reaching implications on the
environment.

consumption taxes from foreign-funded enterprises in the first two
months of 1998, up 15 percent on the same 1997 period.

Rising tax revenues have been attributed to achievements made

LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has said
that it has no money this year to buy fertilizer for farmers,
Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister
Edith Nawakwi as saying in central province Sunday that
fertilizer for maize will not be available to the farmers because
the government has no money to buy it.
</P>
<P>
She said the government has not budgeted for fertilizer this
year and as such farmers should not expect any from her ministry.
</P>
<P>
She told the farmers to be ready for the consequences of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the farmers to invest in livestock which if
looked after well could bring development and raise their
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said the government is ready to help farmers who will
diversify into ranching from maize farming.
</P>
<P>
Money is available under the rural investment fund for farmers
to start other projects other than maize farming, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year the country's agricultural production decreased by
3.4 percent due to deferred supply of fertilizer input among
others.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Team Brings Light to Somali Blind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- It has been wonderful for the
blind in the Somali capital this week after a Pakistani team of
six doctors and nine nurses have undergone a massive operation in
restoring the eyesight to hundreds of Somalis in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Digfer General Hospital, the largest hospital here, has been
selected as the only site that could accommodate such major
operations in which 1,500-1,800 people were screened by the
doctors before the selections were made.
</P>
<P>
During their five-day operation which ended Saturday, the
Pakistani team from Al-Basar International Foundation funded by
Saudi Arabia had succeeded in restoring the eyesight to 709
people who mainly suffered from Cataract and Glaucoma which cause
blindness.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Ali Basha Omar, the deputy chairman of a local
organization Al-Islah charity that invited and worked with the
Pakistani team, 70 out of the 709 people have been given lens
implant.
</P>
<P>
Omar also said that each of the 709 people was offered two
pairs of glasses, one of sun-glass and another of sight glass
free of charge. The patients were also given free treatment for
the first six weeks after the operation.
</P>
<P>
The people who benefited from the operation include 12
children who also lost their eye-sight.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the Pakistani team have conducted similar operations
in the town of Bossaso for three times, and six times in the
Northwestern town of Borama. The team will fly to the
northeastern region of Bossaso Monday for the same cause.

<HEADLINE> HK Lawmaker Urges Laid-Off Workers to Adapt to Social Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A prestigious Hong Kong
businessman today proposed that laid-off workers of China's
state-owned enterprises adapt themselves to the needs of the
society for the sake of their re-employment at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
"According to the laws that guide the flow of human resources,
layoff quite possibly marks a new fresh beginning for the
laborers," said Wilfred Wong Ying-wai, a deputy from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth National People's
Congress, China's top legislature, in session here since early
March.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who is also president of Hong Kong-based China Industries
Investment Group, said that he quite understands the feelings of
frustrations and unsafety shared by many laid-off workers and has
much compassion on them.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I's like to give them a sincere advice, that is,
regarding yourselves as part of the human resources of the
society, making adjustments according to social demand, tapping
your potentials and further increasing your competence, and you
will have bright prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wong has long been impressed by the abundant human resources
and highly-competent skilled personnel in the interior areas,
where he has made a lot of investments, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, both the governments and individuals in the
interior are still not adequately aware of the importance of
market demand in the distribution of human resources, resulting in
an increasing waste of manpower and skilled personnel.
</P>
<P>
"So it is essential not only for government officials and
business managers, but for every individual laborer, to become
market-oriented on the issue of employment," he said.
</P>
<P>
While trying to take care of and help re-train laid-off
workers, he suggested that the government should also take prompt
and effective measures to cultivate and develop a mature human
resources market across the country.

<HEADLINE> Top PLA Officer Speaks About Future Military Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Issue No.6 of the biweekly
magazine "Seeking Truth," which comes out on March 16, carries an
article by General Fu Quanyou, chief of General Staff of the PLA,
on improving the country's military work.
</P>
<P>
The article contains four parts: arming oneself with scientific
theories and high-tech knowledge; increasing military reforms;
building quality in the military; and administration in strict
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Fu says that study is a Party tradition and a prerequisite and
a base for developing the cause and quotes the speech by Jiang
Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, where he emphasizes that the times, the
situation, and the cause call for study, and it is a powerful
driving force for future development of the army.
</P>
<P>
Fu also emphasizes Maxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and
Deng Xiaoping Theory. Deng's theory serves as a guide for the
realization of socialist modernization during reforms, he says,
and there can be no other theory because his is a combination of
Marxism for contemporary practice in China with Chinese
characteristics. It can solve problems related to the future of
socialism and is the only theory which can solve problems of
modernization in the military.
</P>
<P>
Fu also points to the importance of agreeing with the CPC
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the
Central Military Commission, under any and all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
He urges the whole army to study high-tech so as to improve the
military through science and technology.

<HEADLINE> 12 Kenyans Killed in Road Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people died and
eight seriously injured Saturday when the bus they were traveling
in rolled several times at Samburu on the Nairobi-Mombasa
highway, a daily paper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Coast provincial police boss Japheth Mwania who visited the
scene, confirmed that 10 people died on the spot and two others
died while being treated at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper said the death toll has
reached 14 while more than 10 people were critically injured and
another 16 suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The bus, traveling from Nairobi to Mombasa, skidded and rolled
for more than 300 meters at about 7:00 a.m. Some of its survivors
remained trapped in the wreckage for more than five hours --
until 11 a.m. when police from Mombasa came to their aid.
</P>
<P>
Among the survivors were the driver identified as Julius
Ndambuki and an eight-month-old baby whose mother died in the
crash. The total number of the passengers in the bus is 53.
</P>
<P>
Ndambuki said the accident occurred when he lost control of
the vehicle as he tried to avoid a head-on collision with a
truck.
</P>
<P>
"I came out of a bend only to find myself face-to-face with a
lorry which was overtaking. As I was trying to avoid it, the bus
veered off the road and began rolling," he said. His head and
left leg were bandaged.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the bus rolled three times before landing in a
ditch.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, more than 60 passengers were injured in
another road accident along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, 10 of
them seriously.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred shortly before noon when a bus hit a
small pick-up, lost control and overturned.

<P>
Fu quotes CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin
as saying in his report to the Party's 15th National Congress that
China should place importance on building the military with
science and technology, and improving its defensive warfare
capability with modern technology. China should train capable
people and try hard to improve leaders and soldiers' scientific
and cultural awareness.
</P>
<P>
Fu says technology seems to be developed by technological
competition, but actually it is decided by competing human
resources and we should be more aware of the decisive role human
resources play in the quality of a military force and improve the
training of humans, attracting more excellent youths with at least
a high school education or college graduates.
</P>
<P>
He says the nation's military concentrates on economic
development, requiring human, material, and financial resources
for key projects, but we should push the modernization drive of
armaments forward.
</P>
<P>
China cannot catch up with the advanced world levels simply by
introducing foreign armaments, he says. It should develop hi-tech
weapons of its own through a combination of development and
renovations.
</P>
<P>
The army's automatic command system should improve efficiency,
providing a solid base for both scientific and efficient decision
making, he notes.

<P>
Fu says the PLA must carry out Jiang Zemin's orders to study
the characteristics and laws of management, military struggles,
and national defense, and that in the new historical period, the
army must pay attention to two things: technology on the
battlefield and the progress of reforms, opening-up, and the
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
With the extensive application of the latest technology,
especially information technology, to the military, future wars
will be fought with technology in weapons and command.
</P>
<P>
And, because the PLA forces are not up to date in concepts of
war, staff qualifications, and weapons, this is a serious
challenge for military reforms, he says.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, opening-up, and socialist market economy have
breathed new life into the military, but have also brought
problems. Some PLA policies lag behind the market economic
developments, making reforming the troops even more necessary, he
says.
</P>
<P>
The laws of military management in relation to military reforms
is a profound revolution in the military, he says, and some old
concepts are hindering the reforms, and urges the soldiers to
change their ideas under the guideline of Mao Zedong Thought, Deng
Xiaoping Theory, and Jiang Zemin's instructions on army work,
while absorbing useful ideas from elsewhere.

Fu stresses that a major part of military work is administering
the army in accordance with the law and standardizing the
military. The military in the new era needs a high-degree of
standardization and steps should be taken to do this.
</P>
<P>
If the military is not run in strict accordance with the law, a
slip of the hand and the push of a button could mean defeat or
lead to destruction, he says.
</P>
<P>
It is important that we catch up with global military
developments, administer the military in accordance with the law,
and standardize the military in case of future wars, which will
combine sea, air, and land battles by electronic means, requiring
perfect coordination, he stresses.
</P>
<P>
In future, high-tech wars could erupt suddenly and require
various operations and a high degree of combat readiness and quick
reaction, Fu notes.
</P>
<P>
He says that from now to the mid-21st century will be an
important period of national defense and military development, so
the military should rally more closely around the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, hold the banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory high, and build the military into a strong,
modern, and standardized force.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Build More Low Cost Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Building Society
(ZBS) has said it has allocated 400 million Zimbabwean Dollars
(25 million U.S. Dollars) for construction of low cost houses
this year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by ZBS Managing Director Francis Nhema
Saturday while opening the institution's regional administration
center and main banking hall in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Financial shortages that have forced most established building
societies in the country to suspend housing projects.
</P>
<P>
Nhema said since its inception in 1992, the country's first
black-owned building society had invested more than 1.5 billion
Zimbabwean Dollars (90 million U.S. Dollars) in provision of
housing for Zimbabwe's tens of thousands low income earners.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is now difficult to meet the national vision of
housing for all by the year 2000, we are still fighting hard that
when we reach the year, at least the target will not be too far
off," said Nhema.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Invites U.S. Troops to Replace UNPREDF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
Saturday called for U.S. troops to replace the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Forces (UNPREDF) in his country.
</P>
<P>
The request, made in an interview aired by the country's
national television, was out of his concerns over the growing
ethnic tension in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
About half of the 700-strong UNPREDF are Americans. And its
U.N. Security Council mandate is to expire on August 31.
</P>
<P>
If Washington doesn't want to send troops, Gligorov was quoted
as saying by reports from the Macedonian capital of Skoplje, the
UNPREDF's mandate should be extended by at least six months.
</P>
<P>
He called for a political solution in Kosovo, noting that
neither crackdown nor intervention can resolve the problem there.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian president also expressed deep concerns over new
Western sanctions against Belgrade, saying such punitive move will
inevitably inflict harms to neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
He criticized recent demonstrations by ethnic Albanians in
Macedonia in support of their counterparts in Kosovo.

DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 people were feared drowned
and over 100 others were injured when two boats capsized in a
violent storm in the Kalpetua river in southwest Bangladesh on
Friday afternoon, press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two launches, each carrying about 100 passengers against
their capacity of 50, went down in the river in Satkhira, some 170
km southwest of here, when a tornado hit the region, survivors
were quoted as saying.
</P>

The two launches capsized within a distance of one km during
the storm that swept over Satkhira, Chuadanga and Kushita
districts.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had recovered 25 bodies from the river and the
launches were salvaged Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"More than two-thirds of the passengers swam ashore after the
accidents, while the others were drowned or missing," a police
official said.
</P>
<P>
A survivor said the driver of one of the launches ignored
passengers' calls for a halt when the storm came.

A three-member committee, led by the additional district
magistrate, has been formed to probe the accident, the reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Hospitality Industry to Change Strategy to Maintain Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis sweeping
Southeast Asian countries has cast a shadow over Beijing's hotel,
forcing them to pay more attention to attracting domestic
customers, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Customers from Chinese mainland have already accounted for 43
percent of the Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing hotels business,
general manager Dominic Wong said, but that proportion would
increase to 55 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of tourist and business travelers will
definitely be hit by the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, which
gradually shows its impact, this year.
</P>
<P>
Since tourism is an "expensive exercise," it will be one of the
first things abandoned by people if they run into financial
problems, he said, adding that business people from Southeast Asia
will also cut their trips to China if their business is hit by the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that Beijing average hotel occupancy rate and
prices would suffer double-digit declines though the crisis'
impact on local hotel business would not so damaging as in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
To offset the impact, he said, the hotel will adopt a flexible
pricing strategy and improve its services to consolidate its
customer resources, in addition to adjusting its traditional
business strategy, from just focusing on individual business
travelers to groups.
</P>
<P>
Another hotel, the Beijing International Club Hotel (BIC),
ITT's Sheraton's only investment in china, is confident that its
prospects are good despite the general gloom in the hotel market
provoked by the Southeast Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese economic outlook is still looking strong with many
new projects starting every day, and business is still looking
very good," said Katie Benson, the BIC hotel's general manager.
</P>
<P>
Benson admitted the financial crisis in Southeast Asia will
lead to a decline in tourist coming into China, but she did not
think it would have much impact on her hotel's business.
</P>
<P>
The hotel mainly targets government delegations, top managerial
staff and individual travelers who need luxuriously appointed
accommodation and top-quality personal services.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the stable economic growth of China, ITT Sheraton
regards it as one of the most important countries in its business
development strategy.

<HEADLINE> Drought Reduces Longan Yield in Northern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 rai (8,000
hectares) of longan orchards in Thailand's northern province of
Lampang will produce the worst yield in a decade due to heavy
drought, Sunday's Bangkok Post quoted a local agricultural
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
This will bring heavy losses to the local growers, who have
spent much on more expensive chemical fertilizers and will have to
spend more to dig wells for their trees to survive the drought,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some growers predicted that their income this year will shrink
by as much as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lampang Governor Chalermphol Pratheepavanit said on
Saturday that he had ordered the province's 13 district chiefs to
distribute sand bags to every village so that its people could
block the main waterways and store water for farming and home use.
</P>
<P>
The governor predicted that the drought, a result of the El
Nino weather phenomenon, will become critical next month,
affecting the province's main water source, the Wang river.

NEW DELHI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Equities failed to maintain its
initial gains on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the
week as bulls later turned cautious with the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) falling short of a clear majority in the Lower House
of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Another factor is BJP's Tamil Nadu allies' hesitancy to commit
support in writing to the proposed coalition.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index rose to 3,807.1 at close on Monday but
later dipped to 3,691.20 during Wednesday's trade, before ending
the week at 3,716.50 as against last weekend's close of 3,708.58,
netting a modest gain of 7.92 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index was fractionally down at 1,602.95 at the
weekend from the previous weekend's close of 1,603.54. The BSE-200
and US dollar index were quoted slightly lower at 354.34 and
149.31 compared with the last weekend close of 355.12 and 149.76
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade was low at 48,770.2 million rupees
(1,266.76 million US dollars) as compared with last week's
turnover of 59,261.8 million rupees (1,539.27 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional investors and domestic institutions
preferred to keep away from the market due to the stalemate on the
political front.

BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since early March, called
on China's educational circles to offer a helping hand for the

</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the country has 1,020

Prof. Liu Zhongshu, an NPC deputy and president of Jilin
University.
</P>
<P>
Yu Jianhua, a professor at Liaoning University of Engineering

should open free or low-cost training courses for laid-off workers
in evenings or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zixuan, an economics professor from Beijing University,

<HEADLINE> Sino-Latin American Trade Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Latin American trade is
expected to keep growing, according to today's "Business Weekly."
</P>
<P>
Last year witnessed a massive growth in Chinese exports to the
region of 47.7 per cent, bringing the total to 4.6 billion
U.S. Dollars, while the imports from Latin American also went up,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper called it a significant achievement for China, which
has been trying since 1990 to diversify its export markets, which
are currently concentrated in Asia, North America and Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The growth in Sino-Latin trade will be sustained by the steady
economic growth of both Latin America and China, said an official
from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the economies of China and the Latin
American countries are highly complementary and further trade and
economic cooperation potential are yet to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
A 20-day fact-finding mission of the China Chamber of Commerce
of Machinery and Electronic Product Importers and Exporters to
Brazil, Argentina and Chile drew the conclusion that Latin America
has a particularly large demand for machinery and electronic
imports.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports of machinery and electronic products to the
region only make up a small proportion of such Chinese
exports. The ratio stood at two percent in 1996 and about 2.7
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Long distances, high transportation costs, lack of after-sales
services and little understanding of local needs are among the
major reasons for the limited volume of trade, the paper says.

The open-ended Richter scale measures the total energy released
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on
seismographs.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Greg Rusedski clocked the
fastest serve ever on the ATP Tour as he powered his way into the
final of the Champions' Cup in Indian Wells, California on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded Briton recorded a 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 win over
Austria's former world No. 1 Thomas Muster, securing his final
spot against either seventh-seeded Chilean Marcelo Rios or
American new comer Jan-Michael Gambill.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski slammed down a 239.8-km effort in the 11th game of the
first set, the fastest serve ever recorded in the ATP tournament.
</P>
<P>
As always, Rusedski said he was more pleased with his victory
than with the record, saying "If I would have hit 149 and lost
the match, I would be very disappointed."
</P>
<P>
Rusedski overpowered on his serve, putting 73 percent of his
first serves in play and winning 33 of 36 first serve points.
</P>
<P>
He lost only three points on his serve in the first set and
only four points in the second as he stormed into his first-ever
final of a 'Super Nine' event.

<HEADLINE> Tyre Sector Faces Tough Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Tariff cuts, cancellation of the
consumption tax and favorable loans are needed soon to maintain
the viability and profitability of domestic tyre producers, say
industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
"Tariff rates of 20 percent on rubber imports, 10 percent
consumption tax on tyre sales plus repayments of heavy bank loans
are imposing amounting pressure on domestic tyre producers," Ju
Hongzhen, vice-president of the China United Rubber Corp, said in
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Ju warned that the state tyre manufacturers would see their
market share shrink significantly if the central government takes
no measures to help them.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the century, as much as 80 percent of the market
for radial tyres used for cars is expected to be in the hands of
the foreign-funded ventures," Ju said.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that at present, there are at least 30
foreign-funded tyre producers in China.
</P>
<P>
Ju gave an advice for domestic enterprises to develop radial
tyres used by heavy-duty trucks, and for bias tyre producers to
increase product variety and improve quality to keep competitive.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the output of motor vehicles used for transportation
in rural areas hit 2.6 million, "spawning an enormous market for
Medium-sized or small tyre producers," Ju said.
</P>
<P>
Xie Mingzhi, an expert with the Nanfang Rubber Group Corp, said
stimulus is also urgently needed to boost tyre exports, which have
yet to be seriously hurt by the financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Overcapacity in the domestic market and appreciation of the
renminbi would mean tough times ahead for tyre exporters," Xie
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China has exported about 6.5 million
tyres annually on average, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of its
total output. Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa are the
major destinations of tyre shipments.

HAVANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A former U.S. diplomat said here
Saturday the opposition to the U.S. economic sanction against Cuba
is growingly strong in his country.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Smith, former head of the U.S. Office of Interests in
Cuba, told the Cuban press that also stronger is the call for
lifting the embargo of food and medicine to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Smith was in a group of U.S. businessmen and former officials
staying here since Wednesday for a week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials have already acknowledged the failure
of the so-called Helms-Burton Act, which was signed into law by
President Bill Clinton on March 12, 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Initially designed to further tighten up the grip on the Cuban
people, the U.S. legislation is totally counter-productive for the
very interests of the United States, the former diplomat said.

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States national
soccer team levelled with Paraguay 2-2 on Saturday in a friendly
game at San Diego, California as both squads were tuning up for
the World Cup finals to be started in June in France.

minute, heading in Eric Wynalda's well-executed curving corner
kick from the right wing.
</P>

San Diego native Marcelo Balboa scored from near the penalty spot
with a diving header from almost ground level off a left-side
cross from Alexi Lalas.

<P>
MADRID, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov
has left Barcelona to nullify his contract which would run to June
30, club officials confirmed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The club had cancelled the contract of 32-year-old Stoichkov
"by mutual consent", the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov, the 1994 European Player of the Year, had been at
Barcelona for seven of the last eight seasons and was part of the
side which won the 1992 European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov had been unhappy at the club since Dutch coach Louis
van Gaal took over last summer.
</P>
<P>
The pair have clashed frequently and the final straw for van
Gaal came last week when Stoichkov travelled to Argentina without
club permission to play in a friendly international.

<HEADLINE> Rice Output Up in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Peru increased rice output and
reduced the import of the crop in the last three years, the
Agriculture Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The area cultivated with rice was up 17.9 percent, from 203,196
hectares in 1995 to 239,625 hectares in 1997, bringing the output
to the historic high of 1,459,500 metric tons.
</P>
<P>
As results, rice imports last year were down 43 percent from
the previous year, to a total of 234,124 tons; and further down 55
percent in the first two months of this year, to 26,900 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry attributed the drop of imports to the
measures taken by the government to protect the home agriculture,
including a 12 percent tariff and an additional 5 percent surtax.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at the beginning of this year, the government
decided to suspend the imports of rice from 51 countries where the
cultivation were affected by pest.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland defeated second-seeded American Lindsay Davenport 6-3,
6-4 on Saturday to win the 1.25 million U.S. dollars Evert Cup
tennis championship held at Indian Wells, California.
</P>
<P>
Hingis captured her second title of the year by winning the
battle between the world's top two players. She earned 205,000
dollars for the victory as she wrapped up her 16th career singles
title.
</P>
<P>
It was Hingis' second revenge match in two days. On Friday,
she eliminated, at the semifinals, eighth-seeded American teenager
Venus Williams, who beat the top-ranked player in January. Last
month, Davenport sent Hingis to her second loss of the season in
the final of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Hingis improved to 15-2 this season and 6-4 lifetime against
Davenport. Earlier this year, she captured her fourth Grand Slam
title in two years at the Australian Open. Hingis finished last
season with 12 singles titles overall, including three Grand Slam
titles.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, 21, who lost for only the fourth time in 20 matches
this season, failed to reap her 15th career singles title.

<P>
HEERENVEEN, Netherlands, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending world
champion Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann of Germany shattered on Saturday
women's 3,000-meter speedskating world record.
</P>
<P>
She clocked 4 minutes 5.08 seconds during a race of the current
World All-Round Speedskating Championships.
</P>
<P>
The previous mark was 4:07.13 held by another German skater
Claudia Pechstein since the Hamar World Cup race.
</P>
<P>
This is the first world record to fall at this year's
Heerenveen championships. Yet both men's and women's race
leaders, Ids Postma of the Netherlands and Niemann-Stirnemann, are
likely to better the listed world records for the all-round
speedskating events.

<P>
HEERENVEEN, Netherlands, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending
champion Ids Postma not only tightened his grip on the world title
but also moved within easy reach of breaking the world record at
the World All-Round Speedskating Championships on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World titlist Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann fared even better as the
German skater broke a world record while more than closing her
grip on the world title.
</P>
<P>
Niemann-Stirnemann clocked 4 minutes 5.08 seconds in the day's
3,000-meter race for the new world mark, shattering the previous
one of 4:07.13 held by countrywoman Claudia Pechstein.
</P>
<P>
Postma beat compatriot Rintje Ritsma by one hundredth of a
second in the nail-biting men's 1,500-meter race, finishing 1
minute 48.85 seconds ahead of Ritsma's 1:48.86.
</P>
<P>
He now leads the men's pack with 112.072 points, followed by
Ritsma and KC Boutiette of the United States on 112.924 and
114.331 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Postma's accumulated total may well break the listed world mark
of 155.966 points posted by Japan's Keiji Shirahata who created it
last January during the Japanese national championships at Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Niemann-Stirnemann also improved her opportunity for yet
another world mark en route to defending her world title by
finishing first in both of Saturday's races of the 1,500 and 3,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
She now garnered a leading total of 120.979 points, followed by
two other Germans, Pechstein and Anni Friesinger on 121.099 and
122.668 points.
</P>
<P>
Niemann-Stirnemann clocked 1:58.69 in the shorter race.
</P>
<P>
The German skater also holds the current world record of
165.708 points for the all-round total.
</P>
<P>
Only the top 16 skaters from the previous three races will be
eligible for Sunday's grand finale of the men's 10,000 meters and
women's 5,000 meters.

<HEADLINE> EU Drops World Cup Threat to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the European
Union (EU) who were holding a two-day imformal meeting in
Edinburgh Saturday, dismissed the idea of kicking Yugoslavia out
of this year's soccer World Cup finals as a sanction against
Yugoslavia over the Kosova crisis.
</P>
<P>
Swedish foreign minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen, who is attending
the meeting, suggested on Friday expelling Yugoslavia's national
soccer team if Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic failed to
open talks with Kosovans on the autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany all
raised objections to the move.
</P>
<P>
British foreign secretary Robin Cook told a news conference
that a World Cup ban was not within the competence of the EU while
German foreign minister Klaus Kinkel said political sports
boycotts had not produced the desired results in the past.
</P>
<P>
French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine pointed out that the
idea had been dropped by the six-nation Contact Group at its
meeting in London last Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting urged Milosevic to open negotiations or face
further sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Santiago Promoting Electric Cars, Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean capital of Santiago
is promoting the use of electric cars and bicycles as alternatives
to conventional fuel-powered automobiles.
</P>
<P>
As part of an experiment, three electric cars and two electric
bicycles started from Saturday moving around the city's streets
and parks, and would be there for 30 and 60 days.
</P>
<P>
"We want to call for a public bidding to put into operation
more electric cars and also bicycles after we see the results in
the practice," Santiago Mayor Jaime Cavinet told the press.
</P>
<P>
Electricity-powered vehicles are environmental friendly, as
they emit no pollutants into the air. And the technology is
vigorously pursued in the United States and European nations.
</P>
<P>
In Santiago's case, the electric cars are provided by the Eco
Car Electric S.A., and are powered by six or eight rechargeable
batteries capable of running up to seven hours between recharges.
</P>
<P>
The cars can carry two or four persons and reach a speed of 25
miles, or 40 kilometers, per hour.
</P>
<P>
The two bicycles will substitute for the motorcycles in the
parks.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Drachmas' Entry Into ERM Useful For Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said Saturday night that the drachma's entry into the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) would lead the country's
economy to strong development.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation shortly after the decision taken
by the European Union member state ministers and central bank
governors to include the Greek national currency into the EU's
ERM, Simitis stressed that this would be able to win increased
international trust and recognition of the prospect of Greece's
entry to the final stage of the European Monetary Union (EMU),
which would allow Greece to participate in the decision-making
processes.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Greek people, just like its European partners, to
trust the decision the government has made.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers said in a joint communique that the Greek
drachma's new parity to the European currency unit (ECU) as of
Saturday would be at 357.00 drachmas against one ECU.
</P>
<P>
The 14-percent devaluation would fortify the drachma and lead
to lower interest rates, a development which would lower the
national debt and would lead the Greek economy to self-sustaining
growth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not to Sponsor Resolution Critical of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
has decided to give up its bid to sponsor a U.N. resolution
critical of China's human rights record in spite of mounting
pressure from Congress.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Eric Rubin told AP Saturday that the U.S.
decision came after China agreed to sign the Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, a move hailed here as a significant step
forward.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of a number of positive developments in the
human rights situation in China," Rubin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told a
press conference Thursday that his country was prepared to ink the
pact, which guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, religion
and expression.
</P>
<P>
Both the White House and the State Department responded
positively to the Chinese announcement, saying it would have
"significant" impact on moves to be taken by the U.S. at the
upcoming Geneva meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The comment was seen as a hint of no more bid to seek a censure
on China as the U.N. Human Rights Commission prepares to meet next
week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate passed a resolution Thursday, urging the
Clinton administration to come forward with an anti-China
resolution at the Geneva meeting. But the administration cited
sights of improvement in China's human rights situation to justify
its intention to head off confrontation with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Bill Clinton expressed satisfaction at
China's "swift and firm" response to U.S. concerns about a
possible sale of chemical to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced that he decided to move up his trip to China
to June to maintain the momentum of improvement in relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The president cited China's response as an "example" for
cooperation on nonproliferation, standing firmly on his early
certification to Congress that China abides by the principles of
nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
The certification, if not rejected by Congress, will result in
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars of nuclear equipment sales to
China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's bid can be overturned only if both houses of Congress
vote to disapprove it. Outcome seems unlikely because only a few
days remain before certification becomes final under a
congressionally-mandated deadline, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided not to censure China on human rights this year
after it realized that it might be more isolated among its allies
if it stands where it was as the European Union decided earlier to
back off.
</P>
<P>
The annual resolution sought by the U.S. and its Western allies
since 1990 has never been adopted by the 53-member U.N.
commission. Even the senators who pushed hard for such a
resolution have admitted that the prospect became dimmer this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post aired Saturday the belief that the
administration is seeking a new policy toward China on the human
rights issue by pressing Beijing to sign international human
rights covenants.
</P>
<P>
"We have determined there are other, more promising ways to
pursue improving the human rights situation," Rubin of the White
House said.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Proposes to Streamline Traffic Bans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, has proposed that EU member
states wishing to limit the time when lorries may travel on roads
should observe a harmonized system.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal by the EU executive, the system should
require its member states to notify the commission of any plans
they may have in this realm, according to European Report, a
newsletter published in Brussels Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The commission's proposal seeks to guarantee unimpeded movement
of goods from one member state to another, while recognizing the
justification for some national restrictions in the light of
environmental, social and safety considerations.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive also wants the harmonized system to focus on
the period and traffic times as well as on the types of vehicles
and operations concerned. The system should also include night
bans on noisy lorries as well as a series of specific exemptions,
according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
European Report said the proposal is in part a reaction to the
present confusion caused by a lack of coordination between the
bans on lorries at weekends and during public holidays.
</P>
<P>
This type of ban is being applied in seven EU member states --
Germany, Austria, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
However, the systems differ considerably from one country to
another. The holiday periods, the time when the ban starts and
ends, exemptions and the category of lorries involved vary
considerably, with the result that hauliers are finding it
difficult to plan their journeys properly.

<HEADLINE> Annan Begins Middle East Trip Next Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is going to visit the Middle East next week to shore up
support for his recent agreement with Iraq on arms inspections,
U.N. officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The visit will last nine days with stops in Jordan, Egypt,
Lebanon, Syria, Palestinian-controlled Gaza and Israel, but no
agenda has been fixed, said the officials who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief will spend several days at the U.N. headquarters
in Geneva before he begins his trip to the region next Wednesday,
the officials told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who successfully averted a threatened U.S. and British
military strike against Iraq, will mainly brief leaders of
governments in the region of his deal with the Iraqi government on
February 23 as well as the recent progress in the U.N. weapons
inspections in Baghdad, Annan's aides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. chief has denied that he is going to take a role
in the Middle East peace process, launched in Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Annan's aides said that his visit is part of his duty of
visiting every region of the world as the U.N. chief at the
invitation of governments.
</P>
<P>
Annan was to go to the Middle East last month but finally
postponed the trip because of the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the Middle East conflict is concerned, the parties
have a mediator," Annan said during his visit to Washington
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the United States: it is President Clinton, Mrs Albright
(Secretary of State) and Dennis Ross (the State Department's chief
negotiator for the Middle East)," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes "a multiplicity of mediators often
confuses the issue."

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President on Relations With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir instructed Saturday the relevant ministries to make
necessary arrangements for reconsidering the status of the
Egyptian interests on the Sudanese territories.
</P>
<P>
The instructions are in line with the policies of the Sudanese
government which seek to remove all the long-standing obstacles
that had hindered the development of the bilateral ties, the
Sudanese News Agency quoted Al-Bashir as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government closed the Egyptian schools and the
Khartoum branch of Cairo University, and confiscated some Egypt's
property on its territory when the bilateral ties were
strained over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had accused Sudan of sheltering Egyptian militants bent
on installing a strict Islamic state in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Cairo also accused Khartoum of supporting an attempt to kill
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in
1995. Sudan denied the charge and blasted Egypt for letting in
members of Sudanese opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
However, the bilateral relations began improving over the past
few months. After a hiatus of more than three years, Egypt resumed
the river Nile navigation from the Egyptian High Dam to the
Sudanese port of Halfa in mid-February, a move hailed by both
sides as a sign of improving relations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir phoned the Egyptian president on Friday and hailed
the noticeable improvement of the bilateral relations, indicating
Sudan's desire to push its ties with Egypt forward.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will
hold talks with his Sudanese counterpart Mustafa Ismail in Cairo
on March 23 on the sidelines of meetings of the Arab League
Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Goweili met with Sudanese
Minister of Trade Osman el-Hadi, who is now visiting here.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed ways of increasing the volume of trade
exchange between the two countries, said Goweili after the talks.

<HEADLINE> EU Monetary Officials Locked in Drachma Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior European Union (EU)
monetary officials were locked in talks Saturday over how to allow
the Greek currency drachma to make its debut in the planned
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Greece Friday asked other EU member states to let the drachma
enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), part of its bid to gain
market credibility and improve its chances of joining Europe's
much-vaunted single currency.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Sweden and Denmark have announced not to join the
first wave of EMU countries while Greece, struggling with high
inflation, is having difficulty in meeting the EU's rigorous
qualification criteria. The EMU is scheduled to be launched on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece wants to show its enthusiasm about EMU by
signing up first to the European Monetary System's ERM.
</P>
<P>
The EU's secretive monetary committee, composed by senior
finance ministry and central bank officials from the 15 EU member
states, was still discussing at what rate the drachma could come
into the ERM after meeting for over four hours in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
A Greek Finance Ministry official was quoted as saying that
central bankers wanted to devalue the drachma by 14 percent but
politicians were pressing for less.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Greece's request for ERM entry, and the
likely drachma devaluation, could trigger a broader realignment of
other EU moneys already within the ERM basket.
</P>
<P>
Months of speculation that the ERM could be realigned ahead of
EMU's January 1999 launch had focused on a possible revaluation of
the Irish punt which has traded well above its bilateral central
rate against the German mark.
</P>
<P>
However, Greek and Irish officials earlier refused to make any
comment as they arrived for the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges U.S. Devotion to Mideast Peace-making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Saturday called upon the United States, the main sponsor of
the Mideast peace process, to exert more efforts to restart the
long-stalled process.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the U.S. to take action when it is not too
late," Moussa told reporters after Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak held talks with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat on overcoming obstacles facing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt is also waiting to see the results of the
contacts as British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is taking to the
Mideast a European initiative on reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"What matters is how to deal with the Israeli rejection of
implementing the Oslo agreements and other relevant resolutions,"
said Moussa, adding that there will be a number of alternatives if
the European initiatives fail.
</P>
<P>
"But we are waiting for what the current contacts will result
in, specially as regards the stance to be adopted by the U.S. in
its capacity as the main peace sponspor that is responsible for
making a drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated mediation by the U.S. and other parties, the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked for nearly a
year over Israeli construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo on Saturday afternoon, a day before
Cook launches his six-leg tour of the region to float the European
initiative that calls on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and
halt Jewish settlement activities, while urging the Palestinians
to guarantee Israeli security demands.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor of Cairo for consulations with
Egyptian leaders on Mideast peace, came here amid rampant Arab
unrest in the Palestinian self-rule areas over the killing of
three Palestinian workers by Israeli soldiers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Despite those events, the Palestinian side will remain
committed to the signed agreements, Arafat told reporters upon
his arrival, urging the world community to put pressure on the
Israeli government to comply with these U.S.-brokered
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will leave for Doha to attend the Islamic foreign
ministers meetings scheduled to open on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> EU Wants Tougher Checks on Goods Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, wants all lorries and
utility vehicles to meet uniform roadworthiness and maintenance
standards.
</P>
<P>
A draft directive, which the EU executive has recently
unveiled, was an attempt to bridge existing gaps in the inspection
mechanism already applied throughout Europe, according to European
Report, a newsletter published in Brussels Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This system requires an annual technical inspection of heavy
goods vehicles used for road transport, said the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The draft directive provides for the 15 EU member states to
carry out additional random inspections of these vehicles on the
roads, in ports, in parking areas or in hauliers' own premises.
</P>
<P>
If an inspection reveals that a vehicle fails to meet standards
for safety and environmental protection and consequently
constitutes a major risk for its occupants or other road-network
users, it may immediately be ordered off the road.
