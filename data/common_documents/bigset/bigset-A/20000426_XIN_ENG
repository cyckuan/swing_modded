<HEADLINE> hke042573--ADB: Asia Becomes Again World's Fastest Growing Region (Embargoed Till 03:00 GMT, April 26) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Fueled by strong domestic demand
and favorable external conditions, Asia will continue to be the
fastest growing region in the world in 2000 with an economic
growth rate of 6.2 percent, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Recovery in Asia was robust during 1999. The transformation of
developing Asia from the financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 to the
world's fastest growing region has exceeded all expectations,"
said the Manila-based bank in its "Asian Development Outlook 2000"
released here.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it took developing Asia less than two years
to return to the pre-crisis level of industrial production.
</P>
<P>
"In early 1999, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent was
forecast for the region," it said. "This was revised to 5.7
percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, and the actual outcome for
the year have exceeded 6 percent (or 6.2 percent)."
</P>
<P>
But the bank said the recovery has been uneven across
developing Asia, and South Korea was particularly strong with its
gross domestic product (GDP) growing by 10.7 percent in 1999 from
a negative rate of 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
China maintained a robust growth rate of 7.1 percent in 1999
and India registered a 5.9 percent GDP growth rate in the year,
compared to a 6.8 percent increase in the previous year, the ADB
said.
</P>
<P>
The newly industrialized economies, namely, South Korea,
Singapore, and China's Hong Kong and Taiwan, rebounded strongly in
1999 and their averaged GDP growth was 7 percent compared with
negative growth of 1.9 percent in 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB noted that Southeast Asia's recovery has proved more
rapid than anticipated and the GDP growth rate for the region was
3.2 percent in 1999 in sharp contrast to a negative rate of 7.5
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
South Asia continues to be a strong performer in 1999, largely
because of the strength of the Indian economy, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in the sub-region was 6.2 percent and 5.5 percent in
1998 and 1999 respectively," it said.
</P>
<P>
In India, the industry sector showed signs of an increase after
three years of sluggish performance in 1999, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Combined with increased exports and a weaker performance in
the agriculture sector," the bank said, "GDP growth was 5.9
percent in 1999."
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, the faster than expected recovery in Asia
last year was fueled a pickup in global demand for electronics,
which sparked an export boom in the region, and expansionary
policies and implementation of structural reforms, which further
stimulated domestic demand in the region.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of new policy measures to address corporate
and financial sector problems has helped to contain the level of
non-performing loans, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of the regional economy in 2000, the bank said
that at 6.2 percent, growth in the Asian region is expected to "
remain virtually unchanged" this year.
</P>
<P>
The newly industrialized economies would grow 6.5 percent this
year, somewhat lower than in 1999, primarily because of a decline
in South Korea's growth, where double-digit growth is not expected
to be sustained this year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
But in Southeast Asia, the economy would increase 4.6 percent
this year from last year's 3.2 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"This upward trend should be supported by the boom in the
electronics industry, continued economic growth in the United
States, likely upturn in Euro area, and the possible continued
recovery of the Japanese economy," the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, the bank said, the aggregate growth for 2000 is
forecast at 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth in India will increase 7 percent this year, with
industry and service sector growth remaining strong, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said, Asia's prospects for 2000 depend on
sustainability of domestic demand growth, "not only through growth
in consumption, but also an upturn in investment demand and
favorable global economic conditions."

<HEADLINE> ADB Urges Crisis-Affected Countries to Restructure Banks (Embargoed Till 03:00 GMT, April 26) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Wednesday urged Asia's crisis-affected countries to restructure
their insolvent banks either by closure, merger or
recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook 2000" released here, the bank
also asked the crisis-affected countries -- Indonesia, South Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, to improve corporate
governance, reduce market rigidities and de-regulate domestic
markets.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that improvement in financial market conditions
in these countries was impressive in 1999, but problems in the
corporate and financial sectors are threatening the sustainability
of their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The bank quoted analysts as estimating that as many as 60-85
percent of loans in Indonesia are non-performing, compared with 20-
30 percent in South Korea and Malaysia and 50-70 percent in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Official estimates of the share of non-performing loans (NPLs)
are much lower, but even these indicate a dramatic increase since
the onset of the financial crisis," the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the bank said, the sheer size of NPLs reflects the
poor health of the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that total financial restructuring cost for the
four worst-hit countries will reach 58 percent of GDP in Indonesia,
16 percent in South Korea, 10 percent in Malaysia and 32 percent
in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Distress in the financial sector and restructuring cost have
proved far larger than anticipated," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said crisis countries have made significant, if
intermittent, progress toward financial and corporate reform.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is much more to be done. The biggest risk
facing the region is complacency," it said.
</P>
<P>
As markets recover and foreign investors return, it said, the
momentum for further reform is weakened.
</P>
<P>
"With the growing opposition from vested interests, the risks
of back-tracking are high," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank appealed to the crisis-affected countries to
strengthen on-going reforms, improve governance in the short term,
and reduce fiscal imbalances and develop financial markets in the
longer term.
</P>
<P>
Crisis-affected countries need to restructure insolvent
financial institutions, either by closure, merger or
recapitalization, it said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Describes Poverty as Asia's Formidable Challenge (Embargoed Till 03:00 GMT, April 26) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Wednesday that poverty reduction is a formidable challenge
Asia has to face in the 21st century and countries in the region
must adopt a new strategy to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Developing Asia enters the new century with an enormous
challenge: to improve the quality of life for the hundreds of
millions of its citizens who still live in poverty," said the ADB
in the "Asian Development Outlook 2000" released here.
</P>
<P>
According to the most common international definition of
poverty -- those who live on less than a dollar income measured in
purchasing-power-parity dollars -- about 900 million people in
Asia were poor in 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"That is about twice as many poor people as in the rest of the
developing world combined," it said.
</P>
<P>
Using a more generous poverty threshold of two dollars a day,
almost two billion people, the majority of Asia's population, are
poor, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said, since the financial crisis hit East
and Southeast Asia, poverty in the region has jumped by at least
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the bank said, despite the so-called Asian miracle
in East and Southeast Asia, the Asian region faces a formidable
social challenge in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This challenge relates not only to poverty, but also to other
aspects of quality of life, such as health, education, environment
and internal disparities among social groups, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth remains
the best path to poverty reduction," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said Asian nations must adopt an anti-
poverty strategy that emphasizes the following:
</P>
<P>
-- Openness and market orientation. The economic and social
transformation of Asia must be based on a strategy of openness and
market orientation that is supported by prudent macro-economic
policies. This strategy will enable Asian countries to exploit new
economic opportunities in the integrated global economy, while
imposing policy discipline.
</P>
<P>
-- Investment in human and physical infrastructure. Investment
in human resource development and physical infrastructure are
vital components of Asia's anti-poverty strategy. These
investments not only directly improve Asia's quality of life, but
also boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
-- Improvement of governance. Asia's economies need better
governance, which has an instrumental role in ensuring that
governments adopt a policy framework that is responsive to people'
s needs.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening of social protection. A social safety net
becomes an important ingredient in reducing poverty, particularly
in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis. The need for
social safety nets may increase in the future as the risk of
income variability rises due to shocks from the global economy.

<HEADLINE> ADB Says China's Economy to Sustain Robust Growth (Embargoed Till 03:00 GMT, April 26) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Largely unaffected by the recent
Asian financial crisis, China's economy continued on its growth
path, registering a hefty 7.1 percent growth rate in 1999 compared
to 7.8 percent in the previous year, the Asian Development Bank (
ADB) said in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the "Asian Development Outlook 2000" released here, the bank
said China's gross domestic product (GDP) will rise by 6.5 percent
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's cautious approach to liberalization of capital controls
and a comfortable external financial position insulated it from
the worst of the contagion effects of the Asian crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
Fixed investment grew by 7.8 percent in 1999, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The March 1999 constitutional amendment to officially
recognize the role of private sector in the economy should improve
the prospects for private investment," it said.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's small fiscal deficits and modest public debt,
the bank said, the continuation of an expansionary fiscal policy
to pump-prime the economy in the face of deflationary trends is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The bank said China's marco-economic indicators, such as
inflation, short-term capital flows and the size of short-term
external debt relative to foreign exchange reserves, are much
stronger.
</P>
<P>
The recovery in the newly industrialized economies should
improve China's export prospects while the competitiveness of the
country's exports will be enhanced by domestic price deflation and
continued tax rebates, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the rapid growth of the economy, significant
expansion of employment opportunities, and impressive achievements
in poverty reduction in the last two decades, the population (of
China) has come to expect ever-improving economic conditions and
living standards," the bank said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Report: S.E. Asia to See Modest Growth in 2000 (Embargoed Till 03:00 GMT, April 26) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian economy is
expected to increase 4.6 percent in 2000 after registering a 3.2
percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate last year,
according to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) Report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The 2000 forecast for Southeast Asia is for a modest
strengthening of growth to 4.6 percent," the bank said in its "
Asian Development Outlook 2000" released here.
</P>
<P>
But this upward trend should be supported by the boom in the
electronics industry, continued economic growth in the United
States, the likely upturn in Euro area and the possibly continued
recovery in the Japanese economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that after an initially tenuous start, Southeast
Asia's recovery proved more rapid and broad-based than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
"The GDP growth rate for the subregion was 3.2 percent in 1999,
in sharp contrast to a negative growth of 7.5 percent in 1998.
Nevertheless, domestic consumption and investment on average,
remained well below the pre-crisis levels," the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the V-shaped recovery in the crisis countries in
the region can be viewed partly as a snapback given the sharp
negative growth in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, various positive factors, both domestic and
external, contributed to the recovery, including increased
consumption, stock rebuilding, massive fiscal stimulus, and loose
monetary policy," it said.
</P>
<P>
New policy measures to address corporate and financial problems
also supported the recovery, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of the sub-regional economies, the bank
predicted that Indonesia's GDP will grow 4 percent this year from
0.2 percent last year, and Malaysia's GDP from 5.4 percent last
year to 6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine economy will increase 3.8 percent in 2000 from 3.
2 percent last year, while the Thai economy will grow 4.5 percent
in 2000 from 4.1 percent last year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
But it said high non-performing loans and corporate debts are
threatening the sub-region's economic sustainability.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the biggest immediate challenge facing Thailand
is financial restructuring, in particular the problem of non-
peforming loans.
</P>
<P>
Although the level of Thailand's non-performing loans declined
from over 50 percent to 39 percent now, the problem continued to
hamper the financial sector, resulting in weak credit expansion,
it said.
</P>
<P>
"This could result in another wave of business closures and a
swelling in the ranks of the unemployed," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank called on Southeast Asian countries to speed up
reforms in the financial and corporate sectors to ensure a
sustainable recovery this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GDP to Grow by 4 to 5 Pct in 2000: (Embargoed Until 0300 GMT 26 April) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank said
Wednesday that the Philippines' gross domestic product (GDP) will
grow by 4 to 5 percent in 2000 as the economy continues its slow-
paced recovery.
</P>
<P>
Faced with weak consumer demand and a severe contraction in the
construction industry, the country's economy grew by 3.2 percent
in 1999, lower than other crisis-affected economies of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its annual Asian Development Outlook (ADO)
that the country's slow growth in 1999 "was primarily due to the
anemic performance of the industrial sector, which grew by only 0.
5 percent."
</P>
<P>
Conversely, agriculture experienced a strong recovery from the
El Nino drought of 1998, growing by 6.6 percent -- the highest
growth rate in decades.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADO, poor industrial performance was the
result of flat consumer demand, a contraction in the construction
sector which suffered from overcapacity and non-performing loans
that held down the growth in bank finance for new projects.
</P>
<P>
Services, which had remained resilient throughout the crisis,
grew by 3.9 percent in 1999, based on growth in retail trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the Philippines' economic situation continues to
reflect the adverse effects of Asia's financial crisis in 1997-
1998, said the ADO.
</P>
<P>
The ADO added that signs of slow recovery are evident in low
industrial activity, high unemployment, a high level of non-
performing loans, low demand for credit, low investment demand,
and a low level of foreign capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
The ADO is also concerned about the country's declining tax
revenues, quality of public expenditures, delays in reforming the
banking and financial sectors, slow progress in capital market
reforms, and a slow-moving privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The ADO observed that the country's solid economic growth in
the future is contingent on prudent macroeconomic management, high
export growth and favorable regional environment.
</P>
<P>
The ADO stressed that if the country's economy is to achieve
sustained growth, it must address three structural challenges --
poverty reduction, proper environmental management and provision
of adequate infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Indian Market Volatile?  By Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The recent sharp swings in
global markets caused by the fall of technology stocks have rocked
the Indian market, which has largely been driven by information
technology (IT) stocks for most of 1999 and early 2000.
</P>
<P>
The country's key market indicator, the Bombay Stock Exchange (
BSE) Sensex, which touched a record high of 6,150.69 on February
14, continued to decline and closed at 4,511.05 Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the sharp fall of some 168 points in Nasdaq
Monday, the BSE Sensex opened sharply down Tuesday at 4,336.64
points and crashed to the day's low of 4,284.17.
</P>
<P>
However, with a strong turnaround in heavy-weighted IT shares,
the Sensex bounced back with a vengeance and closed at 4,533.99,
netting a moderate gain of 22.94 points.
</P>
<P>
The recent stock market volatility in the country was mainly
due to the continued fall started on Nasdaq in reaction to views
expressed by leading stock analysts that Internet companies were
overvalued in relation to their earnings.
</P>
<P>
There was also a perception among local investors that India's
IT stocks were also overvalued, which triggered falls in domestic
IT stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sharp falls in IT stocks and in the overall market
spooked retail investors who were heavily investing in the IT
sector either directly or through mutual funds, causing them to
withdraw their investments, adding to the market's woes.
</P>
<P>
Bhupinder Sethi, associate vice-president of Dundee Mutual Fund,
said that one of the major factors causing Tuesday's volatility is
the unanimity in investors' inclination towards new economy stocks
and their shunning of old economy stocks. This has led to a huge
polarization in the markets.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said, unlike the dot.com firm in the
United States, Indian IT companies, which are basically software
developers, enjoy a high earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
What is happening here is just a panic reaction, they said,
adding that the fundamentals have not changed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Cooperation in Fighting Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Tuesday urged for close cooperation between African countries to
develop malaria vaccines and new drugs to combat malaria,
according to Kenya's Presidential Press Service.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists from the continent should constantly work as a team
and share research findings in order to jointly fight malaria," he
said when addressing the on-going African summit on malaria in
Abuja, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Moi emphasized the need for greater cooperation and partnership
between various national research institutions to avoid wastage of
resources or research duplication.
</P>
<P>
He urged member countries of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) to consider the creation of transnational institutions under
OAU to handle and harmonize their policies.
</P>
<P>
It is only through research carried out in Africa that various
health problems affecting Africans can be solved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, a mosquito-borne tropical epidemic, has become one of
the top killer diseases in Africa. About 500 million Africans are
infected by the disease every year.

<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government is preparing to draw up a new
foreign capital law to replace the existing one in a bid to attract
more international investment, reported Turkish Daily News on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Recep Onal announced Tuesday that the new law
will offer foreign investors opportunities that match those allowed
for domestic investment, thereby easing and encouraging foreign
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The move is another step taken by the Turkish government to
create a more favorable environment for foreign investment. By May
1999, the amount of direct foreign investments in Turkey reached
11.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government is adjusting its foreign trade
policy by slowly shifting its short-term focus to Turkey's southern
neighbors with which trade volume has remained low due to a U.N.
embargo on Iraq and strained relations with Iran and Syria,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A trade delegation of 100 Turkish businessmen headed by Economy
Minister Recep Onal will visit Damascus for the first official
Syrian-Turkish business meeting on May 7-12.
</P>
<P>
The contact with Syria will be followed by a similar move
directed at Iran which will host a Turkish trade delegation from
May 27 to June 1.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government has decided to compensate the
shareholders of the Egypt Company for Free Markets, the chairman of
the Capital Market Authority said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Hamid Ibrahim said the shareholders, who lost money due to
a government decision to halt the company's activity last year,
would receive compensation at 30 Egyptian pounds (8.7 U.S. dollars)
a share, in addition to 3 pounds (0.87 dollars) for each share in
profits.
</P>
<P>
The company had registered a total of 3.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The Egypt Company for Free Markets used to sell duty-free goods
to foreign visitors to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The U.S. Forbes magazine has listed three Turkish
companies among the 800 Giant companies of the world excluding U.S.
companies, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Koc Group occupies the 338th place with an annual revenue of
7 billion U.S. dollars. With a total of assets estimated at 6.484
billion dollars, the group currently has 37,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
The Sabanci Group is in the 446th place with a 5.2-billion-
dollar revenue. Its assets total 10.718 billion dollars and it
employs 28,400 people.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Oil Refinery Inc. took the 714th seat with a 3.2-
billion-dollar revenue. Its total assets amount to 1.212 billion
dollars and it employs 4,400 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Emergency Minister Sergei
Shoigu on Wednesday called for better treatment of the workers who
became invalids after cleaning up the Chernobyl nuclear accident
14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the 250,000 Russians who took part in the cleanup after the
Chernobyl disaster, 30,000 became invalids, the Interfax news
agency quoted Shoigu as saying at a memorial rally at Mitinskoye
cemetery in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we take care of them now, nobody will deal with the
consequences of disasters if something, God forbid, happens
tomorrow,"Shoigu said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 55,000 people who dealt with the consequences of the
Chernobyl disaster and died of radiation disease, 15,000 were
Russian citizens, Shoigu said.
</P>
<P>
The operation involved a total of 860,000 people, 250,000 of
them Russians.
</P>
<P>
"Our debt is irredeemable to those who gave their lives to
avert a terrible tragedy for the entire world," Shoigu said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Cabinet ministers and representatives of the
Belarussian and Ukrainian embassies laid wreaths on the graves of
those who fought the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster 14
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu said that thanks to reliability improvements made since
then, nuclear stations of the Chernobyl type are as safe as any
other.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Cypriot FMs Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Following the Athens talks
between Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and his Cypriot
counterpart,Ioannis Kasoulides, Athens and Nicosia Wednesday
believed that the time had come for substantive negotiations on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said after their talks that the cycle of the U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks between the two communities on the
divided island had closed.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that he would raise the Cyprus issue in
the talks he would have in New York with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides, who arrived here Wednesday to discuss
with Papandreou issues concerning the preparation of Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides' visit to Athens on May 19 for talks
with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, said that the period
started after the Helsinki EU summit last December was very
important for the future of Cyprus and that the time had come for
Turkey to also change its position on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the island, the two communities in Cyprus have held
two rounds of proximity talks in New York and Geneva respectively,
and the third such talks will take place in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Cyprus Republic-led by Clerides have maintained
that the Cyprus problem must be resolved on the basis of the
establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal federation in line with U.N.
resolutions, but Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots side led by Rauf
Denktash demand that northern Cyprus, illegally declared in 1983,
be recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification in the
form of a two-state confederation.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Iraq to Cooperate on Missing Kuwaitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Expressing its deep
concern over the plight of Kuwaitis missing since Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, the United Nations Security Council on
Wednesday urged Iraq to cooperate with the U.N. and resume
cooperation with all other agencies and bodies in dealing with
this issue.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council was briefed this
morning on the issue by the U.N.Coordinator for Missing Kuwaitis
and Kuwaiti property, Yuli Vorontsov.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, the Council expressed its support
for the Coordinator's future efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its hope that this issue would be dealt
with as a strictly humanitarian one by all sides concerned and
highlighted the valuable work of the International Committee of
the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The Council stressed the importance of dialogue among all
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait says about 605 people, including 550 Kuwaitis and the
rest of various nationalities, have been missing since the Iraqi
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov was Moscow's Ambassador to the United Nations from
1990-1994. He recently visited Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Marketing Season Begins Despite Boycott Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's 2000 tobacco marketing
season started at low note here on Wednesday amid calls for an
improved exchange rate and fears that commercial farmers would
withhold their crop due to farm invasions by war veterans.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Tobacco Sales Floor Pat Devenish said
that the slow start was largely due to the incorrect exchange rate
and farm invasions which had resulted in some farmers being chased
away and their workers beaten up.
</P>
<P>
"The prices were a little bit disappointing. I do not think the
crop we offered is a true cross section of the entire crop. I
believe there is better crop out there," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,000 bales were sold at Tobacco Sales Floor on
Wednesday, while the Burley Marketing Zimbabwe auction floors sold
850 bales.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Burley Producers Association Bruce
Searles said that he believed the growers were withholding their
crop waiting for the devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar.
</P>
<P>
The present exchange rate was discouraging, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bookings for Wednesday sales went down to 7,168 bales from the
expected 9,000 bales after the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
ordered its members not to sell their crop due to the prevalence
of civil disorder within the farming community.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a main tobacco market in the world and 220 million
kilograms of tobacco were expected to be sold this season against
last season's 196 kilograms.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Zambia to Fight Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) --The World Health Organization (WHO)
 Wednesday urged the Zambian government to prioritize and
strengthen its existing HIV/AIDS care programs apart from
developing feasible and achievable programs in the fight against
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Due to budgetary constraints, health institutions in the
country had continued to experience low staffing levels especially
in rural areas, said WHO acting country representative to Zambia
Kamau Thuo while officially opening a three-day workshop on
HIV/AIDS here.
</P>
<P>
The acute conditions of HIV/AIDS related cases had not been
fully attended to because of a critical shortage of patients' beds
in hospitals, a situation further compounded by a perpetual
shortage of drugs for treating opportunistic infections, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged participants of the workshop drawn from both
government health institutions and non-governmental organizations
to critically review the findings of the study on the magnitude of
HIV/AIDS in October last year with a view to consolidating the
health delivery system.
</P>
<P>
The health services could not be adequately improved without a
solid referral system, he stressed, calling on the participants to
come up with a feasible recommendation on the referral system.
</P>
<P>
The WHO would endeavour to support the initiatives for an
improved health care in the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Challenged to Invest in Air Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have been challenged to
invest appropriately in the air transport industry if the African
continent is to develop.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for member states to review their air transport
policies so as to ensure they are generally aligned to the ideals
and objectives of COMESA in liberalizing the aviation industry in
the region, said Zambian Transport and Communications Minister
Nkandu Luo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second COMESA meeting on the liberalization of
the aviation industry in Lusaka on Wednesday, Luo urged the quorum
to come up with regulations that would attract investment in areas
that would be pivotal in enhancing the development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The onus is on the quorum to come up with regulations that
will attract good investors and not Mafias who will come to make
money and destroy our resources at the expense of the safety of
our people in the sky," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said for the Free Trade Area (FTA) to be a reality, COMESA
should seriously assess progress made by member states in
implementing the program to liberalize air services.
</P>
<P>
The region needs advanced technology to cope with the growing
traffic demand to minimize the increasing rate of aircraft
accidents, she said, adding that this is not aimed at destroying
the aviation industry in the region but to foster its growth.
</P>
<P>
Luo called on COMESA to recognize similar efforts being made by
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in promoting a
project to provide increased safety in African skies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said the
liberalization of the air transport is a cardinal element in the
realization of the FTA in the region.
</P>
<P>
The program has provided an environment where adequate and
affordable air transport services would be made available to
enable movement of people and cargo among all the member states,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in several cases the number of flights between city
pairs has increased two-fold or even higher. Increased frequency
means increased trade and better service to passengers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged participants to come up with recommendations that
would constitute a major contribution to the process leading to
the launching of the FTA in October this year and propel COMESA
into a progressive and prosperous region in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Vows to Protect Foreigners' Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said here on Wednesday that his government will not allow the
invasion of private property owned by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that many foreigners who invested in land
in regions like Naivasha had created a lot of jobs for Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Moi called on Member of Parliament Stephen Ndichu to stop
advocating the Massai tribe to claim back their land in central
Kenya, cautioning him about the impact of his words and the
possibility of pitting different Kenyan communities against each
other over land occupation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president urged political parties not to incite
unrest for the interest of the party politics, stressing that
there are many problems facing Africa because leaders serve
selfish interests and quest for power at the expense of the
welfare of the people.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers to Fill Vacuum after Israeli Pullout: Lebanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Wednesday announced that international peacekeeping forces will
fill the vacuum in south Lebanon after Israel pulls out its troops
from south Lebanon by July, the Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel's pullout will not threaten the stability and security in
south Lebanon as some pessimists expect, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel's withdrawal, according to U.N. resolutions
425 and 426, is Lebanon's victory and Israel's defeat, adding
that "we should not reverse it as our defeat and the enemy's
victory."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the situation will be under control and the
Lebanese authorities will resume sovereignty over the sea, air and
land of the liberated areas.
</P>
<P>
"We will face a new era after the history wraps up an old page,
in which south Lebanon has been living in tension and fear every
day. So we are entitled to live happily with our victory." Hoss
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is expected
to be reinforced from the current 4,500 to 7,000 if it takes on the
peacekeeping task in south Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese leaders have never declared that Lebanese army will be
deployed in the vacated area in south Lebanon as "border guarder"
alongside the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has reiterated that it will not guarantee Israel's
security as Palestinian refugees will fight for the right to go
home. Some 360,000 Palestinians live in refugee camps in Lebanon as
a result of Arab-Israelis wars since Israel was created in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Israel has formally notified the United Nations that it was
determined to pull out its troops from south Lebanon completely by
July, with or without an agreement with Lebanon or its main power
broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone there in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its northern settlements from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Presidential Elections to Begin Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Head of Turkey's Constitutional
Court Ahmet Necdet Sezer and 12 members of the Grand National
Assembly (Parliament) will compete for presidency during Thursday's
first round of presidential elections, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented show of unity among Turkey's rival political
parties, the leaders of the five political parties represented in
the parliament, both in the ruling and the opposition camps, acted
in harmony Tuesday in nominating Sezer as their joint presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The nomination, bearing the signatures of 131 MPs in favor of
Sezer, was submitted to the parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 MPs from the five parties have, in their personal
capacity, applied for presidential candidacy, according to a list
of candidates. However, Islamist Deputy Speaker Vecdi Gonul was
reportedly to have withdrawn from the race Wednesday. The report
could not be confirmed independently.
</P>
<P>
Parliament is due to hold the first round of voting for the
country's next president on Thursday by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, presidential candidates must win at
least 367 votes in the 550-seat Parliament in the first or second
ballot in order to win election. The second round falls on May 1.
</P>
<P>
If all candidates fail to garner the required votes, a third
round of voting will be held on May 5. In this round the hurdle is
lowered to 276 votes.
</P>
<P>
If all the candidates failed again, then the two, who get the
most votes in the third round, will contest in the fourth round, in
which the winner must get 276 votes.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement can be reached in four rounds, new elections are
called immediately in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Parliament is set to choose the president over a maximum of four
rounds of voting that must conclude before President Suleyman
Demirel's seven-year term in office ends on May 16, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Offer Zimbabwe More Aid, Under Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday it is
planning to increase aid to the African nation of Zimbabwe for
land reforms over the next two years if it ended a wave of farm
occupations and agreed to fair transfer of land.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is ready to help the government of Zimbabwe but we are
not going to appease," a Reuters report quoted Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook as saying, ahead of talks with Zimbabwe ministers in
London on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cook declined to say whether he was optimistic about the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Time will tell whether the (Zimbabwean) delegation is here to
grandstand or to reach agreement," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is no fresh offer tomorrow there has always
been an additional 36 million pounds (about 58 million U.S.
dollars) potentially available to help with land reform and other
aid if the government of Zimbabwe cooperates," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
But Britain would insist that land reforms be carried out
within the rule of law, on the basis of a fair price offered to
farmers for their land, and that they benefit "rural poor and not
public officials with the right connections", Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"What that means in the immediate future is that the illegal
occupations must be stopped before any land reform starts."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe said earlier that Britain,
Zimbabwe's former colonial master, has a moral responsibility to
pay for land which he plans to take from white farmers for
redistribution to blacks.
</P>
<P>
He said the farmers' British forefathers stole the land from
indigenous blacks when they colonized the country in the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
Britain funded Mugabe's land redistribution program in the
1980s but stopped in the 1990s, saying it was now being used to
benefit his cronies and government supporters.

PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
visiting Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Wednesday
that France and Australia have turned a page of difficulties due
to France's nuclear tests in the South Pacific in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting at the Elysee presidential palace, the two
leaders also stressed the mutual interests in developing closer
ties.
</P>
<P>
``After a period in which our two countries experienced some
difficulties in their relations, the page is from now completely
turned,'' French officials quoted Chirac as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the political relations between the two countries
are excellent while economic and cultural relations are developing.
</P>
<P>
``Our two countries are turning toward the future and there are
many reasons for amplifying our cooperation,'' said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that Australia and France have showed their
cooperation during the East Timor crisis last year, when both
countries sent U.N.-auspiced peacekeeping troops to the island.
</P>
<P>
He praised French troops for building ``perfect entente'' with
the Australian commander of the peacekeeping force in East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Deficiencies of NPT Under Wide-Range Assault at 2000  Review Conference  By Xie Meihua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- As the 2000 Review
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) continues its general debate on
implementing the provisions of the Treaty, Sates parties have
expressed their disappointment over the deficiencies in the last
five years and urged further actions for the future.
</P>
<P>
Opened for signature in 1968, the Treaty entered into force in
1970. By January 2000, a total of 187 parties have joined the
Treaty, including the five nuclear weapons states.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Review Conference, which opened here Monday and is
scheduled to last until May 19, is the first to meet following the
Treaty's indefinite extension at the 1995 conference.
</P>
<P>
The main concerns expressed so far by the States parties are
related to the universality of the Treaty, unclear non-
proliferation and disarmament and nuclear weapons-free-zones.
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSALITY
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Decision on Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-
Proliferation and Disarmament encouraged all NPT States parties to
exert every effort to achieve universal adherence to this Treaty.
</P>
<P>
States parties share the common view that the last five years
witnessed some progress in this aspect with nine states joining
the Treaty: Andorra, Angola, Brazil, Chile, Comoros, Djibouti,
Oman, United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
But there are still four States that continue to remain
outside the Treaty: Cuba, India, Israel and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, following the South Asia nuclear tests, the
United Nations Security Council unanimously approved resolution
1172, which urged India, Pakistan, and all other States that have
not yet done so, to become parties to the NPT without delay and
without conditions. There are still no positive responses from
them so far.
</P>
<P>
NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION AND DISARMAMENT
</P>
<P>
States parties expressed their deep concern in the field of
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament in view of recent
developments.
</P>
<P>
The findings of 1995 that the proliferation of nuclear weapons
would seriously increase the danger of nuclear war remain even
more valid in the light of nuclear tests in South Asia, and there
remains broad and deep international support for the global non-
proliferation norms of the Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Progress towards further reductions in nuclear weapons remains
limited and the absence of global negotiations on nuclear
disarmaments continued to be a source of disappointment and
concern.
</P>
<P>
The States parties agreed in 1995 on a program of action
towards nuclear disarmament. The first measure towards
implementation of article VI of the Treaty was to complete
negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty(CTBT) no later
than 1996.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was opened for signature on 24 September 1996 and had
been signed by 155 States. Fifty-four States have ratified it. Of
the 44 states whose signature and ratification are essential for
the Treaty to enter into force, only 28 states have done so.
</P>
<P>
At the Conference on facilitating the Entry into Force of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which was held in October 1999 in
Vienna, ratifying and signatory States adopted a Final Declaration
calling on all signatory States to ratify the Treaty as soon as
possible, and urging those States whose ratification is required
for the CTBT's entry into force, but they have not done so.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, the U.S Senate failed to give its consent to
ratify the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
As regards the second measure identified in 1995 Conference, an
ad hoc committee to negotiate a non-discriminatory and universally
applicable convention banning the production of fissile material
for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices was
established by the Conference on Disarmament in 1998. Disagreement
over the program of work of the Conference has, however, prevented
the commencement of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
States parties strongly criticized the United States for
attempting to make changes to the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-
Ballistic Missile Systems(ABM) and its plan to deploy the national
missile defense system, saying these bids would have negative
consequences for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
NUCLEAR WEAPONS-FREE-ZONES
</P>
<P>
States parties agreed that some progress had been made since
1995 in consolidating existing nuclear weapons-free-zones and
establishing new such zones.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Treaty establishing a nuclear weapons-free-zone in
Southeast Asia entered into force in 1997; The Pelindaba Treaty
establishing a nuclear weapons-free-zone in Africa was signed in
1996, although progress has been slow in acquiring the 28
ratifications to bring the Treaty into force; negotiations to
establish a nuclear weapons-free-zone in Central Asia are under
way.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, no progress has been made in establishing a
nuclear weapons-free-zone in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> SAirGroup Takes Control of Sabena of Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- SAirGroup on Wednesday raised
its stake in Belgium's national carrier Sabena to 85 percent from
49.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
SAirGroup, the parent company of Swissair, thus replaced the
Belgian government as the majority shareholder of the country's
airline company.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government swapped most of its Sabena shares for a
3.3-percent stake in the SAirGroup and the deal left the Belgian
government with a 15-percent stake in Sabena but made it the
largest shareholder in SAirGroup, ahead of the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government now holds 3.2 percent of the stake in
SAirGroup.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government can boost its stake in SAirGroup to 5.5
percent if it sells its remaining shares in Sabena.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between the Belgian government and
SAirGroup, Sabena's 12,000 employees each get two shares in their
company.
</P>
<P>
"That is the best possible way to anchor Sabena in Belgium,"
said Belgian Enterprise Minister Rik Daems who signed the
agreement with SAirGroup's Chairman Hannes Goetz.
</P>
<P>
The deal is contingent on ratification of an air transport
agreement between Switzerland and the European Union which is
subject to a referendum by Swiss voters on May 21 and approval by
parliaments in Belgium and the other 14 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Swissair took a 49-percent stake in Sabena in 1995 under a deal
that gave it an option to take a controlling interest in a matter
of years.

<TEXT>
<P>
The group also will develop Web-based services to assist
brokers with deals and Internet portals for the 1.2 billion square
feet of office buildings they control, according to The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is made up of CB Richard Ellis Services Inc., Los
Angeles; Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., Chicago; and Trammell Crow Co.,
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, building sale transactions executed by the three
giants together reached more than 31.4 U.S. U.S. dollars in North
America.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal said the move follows a growing trend
in which industry competitors get together to create online
exchanges. Automobile makers and retailers all recently have
announced plans to form Internet-based marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
By aggregating their purchasing power, these companies can
achieve savings and efficiencies that would be much more difficult
to attain if they were to act independently.
</P>
<P>
On the transaction side, the real-estate companies believe the
Internet could help brokers put together marketing studies or, in
some cases, help buyers and sellers or landlords and tenants
complete small deals, thereby freeing up the brokers to work on
larger, more lucrative deals.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Crime Rises in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Registered crimes in Russia
involving high technologies witnessed a 12-fold increase in two
years, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, 852 crimes of this kind were recorded, Interfax
said, quoting Colonel Konstantin Machabeli, head of the Russian
Interior Ministry's R Board, which deals with high-tech crimes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the crimes involved computers and telecommunication
networks, Machabeli said.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the legislation lags behind and such crimes
are punishable only by fines at present.
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry officials did not specify the damage done by
computer criminals, but said that the damage incurred by
Rostelekom, a provider of mobile and paging communications, has
increased 14-fold within a year as a result of unauthorized
interference, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti Delegations Arrive in Somalia for Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Djibouti government has
dispatched two top level delegations to southern Somalia as part
of its last attempts to seek further support for the Somalia
Reconciliation Conference due to start in Djibouti in a week's
time.
</P>
<P>
The landing of a Djibouti delegation in Baidoa town, Bay region
on Wednesday turned out to be a victorious move in the wake of the
latest breakthrough in the encouragement of the convening of the
Djibouti peace conference for the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) controlling
the region had been among the outspoken leaders opposing to the
Djibouti peace plan until early this week. However, underground
talks have been continuing between the top leaders of the RRA and
some Djiboutian diplomats who in the end seemed to have persuaded
the RRA to join their fellow Somalis in the Djibouti conference.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the four-member delegation, which was led by
Second Deputy Chairman of Djibouti parliament Iddiris Harbi Farah,
were welcomed by hundreds of people at the airport. Among them
were RRA Chairman Hassan Mohamed Nur Shargudud, Governor of Bay
region Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh and dozens of officials from
various social groups.
</P>
<P>
Qalinleh, when contacted on the telephone line Wednesday
afternoon, told the reporter that the meeting with the Djibouti
delegation is to start later soon, and that everything depends on
the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"If we agree we will attend the Djibouti conference, and if not
we won't, " he said with a sound of optimism.
</P>
<P>
Before the delegation arrived in Baidoa, their plane landed in
the regional capital of Hiran, Beleteuin town, where another
four-member delegation was dropped for the people of Hiran.
</P>
<P>
Region Governor Hassan Abdulleh Qalad and Chairman of the local
Islamic court Sheikh Abdullahi Ali Barkhadleh were among the
dozens of high ranking officials and traditional leaders to
welcome the delegation led by Abdullahi Hashi Ali.
</P>
<P>
The delegation had a closed-door meeting with local officials
including Muslim scholars and traditional leaders. Although the
details of their discussion are not known, it is widely believed
that both the Djibouti delegations are conveying invitations for
the local authorities in both regions to attend the forthcoming
reconciliation conference.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, U.S. Sign Extradition Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and the United States
Wednesday signed an extradition treaty which will help law
enforcement agents to track down criminals in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed here by Zimbabwean Home Affairs Minister
Dumiso Dabengwa and U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Tom Mcdonalds.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had been working on the instruments of the
treaty for the last three years before reaching an agreement on
the contentious issues of death penalty and implications for
wrongful arrests, Dabengwa said.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, the two countries agreed that an individual
could be extradited only if he or she had committed a criminal and
not a political offense.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that individuals could be extradited to face a
death sentence only if the individual had committed a criminal
offence that warranted the noose.
</P>
<P>
Concessions by both nations were guided by the principle of
justice and the rule of law, Dabengwa said, adding that "police
will now be able to make follow-ups on criminals seeking refuge in
the United States".
</P>
<P>
Within the Southern African Development Community, the minister
said, criminals could be extradited to the member states provided
there was sufficient evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
There were a number of criminals who were missing from police
lists and were thought to have fled to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Optimistic About Discussions With Britain on Land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean delegation in the
British capital London Wednesday expressed optimism about the
forthcoming meeting with a British delegation which could pave the
way for the resumption of financial assistance for the land
redistribution program in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira
told the Zimbabwe News Agency in a telephone interview from
London that the British government's decision to engage in
dialogue was most welcome.
</P>
<P>
"The British are now more flexible and open-minded," he said,
adding that "they now want to arrive at a settlement through
dialogue instead of being confrontational."
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping the meeting will yield good results, but we
can't say much until tomorrow's meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
He could not disclose the exact amounts of money required by
Zimbabwe from Britain for the land acquisition program.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira, together with Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge and
Local Government and National Housing Minister John Nkomo, were
scheduled to meet the British delegation led by Foreign Minister
Robin Cook on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue is the British funding. We need substantial
amounts of money to cover the land redistribution program," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides the land issue which is the main issue on the agenda,
we will also discuss the relations between Zimbabwe and Britain,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has said that should Britain fail to
finance the resettlement program, Zimbabwe would proceed to
compulsorily acquire the white-owned land using the recently
amended constitution.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Mineral Production Hit by Low World Market Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Production of key minerals in
Mozambique has been hit by a fall in the world market price,
Mozambican Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Castigo Langa
told the parliament, the Assembly of the Republic, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In reply to queries from deputies of the Assembly's specialized
 commissions during the debate on the government's plan and budget
for this year, Langa said the graphite mine at Ancuabe in the
northern Province of Cabo Delgado is currently closed, precisely
because it is no longer profitable to sell the graphite.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the price of titanium, a mineral
extracted from the sands, has also fallen, and this forced a
"reduction in the rhythm" of the heavy sands project at Moebase in
Zambezia Province.
</P>
<P>
Currently only a small amount of coal is exported by road to
Malawi, Langa said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Assembly that the government favored labour
intensive methods in mining in order to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that "we cannot oblige companies to employ more
people than they need" because technological advances had
significantly reduced the labour requirements in the mining
sector.

<P>
YANGON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar military government
has arrested U Aye Tha Aung, secretary of the Committee
Representing the People's Parliament (CRPP) Elected in the 1990
General Election, according to a statement of the committee issued
here on Tuesday and available on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U Aye Tha Aung, who is also secretary of the ethnic Rakhine
League for Democracy and represents four ethnic political parties
in the committee, was arrested and taken to an unknown place by
the Myanmar military intelligence unit on Monday night, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member CRPP was unilaterally formed by the opposition
National League for Democracy (NLD) on September 16, 1998 after
its demand to the government to call the parliament within 60 days
was ignored.
</P>
<P>
The NLD won 396 parliamentary seats out of 485 in the 1990
multi-party general election, sponsored by the Myanmar military
government after the military took over the power of state on
September 18, 1988.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, the NLD blamed the government for still
refusing to implement the result of the 1990 general election.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military government urged the NLD recently to act
in a more responsible and constructive manner without adding
hardship to the country while it is working to develop Myanmar and
rejoin the world community.
</P>
<P>
The government charged that the NLD as well as some foreign
governments are in favor of using the method of confrontation in
dealing with the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Readies Payment for Retired Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
retired public school teachers Wednesday that it is preparing the
needed funds for their salaries and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and
Management said President Joseph Estrada remains committed to
implementing measures that will ensure the well-being of the
country's public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
"The retirement pay for teachers remains a priority of this
administration," Diokno stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the reported delay in the release of payments may
be due to administrative procedures that aim to verify the
retirement claims of some teachers.
</P>
<P>
"We'll look into the reports. We'll resolve this as soon as we
can," he said.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said several retired teachers complained they had
yet to receive their benefits, while others inquired if these are
provided for in the budget.

NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Gold prices declined sharply on
the bullion market in Mumbai (Bombay) Wednesday due to lack of
local demand while silver ruled steady.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Rebound in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
big-ticket manufactured goods rose in March for the first time
this year, led by a big jump in demand for electronic equipment,
the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After two straight months of declines, orders for durable goods,
items expected to last at least three years, rose 2.6 percent last
month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 215.2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In February, durable-goods orders fell a revised 2 percent, a
slightly smaller decline than the government previously estimated.
In January, orders decreased by 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that orders for electronics and electrical
equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and home
appliances, rose 9.7 percent in March, the eighth increase in the
last 10 months. March's increase was the biggest since November.
In February, such orders rose 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment grew by 1.8 percent last
month as an increase in orders for cars and car parts more than
offset a decrease in shipbuilding and tanks. Overall
transportation orders fell by a sharp 9.7 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation category, total durable-
goods orders rose 2.8 percent in March, the fifth straight monthly
increase and the largest since July. Transportation is often
volatile from month-to-month because it includes such big
purchases as airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Primary metals, the category that includes steel, saw orders go
up by 0.5 percent following a 1.6 percent decline in February.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for industrial machinery, including computers
and machine tools, down four of the last five months, fell 2.1
percent in March following a 3.8 percent decline the month before.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket items, a good sign of current demand,
rose 1.5 percent in March after a 1.4 percent drop the month
before.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Law Makers Become Targets of Thefts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian law makers have become
easy targets of some thieves in the country's capital Abuja, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two senators at the National Assembly Complex lost last week
some 450, 000 naira (4,500 U.S. dollars) to hoodlums, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In one case, the boot of a senator's car, which was parked in
the assembly's car lot, was ripped open and 250,000 naira (2,500
U.S. dollars) inside it was taken away.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a senator lost some 200,000 naira (2,000 U.S.
dollars) he kept in his office to an unknown visitor.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, some hoodlums recently found their way
into the complex, vandalizing and stealing valuables kept in
vehicles belonging to visitors including journalists.
</P>
<P>
Security is tightened at the complex to check the trend. An
additional checkpoint was opened outside the complex and those who
could not produce the assembly's identity card or who did not have
any genuine business there were turned back.
</P>
<P>
Police also started imposing thorough check on vehicles coming
in and out of the complex, barring commercial vehicles known as
Kabu-Kabu from entering the premises.
</P>
<P>
The current efforts were aimed at preventing such incidents
within the complex, a police source said, adding that it was,
however, difficult to identify the real owners of vehicles because
some of the hoodlums operated with master keys.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Newspaper Baron Announces Massive Sell-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest newspaper
publisher is putting most of its North American newspapers up for
sale while looking for online partners for its remaining big-city
dailies.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based Hollinger International Inc, owned by the
country's newspaper baron Conrad Black, announced Tuesday that it
is seeking buyers for all but its flagship National Post and some
other major papers in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa and
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Besides selling most of its stable of small dailies, Hollinger
also wants to enter the digital age more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
Black said Hollinger "will make most of its operating assets
available in one way or another to facilitate the current trend to
larger, consolidated multimedia entities."
</P>
<P>
That trend is represented by two major mega-deals in North
America this year, including the Time-Warner America Online merger
valued at 145 billion U.S. dollars and BCE Inc.'s bid of nearly 1.
6 billion U.S. dollars for Canada's CTV network.
</P>
<P>
Hollinger's announcement also followed a decision by Thomson
Corp. in February to sell all of its North American community
newspapers except its Toronto flagship, the Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
An empire of 5 billion U.S. dollars, Hollinger owns more than
40 percent of the Canadian newspaper market and some of the
world's best known newspapers ranging from the Chicago Sun-Times
to The Daily Telegraph in London.

<HEADLINE> EU Remains Silent on Continued Euro Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan Faull, spokesman of EU's executive European Commission,
told the day's routine press briefing that he had no comment to
make though he had been asked to comment on the record fall of the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
The euro dropped to record low-- around 97 yen-- on Wednesday,
posting a stunning 28-percent decline against the Japanese
currency since the euro's inauguration in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the single currency fell to record lows against the
United States dollars and British sterling, around 0.916 against
the dollar and 58.04 pence against the pound.
</P>
<P>
The market is waiting for a policy meeting of the European
Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday, but little chance is seen that
even a rate rise on lending can reverse the euro's downward trend.
</P>
<P>
Dealers began to sell the single currency aggressively on
Tuesday amid frustration at its inability to firm despite
improving economic fundamentals and increasing prospects of a euro
zone interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Few dealers expected the euro to regain ground unless the ECB
gave a clear sign of their willingness to intervene either by
raising the interest rate or buying back the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Critics here said that the ECB bankers and the finance
ministers of the European Union need to become stronger in their
rhetoric on the potential to intervene.

<HEADLINE> Syria Skeptical About U.N. Peacekeeping in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said here on Wednesday that a United Nations peacekeeping
force in southern Lebanon is a highly sensitive issue and its
objective is unclear.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why such a force should be deployed, or what
will be its nature and objective," said Shareh during an interview
with the French media.
</P>
<P>
He said that the role for such a force will be unbalanced, as
it is no match of the Israeli troops but can only repel attacks of
Syrian or Lebanese forces.
</P>
<P>
He said a participation by France could have a disastrous
result ten times worse than the criticism of Hezbollah guerrillas
as "terrorists" by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin when he
visited Israel in February.
</P>
<P>
"All will depend on the behavior of the peacekeepers in this
area (southern Lebanon). It will either increase the prestige of
France in the region or the contrary," said Shareh.
</P>
<P>
France is considering participating in such a U.N. force once
Israel pulls out of southern Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 noted figures from
the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan today gathered
in Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong Province today to express
their sincere wish for China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium titled "Anti-Taiwan Independence and Promoting
China's Reunification," Zhang Kehui, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), urged the new leader of Taiwan to go with the
tide of historical development and make the correct choice on the
cardinal issue of China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, also chairman of the Central Committee of Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League, said that in recent days the
newly elected Taiwan leader made some positive gestures on some
specific questions on relaxing and developing relations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the essential question is whether he will
recognize or not recognize the one China principle and the fact
that Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
If the question is denied, that represents splitting China's
sovereignty and the integrity of China's territory and the Chinese
nation. In that case, the basis and precondition for China's
peaceful reunification will not exist, and war between the two
sides will be unavoidable, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The website www.21cn.com in south
China's Guangdong Province is trying to popularize the Internet by
supporting four people in their trek through western China.
</P>
<P>
Lu De, executive deputy general manager of the State-holding
website, said today that people will be able to follow the four
explorers along their 35,000-km-long journey by accessing www.21cn.
com, and can also chat with the four through visual messaging
services.
</P>
<P>
The website's budget for the exploration is 1.2 million yuan (
about 144,000 U.S. dollars), including visual messaging facilities
and photographing and videotaping machines to record what the
explorers experience along their trip.
</P>
<P>
The team will pass through seven provinces and autonomous
regions and a municipality in seven months, going through the
Yarlung Zangbo Gorge, and crossing the desert, mountains, valleys,
and grasslands of western China.
</P>
<P>
Lu said this trip will help intensify knowledge of the Internet
revolution in the western region of the country, as the four
explorers intend to contact the news media organizations at every
stop.
</P>
<P>
The exploration team has left Guangzhou in south China for Xi'
an in Shaanxi Province in north China via Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in southwest China, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The www.21cn.com site has been focusing on expansion in south
China since it came into being on February 9, 1999, and its
support of this activity is part of its attempt to expand into
western China.

Zhang stressed that only if Taiwan's new leader recognizes the

China's territory can all questions be negotiated.
</P>

He said that it is time to end the separation of the two sides

secure "Taiwan Independence," and to contribute to the
reunification of China.

Yang Guoqing, president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan

Yang called on all parties and associations in Taiwan to urge
Taiwan's future authorities to place Taiwan's peace, stability,
and development on top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinping, vice-chairman of the Taiwan-based China
Reunification League, said that fighting against "Taiwan
Independence" is the source of the strength of the people across
the straits.
</P>
<P>
He said that only by insisting on the one China principle will
there be peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
He called on people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to make
unremitting efforts for China's reunification.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Community Refutes Taiwan Separatist's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong communities in Hong
Kong on Wednesday strongly condemned Annette Lu's statements
advocating "Taiwan independence," warning that any attempt to
split the motherland is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium organized by the Guangdong Communities,
participants pointed out that Lu, turning a blind eye to
historical facts, has made absurd statements of "distant relatives
and close neighbors" to describe cross-Strait relations, which
revealed her real intention to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and can
never be separated from the motherland, which has become a shared
view of people across the Taiwan straits as well as the
international community, participants said.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who preached "it's time for the international community to
interfere with the Taiwan issue," attempted to internationalize
the Taiwan issue and turned to foreign forces to carry out
separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people must keep their eyes open to any attempts to
hamper China's reunification cause, participants said.
</P>
<P>
Participants believed anyone who goes against the "One China"
principle will be a sinner to the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation of the "one country, two systems"
principle in Hong Kong and Macao proves that the principle is the
best way to achieve China's peaceful reunification, they said.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Taiwan authorities to proceed from the interests
of the Taiwan people and come back to the "One China" stance,
doing some useful things for China's peaceful reunification.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Companies Launch E-trading Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's most popular financial
and securities website: homeway.com.cn, announced here today that
it has launched an e-trading platform in collaboration with CITIC
Securities Company, a major securities broker in China.
</P>
<P>
CITIC Securities hence becomes the first broker to open on-line
stock trading services after the China Securities Regulatory
Commission's (CSRC) recent promulgation of regulations on Internet
stock trading.
</P>
<P>
The platform currently provides financial and securities news,
real-time market information, on-line consultation, account
management, on-line trading, and other services.
</P>
<P>
The homeway website said its services will be expanded to on-
line banking, insurance, foreign exchange trading, and other
services in the future.
</P>
<P>
China currently has nearly nine million Internet users and more
than 40 million stock investors, and over 20 securities brokers
have opened on-line trading services.
</P>
<P>
Information from the CSRC said that on-line trading now
accounts for one percent of the total stock trading volume in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that the Internet has become an
increasingly important source of information for China's stock
investors.
</P>
<P>
Yang Huaiding, one of the earliest and most successful small
investors in China, well known as "Millionaire Yang", said he used
to subscribe to 73 newspapers, but now that he has gone on-line,
he no longer needs the newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.S. Official Urges Granting China PNTR Status (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Dan Glickman encouraged the local U.S. business
community to support the granting of the Permanent Normal Trading
Relations (PNTR) status for China today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.S. business people at a luncheon held by the
American Chamber of Commerce at noon today, Glickman said he
believes that the Congress will eventually grant China the
Permanent Normal Trading Relations (PNTR) status, because "It is a
right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
He said that American business people will make their own
decisions whether they make further inroads into the Chinese
market or be left behind the European, Canadian and Japanese
companies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is expected to vote on the PNTR in late May.
</P>
<P>
Glickman is leading an American delegation made up of four
congressmen and one governor in an effort to push the granting of
PNTR for China. In addition to Beijing, the delegation will travel
to Shanghai and Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
He said that the PNTR is one of the most important decisions
facing the Congress and the nation this year, and passing it will
allow the United States to be a "constructive partner" for China.
</P>
<P>
"Rejecting it could badly fracture the bilateral relationship,
aggravating tensions and reopening old wounds between the world
largest nation and the world largest economy," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The PNTR granting will help give the U.S. greater access to the
Chinese market, said the secretary, adding that the move will
bring about benefits to both countries.
</P>
<P>
"Should PNTR fails, China will still in all likelihood join the
WTO. That train is leaving the station, it's just a matter of us
deciding whether to hop along for the ride," he said, noting as a
result, the U.S. will stand outside the Chinese market and invite
its competitors to come in.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said he hopes that U.S.-China relationship will be
constructive and positive in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is learnt that the director-general of Asian affairs
division of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, at the direction of
Yoshiro Mori, met with Chinese diplomats stationed in Japan and
made clarification on Mori's remarks.
</P>
<P>
He said that former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama made clear
in his speech in 1995 the basic stand of the Japanese government
toward the issue of history, in that Japan admits its record of
invasion and show deep introspection over it.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the Joint Declaration issued by both sides
during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan in 1998,
Japan confessed clearly its invasion into China. Mori's cabinet
will not change the official stand held by the Japanese government,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono today also reiterated such
stand by the Japanese government, in reply to a written inquiry by
Chinese journalists in Tokyo. Japan will, on the basis of
continuing introspection of that unfortunate history, devotes
itself to the development of good Japan-China relations, he
stressed.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori said on Monday in the Japanese Diet that whether or not Japan
carried out an invasion should be judged by people in the process
of history, when he touched upon the essence of Japan's invasion
of China.
</P>
<P>
In response to Yoshiro's remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi at a regular press conference on Tuesday urged
Japan to learn profound lessons from Japan's history of invasion.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is surprised at and regrets the prime
minister's wrongful remarks which blurred the essence of Japan's
invasion into China and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Sun urged Japan to strictly abide by principles set forth in
the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Joint
Declaration, as well as a series of remarks and pledges it has
solemnly made to China on the issue of history, and sincerely
reflect on its invasion history, draw profound lessons from it,
and earnestly safeguard relations between China and Japan.

<HEADLINE> hke042660-- ADB:China's Entry to WTO to Benefit Itself and Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will not only contribute to the Chinese
economy but also to the development of the rest of the region,
Myoung-Ho Shin, vice president of the Asian Development Bank. said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry to WTO will be a very historic event," Shin told
a press conference held for the launch of the Asian development
Outlook 2000.
</P>
<P>
The outlook, an annual publication of the ADB which forecasts
short-term economic trends in the region, projects that gross
domestic product in China will rise by 6.5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The outlook said China's cautious approach to liberalization of
capital controls and a comfortable external financial position
insulated it from the worst of the contagion effects of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jungsoo Lee, ADB chief economist, agreed with Shin, saying that
China's entry into the WTO will have a good impact on itself as
well as the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very positive view on China's entry to WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
M. Quibria, assistant chief economist of the ADB, said that
after China joins the WTO it will have access to foreign entities,
which can bring in new technologies and new practices. These
things will influence the efficiency of Chinese industry and help
promote the competitiveness of Chinese products, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry to WTO will present challenges as well as
opportunities to China's state-owned enterprises," David Green,
ADB's senior economist, noted.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the survival of the state-owned enterprises after
China's entry to the WTO, he suggested the Chinese government
strengthen the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
"What you face in the short term for industrial restructuring
is unemployment. Pension reform is a very important aspect. It
could help implementing labor restructuring and enterprise
restructuring," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the Chinese government improve the
competitiveness of China's agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"As China moves towards joining WTO, certain aspects of the
agricultural sector will face competition from the world market,"
he said, expressing concern about the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, he was pleased to see that the Chinese
government is shifting attention towards west, adding that the ADB
will continue supporting the infrastructure sector in western
China.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation a Key Challenge to Nepal: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Although Nepal's economy is
expected to achieve a robust growth in the year 2000, poverty
alleviation remains a key challenge to the Nepali government, an
official of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal is expected to achieve an economic growth of 5 to 6
percent in 2000 due to a recovery of the agriculture sector and
continued strong performance on other sectors," said Richard Vokes,
resident representative of ADB in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Nepali government is still facing ahead a tough
task to fight poverty," Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
Even though the economic growth of Nepal is on the upward trend,
which rose to 3.3 percent in 1999 from 2.3 percent in 1998, the
situation is not all rosy, Vokes told a press conference held to
launch the "Asian Development Outlook 2000," the 12th annual
economic report on the developing member countries of the ADB.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Nepal's inflation rose to 13 percent, the budget
deficit remained at 6.1 percent and domestic revenue only
accounted for 10 percent of GDP, substantially lower than the
budgeted amount, according to the ADB report.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the Nepali government to pursue a broad-based
reform agenda, especially in financial and civil service sectors,
to achieve sustained growth necessary to lift the country out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
"If the government can, as promised, push forward with
implementation of the second round of economic reforms, the
outlook for 2001 is for continued strong growth," said Vokes.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government ratified a second round of the economic
reform package earlier this month to convince international donors
to channel more money into the country for its poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The package included restructuring of the country's economic
and fiscal sectors, decentralization, reform in civil service and
effective use of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
As corporate and financial governance reforms are crucial for
generating pro-poor economic growth in Nepal, Vokes said, the ADB
is supporting the reforms through a series of technical assistance
projects and possibly loans.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an
annual per capita income of merely 200 U.S. dollars and about 45
percent of the population living below the poverty line. About 60
percent of its development funds come from donors.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major multilateral donors of Nepal, the ADB is
currently financing 19 projects in the country totaling 480.4
million U.S. dollars. The disbursement of loans over the past
three years has averaged 92 million U.S. dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Continues Air Strikes Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's air force on
Wednesday continued air strikes against Tamil Tiger rebels in
northern Jaffna peninsula after losing a key army base last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the air strikes had entered third day
on rebel targets at the Elephant Pass, a narrow causeway linking
Jaffna peninsula with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) captured the strategic army base at Elephant Pass,
inflicting a heavy blow to government troops in their 17-year-old
war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government troops' death toll in the Elephant Pass
debacle rose to 214 after the LTTE handed over bodies of 126
soldiers to the International Committee of the Red Cross on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Army Commander Srilal Weerasooriya admitted that eight
officers and 80 soldiers had been killed in the fighting at
Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that the
military had received the 126 bodies, but that only 28 of them
could be identified by a special team flown to the Wanni region
from Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
"Thereafter the religious rites were performed and cremation of
the rest of (the 98) bodies took place with military honors," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has said more than 1,000 soldiers died in the battle,
a claim denied by the government which said at least 150 rebels
had also died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the troops were setting up new defense
lines in anticipation of fresh LTTE attacks following the loss of
Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
Local media said hospitals in Colombo were struggling to cope
with the casualties brought in from the war front, but added that
a government request for people to donate blood for wounded
soldiers had met with tremendous response.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the main opposition United National Party
criticized the government's handling of the war, saying the loss
of Elephant Pass was both a political and a military setback.
</P>
<P>
Ranil Wickremesinghe said Tuesday he had information that more
than 1,000 soldiers had been killed and 300 taken prisoner by the
LTTE at Elephant Pass, which military officials said had been
defended by at least 15,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983. More than 60,000
people have been killed in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> 20 Hostages Kept in Southern Philippines: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado confirmed Wednesday that the 20 foreigners
abducted from Malaysia had been found in the southern province of
Sulu, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also confirmed the participation of the Muslim rebel
group Abu Sayyaf in the recent abduction.
</P>
<P>
Mercado was quoted as saying that Talipao town, 16 km away from
Jolo, the capital city of Sulu, has been pinpointed as the hideout
of the captors of the foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief said the military intelligence agents also
identified some leaders of the extremist Abu Sayyaf group as
behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
The 20 foreigners were snatched by a lawless group in Sipadan
island, near Borneo in Malaysia last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The group is "a mixture of former members of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) and the dreaded Abu Sayyaf group," Mercado
said.
</P>
<P>
"This information was relayed to us by Sulu Governor Abdusakur
Tan in a briefing we had in Jolo this morning", Mercado added.
</P>
<P>
But he said no contact has been established yet with the
foreigners' abductors, so no demands have been presented by the
lawless group before the government.
</P>
<P>
"We have been checking and verifying leads. The abduction may
or may not have anything to do with the military operation in
Basilan," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado has given military officials the blanket authority on
what actions to take against the captors.
</P>
<P>
"We are leaving it all up to the Armed Forces headed by
Southern Command chief (Lt. General Diomedio Villanueva), on what
actions to take -- of course with the appropriate guidance of the
Chief-of-Staff (General Angelo Reyes)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the hostages are "safe, sound and alive" in the hands
of the captors, as was learned through feedback gathered from
military assets in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"Our prime concern will always be the safety of the captives,"
he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> EC Acts to Facilitate Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) on
Wednesday recommended the European Union (EU) member states to
share the existing routes with network providers to facilitate
public access to computer network services.
</P>
<P>
The EC, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, called on all
member states to enact appropriate legal and regulatory measures
for incumbent telecommunications operators to provide full
unbundled access to the existing copper local loops.
</P>
<P>
It set a deadline on December 31 this year for the full
unbundled access in all member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU has worked out a program to boost economic growth so as
to increase employment via its e-Europe initiative and the EU
summit held last month in Lisbon mapped out the first step to
reduce substantially the access costs to computer network services.
</P>
<P>
Erkki Liikanen, EU commissioner for information society, said
that among the three existing end users-reaching local loops, only
the copper loop is popular in the installation of new cost-
effective technologies such as digital subscriber loop (DSL) which
can largely enhance the capacity of ordinary copper telephone
lines.
</P>
<P>
The other two loops -- television cable networks and wireless
telephone networks -- are still not available within the EU.
</P>
<P>
The DSL technology can "rapidly unleash Internet access", added
the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The EC's non-binding recommendation mainly aims at the EU
member states where former state telephone companies still control
access to private individuals.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Italy
have already unbundled their local loops, the physical circuit
linking the telecommunications operators' local switch and the
telephone sets of end users.
</P>
<P>
Britain is aiming at taking away the monopoly of the British
Telecommunications by July 2001.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reports 259 UFOs in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada reported 259 unidentified
flying objects (UFO) in 1999, compared with an average 230 for
each year, the Globe and Mail newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's western province of British Columbia helped drive
a 30-percent national increase in UFO reports, of which 118 came
from this coastal province, accounting for almost half of the UFO
reports in Canada last year.
</P>
<P>
Ontario had 79 UFO reports, followed by Yukon's 20, Alberta's
19, Quebec's eight, Manitoba and Newfoundland's six each as well
as New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan's one each.
</P>
<P>
An active UFO community in British Columbia gets some of the
credit. The province has a UFO hotline, a TV show and a special
magazine for a devoted following, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Against Jeopardizing Disarmament Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday warned against
moves which are jeopardizing the achievements in the field of
disarmament, in particular the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
and Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty (ABM).
</P>
<P>
In some pre-words to a document on the efforts made by France
in disarmament and reducing its scale of armed forces, French
President Jacques Chirac said that the past two years have
witnessed some moves which could undermine efforts of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Such moves include nuclear and missile tests, the refusal to
ratify the CTBT by several countries including the United States,
and putting into question the fundamental principles of the ABM.
</P>
<P>
France is concerned about the U.S. demand to amend the ABM,
signed by Washington and Moscow in 1972, so that it can build a
new anti-missile defense system around the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Urges Taiwan to Accept "One China" Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's civil war will be
reopened only if the new Taiwan authorities do not recognize the "
One China" principle and the fact that they are Chinese, a Chinese
research fellow pointed out here today.
</P>
<P>
All responsible and sensible Chinese across the Taiwan Straits
should unite as one to fight against "Taiwan independence" forces,
and promote peace and reunification at this critical moment, said
Xin Qi, a research fellow of the Peace and Development Research
Center, at a symposium held here today.
</P>
<P>
The relationship across the Taiwan Straits is still in a
hostile state, and the possibility of new civil war and
reunification by force still exists even though Taiwan leaders
have been changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The "One China" principle is the basis for political talks
across the Straits and key to peaceful reunification, Xin noted,
adding that the principle is adhered to by the international
community, and accepted by 1.3 billion Chinese people, including
Taiwanese, as well as tens of millions of overseas Chinese.

<P>
DALIAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- E-commerce is bound to bring a
revolution to China's tourism sector, said a Chinese tourism
official.
</P>
<P>
Wei Xiao'an, director of the Planning and Finance Department of
the National Tourism Administration (NTA), said tourism e-commerce
companies, with their low cost, wide coverage, and direct sales,
will take an increasingly large market share from traditional tour
companies.
</P>
<P>
Wei's remarks were supported by the recently closed China
Scenic Spot and Resort Exhibition in this northeast China's port
city, which was invigorated by various promotional activities
launched by a number of e-commerce companies, drawing the
attention of both visitors and professional tourism personnel.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 300 professional tourism websites.
</P>
<P>
However, tourism-related e-commerce in China is still in the
preliminary stage, and these companies must improve in line with
market changes, Wei said, adding that they should also cooperate
with foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
At a recent National Work Conference on Tourism Management, NTA
Director He Guangwei said that China will build a nationwide
website on tourism management linking NTA with all local tourism
management departments, and will choose strong partners to launch
a state-level tourism e-commerce website.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Minister Urges More Foreign Contracting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said today that China has
become one of the world's top ten project contractors, and must
strive for an even greater share in the global market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, China had achieved a total contractual
value of nearly 75 billion U.S. dollars in foreign contracting,
and actually implemented contracts involving over 54 billion U.S.
dollars, Shi said at a meeting of major Beijing-based Chinese
contracting corporations which have claimed market shares in over
180 countries.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of foreign contracting in foreign
trade, Shi urged the contractors to play a greater role in
boosting the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time now for China's contractors to step up their
development," Shi pointed out, citing the overall recovery of the
world economy and China's anticipated entering into the World
Trade Organization in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Shi places great hope on large contractors, saying they must
improve the quality and efficiency of their projects to sharpen
their competitive edge. Bilateral and multilateral consultation
systems also need to be established to clear the path for Chinese
contractors in the world market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Call for Ultimatum to Air-Polluted Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Participants at the 15th session
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)
here today called for issuing an "ultimatum" to air-polluted
cities.
</P>
<P>
The top legislators made the call here during a panel to
discuss on revising the Law of the People's Republic of China on
the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers were unsatisfied with the wording of the draft
concerning enterprises which have failed to meet the requirements
of national and local laws on environmental protection. They
proposed that stricter measures be adopted to curb the discharge
of pollutants into the air by factories, and that those that
failing to meet national and local standards have their operation
halted.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, the legislators showed great interest in
dealing with the increasingly rampant sand and dust storms, the
number of which now exceeds 20 a year, compared with five or six a
year in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Currently, sand and dust storms are affecting a dozen provinces,
municipalities and ethnic autonomous regions in north China and a
population of more than 300 million, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also urged sand prevention and control efforts by
increasing tree and grass planting, returning reclaimed land to
forests, banning animal husbandry in favor of cultivating grass,
and carrying out urban afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Lai Aiguang, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee
of the NPC, suggested adding wording to the 22nd clause to
encourage the development and utilization of equipment and
instruments for measuring air pollution.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Hold Parliamentary Runoff on May 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Guardians Council (GC) on
Wednesday set May 5 as the date for the runoff election of the
sixth Majlis (parliament), the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The date had been proposed by the Interior Ministry, and it was
approved by the GC in its session on Wednesday, said the GC's
Public Relations Department.
</P>
<P>
On this basis, the runoff election will be held in 52
constituencies to elect 66 parliament members, the department
added.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the election was held on February 18, in
which reformists allied to President Mohammad Khatami won more than
75 percent of 224 seats, ending the long time conservative majority
in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament has a total of 290 seats. Those candidates
who failed to get the minimum 25 percent of votes in the first
round have to compete in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
The runoff was originally planned at the end of this month but
was put off due to the delay of the conservative GC in approving
the first-round results.
</P>
<P>
As the watchdog of the election, the GC was not satisfied with
the first-round results, and it has canceled the qualification of
nine reformist winners in seven constituencies around the country
without giving sound reasons, stirring up a series of protests.
</P>
<P>
In a communique on Tuesday, the GC declared that it has
confirmed the eligibility of 185 winners in the first-round
election, except for the Tehran constituency, confirmation of whose
polls awaits the result of vote recounting.
</P>
<P>
The reformist victory has infuriated the conservatives, who
still control most of the powerful state organs. Recently the
conservatives stepped up their effort to crack down the reformist
campaign by jailing reformist journalists and closing down papers.

</P>
<P>
Goh said he was "confident that the Chinese government remains
committed to the path of economic reforms and is prepared for the
full introduction of foreign competition upon WTO membership."

reforms, it is at the same time busy preparing for the New Economy.
"
</P>
<P>
"During our visits to Zhongguancun in Beijing and the Xi'an Hi-
Tech Industrial Development Zone, we saw that the Chinese
government had begun to build infrastructure, including info-

riding on the New Economy for sustainable long-term growth," he
added.

new opportunities for our businessmen," and the opening up and
development of China's inland provinces "will create even more
investment and trade opportunities," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said on
Wednesday it would resume talks with China in mid-May on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Pascal Lamy, trade commissioner of the 15-nation bloc, said
that the next round of talks with China aimed at completing a
bilateral deal on China's accession to the WTO is scheduled for
May 15 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The date for the fourth round of talks this year was agreed on
Tuesday with Shi Guangsheng, Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister, a spokesman of the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
Lamy has submitted a report to the European Commission, the
executive body of the EU, and the European Parliament about the
third round of talks held in Beijing at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
"We will now be able to bridge the gaps that remain," said the
commissioner who expressed satisfaction at being able to renew
talks "with the full backing of the 15 member states of the EU and
the parliament."
</P>
<P>
Lamy added that both the EU and China had ample time to reflect
on their respective positions since March.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner earlier urged flexibility from both sides to
complete the entry talks, saying that China's entry into WTO would
bring mutual interest to the EU and China.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers also agreed that it is of extreme
importance to get China into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
After three rounds of talks this year in Brussels and Beijing,
the remaining obstacles between the EU and China are believed to
include the market access to China's telecommunications and life
insurance sectors.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government's View on Past Aggressive War Unchanged: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese government maintains its view on the past war as
manifested by former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in
1995, and expounded in the 1998 Japan-China Joint Declaration,
Kono said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Murayama expressed "deep remorse and a heartfelt apology" for
the "tremendous damage and suffering" inflicted on "the people of
many countries, particularly on those of Asian nations" through
Japan's wartime "colonial rule and aggression."
</P>
<P>
In the 1998 Joint Declaration, the Japanese government
explained its views on Sino-Japanese relations, saying Japan
should take responsibility for the great suffering and damage
inflicted on the Chinese people by its past aggression.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's such view has not changed after Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori's cabinet was formed, Kono stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kono's remarks came one day after Mori gave a vague explanation
about his view on Japan's past aggressive war against China.
</P>
<P>
In a House of Representatives Budget Committee session on
Tuesday, Mori said there are many versions in regard to war
depending on different historic backgrounds, and that whether
Japan launched the aggressive war to China in the past "needs
people's further judgment."
</P>
<P>
Yokio Hatoyama, leader of Japan's main opposition Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ), rebutted Mori's remark, saying it is a major
setback from Murayama's manifestation.

BRUSSELS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Wednesday that it is a priority for the current commission to
fight against doping in sports.
</P>
<P>
In a call unleashed on Wednesday, the European Commission, the
executive of the 15-nation Union, urged for proposals that will
enable pilot actions to combat doping.
</P>
<P>
Information campaigns and conferences on ways to harmonize the
fight against doping at European level will be the two types of
actions called for by the commission.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has earmarked five million euros (4.6
million U.S. dollars) to facilitate the pilot actions.
</P>
<P>
Both EU member states and international sports governing bodies
recognized by the International Olympic Committee can enter their
proposals for actions before June 17 this year.

The commission supports actions that examine the advisability
of approximating or even harmonizing the legislation of member
states laying down acceptance medical limits for the absorption of
doping substances.
</P>
<P>
It also supports actions that examine the advisability of
harmonizing testing arrangements through the 15-nation bloc.

the baby and he will grow up as other healthy babies.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Chen said that his hospital will operate an ultrasonic
test on the baby three months later.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was sent to the Xinhua Hospital on February 23, when he
had had no urine for five consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
Related tests show that the baby is suffering from acute renal
failure and ureter obstruction. Doctors said that the baby's life
is seriously endangered due to the facts that his creatinine index
is six times the normal level, urea nitrogen four times the normal
level, and he lost balance in terms of electrolyte and also had a
very bad cruor function.
</P>
<P>
Doctors also found that the baby only has a very small bladder
with a capacity of 20 milliliters, and the two ureters each has a
2.5 cm long narrow section. Doctors diagnosed that it was the
narrow sections that had blocked the flow of the urine. More
worse, part of the ureter had swelled as thick as one centimeter
due to the obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Doctors cut off the narrow sections and made the bulgy part
into the normal width of 0.4 cm, and then replace the ureters into
the bladder.
</P>
<P>
The baby discharged 950 milliliters of urine on the very day of
the operation. When examined 24 hours later, his bladder became
normal and his weight decreased from 4.1 kilograms to three
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
It is learned Zhang Xinlong is the youngest to undergo an
operation in this regard.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Prices of productive materials in
China, which have been falling for more than a year and a half,

the State Administration of Internal Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
Figures released by SAIT today indicate that growth of demand

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to reduce
environment pollution, slow down the degradation of eco-system and
improve the environment in major cities from 2001-2005, said a top
official of environment protection today.
</P>
<P>
China will try to reduce the total amount of pollutants
discharged by 10 percent by the end of 2005, said Xie Zhenhua,
minister of the State Environmental Protection Administration (
SEPA) at a forum on innovation strategy held by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that to achieve this goal, the government will
especially urged the economically developed eastern regions to cut
pollutant discharges by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
The environment protection program will focus on three rivers
including Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe rivers, and three lakes
including Taihu, Dianchi and Chaohu lakes. Measures will also be
taken to reduce pollution along the middle and upper reaches of
the Yellow River and the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In areas which are affected by sulfur dioxide and acid rain,
the discharge of sulfur dioxide should be reduced by 20 percent by
the end of 2005, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state will increase the number of key cities
for environment protection from 47 during the 1996-2000 period to
about 100 in the next five years. These key cities include capital
cities of provinces and autonomous regions, some coastal cities,
and tourist cities.
</P>
<P>
China will also launch projects to improve eco-systems along
the Yellow and Yangtze rivers which are especially vulnerable to
environment pollution. Some areas in Shanxi and Hebei provinces
which cause environment pollution to Beijing will also be
protected.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that the control of pollutants from daily life and
agricultural production will be another major issue for
environment protection in China. He called on experts and scholars
at CAS to make more contributions to protecting the environment.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's largest auction house
plans to sell a six-volume rare book with handwritings of Emperor
Qianlong (1736-1795) at an opening bid of one million yuan (about
120,500 US dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slumped to
a fresh 18-month low Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the market returned to full strength after a five-day Easter
break, the Australian dollar went down after opening at the day's
highs around 59.35 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
It steadied for some time at the low of a week ago around 58.95
U.S. cents before another raft of sales sent it to a low of 58.72
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the currency was 58.96 U.S. cents from 59.54 at
last Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
The currency was last in this region on October 6, 1998, when
it closed at 58.55.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said there was some short covering which sent it back
to 59 U.S. cents late in the day but overall it had been a "very
weak performance."
</P>
<P>
But he said there were signs it may not have much more downside.
</P>
<P>
"I think 58 cents would be the deeper low and then we may see
the start of a new rally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the close, the Australian dollar was at 0.6392 euro
from 0.6319 at last Thursday's close and 62.30 Japanese yen from
62.33.

<HEADLINE> No Olympic Boycott: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestine was not planning to
boycott the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, its representative to
Australia, Ali Kazak, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We've never planned to boycott the Olympics," Kazak told the
Australian Associated Press from Palestine after arriving from
Canberra.
</P>
<P>
"This is not true. This issue has been solved a long time ago.
There's no problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian newspaper Wednesday reported Palestine objected
to a monument unveiled last year at Sydney Olympic Park to
commemorate the 11 Israeli athletes slain at the 1972 Munich
Olympics and would call for an Arab boycott of the Games.
</P>
<P>
It said this superseded earlier Palestinian concerns over a
plan to hold a minute's silence for the Israeli athletes, a
proposal which was rejected in February by Sydney Olympic
organisers.
</P>
<P>
Kazak, who is head of the general Palestinian delegation in
Australia, the country's official spokesman, said the issue had
been resolved.
</P>
<P>
"What we said is that if the minutes silence would go ahead,
then we would demand that a minutes silence also to be included
for the Palestinian and Arab athletes who have been killed by the
Israeli army and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The International Olympic Committee have already decided not
to go along with the demands of the extremist Jewish community put
to them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The extremist leaders of the Jewish community are trying to
politicise the Olympic Games. We reject the politicisation of the
Olympics," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kazak said he would meet with Palestine Olympic Committee
officials in his visit but not to talk about boycotts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games
dismissed the report as nonsense.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Palestine sent two athletes to the Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Shandong Factory Fire Determined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The burning of polyester material
near an overheated fluorescent light caused the fire in a chicken
processing workshop in east China's Shandong Province that killed
38 workers, local investigators announced here today.

firefighting departments found that the fire began with the
burning of polyester materials near the overheated light on the
ceiling of the workshop.

Neglected hidden fire dangers stemming from imperfect design
and misuse of the building, as well as a poor fire-alarm system
and inadequate firefighting facilities were blamed for the fire.

<HEADLINE> China Helps Poor Urban Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The emergence of poor urban
groups has attracted the attention of the government and measures
are being taken to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Urban Survey Organization under the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) said in a report today that poverty in urban
areas has become a problem that cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a nationwide survey that NBS
conducted among 760,000 urban households recently, six percent of
these households are below the poverty line receiving an average
income of 100 yuan per month.
</P>
<P>
The ratio is much higher in areas in the western part of the
country, about ten times more than in big cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
People aged between 40-45 are among the lowest income group in
cities. These people have a relatively lower level of education
and are more dependent on family members.
</P>
<P>
NBS said that the government has prioritized helping poor urban
residents. It has already established a system for ensuring a
minimum standard of living in almost all cities at and above the
county level by setting the line of minimum standard of living and
minimum wage. By the end of last year, more than five million
urban residents had received relief from the government.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to establish a complete social
insurance system within the next five years. Up to mid 1999, 110
million workers in urban areas bought pension insurance and 137
million people bought unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
In addition to measures to insure a minimum level of
subsistence for poor people in cities, the government has also
used taxation as a leverage to narrow the gap of incomes between
different social urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The government imposed tax on interest of bank savings of
residents in last November. It plans to use the tax revenue,
estimated at 20 billion yuan this year, to fund compensations for
low-income urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is also planning to launch inheritance
tax and social insurance tax in the near future. It is now looking
into the possibility of imposing property tax.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS statistics, the gap between the rich and the
poor is widening in cities. Young households are earning 30
percent more than middle-aged households. People with university
degrees are earning 85 percent more than those with primary school
education. Male urban residents earn 30 percent more than female
residents.

<HEADLINE> China Announces First Batch of New Agro- Plant Varieties under Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture today authorized 8 research institutions and
enterprises nationwide the exclusive rights to own, grow and sell
38 new agro-plant varieties, the first step taken by MOA to
protect the rights of researchers engaged in breeding new
varieties of agriculture plants.
</P>
<P>
The new plant variety rights is a form of protecting
intellectual property rights, just like patents and brands. And
without permission from the owner, no one is allowed to grow or
sell these new varieties.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, Chinese researchers have bred more than
6,000 new varieties of agricultural plants, which have replaced
varieties of China's main grain and cash crops. Each replacement
will increase production by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the rights of breeding researchers have been
constantly infringed due to lack of laws and regulations. To
protect their rights and to promote the research of more new
varieties, China issued the Regulations on Protecting New
Varieties of Plants in 1997 and joined the International
Convention on Protecting New Varieties of Plants.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Ministry has received 124 applications for
protecting new varieties of plants, but only 38 of these
varieties - all corn and rice - have been approved.
</P>
<P>
At the National Work Conference on Protecting New Varieties of
Agriculture Plants which opened in Beijing today, MOA vice-
Minister Zhang Baowen said that the authorization of the variety
rights will promote the development of China's agro-science and
technology and international exchanges, paving the way for foreign
researchers to apply for variety rights in China and Chinese
researchers to apply abroad.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Quality Control in Fishery Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 ( Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture has decided to set this year as a quality year for the
fishery sector to enable consumers to enjoy quality-controlled
aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Liu Jian said at a press
conference here today that to enhance quality control is also
urgently needed with China's approaching entry into the World
Trade Organization to improve its competitive edge in
international market.
</P>
<P>
China's fishery industry has witnessed rapid development in the
past 50 years. Last year, the country's aquatic products totaled
more than 40 million tons, accounting for about one-third of the
world's total. However, many products are poor in quality due to
lack of efficient quality control systems.
</P>
<P>
Liu urged all localities to speed up the formulation and
revision of regulations, and punish those enterprises that produce
inferior products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges Clear-Cut Settlement of PNTR Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
said this afternoon that a clear-cut and unconditional settlement
of the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) issue will be good
both for China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wen told visiting U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman
and U.S. congressmen and officials accompanying the secretary that
China's attitude towards the bilateral agreement concerning China'
s entry into the World Trade Organization is "serious" and "
earnest," and hopes the U.S. will honor its promise as well.
</P>
<P>
"To settle the PNTR issue in a clear-cut and unconditional
manner will be beneficial for both China and the United States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier stressed the importance of keeping
relations between China and the United States stable, saying that
development of bilateral relations will not only serve the
fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people, but also
be conducive to peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region
and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long talks, Wen answered various questions
raised by the U.S. guests.
</P>
<P>
Glickman, who is here on behalf of President Bill Clinton,
arrived in Beijing last night. Glickman said that President
Clinton pays great attention to U.S.-China relations. The
president and many congressmen are in favor of granting China PNTR.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary also said that the U.S. Government will
continue to make efforts to have the PNTR issue resolved.
</P>

<P>
On February 3, 2000, Tracy Zhao arrived in Beijing intending to
prepare for the human rights conference in Geneva in March.
</P>
<P>
But she had ulterior motives in visiting China, a fact which
was proved repeatedly during her 10-day stay in Beijing, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, at 9 p.m., Zhao arrived in Beijing on a
Northwest flight, together with her boyfriend and other three
people.
</P>
<P>
Unlike her previous trips to Beijing, Zhao did not stay at the
home of her uncle or aunt. She did not make phone calls to wish
New Year's greetings to family members and friends, who did not
know she spent the Spring Festival of the Year of the Dragon in
Beijing until she was expelled by the Chinese government 10 days
after her arrival.
</P>
<P>
On February 4, at about 11 p.m., she and her boyfriend left for
Tiananmen Square. After arriving at the square, she gave her
passport and all other IDs to her boyfriend who left the square,
thus making her an unidentifiable person.

<TEXT>
<P>
On that same day, some die-hard elements of Falun Gong were
preaching the ideas of the cult by waving banners and shouting
slogans. They were taken away by the patrol police who failed to
persuade them to stop.
</P>
<P>
The article questions Zhao's testimony that she saw many
policemen beating and kicking Falun Dafa practitioners". The
article points out Zhao failed in the United States to answer
questions from reporters on why she was not "bleeding in the face"
and had no "bruises or black eyes" like others on the square.
</P>
<P>
On February 5, at 2 a.m., Zhao and some other Falun Gong
practitioners -- not 1,200 of them, as Zhao claimed in her
testimony -- were removed from the square in police vans.
</P>
<P>
They were sent to a holding center under the Municipal Public
Security Bureau. At the center, Zhao told police she is a local
resident and lives at 12 Liulisi, Andingmen, Dongcheng District.
</P>
<P>
At 4 p.m., Zhao was taken to the Dongcheng Public Security
Branch, where she continued to conceal her identity and refused to
answer other questions. The Dongcheng police branch detained her
in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
However, in her testimony, Zhao said, "I told them I was an
American citizen. They did not believe me and sent me to a prison
cell."

From February 6-10, Zhao was in temporary custody in the
Dongcheng Detention Center, which has the best conditions and is
the most modernized of any such facility in Beijing, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
Last year, during their visit to the place, some officials from
the UN Committee Against Torture spoke highly of the conditions
there and its humanitarian treatment of the people in custody,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Each cell has a toilet, and hot water is supplied twice a week
for the inmates to take showers. According to the rules, newcomers
must take baths.
</P>
<P>
The detention center has a scientifically-designed, heated
wooden platform on which those in detention sleep. Zhao said in
her testimony that she and others slept on "one big wooden
platform," according to the article.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring Festival, the number of baths inmates in the
detention center were permitted to take was increased, and Zhao
took showers on February 5, 8 and 10. Guo Guilan, who was in the
same cell with Zhao, said she and Zhao bathed together. But, Zhao
claimed in her testimony that "In the entire time I was there, we
weren't allowed to take any showers".
</P>
<P>
The article says that Zhao, who came to Beijing to get a "first-
hand look at what was really going on", did not mention in her
testimony the fact that police in the detention center had never
beaten, cursed or tortured these Falun Gong members and other
inmates. Both Yin Fengyan and Liang Fuwei, who stayed with Zhao in
the same cell, have confirmed this, it says.
</P>
<P>
On February 9, the US Embassy in China abruptly sent a fax to
the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau saying that Zhao, a
US citizen, was arrested while taking pictures of those who were
practicing Falun Gong on Tiananmen Square. The Municipal Public
Security Bureau contacted the US Embassy immediately, asking it to
help provide Zhao's identification documents.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of February 10, the US Embassy sent Zhao's
passport to the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

Zhao's infatuation with Falun Gong had been earlier denounced
by her father, aunt and uncle. After her detention, her relatives
expressed their anger and disappointment with her behavior.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid she has become a sacrificial object of Li Hongzhi,
her father said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here have tried to figure out the connections between
the overseas anti-China forces, Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong cult,
Tracy Zhao, illegal gatherings at Tiananmen Square, Zhao's "fact-
finding" tour, her statement to the US congressional committee as
well as the US attacks on China's human rights conditions and Zhao
's lies about "persecution" and "abuse."
</P>
<P>
Zhao's story has once again reminded the Chinese people of the
"marvels" of Li Hongzhi's "truth, compassion and tolerance."
</P>
<P>
The latest paraphrase of the three words is believed to be that
that lies would become truth if repeating them for one thousand
times; to bring shame on the motherland, the perilous intention
would become an benevolent one while the "tolerance" becomes means
for achieving goals.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's lies have turned into a "priceless treasure" for some
anti-China forces. The Chinese people have seen time and again
that these forces will use any means to gain their end.

</P>
<P>
Zhao's claim that "11 people are known to have died while in
police custody" is absurd.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's "China trip" ended ahead of schedule, but the farce
featuring the Falun Gong practitioners has just begun. The "drama"
continued after the March 2 congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
After March 11 when a spokesman of the Chinese Consulate in New
York refuted Zhao's testimony at the hearing, Zhao revised her
statement that she was in China on a "fact-finding" mission.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, actions she previously said she "saw firsthand"
became actions she had only "heard about from other sources." Her
testimony that she "wasn't permitted to bathe" changed into a
statement that she in fact took "three showers."
</P>
<P>
During the UN human rights conference in Geneva, Zhang Erping
and some other core members of the Falun Gong held frequent news
conferences, group practice of Falun Gong and other activities.
</P>
<P>
Zhao continued to join in the farce, taking a lead role.

The Dongcheng Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau
released Zhao from the Dongcheng Detention Center immediately
after verifying her identity. She expressed her sincere thanks to
the policemen involved.
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. on February 12, Zhao left Beijing International
Airport by a Northwest flight.
</P>
<P>
She made a brief farewell phone call to her father, uncle, and
aunt at the airport before boarding the plane. It was the first
and only call Zhao made to inform her family members of her stay
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During her eight-day detention, she did not submit any requests
to the Chinese police for meeting with representatives from the US
Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
She also declined the services of a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
These are the facts. But Zhao claimed that in the entire time
she was in detention, "None of the practitioners were allowed any
contact with the outside, nor were family or relatives allowed to
visit."
</P>
<P>
An investigation indicated that since the Chinese government
outlawed Falun Gong on July 22, 1999, none of the family members
or relatives of Falun Gong practitioners, including Zhao's father,
had received any notices of "huge fines" because of their
involvement in Falun Gong.

<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A national publicity campaign
aimed at preventing fires from breaking out in households
officially started today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that in 1999, 22,000 fires broke out
in homes, causing 673 deaths, 945 injuries and a total property
loss of 110 million yuan (about 13 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The lack of fire-prevention awareness and that of common
knowledge of electric appliances is believed to be the major
reasons for fires at home.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, fire-prevention and fire-extinguishing
exercises will be organized in communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Television and radio stations will also put on programs to
enhance the fire-prevention awareness and skills of families.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Ministry of Public Security and a national
insurance company have also printed pamphlets to be sent free to
households.

<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's
Procuratorate and nine central government departments will take
effective measures to crack down on cases of dereliction of duty
by government employees, according to a meeting held by nine
central government bodies in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The nine government bodies include the Ministry of Public
Security, Ministry of Land and Resources, General Administration
of Customs, State Administration of Taxation, State Environmental
Protection Administration, State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, State Forestry Administration, State Bureau of Quality
and Technical Supervision, and the National Administration for the
Protection of State Secrets.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the government departments will transfer
information on suspected dereliction of duty cases to
procuratorates which will inform related government departments of
crimes committed by their employees.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will help promote the crackdown and prevention of
cases concerning dereliction of duty, said Zhao Dengju, deputy
procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is part of China's anti-corruption drive. In the
Criminal Law, amended in 1997, the steepest penalty for this crime
increased three-fold, from five years imprisonment to fifteen.

<HEADLINE> Forum in Memory of Chinese Female Leader Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A workshop was held here in
memory of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Shi Liang (1900-
1985), a well-known law expert, a leader of the China's women's
movement and a co-founder of the China Democratic League.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people attended the forum, including Li Ruihuan, a
member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, a vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,

the Kuomintang against the Communists, the release of political
prisoners and the establishment of a united front against Japanese
aggression.
</P>
<P>
She closely cooperated with the Communist Party in the struggle
for democracy and peace and against the Kuomintang rule and
imperialist influences in China.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic, she was the first
minister of justice and also once served as vice chairman of the
CPPCC National Committee, member of the NPC Standing Committee and
vice chairman of the All-China Women's Federation.

National Committee, vice chairman of fifth CPPCC National
Committee; Standing Committee member of the first, second, third
and fourth NPC, vice chairman of the fifth and sixth NPC, vice
chairman of the first, second and third Central Committee of the

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Flies to Zambia for Regional Group Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
flew to Lusaka on Wednesday for a regional economic group meeting
and talks with Zambian officials on ways of enhancing bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Moussa will attend the foreign
ministers meeting on Thursday among the member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, proposed by Moussa at the 1999 COMESA summit held
in Kenya, is aimed at exchanging views and coordinating stances on
efforts to cement peace and security among the group's members, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt joined COMESA in 1998, which groups 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral level, Moussa will deliver a message to Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba from his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak on bilateral relations and regional issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Zambia will hold a joint committee meeting, during
which a number of agreements on political, economic and social
cooperation will be signed, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
On his way to Lusaka, Moussa will stop over in Khartoum for
talks with his Sudanese counterpart Mustafa Othman Ismail on the
latest developments of the Sudanese issue in light of the Egyptian-
Libyan initiative on helping realize national reconciliation in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed a five-point peace plan last year,
calling for permanent cease-fire between the Sudanese government
and southern rebel groups and the holding of a conference aimed at
seeking national reconciliation and peace in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Reduction an Overarching Objective of ADB:  Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is Asia's main social
challenge today and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has adopted
poverty reduction as its overarching development objective, ADB
deputy President Myoung-Ho Shin said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held for the launch of the Asian
Development Outlook 2000, Shin said the ADB believes that
promoting economic growth remains the best path to poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
If developing Asia can continue with its historical trend in
economic growth, an ADB study indicates that it will be largely
free of poverty by 2025.
</P>
<P>
"But to have a large impact on the poor, growth must be
inclusive. That is, growth that the poor can share in," the deputy
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the main focus of the Outlook this year is on the
social challenge facing developing Asia as it enters the 21st
century: that is, improving the quality of life of the hundreds of
millions who still live in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to a commonly used definition of poverty -- those who
live on less than one U.S. dollar a day -- about 900 million
people in Asia were poor in 1998. This is about twice as many poor
people as in the rest of the developing world combined.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, quality of human life cannot, and should not,
be defined by dollar income alone.
</P>
<P>
"There are other aspects of human deprivation such as
illiteracy, malnutrition, poor health, limited access to water and
sanitation, vulnerability to economic shocks and a lack of
political freedom," Shin said.
</P>
<P>
Some Asian economies, particularly the newly industrialized
economies successfully telescoped into four decades the process of
social and economic development that took the industrial economies
of Western Europe three centuries to achieve.
</P>
<P>
This has led in these economies to the virtual eradication of
abject poverty, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some southeast Asian economies have also made impressive
strides in poverty reduction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not all parts of Asia shared this progress, he
pointed out, saying that South Asia has discernibly lagged behind,
so have the central Asian republics.
</P>
<P>
More worrying, progress that developing Asia has made in four
decades has stalled in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a number of policy priorities to developing Asia
in terms of poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to further open up their economies to enable them
to exploit new economic possibilities in the international economy
and increase investment in human resource development,
particularly education, health care and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Asian economies to improve governance to ensure
more efficient and equitable public expenditure management and
strengthen social protection, noting that the recent financial
crisis has "dramatically" highlighted the inadequacies of current
arrangements.

<HEADLINE> ADB Urges to Improve Global Trading Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- To address the social challenges
of Asia, there must be an effort to improve the global trading
environment, Myoung-Ho Shin, vice president of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held for the launch of the Asian
Development Outlook 2000, Shin said, although the global trading
environment has improved over the years, developed countries
continue to maintain high tariff and non-tariff barriers in areas
such as agriculture and textiles which are of interest to poorer
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The rampant use of anti-dumping measures by advanced countries
and the specter of protectionism in the guise of labor and
environment measure do not inspire confidence in poor countries
about the fairness of the global trading system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said the social challenge facing developing
Asia as it enter the 21st century is to improve the quality of
life of the hundreds of millions who still live in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
To reduce poverty in the region, he also urges Asian economies
to seek an increase in the flow of foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said that assistance from the developed to the developing
world has steadily declined over the last decade, which
unfortunately happened when many industrial economies are in much
better fiscal shape than at any time in recent history.
</P>
<P>
Appealing for more attention to be given to providing
international public goods, Shin said the international community
can greatly help to reduce global poverty by providing important
international public goods.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Rises in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing output saw a
marginal 3.2 percent increase on year-on-year basis in March in
Singapore, mainly due to the decline in the chemicals cluster, the
Economic Development Board (EDB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On a three-month moving average basis, manufacturing output
rose by 12.9 percent, which is also the cumulative growth for the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster grew by 15.4 percent compared to March
last year while its cumulative output for the first three months
of the year grew by 21.7 percent compared to the first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
EDB attributed the high growth to the increase in the demand
for telecommunication equipment, computer peripherals and PCBAs.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster contracted by 24.4 percent form its March
1999 level as the result of declining output from pharmaceuticals,
petroleum and petrochemicals segments.
</P>
<P>
Despite reduced output in March, the cumulative output of the
chemicals cluster for the first three months of this year was
still 5.6 percent more than the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Output of engineering cluster in March this year grew by 6.4
percent, mainly contributed by the growth of the precision
engineering segment.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, the engineering cluster's output for the first
three months grew by 7.9 percent over the same period last year.

NZPA quoted New Zealand Transport Minister Mark Gosche as
saying he would not lift foreign ownership rules stopping SIA
going beyond a quarter stake.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Political Leaders Appealed to Stop Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe
Council of Churches Densen Mafinyani Wednesday called on
political leaders to ensure peace during the parliamentary
elections in May.
</P>
<P>
He told the Zimbabwe News Agency that there was no benefit in
condoning violence which was affecting innocent citizens.
</P>
<P>
"If we follow the trend of violence no one is going to
benefit," he said, adding, "Political leaders must speak peace
and not violence."
</P>
<P>
"The sad situation is that violence is affecting innocent
citizens.  Poor people who do not participate in gaining power
are the ones being affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the churches were concerned at the deteriorating
situation of political violence as it affected most of the
members.
</P>
<P>
The council was scheduled to meet leaders of political parties
on Wednesday to seek a solution to the prevailing violence.
</P>
<P>
"The church cannot see people being killed and keep quite," he
said. " Churches have analyzed the situation and decided to
intervene."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been rocked with political violence which has
already claimed a number of lives in the build up to
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The violence has been reported as mainly between the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and opposition
Movement for Democratic Change supporters.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of supporters of these two parties have
already appeared in courts charged with public violence.

<HEADLINE> Angola Appeals for End of Interference in Other's Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Angolan president Jose Eduardo
dos Santos urged African countries should take effective measures
to avoid the interference in other countries' internal affairs and
stop the impunity of individuals who destabilized brother
countries' regimes.
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted here on Wednesday by the official news
agency as saying in a statement after attending the African Summit
on the fighting against malaria, which was held in the Nigerian
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that this statement is aimed to warn those
countries accused of giving logistic support to the Angolan rebels
led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"There are direct actors in the scene of military operations
and there are others outside...they are more powerful and feed
these wars," said the president, adding that "among them,
unfortunately, there are African personalities. There are also
heads of state and government."
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos pointed out that wrong judgements were often done
when analysing some countries' war situations in the Organization
of African Unity which has a commission in charge of the issues on
the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan head of state proposed that, at the level of the
OAU commission, there should be a mechanism that can help resolve
the internal problems of pacification and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said in a speech at the summit on malaria that
through that way, the African countries can make greater
contribution to save our continent, "sparing it from disease but
also from wars."
</P>
<P>
"It is not only malaria and AIDS that kill in Africa, the wars
also kill, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Lies of Falun Gong Hearings Exposed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency released a
bylined article today detailing the recent activities of Falun
Gong member Tracy Zhao and exposing the lies in her testimony at a
US congressional hearing in early March.
</P>
<P>
According to the March 3 reports from overseas Falun Gong
websites, the International Relations Committee of the US House of
Representatives held a hearing in Washington on March 2 on human
rights and religious freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Tracy Zhao, a resident of New York who is a
flight attendant for Northwest Airlines and a Falun Gong
practitioner, testified before the congressional panel about her "
illegal detention" on Tiananmen Square during this year's Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
Zhao recounted in her statement: "Shortly before midnight on
February 4th, which was the night before the Chinese New Year, I
arrived at Tiananmen Square. I saw many policemen beating and
kicking Falun Gong practitioners and dragging them into police
vans."
</P>
<P>
"We were all taken to the nearby police station. There were
hundreds of practitioners being held there. Some were bleeding in
the face; others had bruises or black eyes," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the early hours of February 5th, around 1,200 practitioners,
including myself, were taken to the Dongcheng detention center on
the outskirts of Beijing. For 24 hours there was no water or heat.
Each of us received only two pieces of Chinese bread for food. And
we were not allowed to use the bathroom," she said.
</P>
<P>
"After 24 hours, the police questioned me and I told them I was
an American citizen. They didn't believe me and sent me to a
prison cell," Zhao said.

<P>
Zhao was born on July 22, 1969, in Beijing, and lived at 12
Liulisi, Andingmen, in the Dongcheng District. She attended the
Beijing Civil Aviation Technical School from 1985 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
Without completing her studies there, she left to go to a
vocational school specializing in training for the service
industry. After finishing her courses there, she became a hotel
waitress.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, 1990, Zhao resigned and applied for leaving for
the United States. She became a US citizen in 1996. Later, she was
employed by Northwest Airlines thanks to her skills learned at the
Beijing technical school.
</P>
<P>
In her first 20 years, Zhao, like her Chinese peers, grew up in
a peaceful and free environment and received compulsory education.
She also benefited from China's reform and opening up when she
chose to emigrate to the US.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said she first heard of Falun Gong in 1997 and became a
practitioner two years later. And yet Falun Gong, which claimed to
cultivate the spirituality of its practitioners, only left Zhao
confused and unable to distinguish right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua article notes that February 4, the eve of the
Chinese lunar New Year, was a day when the Chinese people returned
home for family reunions and to celebrate the new year.
</P>
<P>
But 10 days before that, core members of the Falun Gong cult
announced that February 4 was an auspicious day for practicing
Falun Gong on Tiananmen Square.

"Every practitioner in my cell had been abused at some point by
the prison guards and policemen. In prison, we were given two
meals a day, and it was always two pieces of Chinese bread with
cabbage soup," she said.
</P>
<P>
"At night all of us slept on one big wooden platform, with one
blanket for two people and no pillows. It was very crowded. In the
entire time I was there, we weren't allowed to take any showers.
None of the practitioners were allowed any contact with the
outside, nor were family members or relatives allowed to visit.
And the families usually also faced huge fines," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Zhao also said, "So far, 11 people are known
to have died while in police custody, while countless others
remain unaccounted for."
</P>
<P>
The testimony, which was riddled with lies, had the negative
impact desired by the congressional committee and participants,
the Xinhua article said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that after the hearing, the head of the
congressional committee posed for pictures with Falun Gong members.
</P>
<P>
At noon the following day, Zhang Erping, an assistant to Li
Hongzhi, the founder of the Falun Gong cult, attended a luncheon
for over 60 US politicians, academicians, businesspeople and the
press, briefing them on Falun Gong and its "repression" in China.
Zhang also quoted Zhao's testimony before congress.
</P>
<P>
But who is Tracy Zhao? She was an ordinary Chinese named Zhao
Yanhong.

Azerbaijani Caspian port of Baku with Turkey's Mediterranean port

The three parties were close to reach a consensus on the transit

</P>
<P>
The officials said that there is no problem in Ankara in the

</P>
<P>
The ongoing talks are between Georgia and Azerbaijan concerning
Georgia's responsibilities such as security guarantee for the
project, they added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ready for Water Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is ready to export its "
peace water" to the water-deficient Middle East countries, reported
the Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Waterworks Authority Chairman Dogan Altinbilek sent the
signal while giving a briefing Tuesday on the progress of the "
Peace Water Project" in Manavgat, southeast Turkey. The project,
initiated in early 1990s, is aimed to boost the peace process in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He announced that each cubic meter of water exported will yield
only a 10-cent profit, which means only 18 million U.S. dollars of
profit per year for the 180 million cubic meter Manavgat project.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and Jordan have expressed deep interest in importing
the "peace water" from the Manavgat River. During his visit to
Turkey earlier this year, King Abdullah of Jordan discussed the
water issue with Turkish officials, but said that Jordan could
hardly afford it due to its high price.
</P>
<P>
Altinbilek said that the annual water deficits for Israel and
Jordan are 50 million cubic meters and 100 million cubic meters
respectively and that Manavgat is capable of supplying those
amounts.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet has recently decided to continue the process
of investigating the feasibility of importing water from Turkey and
is expected to make a final decision on the issue within three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is presently also examining the possibility of purifying
sea water for drinking.
</P>
<P>
Altinbilek said that if Israel decides to buy water from Turkey,
the Manavgat project will start delivery in October.
</P>
<P>
He argued that purifying sea water is much more expensive than
purchasing water from Turkey, adding that purification costs 70
cents per cubic meter whereas water from Turkey will only cost 50
cents.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Attack South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel blasted suspected guerrilla
bases in southeast Lebanon with six air-to-surface missiles
Wednesday morning, following intermittent barrages of artillery
bombardment that left two Lebanese civilians wounded Tuesday,
Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The air assaults targeted suspected Hezbollah strongholds in the
Birket Jabbour area at the western sector of the Bekaa valley in
west Lebanon, which straddles the eastern sector of the Israeli-
occupied zone, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
There were no further reports about casualties after the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Retaliation attacks between the Israeli troops and Lebanese
resistance guerrillas intensified after Israel formally notified
the United Nations that it would pull out its troops from south
Lebanon by July after a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had stressed that his country
will harshly retaliate if the resistance continues firing Katyushas
to northern Israel or causes any casualties after its withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985 with the excuse of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since
been leading a war of attrition aimed to oust the Israeli forces.

<HEADLINE> Press Freedom Basic Right of Iranians: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Stressing press freedom is a basic
right of the Iranian people, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday deplored "interfering remarks" made
by certain Western officials on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Freedom of expression and press is among the basic rights of the
Iranian nationals which are guaranteed by the constitution, Asefi
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
On recent comments by some Western countries about Iran's
closure of reformist papers, Asefi said other countries are
expected to comment about Iran realistically and refrain from
interfering in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the existence of various tendencies in the country "is a
sign of success for the Islamic republic in the establishment of a
pluralistic and democratic society."
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary on Sunday and Monday ordered the
closure of 13 reformist papers and journals amid a new wave of
crackdown on the country's reformers since they won an overwhelming
victory in February's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the judiciary's act, spokesmen of the French
Foreign Ministry and the U.S. State Department voiced their concern
over the closings, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Although the conservatives were defeated in the parliamentary
election, they are still in control of most of the powerful state
organs in Iran, including the military.
</P>
<P>
Recently they have stepped up their effort to curb the country's
reformist campaign fostered by President Mohammad Khatami since he
took office in 1997.

This year's rainfall began about two weeks earlier than last
year,according to the Water Resources and Meteorology Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rice crops planted in December and January are now
ready for harvesting, but the early rains have drowned the crops,
rotting the rice before it could be brought in from the fields.

<P>
Other provinces, including Kandal and Battambang, have also
suffered damage though less than in Takeo where officials say more
than 2,000 hectares of rice may have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The wet-season harvest is often used for subsistence while the
dry-season harvest is for sale. But rice which normally sells for
500 to 600 riel per kilogram may sell for only 300 to 400 riel per
kilogram if it is damaged.

<HEADLINE> Local Officials Say Hostages Now in Philippines  (Eds: Update with Officials' quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of tourists who were
kidnapped from a Malaysian resort island Sunday are being held in
southern Philippines, local officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They are here," Governor Abdusakur Tan of the southern
Philippine island province of Sulu was quoted by local reports as
saying. He added that a Philippine rebel commander is suspected
behind the abduction.  "The hostages are probably being held by
Galid Andang, the commander of the extremist Muslim group Abu
Sayyaf in the province,"Tan said.
</P>
<P>
But another report said that by now only 17 of the 20 hostages
have been detained while the location of the other three is not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a
remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast in eastern
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, a least 10 of those kidnapped
were foreign tourists, including French, German, South African,
Lebanese and Finnish nationals. The rest were Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports have confirmed that Philippine military
officials will go to Sulu island Wednesday to verify the
information and check the situation there.
</P>
<P>
According o Governor Tan, he will meet later Wednesday with
military officials, including Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
and Vice Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim, to discuss whether to
negotiate for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, the Abu Sayyaf group claimed responsibility for
the kidnapping of the 20 tourists in Malaysia. But later it
retreated from the claim.
</P>
<P>
As Abu Sayyaf's spokesman Abu Ahmad put it later Tuesday, he
was not certain the group was involved in the abduction in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, one of the two Muslim rebel groups fighting for
an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, is under
attack for holding 27 Filipinos hostage for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have pounded several Abu Sayyaf camps with
rockets Tuesday in a bid to free the remaining 27 hostages. The
group reportedly captured some 50 people, mostly school children,
on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Early last week, the rebel group demanded that the Philippine
government press for the release of three Arabs jailed in the
United States, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
However, the Abu Sayyaf claimed last Wednesday that it had
beheaded two of the hostages because their demand had been
rejected by the government. They also threatened to kill five more,
if the military does not stop its attack.

Latest Department of Transport figures showed passenger numbers
from Fiji grew from more than 246,000 in the 12 months to
September 1998 to more than 295,000 in the year to September 1999,
a jump of 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, passenger numbers from Singapore grew
by 17.2 percent to 2.25 million, Malaysia by 15.3 percent to 843,
000 and Thailand by 12.3 percent to almost 668,000.
</P>
<P>
These figures may suggest further recovery from the Asian
financial crisis but they are muddied by falls in passenger
numbers from Indonesia, with a drop of 7.5 percent, and Japan, 6.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has been the second largest source of passengers,
behind New Zealand, since it edged out Japan in September 1997.

The busiest Australian international route for the year was Los
Angeles-Sydney, followed by Auckland-Sydney and Singapore-Sydney.

<HEADLINE> ADB Urged More Int'l Aid to Cut Asia's Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The international community
should do more to alleviate Asia's poverty, a statement of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which is released at a ADB news conference here,
said that while the main effort to reduce poverty has to be made
within the borders of Asian countries, much needs to be done at
international level if the global community is serious about
eliminating Asia's poverty.
</P>
<P>
It listed that three areas where the international community
needs to do more for cutting the poverty in Asia.
</P>
<P>
One is to improve the global trading environment. While global
trading environment has improved over the years, the areas in
which poorer developing Asian countries want to penetrate most
remain protected by industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The Second is to increase the flow of foreign assistance. The
flow of foreign economic assistance to poor Asian countries has
steadily declined since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The last one is to provide international public products.
</P>
<P>
If the Asian countries and the international community work
together, the quality of life of Asia's poor can indeed be
improved much better, it said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Gov't Urged to Stick to Economic Recovery Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries (CZI) said the government has a poor record of
implementing economic programs and it remains to be seen whether
it will ensure that objectives in the economic recovery plan are
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The confederation said in its April economic update released
here Wednesday that the plan designed to reverse the serious
decline in the country's economic performance which was launched
at the end of February this year had noble objectives.
</P>
<P>
The program was aimed at streamlining government expenditure
and improving the management of the budget so that overruns were
avoided and resources used in an effective and efficient manner.
</P>
<P>
A large portion of government expenditure goes towards
servicing the debt now almost reaching 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program emphasizes the importance of implementing a social
contract that would see the government, business and labor
working together for the wellbeing of the country.
</P>
<P>
It said fundamental changes such as the depreciation of the
Zimbabwean dollar, cash budgeting and reduction in the size of
the civil service were likely to be implemented after the
parliamentary elections scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to get mixed signals from the government which
indicate some lack of commitment to fiscal prudence which has
driven our economy into the mess it is in," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said such decisions as the awarding of hefty salary
increases to civil servants, chiefs and headmen had influenced
political expenditure rather than economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
Such policy inconsistencies, it said, had to be avoided if the
economic recovery program was to succeed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Play Role in Turkish-Greek Talks: Turkish Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
reportedly eager to play a role in pushing forward the Turkish-
Greek peace process in order to add to his diplomatic successes as
he approaches the end of his term in office.
</P>
<P>
The United States is increasing its emphasis on rapprochement
between Turkey and Greece, unidentified diplomatic sources were
quoted by Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Washington appears to be working on a schedule to enable Clinton
to join the trilateral meeting of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Turkish and Greek Foreign Ministers, Ismail Cem and
George Papandreou, to show the importance it attaches to the
solution of disputes between its two close allies, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Though it has not been confirmed yet, both Turkish and U.S.
sources say that they are making necessary preparations for such a
scenario.
</P>
<P>
Judging by his efforts in the peace talks in the Middle East and
Northern Ireland, Clinton most likely wants to do something
personally regarding the Aegean disputes before his term in office
ends in January, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Cem and Papandreou will travel to the U.S. to receive "Statesman
of the Year" awards by the U.S.-based East-West Institute on May 2
in New York and to meet with Albright the following day.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Mark Parris will return to the U.S.
Wednesday to attend the high-level Turkey-U.S. defense group
meetings on April 27-28 and the meeting between the Turkish and
Greek foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Parris has tried hard to help advance the rapprochement between
Ankara and Athens. Before his departure to the U.S., he visited Cem
on Monday to have an exchange of views on options to speed up the
talks between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cem and Papandreou paid historical visits to each other's
country earlier this year and signed nine bilateral agreements. The
two men have thus been honored with the titles of "architects of
rapprochement" in the press.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, two Mediterranean neighbors, have long been
locked in disputes over Aegean territories, ethnic problems as well
as Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Their relations improved after they rushed to the aid of each
other following devastating earthquakes in the two countries last
year.

<HEADLINE> Another Iranian Reformist Daily Receives Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Another prominent reformist daily
Mosharekat (Participation) has received a warning from the
conservative press court in the wake of a conservative crackdown on
the reformist press.
</P>
<P>
"If the paper fails to pay attention to the legal note of the
court, a proper decision would be taken against it," press court
judge Saeed Mortazavi warned in a letter sent to the daily's
Managing Director Seyed Mohammad Reza Khatami on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mortazavi accused Mosharekat of reprinting several times on
Monday and Tuesday with varied headlines and contents, violating
the regulations of the press law approved in 1985, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the closure of 13 reformist publications by Tehran
justice department on Sunday and Monday, the remaining two mass-
circulated reformist dailies Mosharekat and Sobh-e Emrouz (This
Morning) increased their circulation by reprinting several times to
meet the demands.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the Sobh-e Emrouz was also announced on Monday
but was revoked later at night as its Managing Director Saeed
Hajjarian is still hospitalized after being shot in an
assassination attempt on March 12.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Reza Khatami, younger brother of President
Mohammad Khatami and the top winner of the February parliamentary
election in Tehran constituency, Mortazavi said the headlines,
layout and contents of Mosharekat in the second and third editions
were different from the first issue and this was against the press
law.
</P>
<P>
Since cases of complaints against the daily are under
investigation at the press court, this case of violation was
notified in order to prevent its repetition, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Spends More on Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ABS said Australia's higher education expenditure on
research and development in 1998 was estimated to be 2.6 billion
Australian dollars (1.56 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
That was an increase of 13 percent on 1996, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
University spending on research and development had risen from
0.34 percent of Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990
to 0.44 percent of GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
That compared to 0.41 percent of GDP in Germany in 1998, 0.39
percent in the United States, 0.38 percent in France and 0.35
percent in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Medical research was the biggest beneficiary of the funds,
accounting for 591 million Australian dollars (354.6 million U.S.
dollars) or 23 percent of the nation's research expenditure.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by social sciences, biological sciences and
humanities.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said the number of researchers employed at Australian
universities had grown since 1996.

<P>
A south-easterly weather system was behind torrential rain
along the coast with floodwaters rising in the outer suburbs of
the city of Cairns and outlying roads, the state's weather bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rain in outback Queensland has stranded a number of
tourists including 12 students from the Sydney University.
</P>
<P>
Police said because of the boggy conditions it might be two to
three weeks before the students can drive out of the area.
</P>
<P>
Police were considering airlifting the students to dry land or
taking food supplies to their camp site.
</P>
<P>
Another 14 adults and children stuck on the Georgina River were
in a better position.
</P>
<P>
"They have enough food and at this stage the weather seems to
have eased a bit so we're hoping they can drive out of there by
the weekend," a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to reassess it and probably drop some food off to
them in the next couple of days to make sure they have adequate
food so they can drive out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Meteorology said the wet weather could continue
with the possibility of a tropical low brewing in the Coral Sea.

<HEADLINE> Financial Restructuring Poses Biggest Challenge To Thailand: economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The biggest challenge Thailand
faces now is financial restructuring, in particular the problem of
non-performing loans (NPLs), a chief economist of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jung Soo, chief economist of ADB, told reporters in a ADB
news conference here that despite bringing the level of NPLs down,
NPLs continued to hamper the Thai financial sector, resulting in
weak credit expansion.
</P>
<P>
If lending does not resume quickly, Thai firms that survived
the crisis may eventually succumb to sustained liquidity problems.
This could result in another wave of business closures and a
swelling in the ranks of the unemployed, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Many Thai commercial banks have so far been reluctant to
restructure problem loans and accept actual losses. Instead most
have opted for less painful rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with other crisis-affected countries, he points out
that Thailand has not chosen to bank recapitalization financed by
the government, and such a program would encourage moral hazard
and put an excessively high burden on taxpayers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee said the Thai government was making progress in
helping banks cope with the crisis. For example, it has encouraged
banks to set up special funds to deal with NPLs.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda Peoples Defense Forces
(UPDF) denied any troop withdrawal from the Democratic Republic of
Congo the (DRC), saying "it has not quit DRC and the troop
movement is normal"
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma said, "It is not the
correct analogy to say we have quit Congo. The press has
exaggerated the situation. It is normal troop movement," the New
Vision daily quoted Kavuma as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma made the remarks at the parliamentary committee when
answering a query whether the UPDF had withdrawn troops from the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said that any withdrawal of UPDF troops from the DRC will
only come as a result of the full implementation of the Lusaka
Cease-fire Agreement to which Uganda is committed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UPDF had withdrawn two battalions from
DRC last Sunday. The returned forces were led by the 55th
battalion commander Major Sam Bishuba and the 31st battalion
commander Major Isaac Katongole.

on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Production of the crop had slumped from about 37 million
kilograms in the 1996/97 season to 16.6 million kilograms in the
last harvest season.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco growers this year are expected to harvest just a little
over 14. 5 million kilograms, the Manager of the Tanzania Tobacco
Board in the western zone Jamesson Kabage was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in western regions are complaining bogus contracts
between buyers and co-operative unions, which let their harvests
bought on credit, have left them completely cash-strapped.
</P>
<P>
They are threatening to stop cultivating tobacco and look for
other means of making an honest living if private buyers continue
to purchase the crop from co-operative unions on credit and at
unfair prices, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the problem dogging many co-operative unions was
the fact that they had unskilled leaders who could not keep proper
books of accounts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vast majority of tobacco growers do not have
information of prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
This made some unscrupulous traders offer unfair prices for
tobacco even when the demand was high in the world market.

ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish Constitutional Court Chairman Ahmet Sezer, who
was offered as the single candidate for the presidency by the
coalition leaders, criticized on Tuesday the power awarded by the
Constitution to the president of exceeding the boundaries of a
parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the president has the power to appoint the
high judicial authorities, dragging Turkey away from the state of
rule by law.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish powerful military kept silent about the
nomination of Sezer for the single presidential candidate as some
sources claimed that the General Staff of Turkish Armed Forces did
not seem to be warm toward the jurist.
</P>
<P>
Sezer made a speech on freedom and democracy last year, causing
unease to the military.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Some 35 people, including two teachers, were detained and
questioned by police on Tuesday in Turkey's southeastern province
of Diyarbakir during the ongoing anti-Hezbollah operations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has launched since the end of last year a massive
crackdown against the radical Islamic terrorist group, which
reportedly sought to turn the secular but overwhelmingly Muslim
Turkey into a strict Islamic-rule regime by violence.

<HEADLINE> Immediate Prospects for Developing Asia Remain Good:  ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Immediate prospects for
developing Asian countries remain good, with an expected 6.2
percent growth this year, Myoung-Ho Shin, vice president of Asian
Development Bank (ADB), said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held for the launch of the Asian
Development Outlook 2000, Shin said that the Asian economic
outlook changed rather dramatically in 1999. The actual regional
growth rate exceeded six percent, much higher than the original
forecast of 4.4 percent and the revised forecast of 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This high growth in gross domestic products was largely due to
the sharp rebound in economic activity in the five crisis
countries, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Thailand, from a fall of 7.7 percent in 1998 to a gain of 6.6
percent in 1999," Shin said.
</P>
<P>
During the year, he said, expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies helped spur domestic demand while the substantial real
depreciation of their currencies and robust U.S. growth led to
greater external demand for manufactured goods, especially
electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Policy initiatives to restructure the financial and corporate
sectors of these countries also led to a sharp improvement in
market sentiment and a rebound in regional stock markets, which,
in turn, provided an additional boost to domestic consumption, the
deputy ADB president said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that there will be slower growth in the newly
industrialized economies and the People's Republic of China, which,
however, will be offset by more rapid growth in Southeast Asia,
South Asia and the Central Asian republics.
</P>
<P>
He also warned to guard against some uncertainties, such as a
pronounced slowdown of the U.S. economy and the relatively large
fiscal deficits in the crisis-countries.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficits "could become unsustainable, or, as these
economies recover, the resolve to reform, especially in the
financial and corporate sectors, could weaken," he said.

MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Latest intelligent reports from
the Philippine military said Wednesday that 17 of 20 tourists
abducted from Malaysia have been spotted in the southern
Philippines, but such reports have not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN news channel quoted the military report as saying
that the 17 tourists abducted in Sipadan Island in Malaysia are
now detained at Bandang, Talipa in the southern Philippine island
of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ABS-CBN said, Vice Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim
has confirmed the report that he will proceed to Jolo, the capital
city of Sulu, together with Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado to
verify the information and check the situation in the area.
</P>
<P>
But the TV report did not mention the location of the other

<HEADLINE> Asian Nations to Do More on Financial Reform: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference for releasing the Asian
Development Outlook 2000, Shin Myoung-Ho, ADB's vice president,
said that Asian countries had "made significant progress toward
financial and corporate reforms", but "much more needs to be done".
</P>
<P>
He warned that a slowing or halting of the reform process would
have serious consequences and therefore, the region should press
forward,strengthening ongoing reforms and improving the governance
process.
</P>
<P>
The crisis-affected Asian economies recovered generally during
1999, but this recovery masks substantial problems, particularly
in the corporate and financial sectors, Shin said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen ongoing reforms, He recommended that several
initiatives must be adopted: one is to focus on asset management
companies and another is to modernize and develop capital markets
in those countries.
</P>
<P>
In short, Shin said, the financial sector was the weakest point
in Asian economic development.
</P>
<P>
The region's short-term recovery, as well as its long-term
economic future, rests in large part on how effectively the
financial and corporate sector can be restructured, Shin said.

KAMPALA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Police have asked the
Red Cross and other non-governmental organizations for assistance
to unearth a suspected mass grave belonging to a doomsday cult in
capital Kampala, the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The police have not started digging up the grave due to lack of

<HEADLINE> Compaq Reports Modest Profit For First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp. Tuesday
reported a profit that was in line with Wall Street's expectations
for the first quarter, as the personal computer maker struggled
with a slowdown in sales to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
Excluding special items, Compaq posted an operating profit of
281 million dollars, or 16 cents per share, during the three
months ended March 31, matching the consensus estimate of analysts
polled by earnings tracker First Call.
</P>
<P>
Including an after-tax gain of 44 million dollars related to
the company's strategic investment portfolio, the world's largest
personal computer maker said it earned 325 million dollars, or 19
cents per share, during the quarter. That's up 15 percent from 281
million dollars, or 16 cents per share, during the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 1 percent to 9.51 billion dollars from 9.42
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Executives at Compaq in Houston said that sluggish sales to
corporate customers were offset by strong demand on the consumer
side.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts believe that Compaq's sales were hampered by
corporate buyers who deferred their technology spending ahead of
the millennium changeover to avoid potential "Y2K" problem, which
many thought would render some systems unable to distinguish the
year 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
Though Y2K turned out to be largely a non-event, many
corporations did not resume their technology spending at the rate
that a lot of companies had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
But Compaq executives said that strong sales of consumer PCs as
well as ongoing cost-cutting initiatives helped them to meet their
earnings targets.
</P>
<P>
Compaq, which is in the process of laying off 7,000 workers and
implementing other cost-cutting measures, said its operating
expenses totaled 1.76 billion dollars during the quarter, a 7
percent reduction from the same period last year and an 8 percent
reduction sequentially.
</P>
<P>
Robust sales of PCs to consumers also helped offset weakness in
other areas, according to Compaq executives, who said Compaq's
Consumer Group posted revenue of 1.8 billion dollars during the
quarter, up 35 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Compaq executives, however, said they were confident about
meeting earnings and revenue projections for the second quarter
and the full year, as the company emerged from what they called a
difficult first quarter.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely comfortable with estimates for the total
year from both a revenue and a profitability point of view," said
Compaq President and Chief Executive Michael Capellas.

BERLIN -- The euro fell to a new low against the U.S. dollar
Tuesday on the first trading day here after the long Easter
holiday.
</P>
<P>
The euro was quoted at 0.9302 dollars Tuesday after having
fallen to 0.9376 dollars last Thursday, its lifetime low since it
was launched in January 1999. The exchange rate between the dollar
and German mark also fell to 1:2.1025, according to Tuesday's
reference price announced by the European Central Bank. Economists
said that the continuous economic growth in the United States
resulted in the sharp drop in the value of euro. (Germany-Euro-

UNITED NATIONS -- Russia said Tuesday the preservation of the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States
and the Soviet Union is the only way leading to negotiations for
further reductions of strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The compliance with the ABM Treaty in its present form without
any modifications is a prerequisite for further negotiations on
nuclear disarmament," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a
U.N. conference to review the implementation of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT, seen as a
cornerstone in arms reduction treaties, went into force in 1970.
It bars nuclear weapon states from transferring nuclear weapons to
non-nuclear-weapon states and prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states
from manufacturing and receiving such arms. (UN-Russia-ABM)

<HEADLINE> Moscow: Russia Won't Be Bound by U.N. Resolution on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Wednesday that it
regards as non-binding a resolution on Chechnya passed by the U.N.
Human Rights Commission because it had voted against the
unacceptable document.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released early Wednesday, the Russian Foreign
Ministry said that there were exclusively political reasons behind
the resolution, which was adopted in Geneva late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the resolution, which was initiated by
the European Union and the United States, was the result of
information pressure from Western states, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our objectives in the Chechen republic remain the same," the
statement said. "An end will be put to international terrorism.
Constitutional order, law and human rights and freedoms will be
restored in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
It said the future of the breakaway republic within the Russian
Federation would be "determined on the basis of a broad dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement bodies, supported by the presidential human
rights envoy in Chechnya and the national public commission will
thoroughly investigate all the facts of human rights violations in
the region," the statement said. "The persons guilty of the crimes
will be punished with all severity of law."
</P>
<P>
Despite the anti-Russia resolution, the statement said Russia
would "continue a dialogue with all Western partners and
international organizations which are indeed ready to help
stabilize the situation and provide humanitarian assistance to
Chechen population."
</P>
<P>
"We will do it proceeding from our convictions and Russia's
international commitments" but not under pressure from politically
biased resolutions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement thanked the countries that voted against the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful to these countries, which thus expressed their
disagreement with this improper anti-Russian action," it said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Supply Ship to Mir Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia launched a supply ship with
fuel, oxygen, water, food and instruments for the Mir space
station early Wednesday, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The ProgressM1-2 blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan at 00:08 a.m. Moscow time (1808 GMT Tuesday). It will
be put into orbit by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket, the Interfax news
agency reported, quoting the press service of the mission control
center in Korolyov outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The spaceship is scheduled to dock up with the 14-year-old Mir
station at 1:30 p.m. Moscow time (0930 GMT) Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second launch of an upgraded supply ship of the
progress M1 series. The previous one took place on February 1,
2000. The latest version, described as "space tankers", has eight
fuel tanks instead of four.
</P>
<P>
In the future, spaceships of the progress M1 series will be
used for supplying cargo to the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
The Mir space station includes six modules, which house 11.5
tons of different equipment made by specialists from 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 scientific experiments have been performed on
board the station, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mir was reactivated on April 6 after eight months of unmanned
operation. The Russian crew of commander Sergei Zalyotin and
flight engineer Alexander Kaleri are working at the station.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Index Continues Slipping in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Nikkei index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange continued falling Wednesday, partly due to
declines of several of its new components.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section lost 138.02 points, or 0.76 percent, from Tuesday's close
to end at 18,134.31, the lowest closing for the year.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) which covers
all First Section issues, in contrast, advanced for the seventh
straight trading day, rising 2.61 points or 0.16 percent to 1,667.
89.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section edged up to 551.81 million shares
from Tuesday's 537.35 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nichiei, a Yokohama-based lumber dealer, was the day's volume
leader.
</P>
<P>
Several issues newly added to the Nikkei remained under selling
pressure, traders said, adding that the turmoil caused by Monday's
reshuffle of the Nikkei's components will continue for the rest of
the week.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented high-tech issues were higher, helped by
Tuesday's surge on Wall Street, where the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index marked its second largest one-day point gain.
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers, nonbank moneylenders and paper makers drew active
buying, while banks, chemical firms and nonferrous metal makers
saw declines.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 685 to 535, with 169 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds FINA's Suspension of Two Swimmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Arbitration for Sport
(CAS) in Lausanne has upheld the decision by the FINA to suspend
David Mecca-Medina of Spain and Igor Majcen of Slovenia based on
findings of nandrolone metabolites in their urine samples on
February 29.
</P>
<P>
The court decision on Tuesday followed on appeals by the
Swimmers against decisions in March by the doping panel of FINA,
the Federation Internationale de Natation Amateur.
</P>
<P>
However, FINA said that it had agreed with the counsels for the
two swimmers to file a joint revision petition with the CAS if
grounds for a revision of the CAS decision exist.
</P>
<P>
The two swimmers claimed that nandrolone metabolites were found
in their urine samples as a result of consumption of meat (
including parts such as liver and kidneys) of uncastrated pigs as
components of a local dish called "sarapatel" which was offered in
their hotel prior to an open water swimming event in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, the counsels for the two swimmers presented
documentation relating to experiments in Belgium in which three
volunteers had eaten a meal prepared from a boar and whose urine
samples then were tested to detect nandrolone metabolites.
</P>
<P>
The documents show results indicating the presence of
nandrolone metabolites of levels that warrant further examinations
which may lead to a review of the findings on which the award is
based and, depending on such review, to a revision.
</P>
<P>
FINA said that the parties had agreed that the suspension
rendered on February 29 shall be temporarily lifted if the CAS
agrees to open revisions proceedings.

GUANGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -The exhibition hall at the
Guangzhou Fair this year was overwhelmed with local businesspeople
competing for attention.
</P>
<P>
Shao Tieyi, secretary-general of Xiamen Trade Delegation to the
87th Chinese Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou, said that
although more than 1,000 enterprises in Xiamen are authorized to
do foreign trade, their delegation was only allowed to rent 110
booths at the fair. Shao's sentiments were echoed across the
country.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 domestic enterprises in China are authorized
to do foreign trade and 300,000 overseas-financed businesses are
also eligible to do foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Xue Hong, an official with the trade delegation representing
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, told reporters that most of Ningxia
's exports were done via businesspeople who knew of or attended
the Fair in the past.
</P>
<P>
Huo Shengjun, an import and export manager with the Hai'er
Group, a home appliance manufacturer based in Qingdao, Shandong
Province, said: "if enterprises in China remain inflexible, they
will become redundant amidst global markets."
</P>
<P>
Huo said Hai'er has built marketing outlets in more than 70
countries and exports more than 100 million U.S. dollars worth of
commodities each year.

<P>
NANCHANG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An International Tea Fair will
be held in Xingzi County in east China's Jiangxi Province from
April 29 to May 2.
</P>
<P>
The New Millennium International Tea Fair, co-sponsored by the
Jiangxi Provincial Tourism Bureau, the Xingzi county government
and several other organizations, will be open to domestic and
overseas traders, investors and people interested in tea culture.
</P>
<P>
Tea performances, academic exchanges as well as trade and
investment talks will be held during the four-day fair.
</P>
<P>
Xingzi boasts two famous springs, Gulian Spring and Fangqiaotan
Spring, which are recorded in The Book of Tea by Lu Yu (733-804 A.
D.), a well-known Chinese tea expert.
</P>
<P>
The book is believed to be the world's first tea primer,
dealing systematically with the cultivation of tea bushes and
methods of tea-processing.
</P>
<P>
China is the home of tea. Tea shrubs are recorded as early as
five to six thousand years ago. Along with silk and porcelain, tea
was exported all over the world more than a thousand years ago.

enterprises can compete on the international market.
</P>
<P>
China scored 360.7 billion U.S. dollars in foreign trade last
year, including 194.9 billion U.S. dollars in exports. China ranks
ninth in the world in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the biannual Chinese Export Commodities Fair,
which is held in spring and autumn each year, major economic
development regions across China have also sponsored their own
trade fairs. Economically developed coastal areas even go abroad
and organize their investment and trade fairs overseas.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of domestic and overseas "dotcom" companies attended the
87th Chinese Export Commodities Fair and launched intensive
publicity campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies promoted 20 selected tourism routes to overseas
businessmen. More than 40,000 English tour brochures were
distributed.
</P>
<P>
"Though business deals from the fair are not big for us, we
have the chance to get to know many overseas customers, which in
turn means more future deals," said Xu Yongfei, a salesperson with
the Golden Rose Arts and Crafts Factory based in Fuzhou, capital
of east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 domestic companies who were denied access to booths
in the Hall set up stands in a nearby parking lot, a stadium and a
hotel plaza to compete for attention. Exhibits included toys,
ceramics, arts and crafts, and souvenirs.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Exporter Reports Growth in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouses, generated more than 8.8
billion U.S. dollars from foreign trade for the first three months
of this year, up 47.8 percent from the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The total figure included 4.9 billion U.S. dollars in exports,
an increase of 41.8 percent year on year, and 3.96 billion U.S.
dollars in imports, up 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province ranked third in China in exports, following
Guangdong Province in the southern coast and Shanghai in the same
period under review.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the sharp growth in exports is largely due to
exports by both state-owned enterprises and overseas-funded
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Jiangsu's state-owned enterprises
contributed 40.5 percent of the province's entire exports during
the period, while overseas-funded businesses achieved 2.65 billion
U.S. dollars in exports, accounting for 54 percent of the province
's total.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the General Administration of
Customs, China's foreign trade in the first quarter this year
topped 98.2 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 40-percent growth
from last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first three months hit 51.7 billion U.S. dollars
in the country, up 39 percent, while imports reached 46.5 billion

<HEADLINE> Exports Crucial to China's Economic Growth This Year: Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign trade accounted for 30-44 percent of China's GDP in
recent years, and the figure reached 44.6 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Surging exports promoted technical upgrading and industrial
restructuring by bringing in state-of-the-art equipment.
</P>
<P>
The steady growth of foreign trade will be affected by
uncertain global markets, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a a number of favorable policies to encourage
exports such as tax rebates in the face of a weak global market.
The rising prices of raw materials as well as stronger competition
from foreign companies would require greater efforts in sustaining
export growth.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts an annual
global economic growth of 4.2 percent in 2000, supported by strong
growth in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, IMF pointed out that the economic boom in U.S.,
based on a bullish stock market, poses somehow an uncertainty in
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the research institute said that economic growth
in China should combine both strong domestic demand and exports.

<HEADLINE> Exports Crucial to China's Economic Growth This Year: Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The accelerated GDP growth of
China in the first quarter is largely due to surging foreign trade,
local analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Research Institute under the State Development
Planning Commission published a report in today's "China
Securities", saying China's GDP this year will grow at a rate of
7.5 percent, up from the 7.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth slowed down for almost six years in the
wake of dealing with an overheated economy in the early 1990s and
the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Signs of recovery were shown in the first quarter with GDP
increasing to 8.1 percent, 1.3 percentage points higher than that
of the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the rapid growth is not the result of a healthy
domestic demand, but fueled by surging foreign trade, which jumped
40 percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth has been dependent on foreign trade
over the past 20 years. The average annual growth rate of foreign
trade stood at 15.6 percent in the last two decades. (

<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Zimbabweans who were
arrested a week ago for allegedly stoning President Robert
Mugabe's house in Harare appeared in court Tuesday on charge of
public violence, the Herald newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutor told the court that the accused were
attending a funeral for a member of the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) when the youths of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) passed through
the house chanting slogans.
</P>
<P>
The MDC members then chased the Zanu-PF youths who sought
refuge at the President's house, and threw stones to the house,
destroying all the windows of the house and some furniture.
</P>
<P>
But the defendants rejected all the accusations and complained
to the court that they had been kept in police custody for seven
days.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Criticizes Church for Political Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has strongly criticized church leaders calling for mass action
over the country' s constitutional review debate, the Daily Nation
newspaper said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Church should not be perceived as one of the actors in the
 political game," Moi said in a statement read out by Kenyan Vice
President George Saitoti during the Presbyterian Church of East
Africa's 16th General Assembly being held in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Moi, now in Nigeria on a three-day official visit, said it was
sad that church leaders had taken sides in the debate, thereby
heightening the polarization.
</P>
<P>
"It is even more disturbing to hear some church leaders have
threatened to engage in the so-called mass action and other
lawless activities," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted this was contrary to Christ's teachings, urging the
Church to champion positive values like love, peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on church leaders to stick to its
spiritual calling and maintain its role as a refuge for those who
seek spiritual nourishment, peace and quiet.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Adhere to "One Country, Two Systems" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government will continue to implement
the "one country, two systems" principle faithfully and maintain
the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong, a
government statement said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to the U.S. State Department Report on Hong Kong,
the Hong Kong SAR government said it has taken note of the U.S.
report's overall positive assessment that Hong Kong's high degree
of autonomy has been respected following its return to the
motherland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"As observed in the report, Hong Kong has remained a free
society and makes its own decisions as an international city in
our own economic interests," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We play an active part in the World Trade Organization and
other international forums such as APEC. We have a full range of
bilateral agreements and understandings with other governments to
cover areas such as air services, investment protection, mutual
legal assistance and visa-free travel," it added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of right of abode for persons born in the mainland
to parents who are now Hong Kong residents, the Hong Kong SAR
government statement said the power of final adjudication of the
Court of Final Appeal has been fully respected.
</P>
<P>
"The interpretation of the Basic Law on right of abode by the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is entirely
legal and constitutional. The interpretation was accepted by the
Court of Final Appeal in December last year," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government pledged to increase direct
elections to the Legislative Council in accordance with the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law has laid down a 10-year timetable to enable us
to consider the next step forward in the light of our political
experience. The development must be in accordance with the
principle of gradual and orderly progress and should be designed
to be acceptable to different sectors of the community," it
stressed.

<HEADLINE> 50 Bee Mite Sites Found in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Fifty apiary sites infected
with varroa mites have been found in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Varroa jacobsoni, a mite that poses no threat to human health
but kills bees, was initially found on four South Auckland
properties in New Zealand's North Island nearly two weeks ago. The
discovery of the pest resulted in the New Zealand Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) declaring a biosecurity alert for a
large area in and around the Auckland region.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Wednesday
that 749 sites and 11,591 hives have been inspected so far and all
affected sites are within the imposed quarantine area. It quoted
MAF spokesman Matthew Stone as saying mites have yet to be
confirmed in South Island.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has a trade of about a million U.S. dollars in
exporting live bees and a honey industry of more than 10 million U.
S. dollars.The bug is regarded as the most serious threat ever
faced by the multi-million-dollar industry in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The MAF is afraid that the use of pesticides to control the
mite could undermine trade in honey and other bee products, which
have been promoted as chemical residues free, according to NZPA.It
is likely that a decision regarding control options may require
further work for up to a fortnight.
</P>
<P>
NZPA reported that MAF is now preparing a paper discussing
these issues for presentation to the New Zealand cabinet next week.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement, New Zealand Minister of Agriculture Jim
Sutton said Wednesday that the government is considering paying
millions of dollars to wipe out the bee-killing varroa mite if it
is possible to eradicate it.
</P>
<P>
"The government would not give away the opportunity to get rid
of the mite simply due to cost," he stressed.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
said today that China appreciates Slovakia's adherence to the one-
China policy and its efforts to develop ties with China.
</P>

Hu, who is also a vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission, made the remarks at his meeting with Slovak Defense
Minister Pavol Kanis.
</P>
<P>
China and Slovakia have already had traditional friendship, Hu
said. "Since our two countries forged diplomatic ties seven years
ago, bilateral relations have been growing steadily and the
cooperation between the two countries have been gradually expanded,

countries would strengthen friendly exchanges in all aspects on

between China and Slovakia is in the fundamental interest of our
two peoples," he said, adding that concerted efforts should be

issue.
</P>

supports China's peaceful reunification. Slovakia has no
diplomatic relations with Taiwan and will not establish diplomatic
ties with Taiwan in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>

China's principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit
in developing relations with small countries. He hoped the

<HEADLINE> IBF's Ratings Chairman Beavers Describes System Based on Payoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The longtime chairman of the
IBF ratings committee described a system that helped or penalized
boxers based on payoffs from promoters and managers, according to
reports from Newark.
</P>
<P>
The chairman, C. Douglas Beavers, testified Tuesday his panel
was a sham because only he and IBF founder Robert W. Lee did the
rankings, and that Lee had the final say and often ignored the
sanctioning body's written criteria.
</P>
<P>
Beavers also told the jury in Lee's racketeering case that the
sport's biggest promoters, including Don King, regularly got
special consideration from Lee.
</P>
<P>
The International Boxing Federation derives about 90 percent of
its revenues from sanctioning fees paid by promoters of boxers in
IBF title fights, Beavers said during his first full day on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
Beavers described how the IBF rankings were corrupted to favor
certain boxers, including heavyweights Francois Botha and Joe Hipp.
</P>
<P>
They are among about two dozen fighters that prosecutors say
benefited from Lee's manipulations.
</P>
<P>
Lee and other IBF officials are accused of taking 338,000 U.S.
dollars in bribes to rig rankings, which play a big role in
determining whom a boxer fights and how much he earns.
</P>
<P>
The trial, now in its second week, is expected to last three
months. In the meantime, a court-appointed monitor is overseeing
the IBF, and Lee is barred from participating in IBF affairs.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Garment Buyers Call for Fabric Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's garment buyers have
called for a strong fabric manufacturing base in the country to
cope with increasing competition, the official Daily News reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main areas which will affect us adversely in global
competition ... is the lack of a strong fabric base," Errol
Weerasinghe, chairman of the Sri Lanka Garment Buying Offices
Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He told the association's annual meeting last Friday that the
fabric base will have to be substantially and significantly
developed for business to grow.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's garment industry has for long enjoyed the security
provided by the Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA) for apparel exports.
</P>
<P>
However, with the phasing out of the MFA in 2005, the garment
industry will face increasing competition and require more
aggressive marketing to win orders.
</P>
<P>
Weerasinghe said he was glad to note that many globally
recognized accessories and trim manufacturers are gradually
setting up in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said that together with this if a fabric base follows, Sri
Lanka will be able to be competitive in the post-MFA period.
</P>
<P>
Weerasinghe cautioned that the rate of growth of the garment
sector is slowing down and efforts should be made to accelerate it
as Malaysia,South Korea, Singapore, China and Japan have done.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's garment industry is the country's most important
sector as it accounts for over 50 percent of the total exports and
65 percent of all industrial exports and directly employs more
than 350,000 persons.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Strives for Border Areas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar spent more than 18 billion
kyats (56.25 million U.S. dollars) on its border area development
projects between late 1988 and the end of March this year,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, the paper said
efforts have been made for the development of the border areas for
over 10 years and tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Since measures have been taken to ensure that most of the
domestic anti-government armed groups operating in the border
areas have returned to the legal fold, plans for the areas'
development could be implemented, said Khin Nyunt, who is also
chairman of the Work Committee for Development of Border Areas and
National Races, at the committee's coordination meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the success achieved so far is far beyond
expectations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has laid down six strategic objectives in carrying out
the tasks of border areas development. They include building of
all-weather roads in strategic regions, growing of paddy,
sugarcane, corn and beans and pulses for self-sufficiency,
cultivation of perennial crops on a large scale, upgrading of
school buildings and taking of precautionary measures against
diseases likely to break out in border areas.

<HEADLINE> Anwar's Defense to Appeal Against Decision on Mahathir's Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's defense lawyers were allowed
Wednesday to appeal against a decision by the High Court here not
to call Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as a witness in Anwar's
ongoing sodomy trial.
</P>
<P>
When the trial resumed at the High Court here Wednesday after a
five-day break, court judge Arifin Jaka said he was granting a
stay for the defense to appeal on condition that they file the
appeal immediately.
</P>
<P>
The judge postponed the trial indefinitely until the appeal is
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The High Court passed last Friday the ruling not to call
Mahathir to testify in Anwar's sodomy trial after hearing
submissions from Senior Deputy Public Prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail
who said Anwar's intention of calling Mahathir was only to
ridicule and scandalize the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Gani also said the defense had failed to show any
relevancy on what they intend to adduce through Mahathir's
proposed evidence.
</P>
<P>
Judge Arifin said that to call Mahathir to testify in the trial
would be an abuse of the court process and it was his duty to
refrain such thing from happening.
</P>
<P>
He said there was not an iota of evidence to show that the
prime minister was involved in fabricating evidence in the alleged
conspiracy to topple Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, is jointly tried with his adopted brother Sukma
Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja, 38, on separate charges of sodomizing
Anwar's former family driver Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
Sukma, a businessman, faces another charge of abetting Anwar to
sodomize Azizan.
</P>
<P>
Both Anwar and Sukma have applied to the court for having
Mahathir as a witness in his personal capacity.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is serving a six-year jail sentence upon conviction on
four counts of corrupt practice of interfering with police
investigations into allegations of his alleged sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was fired as deputy prime minister on September 2, 1998.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Develop Consumer Credit Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese customarily spend no more than they have, and the
proportion of personal income they deposit has always been high.
Only 31 percent of Chinese are interested in the consumer credit
business.
</P>
<P>
Other research shows that in China's five largest cities,
including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, 59 percent of the
citizens know about the personal loan business, but have never
considered using a loan.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that four percent of the citizens worried
about revealing information on their personal finances and want
nothing to do with credit services.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people's loan repayment ability is still weak: The
average per family monthly income in 35 major Chinese cities is 1,
500 yuan (about 180.72 US dollars). Deducting the average monthly
living costs, a family has only 400 yuan (about 48.19 US dollars)
available for loan payments.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China needs a comprehensive personal credit
system to support its rising consumer credit business.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Develop Consumer Credit Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people's traditional
buying habits and the country's backward credit system continue to
hinder the development of consumer credit, according to a recent
article in Financial News.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that consumer credit or loans can go far in
stimulating domestic demand, guaranteeing the steady growth of the
economy, and giving Chinese people a more convenient way to buy
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks also expect the emergence of the consumer
credit business to raise their asset quality and liquidity.
</P>
<P>
An official market survey shows that about 40 percent of
Chinese people are keen on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that people's zest for consumer credit,
especially for personal housing loans, will increase substantially
as China's urban housing reform is gradually carried out.
</P>
<P>
Since November, 1998, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China (ICBA) has offered ten consumer loans, including those for
home buying, home repair, automobile purchase and even for travel.
</P>
<P>
But the development of China's consumer credit market is still
far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, only one percent of China's total
consumption was made through consumer credit; the figure is
usually over 20 percent in western developed countries.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua)-- The Republic of Korea admitted

that has been raging in the ROK has nothing to do with China's
agricultural exports to that country.
</P>

Recently, there is a rumor that the hoof-and-mouth disease in
the ROK was caused by China's exports to the ROK.

The chief economist of the Bank of America, Jeremy Hawkins,
said in London Tuesday that there is nothing at the moment that
could check the slide of the euro. He predicted the sliding trend
would continue.
</P>
<P>
But German Finance Minister Hans Eichel was a bit optimistic.
He said the decisive effort for the smooth economic development in
Germany is the stable currency relationship in the euro zone,
because the index of the national economy in the euro zone has
been higher than that at the early days of the birth of the euro.

<P>
LIMA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Peru and Venezuela
will rise to 500 million U.S. dollars this year, an expected
increase of 16 percent over 1999, a Venezuelan diplomat said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Julio Cesar Herrera, Venezuela's commercial attache in Lima,
noted that trade between the two countries fell 11.8 percent to
431.6 million dollars in 1999 after slumping by one third to 489.8
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Herrera, in the best period of 1990-1997,
bilateral trade between his country and Peru had nearly septupled,
with a record 700 million dollars registered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum products and iron and steel are among the major
exports of Venezuela. It imports copper, zinc, fish powder, cotton
and cocoa from Peru.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 the oil-based Venezuelan economy experienced a 7.2
percent fall, the worst recession of the Latin American countries.
However, analysts said that it will overcome the crisis and see a
growth of about 3 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Farmers Have Access to TV, Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China is closer to hitting the
target of providing all its villages with easy access to
television and radio shows.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, another 70 million Chinese farmers in more than 70,
000 villages have had TVs and radios in their homes, according to
a national conference being held in Xichang city, southwest China'
s Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, as many as 150 million people in 100,000 outlying and
mountainous villages did not have televisions or radios.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this trend, the central government established a
special fund of 250 million yuan (about 30 million US dollars),
and provincial, municipal and autonomous regional governments have
provided 750 million yuan (90.36 million US dollars) in matching
funds to give all the country's villages TV and radio access
within three years.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yichun, an official in charge of the project, said that the
TV and radio-deprived population has dropped from 150 million to
80 million in just over two years.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the number of remote villages which don't have
TVs or radios in Sichuan Province account for one-eighth of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the province had relayed radio and
television programs to more than 11,000 villages, or 95 percent of
its total.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Government agencies, educational
experts and Internet portals must join to fight pornography, an
article in today's China Daily says.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, more than 500,000 pornographic
websites are operating worldwide and it is easy for children to
browse pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Compared with print media and TV, the Internet is more of a
threat since it is boundless, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that "protecting youth from becoming Net
porn victims requires urgent action."
</P>
<P>
According to the article, now there is no specific regulation
on porn websites in China.
</P>
<P>
"One solution is special software to block access to dirty
pictures and keep young people away from them," the article
suggests.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Regarded as Most Popular Occupation: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Majority of Shenzhen
residents consider scientist as the most prestigious and popular
occupation, a recent survey has found.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Shenzhen Weekly and the Sociology
Department of Shenzhen University, asked 610 local households to
express their views on 100 common occupations, including how much
they like the jobs, the impression of the jobs and the jobs'
social position.
</P>
<P>
Scientist, as an occupation, topped the 100 occupations, today'
s China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Similar surveys have been done in some other cities in China,
and the results are amazingly similar, which indicates that
scientists are respected all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Network engineer, professor and software engineer ranked the
second, third and fourth in the survey, apparently higher than in
previous ones.
</P>
<P>
The top ten occupations also included architect, pilot, primary
and high school teacher, translator, lecturer and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, salesman was the least prestigious occupation,
according to survey results.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, a fast-developing city neighboring Hong Kong, is the
first special economic zone in China.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Worker-Turned-Farmer Devoted to Tree-Planting (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A wide swath of trees outlines
the suburbs of Pingxiang, a city in east China's Jiangxi Province,
which just 20 years ago was surrounded by barren, rocky hills.
</P>
<P>
Worker-turned-farmer Xiong Qidong and his family are credited
with the transformation, which has created not only more pleasant
surroundings for Xiong and his fellow villagers but also gives
them the chance to make more money.
</P>
<P>
When Xiong announced he was giving up his job at a State-owned
paper mill in 1981, many of his relatives and friends jeered at
his decision to abandon the security of the "iron bowl" for a life
of hoeing.
</P>
<P>
But Xiong was determined to rejuvenate the balding hills that
once were the lifeline of the villagers.
</P>
<P>
To start out, he contracted 5.2 ha of land from the community,
spending all of his family's savings of 1,710 yuan (about 200 US
dollars) on the purchase.
</P>
<P>
No guarantees came with planting tree seedlings on the rugged
land. Giving himself over fully to the project, Xiong built a
bamboo hut on the hill, and moved his family of four into it. (

Xiong didn't allow success to lead to complacency; instead he
bought more treeless hills, and asked other villagers to join him
in his project.
</P>
<P>
Xiong and his wife gave their neighbors free saplings, carrying
them by the bundle to every doorstep in the village.
</P>
<P>
Local people estimate that in the past 20 years, the Xiong's
have given free saplings worth at least 200,000 yuan to the
villagers.
</P>
<P>
Xiong's devotion to tree-planting led him to more formal study
of farming skills. He subscribed to a number of agricultural
science journals and newspapers and bought books on the subject. (

Xiong traveled to the provinces of Hunan, Zhejiang and
Guangzhou to learn from skilled farmers there. Now, many forestry
experts in the region regard him as one of their own.
</P>
<P>
The local forestry department said that by the end of 1999,
Xiong and his family had greened over 1,200 ha of barren hills, of
which 500 have been planted with fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
The total assets of Xiong's "green bank" have reached over
eight million yuan, and the yearly net income of his family stands
at 120,000 yuan, they said.
</P>
<P>
Xiong's success has set a good example for his neighbors, and
now all 36 of households in the village have contracted their own
land to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts have also paid off: Their annual average income
from the trees is more than 300 yuan, and many of the families in
the village are no longer living in poverty.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Court Approves Seizure of Soeharto Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The South Jakarta District Court
Tuesday endorsed seizure by the Attorney General's Office (AGO) of
the assets belonging to seven charity foundations set up and
chaired by former President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The court endorsement was signed by Deputy Chief of the South
Jakarta court J. M. T. Simatupang, according to The Indonesian
Observer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The court said in a letter that a sequestration order would be
issued soon after the AGO hands over documents related to the
probe into the affairs of the former president.
</P>
<P>
The AGO in a letter dated April 18 asked the court to endorse
its plan to seize Soeharto's assets.
</P>
<P>
This was the first concrete move made by Indonesia's judiciary
against the former president in its attempt to bring him to court.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is suspected of abusing his power and authority as
president by issuing decrees and government regulations to amass
funds through the foundations.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old former ruler has repeatedly rejected calls to
answer a series of questions related to the corruption probe
initiated by the AGO.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who suffered a stroke last year, has been placed
under city arrest which bans him from leaving the capital.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Vice President Renews Peace Campaign in Ambon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri Tuesday visited Ambon, capital of Maluku
Province, to renew her efforts to restore peace in the town.
</P>
<P>
"The government has a strong will to rebuild Maluku. But to
forge peace and order here (Ambon), the spirit of peace must come
from within the people of Maluku," Megawati told 3,000 people from
the Muslim and Christian communities gathering at the Halong Naval
Base soccer field, about four kilometers east of Ambon.
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather see the Maluku people sing in harmony rather than
swing machetes and kill each other," the vice president was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Megawati took a strong entourage from Jakarta, including
Indonesian Military chief Adm. Widodo A.S., National Police chief
Lt. Gen. Roesdihardjo, Minister of Home Affairs Surjadi Soedirdja,
chief of State Intelligence Board Arie J. Kumaat and Minister of
Religious Affairs Tolchah Hasan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Megawati had visited the Silo Church and An'
nur Mosque which were destroyed during the communal riots.
</P>
<P>
After spending a night on the KRI Arun battleship, the vice
president will visit North Maluku on Wednesday before heading back
to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people have been killed in communal clashes
that began in Ambon in January 1999 and later spread to the
neighboring province of North Maluku. Clashes have subsided in
recent months but tension remains in many regions.

with Israel," the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also told Shareh that France prefers a peace agreement
between Syria and Israel ahead of an Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon. The United Nations Security Council has approved the
Israeli decision and therefore Syria should be prepared for
another hypothesis -- a unilateral pullout by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The application, in a complete and transparent way of the
United Nations Security Council resolutions (by Israel), cannot be
rejected and can only be approved," Chirac was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it will apply the relevant U.N. resolutions calling
for its pullout from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Chirac, Shareh delivered a letter from
Syrian President Hafez Assad, in which the Syrian president
explained the reasons for the failure of his summit meeting with U.
S. President Bill Clinton in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the United States should be
responsible for the failure of the Geneva summit, which was aimed
at breaking the deadlock in the Syria-Israel peace process.
</P>
<P>
Shareh said that if Israel pulls out completely without any
condition beyond the international frontier of Lebanon, Syria will
be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
"But if Israel wants to use this pullout to put pressure on
Syria, it will not succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Israel has "hidden plans" behind
the pullout, which will be revealed sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
"Israel wants to aggravate the situation by threatening to pull
out, and wants to fool even the big powers, but we will not accept
it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Deputies To Rate Work of Beijing's Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Leading officials of the Beijing
municipal government will have their work evaluated by the city's
leading legislative body this year, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the Beijing Municipal People's Congress will exert
a decisive power on local government officials, not only in every
election year, but also during their time in office, the newspaper
quoted Tao Xiping, an official in the Standing Committee of the
11th Beijing Municipal People's Congress, as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Having some pilot work, we decided to spread the appraisal to
a wider range this year," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
Tao took the action as a very important step to better carry
out the supervising function of the People's Congress over the
people's government, defined in the Constitution, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report said that Beijing adopted the practice in
as early as 1993, but it had been limited to those at district or
county level until last year.
</P>
<P>
"Because the officials under appraisal should produce
improvement measures on the opinions of the Standing Committee of
the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the Standing Committee
will do follow-up examinations on the implementation of the
measures," Tao said.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Inoculation of Transient Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health has urged
health departments at various levels to attach importance to
inoculating children who are part of the nation's transient
population, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call came on the National Child Immunization Publicity Day
on Tuesday. The ministry chose the theme of immunization of
transient children because many are not inoculated.
</P>
<P>
China has seen a surge in workers and their families moving
from rural areas to urban centers, especially major cities in
eastern and southern China.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 million people live at places where they are not
registered as permanent residents, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The high mobility and scattered residences of the transient
population make child immunization work difficult.
</P>
<P>
The ministry asked local departments to do all they can to
spread the inoculation message, especially polio immunization,
among transient groups.
</P>
<P>
Under Chinese law, every child must get four vaccinations --
against tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria and polio.

CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

The Australian Financial Review:

<HEADLINE> Many Australian Girls Experience Date Violence: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- More than one third of
Australian teenage girls have experienced a violent dating
relationship, with males using physical coercion to obtain sex, a
new survey published on Wednesday's Sydney Morning Herald said.
</P>
<P>
The largest survey of young Australians' attitude toward
violence showed that males were more likely to humiliate and
physically restrain a partner or throw, smash, hit or kick
something.
</P>
<P>
In the survey of 5,000 people aged between 12 and 20, one in
seven female teenagers said they had been raped, sexually
assaulted or been in a situation where a boyfriend tried to
physically force them to have sex.
</P>
<P>
And one in four had been pushed, grabbed or shoved by a partner,
said the Young People Domestic Violence survey, commissioned by
the federal government under its Partnership Against Domestic
Violence Program.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, fewer than one in 30 males had experienced these
things, although one in five had been slapped, pushed, grabbed, or
shoved by a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Age was the main factor influencing teenagers' attitudes, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
The younger they were, regardless of their social class or sex,
the more likely they were to condone violent behavior, it said.

UNITED NATIONS -- Russia said Tuesday the preservation of the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States
and the Soviet Union is the only way leading to negotiations for
further reductions of strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The compliance with the ABM Treaty in its present form without
any modifications is a prerequisite for further negotiations on
nuclear disarmament," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a
U.N. conference to review the implementation of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
</P>
<P>
The NPT, seen as a cornerstone in arms reduction treaties, went
into force in 1970. It bars nuclear weapon states from
transferring nuclear weapons to non-nuclear-weapon states and
prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states from manufacturing and
receiving such arms. (UN-Russia-ABM)

<HEADLINE> Canada's North Atlantic Oil Rigs Threatened by Icebergs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of icebergs have been
spotted within 100 kilometers of the oil fields in North Atlantic,
threatening oil rigs operating southeast of Newfoundland, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Officials in St. John's said Tuesday that they have pushed or
pulled away several frozen hulks from three rigs since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Two of the floating rigs were shut down for safety over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Pip Rudkin, manager of iceberg tracking at Provincial Airlines
in St. John's, told local media that "they (icebergs) tend to come
in waves" in this iceberg season.
</P>
<P>
"We expect another wave but it will be about the same size," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the past decade that icebergs have
threatened drilling operations.
</P>
<P>
Supply ships mounted with powerful water cannons are being sent
out from St. John's to protect oil rigs.
</P>
<P>
Rudkin said there are about 1,100 icebergs in the northwest
Atlantic, but fewer than 200 are expected to make it south of the
48th parallel.
</P>
<P>
Most icebergs result from Greenland's ice cap. Each year up to
30,000 chunks enter the water with only a few hundred surviving a
three-year journey to approach Newfoundland's coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Problems surrounding the fitness
of Man United's record-breaking transfer signing Ruud van
Nistelrooy mean his arrival at the club has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
Man United have agreed an 18.5 million pounds fee with Dutch
club PSV Eindhoven for the 23-year-old star.
</P>
<P>
The club had been due to unveil his arrival during a press
conference at the club on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The player has been suffering with a recurring knee problem and
has not played since March.
</P>
<P>
It had earlier been suggested he had successfully negotiated a
medical examination at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
However, it later emerged that although there was no dispute
over the fee to be paid for the player, Manchester United want to
carry out further tests before completing the deal which will
break the British transfer record.
</P>
<P>
The medial knee ligament injury is a worry to United, who will
want to be absolutely certain of his future fitness before
spending so much money.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United financial director David Gill, said: "As you
will be aware Ruud van Nistelrooy has had a knee injury and has
not played for the last six to eight weeks. The key focus of our
tests on Tuesday has been on the injured knee and we have been
unable to complete all the necessary tests to our satisfaction
today."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to conduct the tests over the course of the
next few days in co-operation with PSV Eindhoven and will
communicate the position as soon as possible. I am pleased to
inform you that we have concluded negotiations with both PSV and
Ruud and we will complete the transfer as soon as the tests have
been satisfactorily concluded," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Slows Down African Economic Growth by 1.3 Percent: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Song Li
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An American economist Tuesday
cautioned the first ever African summit on Roll Back Malaria held
in Nigeria's capital Abuja that Malaria is dragging down the
continent's already slow economic growth by 1.3 percent in terms
of gross domestic product (GDP) each year.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for International
Development at Havard University, said that the disease, quite
contrary to people's common views, is more an economic disaster
than a medical one.
</P>
<P>
While presenting a research report to the African leaders
attending the summit, Sachs suggested that the efficient control
of the disease would significantly increase the continent's
economic productivity and per capital income.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the per capital GDP in many sub-Saharan African
countries has declined, and malaria is an important reason for
that, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited his statistics and findings as demonstrating that the
sub- Saharan African's per capital GDP would be up to 32 percent
greater this year if malaria had been eliminated 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
This would mean up to 100 billion U.S. dollars added to the
sub-Saharan Africa's current GDP annual total of about 300 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The added sum would be, by comparison, nearly five times
greater than all development aids provided to Africa last year,
the scholar said.
</P>
<P>
Basing on the alarming figures, he called upon the
international community to channel more development aid to malaria
prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
He also called on African governments to put the issue of
malaria control on top of their agenda because of its huge
economic dimensions.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Gto
Harlem Brundtland echoed Sachs' opinion, saying that "malaria is
hurting the living standards of Africans today and is also
preventing the improvement of the living standards for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
What the continent needs now is for its leaders both from the
public and private sectors to step forward and make it the
elimination of malaria possible, she said.
</P>
<P>
The first ever African summit on fighting malaria opened on
Tuesday and was attended by leaders from more than 40 African
countries and dozens of international agencies.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit, proposed by Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo last year, was co-sponsored by the Nigerian government
and four United Nations agencies: the WHO, the United Nations
Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Program and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Opening the one-day summit aimed at refocusing attention on
malaria, Obasanjo observed that the devastating death toll from
malaria in Africa is calling for a total cancellation of the
continent's debt to free resources to combat the deadly disease.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Foreign Minister Calls for Closer Relations With Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic Tuesday called for closer and profitable bilateral
relations between his country and Ghana, Ghana News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, accompanied by a group of business leaders, is
currently on a two-day visit to Ghana.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Ghanaian Vice President John Mills, the
foreign minister said Yugoslavia is entering a new stage and is
working to further develop vital areas of its economy, especially
in science and technology, despite the current political
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Despite sanctions by the West, the refugee problem and the
"distorting pictures being shown around the world", Yugoslavia
managed to achieve economic growth with average gross national
product between 5 and 6 percent last year as compared to the 1.7
percent average for the entire Eastern Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Ghana for its role in international politics in the
past decade, stressing that the two countries must work at
securing fruitful political and socio-economic co-operation to
boost the development of their peoples, commonly united by the
goals of the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
"We so much cherish the positive and constructive role of Ghana
in the West African region as one of the promoters of integration,
peace and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mills buttressed the need for the two countries to
shift focus in their relations to economic co-operation to exploit
many opportunities available.
</P>
<P>
Describing Yugoslavia as a "true friend", Mills said Yugoslavia
still has the potentials and called on "true friends" to remain
behind it to go through the current difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Claims Support for Khatami Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei Wednesday called on political groups to support President
Muhammad Khatami's government and help it overcome the problems.
</P>
<P>
"The president is himself a defender of the system and the
revolution," Khamenei said. "I, based on fundamental principles,
strongly support the president," he was quoted by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Khamenei stressed the need for remaining loyal to
slogans and principled stances of the Islamic revolution, and again
attacked the reformist press for trying to mislead public opinion "
against Islam, the revolution and the Islamic system."
</P>
<P>
All personalities, groups and factions loyal to Islam and the
revolution should adopt concrete positions against those inside and
outside the country who counter the revolution and constitution
under the cover of reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's words came as the conservatives, who control most of
the country's powerful institutions, were stepping up their
vengeful crackdown on the reformists. More than a dozen newspapers
and other publications were ordered to close, and several editors
and managing directors were summoned to court for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader also echoed the conservative condemnation of
a controversial Berlin seminar, which was attended by a number of
prominent Iranian reformers and critical of the Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives lashed out at the Iranian participants' speech
as "conflicting Islamic values and principles, and advocating U.S.-
style reforms."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei called the Berlin conference "ugly," accusing it of
having been supported by the "security, political and intelligence
organs of the enemies."
</P>
<P>
A participant has been jailed, and the Special Court for Clergy
issued an arrest warrant for a cleric, who also participated in the
conference and is currently in France.
</P>
<P>
The political struggle between the powerful conservatives and
nascent reformists in Iran has become heated as the date for the
sixth parliament to take office draws near.
</P>
<P>
The president's supporters won an overwhelming victory in
February parliamentary elections, ending conservative grip of the
legislative body since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
A runoff election has been set on May 5 to decide winners of the
remaining 66 seats in the 290-member parliament. The other 224
seats were already decided pending an approval by the election
watchdog Guardians Council, which is dominated by the
conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Envoy Accuses U.S. of Abusing U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara Faruk
Abdullah Yahya has accused the U.S. government of abusing U.N.
sanctions in an attempt to take control of Iraq's oil resources,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"After the Gulf War, the United States forced most countries to
impose an embargo on Iraq. The U.S. and the United Kingdom's target
is to destroy Iraq and take control of its oil resources," Yahya
said Wednesday during a visit to Izmir, western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is the second largest oil producer in the world after
Saudi Arabia. After imposition of the embargo, Iraq was permitted
to import only some of medical and humanitarian supplies," said the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"More than 1.5 million people have died because of this embargo,
which has caused the Iraqi people much suffering," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed harsh sanctions against Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under a U.N. humanitarian oil-
for-food program launched in 1996, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil under U.N. supervision with the revenues used to buy
food, medicines and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy went to Izmir, the third largest city of Turkey,
to explore ways to strengthen commercial relations between Turkey
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Citing the case that Turkey's private sector has lost 50 billion
U.S. dollars because of the decade-old embargo, Yahya noted that
the trade relations between Turkey and Iraq were badly damaged
following the Gulf War in 1991 and both countries had suffered huge
commercial losses.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that Iraq would like to further its
commercial ties with Turkey and had started meeting with Turkish
investors, adding that the Iraqi government is ready to help
Turkish investors in any field.
</P>
<P>
Turkey wants to see the sanctions lifted or at least eased
because Ankara views its trade with Iraq as crucial for its own
economy and for the restoration of stability in its terrorism-hit
southeast.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey is caught between the U.S., its close NATO ally,
and the sanctions on Iraq, its neighbor. The strategic partnership
forged between Ankara and Washington restricts Turkey's field of
maneuverability because of U.S. hardline policy on Iraq.

</P>
<P>
This declaration, signed by FARC's superior command, was read
on Wednesday via the radio broadcasting station RCN.
</P>
<P>
According to the Non-Government Organization, Pais Libre's
figures, FARC was the organization that kidnapped last year 728
persons out of a national total of 2,945 cases.
</P>
<P>
In the comunique, the guerrillas said that since no "
substantial agreements with government in conversations," they
decided to collect a peace tax to individual whose patrimony is
over one million U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
They made a call to these people to "comply with this
obligation," warning to those who do not, that they "will be
retained". Their release will be determined in agreement with a
payment previously fixed, they said.

According to a study by Colombia's army and the Department of

<HEADLINE> Buenos Aires Should Be Mercosur's Financial Center: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a breakfast with foreign correspondents, Cavallo, now
candidate for governor of the Buenos Aires province for the May 7
elections, said that Argentina and Brazil can achieve to create a
common regional currency if they lower taxes and stick to
convertibility.
</P>
<P>
"If I am elected, I will turn Buenos Aires into Mercosur's
financial center for we have greater law and tax advantages, but
we must first eliminate intermediation costs with the purpose of
generating greater money availability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cavallo, as Minister of Economy during most of the
administration of Carlos Menem (1989-1999), was the schemer of the
"convertibility" system under which one Argentinean peso is equal
to one US dollar, and contributed to lowering inflation during the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
Buenos Aires is a financial center whose stock exchange trades
at least 13 times below Sao Paulo's, Brazil's principal industrial
and financial center, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Mercosur, Cavallo said that the search for a common
currency, like in the European Union, will not be achieved until
monetary policies of Argentina and Brazil are harmonized.
</P>
<P>
"Argentina must lower interest rates in order to attract
foreign capitals to its stock exchange while Brazil must stick to
convertibility, otherwise, I think it will be very difficult to
drive Mercosur and a common currency," Cavallo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while as long as in the U.S. and Europe interest
rates remain around 5 to 8 percent, in Argentina and Brazil, will
rise to between 12 and 16 percent.

MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The first congress of the Union
Public Chamber of Russia on Belarus on Wednesday condemned Western
interference in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the Moscow meeting adopted a statement on the "
inadmissibility of interference in the internal affairs of
sovereign Yugoslavia," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

air strikes and bombings, thousands of peaceful people died and
the economic potential of the country was seriously damaged."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the presence of multinational contingent in
Kosovo "has not brought ethnic peace and accord to the autonomous
(Yugoslav)province."
</P>
<P>
More and more people are starting to realize that "the
peacekeeping mission forced upon Yugoslavia has failed, and the
growing tension is fraught with dangerous consequences for other
Balkan countries as well," the statement said.

It demanded that "component bodies of Yugoslavia be given the

Though Nicaragua signed a free trade agreement in 1997 with
Mexico, trade growth between both countries is increasing very
slowly, in the order of 4 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
The document said that Texan farmers' families are convinced
that it is better to use the abundant agricultural produce as a
peace and cooperation tool among nations.
</P>
<P>
The 19-member delegation, which arrived Monday and finished its
visit Wednesday, was accompanied during its visit to the island by
U.S. Democrat congressman from Texas Charles Stemholm, also a
member of the Congress Agricultural Committee.
</P>
<P>
The congressman said that a first step could be to lift the
sanctions against Cuba regarding food and medicines, and in this
sense, he supported the Aschfrot amendment, a draft law that
allows for the sale of these products in the island.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Stemholm said that the case of the Cuban
child, Elian Gonzalez, has generated a good situation between the
governments of the United States and Cuba. "This is an excellent
moment for the Congress to cease the embargoes, not only against
Cuba," the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Grains Federation of Texas say the Cuban market
has 1 billion dollar potential in rice, wheat, grains, cereals and
other agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
With over 300,000 members, the federation is considered as one
of the largest farmers organizations in the world.

<HEADLINE> IRA Men Moved to Top Security Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A number of Irish Republican Army
prisoners were transferred to a high security jail in northern
Ireland Wednesday after a prison officer was held captive.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners, who committed offenses in the Republic of
Ireland, were being moved from Castlerea Prison in County
Roscommon to the high security Portlaoise jail, in County Laois.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Prison Service said it took the decision to move the
prisoners back to Portlaoise "following events in the prison over
the past 48 hours."
</P>
<P>
On Easter Sunday, a prisoner officer was held in the
republican unit against his will and in a follow-up search, prison
officers discovered a passport, tools, alcohol and cash.
</P>
<P>
The Prison Service also decided that the prisoners should
remain in Portlaoise pending completion of the on-going
investigation of recent events in Castelrea and pending full
consideration by the authorities on the findings of that
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who is married with three children, was released
after a few minutes, but was seriously shaken by the incident.
</P>
<P>
It was the second incident in the low-security jail within a
few days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week a paramilitary uniform was discovered
smuggled into the prison.
</P>
<P>
The treatment of the IRA inmates in Castlerea prison has caused
controversy in the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
They are not thought to be eligible for early release under the
Good Friday Agreement early prisoner release scheme.
</P>
<P>
But under the terms of the Northern Ireland peace accord they
were being retained under a less stringent regime than at
Portlaoise.

<HEADLINE> British Home Secretary Witnesses Immigrant Arrests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
Wednesday witnessed 10 people being caught attempting to illegally
enter the UK as he inspected immigration procedures in the
southern port city of Dover.
</P>
<P>
Straw witnessed the arrests as he went to the port to see how
the government's new measures to curb illegal immigration to the
UK were working.
</P>
<P>
His visit came the day after the Home Office announced that it
had dealt with a record number of asylum applications last month.
</P>
<P>
The debate over asylum seekers has dominated local elections
campaigning in recent weeks with both Labor and the Conservatives
having been accused of politicizing the issue.
</P>
<P>
During his morning inspection in Dover, Straw saw immigration
officers discover nine people in one vehicle, including a woman
with a child, and a further person in a second vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The team of officers were using sniffer dogs, special probes to
detect breathing and other equipment on lorries disembarking from
ferries.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officers dealt with 11,340 cases during March --
four times the number dealt with at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 lorry drivers, 19 of whom are British, have been
caught carrying asylum seekers since the measures were introduced.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials at Dover also showed Straw new
arrangements for dispersing asylum seekers from Kent to other
areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The dispersal arrangements have caused concern among local
councils, many of which are saying that they have not been offered
enough money from the government to cope with the influx of
immigrants.

<HEADLINE> April 25 Declared as Africa's Malaria Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state at the first-ever
African Summit on Roll Back Malaria have declared April 25 of
every year as Africa's Malaria Day and called on the United
Nations to declare the coming decade, 2001 - 2010, as A Decade for
Malaria.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria cited a declaration signed at the
end of the summit Tuesday night and published on Wednesday as
calling for developed countries to donate new and substantial
resources of at least 1 billion U.S. dollars annually to help
combat the disease in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The document also called on developed countries to facilitate
the collaboration of research institutions to ensure full
utilization of research findings.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the heads of state agreed to commit
themselves to an intensive effort to halve the malaria mortality
for African people by 2010 by implementing the strategies and
actions for roll back malaria agreed upon at the summit.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to allocate resources required for sustained
implementation of planned roll back malaria actions and to reduce
or waive taxes and tariffs for mosquito nets and materials,
insecticides, anti- malarial drugs and other recommended goods and
services needed for malaria control strategies.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they agreed to explore and develop traditional
medicine for malaria control and increase their support for
vaccine research and development.
</P>
<P>
The document mandated the Nigerian government to report the
outcome of the summit on roll back malaria to the next
Organization of African Unity summit for follow-up action in
conjunction with the U.N. agencies and other partners.

<HEADLINE> WB Pledges 500 Million U.S. Dollars for Africa's Malaria Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday pledged
between 300 and 500 million U.S. dollars for fighting against
malaria in Africa, the News Agency of Nigeria reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The resources could be deployed to increase the fight against
malaria, said the bank's Vice President for Human Development
Eduardo Doryan in an address to the first-ever African Summit on
Roll Back Malaria in Nigeria's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"But there has to be an explicit country-driven, country-owned
and country prioritization in order to win that fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank's experience in Africa showed that achieving a
 significant reduction in malaria needed common efforts to
"empower communities to combat malaria, and expand the
implementation capacity of the public sector to enable it to
protect and treat every child and individual at risk."
</P>
<P>
Achieving such success would mean ensuring that primary health
services in every community actually worked, staff paid and
adequate facilities and sufficient drugs supplied, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official called for an integrated approach to
the treatment of all diseases of children and their families to
reduce disease burden and provide huge synergies against malaria,
HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
There was no magic formula for winning the fight against
malaria except through hard work, and improvement on budgets
affecting human development in general, and towards malaria and
communicable diseases in particular, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called on the ministries of health in African countries to
forge partnerships across sectors with active health programs.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall On Fears Of Higher Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Wednesday as a rise in orders for durable goods in March sparked
fears of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 179.32 at 10,945.
50, trimming its gain of 218.72 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 81.14 at 3,630.09 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 16.45 at 1,460.99.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged after the Commerce Department reported that
orders to U.S. factories for durable goods rose in March for the
first time this year. Investors moved money out of the market in
fears that the durable goods report would prompt the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times since last June
in an effort to ward off inflation in the robust U.S. economy.
Analysts expected more rate hike on May 16 when the Federal
Reserve meets on the monetary policy apparently because the
current U.S. economy is still too hot in the Federal Reserve's
view.
</P>
<P>
The latest worries about higher rates hit hard the financial
stocks. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan fell, dragging the Dow index
lower and spreading to the Nasdaq index as well.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE fell 4.46 at 654.31 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 4.78 at 484.24. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 0.39 at 896.43.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,533 down, 1,426 up and 494
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 979.71 million shares from 1.06 billion
in the previous session.
