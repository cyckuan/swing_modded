<HEADLINE> Microsoft's Anti-Piracy Campaign in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-based software giant
Microsoft has stepped up its anti-piracy campaign in Zimbabwe,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said in a statement that the Business Software
Alliance (BSA), an industrial association established to protect
software copyright and prevent software piracy, estimated that
last year alone, software piracy resulted in more than 1.21
billion U.S. Dollars in lost sales worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company has sent a notice to a range of
Zimbabwean businesses on action being taken to curb the practice.
</P>
<P>
The most prevalent form of software piracy in Zimbabwe was the
use of unauthorized copies.
</P>
<P>
"Pirated software can be incomplete or contain virus. It may
create technical problems which cost time and money to fix," said
Microsoft's Anti-Piracy Marketing Manager for Africa Fredrik
Jonker, "Additional drawbacks to the use of illegal software
include the inability to get technical support, manuals or
product upgrades."
</P>
<P>
"Such activity constitutes copyright infringement and carries
civil and criminal penalties," Jonker said, adding that "these
include fines or imprisonment for up to two years or both."
</P>
<P>
In view of economic challenges facing many Zimbabwean
companies at present, Jonker said, his company felt there was a
need to show its commitment to Zimbabwe by offering a 15 percent
discount to all organizations wanting to legalize their software
between March 16 and the end of April.

LIMA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Peruvian air force cargo plane
carrying dozens of civilian passengers crashed Sunday in northern
Peru, killing at least 12 people, officials said.

The plane was carrying refugees stranded by El Nino-driven
flooding from the city of Tumbes to Piura in northern Peru, an AP

<P>
The aircraft split in two pieces as it went down into a canal
about two kilometers from the Piura airport.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- As Israeli and Palestinian
leaders were holding talks with an American envoy to break the
peace impasse, their health professionals gathered Sunday in Gaza
city to seek ways of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israel sent a large delegation, mainly staff from the medical
school of Ben-Gurion University, to the meeting while the
Palestinian team was headed by Suha Arafat, wife of President
Yasser Arafat, who is responsible for humanitarian aid in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed proposals for
launching several joint projects in the field of health.
</P>
<P>
Avishai Brobman, president of Ben-Gurion University, told
Israel Radio that Israel and the PNA are considering establishing
a medical training center in the border region between Gaza and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
As part of a World Health Organization (WHO) program, he
added, the two sides are also going to cooperate in medical
research for health development in border areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the medical school of his university will help
the PNA train medical professionals in various fields.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the meaning of this cooperation, Brobman said
that "without support and cooperation in economic and health,
there is no future for coexistence (of Israeli and Palestinian
people)."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Politicians Trade Barbs Over U.S. Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leftist and rightist
politicians Sunday traded accusations over U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's sharp warning over the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Albright told U.S. Jewish leaders in a Friday phone call that
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is nearing its end and the
U.S. might remove itself from the process if the stalemate
continues.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed doubt about Israeli leaders for their
hostility towards the new U.S. initiative on Israel's further
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The leading opposition Labor Party strongly denounced the
Likud-led ruling coalition for destroying both the peace process
and the strategic relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Labor lawmaker Nissim Zvili called for convening a special
session of the Knesset (Parliament), which is at its spring
recess, to debate the worsening situation of the peace process and
the full-blown crisis with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Another Labor lawmaker Dalia Itzik charged the Likud government
of eroding the crucial relations with the U.S., saying Israel is
losing its "last friend."
</P>
<P>
But the rightist defended Israel's firm stand over the peace
process, especially on the issue of security. Likud's leading
hardliner Zeev Begin said he and some other rightist lawmakers
would topple the government if it bows to U.S. pressure to hand
over more land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Likud's National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon told a
weekly Cabinet session Sunday that he would not agree to accept a
redeployment of more than 9 percent in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The coalition party National Religious Party criticized the
government for considering to a more than 9 percent withdrawal,
saying this would lay the groundwork for an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Likud's faction leader in the Knesset Meir Shetrit denounced
the Labor for automatically siding with the Palestinians. He also
criticized the rightist hardliners for issuing threats over the
government's handling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is still committed to finding a final
settlement with the Palestinian side if it keeps its commitments
to fight terror to ensure Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his position in
Sunday's Cabinet session that there must be clear connection
between Israel's carrying out of further pullouts in the West Bank
and the Palestinian fight against terror.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the Cabinet that he and visiting U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross had not yet discussed the exact percentage of
redeployment during two rounds of talks in the past two days. The
two focused on the so-called "reciprocity," the principle Israel
demands for continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Ross were to meet for the third time late Sunday
to get down to the very issue of fixing the percentage of further
redeployment. The U.S. is proposing a 13.1 percent Israeli
pullout, but Israel has said it would not accept anything more
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the Cabinet meeting, Israel's Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani traveled to Gaza to meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said they mainly discussed the security issue rather
than the further redeployment. He disclosed that Arafat was
worried about the prolonged deadlock in the peace process,
although the Palestinian leader has not given up his hope.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Arafat dispatched Planning and International
Cooperation Minister Nabil Sha'ath to Egypt and chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat to Jordan to brief the two countries' leaders on the
outcome of his two meetings with Ross and the Palestinian stand
over Israeli redeployments.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Adams Urges End to Attacks in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish
Republican Army's (IRA) political wing Sinn Fein, Sunday called
for an immediate end to attacks in Northern Ireland amid the
latest eruption of violence.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA),
a splinter group of the IRA, shot dead a former police officer
Cyril Stewart in Northern Ireland last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the violence of the INLA guerillas, Adams was
reported as saying in Belfast: "I have said some long time ago
that that organization (INLA) should disband. It has on a number
of occasions brought the entire struggle here into disrepute."
</P>
<P>
He also called on all conflicting sides in Northern Ireland to
exercise restraint and concentrate on the all-party peace talks on
the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"It should not deflect anyone from the challenge of bringing
about proper, meaningful, substantive, transitional change in this
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart Bertie Ahern had reportedly exchanged views by
telephone on the serious situation in Northern Ireland over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The London and Dublin governments have promised to stage
referendums in British ruled-Northern Ireland in a bid to resolve
the long-standing dispute.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Warring Sides Urged to Honor Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the U.N. Sanction
Commission Njuguma Mahugu said here Sunday U.N. Security council
will not allow the two warring sides to reset timetable for the
implementation of the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Mahugu, who has just finished his week-long visit to Angola,
said the Security Council hopes that both sides keep their
promises made on March 6 to complete the peace process by March
31.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official has come here to show how the Security
Council is worried over the delay of the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
He called on the two sides to follow the new timetable the
Joint Commission for peace process set on March 6 of completing
the implementation of the process by March 31 without any delay
because he said the Security Council will not accept another
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Mahugu said that he met with Angolan President Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos and other government leaders and also held talks with
the leader of the opposition National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has devoted itself fully to the peace
process and is willing to seek political solution to the problems
facing the nation, Mahugu said, adding that UNITA also expressed
its willingness to commit itself to the process until peace is
ultimately achieved.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said that there appeared fine signs for the
peace process, adding that he was satisfied with the attitudes of
the warring sides toward implementing the jointly-designated
process.
</P>
<P>
Mahugu also disclosed that he will visit Democratic Congo,
Zambia, Namibia, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire, convey letters from the
Security Council to leaders of these states.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council believes that at the critical
moment, it's necessary to mobilize all sides to make sure that
the Lusaka Peace Accord be implemented and hopes that the leaders
of the region will make diplomatic efforts to urge the two
warring sides in Angola to honor their promises and successfully
complete the peace process, said Mahugu.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in East S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Fighting is continuing in eastern
Sierra Leone as the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG)
encounters pockets of resistance from remnants of the ousted
military junta.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG's pro-government ally of hunters militiamen
known as the Kamajors is gaining grounds in Kalohon and
neighboring districts in the eastern border area with Liberia,
the British Broadcasting Corporation reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors have reportedly taken over such key towns as
Bunumbu, Miama and Mobi in the area, with thousands of the junta
forces and its rebel ally Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
holding others.
</P>
<P>
In an important step to mop up the junta forces and RUF
rebels, ECOMOG last weekend recaptured Dairo barracks and the
town itself which served for more than six weeks as the base of
the junta forces and RUF rebels in the east of the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
The recapture of Dairo barracks, according to a Kamajor
commander, resulted in the surrender of hundreds of the junta
soldiers and removed the major resistance ECOMOG and the Kamajors
may have met with.
</P>
<P>
But many junta soldiers had fled after being defeated, the
commander said, expressing fear that the fleeing of junta
soldiers would lead to the killing of civilians in places where
they reach.
</P>
<P>
However, an ECOMOG field commander said confidently that the
remnants of junta forces and RUF rebels could be cleaned up in
the next several weeks.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Chief Calls for Oil Output Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- President of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir
Sunday urged non-OPEC oil producers to help shore up oil prices by
cutting oil output.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, who is also Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources
of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told the official Wam News
Agency before leaving for Monday's emergency ministerial OPEC
meeting in Vienna that non-OPEC oil producers should cooperate
with the bloc to rescue declined oil markets.
</P>
<P>
In this field, he said, these countries should follow the
sample of non-OPEC Mexico, which orchestrated with Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela a deal in Riyadh last Monday to trim oil production by
up to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) from the beginning of April
to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The deal was expected to be discussed during the Vienna meeting
to be attended by OPEC oil ministers and officials from some of
non-OPEC countries, the OPEC chief said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen oil producing countries have so far agreed to cut
output by 1.1 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
If the Riyadh accord can be implemented, it will be the first
time that world oil producers have managed to agree to lower
output with the aim of propping up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices had gained legs up by nearly 14 percent to
over 15 U.S. dollars a barrel earlier this week. But the prices
fell back when traders paused for breath to wait for the
implementation of the pact.
</P>
<P>
Prices began to collapse after OPEC decided in November to
raise its combined output ceiling by 10 percent to reach 27.5
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The price crisis was compounded by Iraq's return to oil
markets and a decline in crude demand due to a mild winter in the
northern hemisphere and Asia's economic turmoil.

relevant regulations for its operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ITC was encouraging other Arab countries in the
region to set up national chapters and then join the regional
council so as to benefit from its global network established long
ago for business cooperation, said Asfur.
</P>
<P>
The ITC, a Paris-based world trade organization, has regional
councils all over the world. All the councils can benefit from
publications and research studies issued by the Paris headquarters
on topics such as global agriculture, sea transport, insurance,
arbitration and international trade.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Norway Ties Might Worsen over Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran warned on Sunday it's ties
with Norway might further worsen if Oslo continues support for
Salman Rushdie, a British writer condemned to death by Iran for
his "blasphemous" novel.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of the offensive policies by Norway might
force Iran to further limit its ties with the country," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said, quoted by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 by Iran's late Spiritual
Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei for his novel "the Satanic
Verses," which was regarded as an insult to the Islamic Prophet
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a recent meeting between Norwegian Prime Minister
Kjell Magne Bondevik and Rushdie, Mohammadi said "the meeting
constituted a support for Rushdie's desecration of Islamic
sanctities."
</P>
<P>
He said Norway's move defied the new international consensus
which views understanding among nations and dialogue among
cultures and civilizations necessary for peaceful coexistence in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Norway recalled their ambassadors in December 1994
over Norway's support for Rushdie and their ties have since been
kept at the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the restrictions Iran imposed on its commercial
and political relations with Norway would continue "unabatedly."

<HEADLINE> Egypt: U.S. Peace Proposals Should Be Balanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here Sunday that the latest U.S. peace proposals
should balance the Palestinian and Israeli interests in order to
implement their signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt sees the importance of striking a balance in commitments
of both sides in order to help the signed agreements work," Moussa
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross will hold
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Red Sea resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh Monday to expound the American proposals on
revitalizing the peace process as well as the Palestinian and
Israeli reactions towards them.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, carried by Ross on his current shuttle meetings
with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, suggests that the
Israeli troops pull back from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in 12
weeks in accordance with Palestinians' crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Any proposed ideas should supposedly go in line with the
agreed-upon principles in Madrid Peace Conference in 1991," he
said, adding that the second phase of Israeli redeployment, as
proposed in the U.S. initiative, should be followed by a third one.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that he and Egyptian Presidential Political Advisor
Osama el-Baz will meet Sunday night with a Palestinian delegation
headed by Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Shaath to listen to their assessment of the latest contacts.
</P>
<P>
After Ross' rounds of talks with the Palestinians and the
Israelis, the Palestinians announced Sunday that they tended to
accept the U.S. proposals while Israeli leaders insisted that the
13.1 percent proposed by the Americans is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
After the U.S. envoy leaves the region, Arafat is expected to
visit Cairo to have consultations with the Egyptian leadership
before drawing up a final Palestinian stance regarding the
U.S. initiative, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the past three days, Ross paid visits to Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas in a bid to revive Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, which have been stalled for months over the extent of
next Israeli troops pullback from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Ross Discuss Israeli Pullout Scope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu held a third meeting with visiting U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross to discuss the scope of Israeli further redeployment
in the West Bank Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The two held talks at the Prime Minister's Office for over two
hours, but no details were disclosed about the content of their
discussion. Neither of them spoke to reporters before and after
the meeting, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Ross traveled to Gaza after the meeting to hold a third round
of talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat to brief him on the latest Israeli position.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began focusing their talks on solving a dispute
over the scope of Israel's second of the three-phased troops
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday morning's weekly Cabinet session, Netanyahu
said his past two meetings with Ross only dealt with the
conditions Israel had set for continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel is insisting on the so-called principle of
"reciprocity," which means the PNA should honor its commitments
to fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
No quick breakthrough was expected from Ross' current mission
on settling the issue of further redeployment. The U.S. is
proposing for a 13.1 percent Israeli pullout from the West Bank,
but Israel has said it would not accept anything more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the Cabinet meeting, influential National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon warned the government against accepting a
pullout of more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, who met with Arafat
in Gaza Sunday, said he supported only a pullout of no more than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Arafat dispatched Planning and International
Cooperation Minister Nabil Sha'ath to Cairo and chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat to Jordan to brief the two countries' leaders on the
outcome of his two meetings with Ross and the Palestinian stand
over Israeli redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to travel to Egypt Monday to discuss with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak the Israeli further redeployment and to
win the latter's support to lower the PNA's expectation.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has previously insisted that Israel should carry out
at least 30 percent pullout in the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Another round of talks between Ross and Israeli and Palestinian
leaders are expected following his return from Cairo.

<P>
In regard to the U.S. legislation, Masire's viewpoint was in
sharp contrast to that of South African leaders, who believed
that the bill was unacceptable.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos discussed Sunday with his visiting Albanian
counterpart, Sabit Brokaj, the establishment of a multinational
peacekeeping force in the Balkan region, the situation in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo and the recent upsurge in crime in
Greece.
</P>
<P>
During their talks which took place in the northwestern Greek
town of Ioannina, the two ministers agreed that the Balkan Defense
Undersecretaries meet again in the Albanian capital of Tirana on
May 21, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Greece is currently promoting the idea of a multinational
Balkan force, first put forward last October, with the aim of
preventing regional crisis from escalating into armed conflict and
carrying out humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
The Greek proposal was discussed in Sofia, Bulgaria, last
October at a meeting of Balkan Defense Undersecretaries.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said after their talks that Greece opposed armed
violence in Kosovo while it endorsed respect of human rights. The
settlement of the Kosovo problem could be achieved only through
dialogue between the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that his country had never been, nor would
ever become, a racist country.
</P>
<P>
Brokaj said that some isolated incidents did not affect the
good relations between Albania and Greece.
</P>
<P>
They were referring to the recent wave of violent crimes
committed throughout Greece which has blamed some foreigners,
especially illegal Albanian immigrants for the crimes.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Inches up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose dramatically on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC's basket of seven crudes climbed to 13.20
U.S. dollars a barrel from 11.22 dollars a week ago, the
secretariat of the leading international oil group said.
</P>
<P>
The rise resulted from the decision by Saudi Arabia, OPEC's
leading member, and other OPEC members together with some non-OPEC
oil producers, to reduce daily oil production beginning on April 1.
</P>
<P>
An OPEC meeting, which is due to be held late Monday here, is
believed to contribute to the increase. The meeting will focus
on production cuts aimed at boosting oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC's basket of seven crudes fell to 10.91
dollars a barrel on March 16 and oil markets were adrift at
nine-year lows on the next day as producers failed to curb
swelling supply.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is locked in a
dispute with Venezuela, OPEC's biggest over-producer, over
responsibility for the price fall.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC groups Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab
Emirates. It is estimated that the OPEC members possess 75 percent
of the world's known reserves of crude oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's International Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi, who is making an official visit to China,
spoke today about the prospects of agreements protecting Canadian
and Chinese investment.
</P>
<P>
Marchi said that agreements on safeguarding investment would
provide the right framework for the two countries' enterprises and
give them the confidence they are seeking.
</P>
<P>
Canada has invested more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
China, and Chinese businesses have begun to invest in Canada. And,
although China has similar agreements with more than 70 countries,
it and Canada have yet to reach an agreement to protect their
investment.
</P>
<P>
Marchi attributes this to the fact that both nations have
signed agreements with other countries and have different
standards. However, he said he believes that because the
agreements reflect the common interests and trust of businesses,
an agreement can be reached within months.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese officials will further discuss the issue
when they visit Ottawa.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated Monday that he would not run for the presidential
elections in the year 2000, but he did not name sacked Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a tradition of successors," an Itar-Tass report
quoted Yeltsin as saying. "It is the kings who are successors."
</P>
<P>
"In our country people elect leaders, and every citizen has the
right to run for presidency under the constitution," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Chernomyrdin's Saturday declaration on
presidential bid in 2000 "is in keeping with the president's
thoughts."
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision on the cabinet's dismissal, having in mind
at the same time that he would lead the presidential campaign of
the year 2000," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday last week, Yeltsin suddenly fired Chernomyrdin and
his entire government, saying that they had "failed to cope with a
number of social problems."
</P>
<P>
In a TV address following his surprise order of dismissal,
Yeltsin stressed that the year 2000 elections are of enormous
importance to Russia, so he had instructed Chernomyrdin to
concentrate on political preparations for these elections.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who has served for more than five years in the
post of prime minister, announced over the weekend that he would
definitely be a candidate.

HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Everything is ready for the
Election Committee (EC) subsector elections to be held here on
April 2 after about 140,000 poll cards have been sent to voters.
</P>
<P>
Leaflets carrying personal particulars of candidates have also
been mailed to voters of 35 subsectors representing various
trades, professions, labor and social service sectors, the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and district-based
organizations, according to the Registration and Electoral
Office.
</P>
<P>
Noting that voting is simple, a spokesman for the Registration
and Electoral Office said: "all a voter needs to do is to bring
along his identity card and visit his designated polling station."
</P>
<P>
Ninety polling stations throughout Hong Kong will be open from
7.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Large posters bearing photographs of candidates and an album
containing personal particulars of candidates will be made
available at polling stations for voters' easy reference, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Given that the polling day will fall on a working day, the
spokesman urged employers to give permission to their employees to
cast their votes during office hours.
</P>
<P>
As 95 members on the Election Committee have already been
returned from four uncontested subsectors, 963 candidates from 31
subsectors will run for 588 seats.
</P>
<P>
These 683 members will join 77 ex-officio members and 40
members nominated by the Religious Subsector to form an 800-member
Election Committee which will be responsible for electing 10
Legislative Council members on May 24.

<HEADLINE> HK Conducts Consultancy Study on Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced here Monday that it has commissioned a consultancy study
on the sustainable development for Hong Kong in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Announcing details of the Study on Sustainable Development for
the 21st Century (SUSDEV21) at a press conference, Peter Pun,
director of planning of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, said that the aim of the study is to develop a framework
to help government make decisions for Hong Kong's future in a
balanced and sustainable way.
</P>
<P>
The SUSDEV 21 study began in September 1997 and will be
completed by the end of the next year.
</P>
<P>
Upon the completion of the study, a decision-making framework
will be worked out for sustainable development in Hong Kong which
aims to balance the economic, social and environmental needs of
the community, Pun said.
</P>
<P>
In another word, the SUSDEV21 will help government ensure that
all relevant environmental, social and economic aspects of
development proposals are well coordinated and balanced.
</P>
<P>
Pun said that the task for the government at present is to let
people know what the SUSDEV21 is.
</P>
<P>
The SUSDEV21 does not tackle any specific issues such as the
environment, the economic development and housing. In stead, it
takes all factors into consideration and will work out a system to
help the government make its policies concerning Hong Kong's
long-term development in the future, Pun said.
</P>
<P>
"If Hong Kong is to continue to thrive in the next century, we
need to maintain our environmental quality at an acceptable level
and safeguard the integrity of our natural resource base and
cultural heritage while at the same time continuing to meet
development pressure arising from growing social and economic
needs," Pun said.
</P>
<P>
"Our study will develop guiding values, sustainability
indicators and criteria covering the economic, social and
environmental aspects to provide a basis for measuring our
performance on sustainability," he added.
</P>
<P>
While the study was mainly confined to Hong Kong, the
consultants had to examine developments in the wider Pearl River
Delta Region in Southern China, particularly in respect of
socio-economic and infrastructure developments and cross-boundary
environmental issues, Pun said.
</P>
<P>
A fundamental principle of sustainable development is that
activities arising from decisions taken today should not
compromise the quality of life or economic well-being of the
future.
</P>
<P>
The government's intention to embrace sustainable development
is driven by a commitment to enable Hong Kong to continue to
prosper and allow the economic, social and environmental
aspirations of the people of Hong Kong to be fulfilled. It cannot
succeed without the support and participation of the community.
</P>
<P>
Views of the community will be collected at various stages to
help ensure that appropriate values and indicators are built into
the new decision-making system to form the basis for adjustments,
if necessary, in inter-related policies, plans and programs, Pun
said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this, we will launch an extensive public awareness
and consultation program on April 2 to enhance the community's
understanding of the issue," Pun said. The program will last for
months.

<HEADLINE> BMW Wins Contest for Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The British engineering group
Vickers PLC has agreed to sell the luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce to
BMW AG of Germany for 340 million pounds (572 million U.S.
dollars), BMW confirmed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the decision made by Vickers, a BMW spokesman said in
Munich: "We are honored and also obligated to meet the
expectations of our British partner."
</P>
<P>
While confirming the 340 million pound price tag, the spokesman
said the company would detail its plan about Rolls-Royce at a
press conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vickers, which says it wants to concentrate on its defense
business, put Rolls-Royce up for sale last October, provoking a
fierce contest between BMW and Germany's largest carmaker
Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
Vickers chairman Colin Chandler announced Monday that after
carefully considering a number of proposals, the company found
that BMW's offer was the most attractive one in terms of achieving
best value for shareholders and ensuring the continued success of
Rolls-Royce, the last British-owned car company.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ass't Minister Says Cross-Straits Ties Need Guarding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- An Min, China's Assistant
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, speaking today
at the opening of a two-day symposium on international trade laws,
said that the current sound cross-Straits economic and trade
relations that have taken shape over the past two decades need to
be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is being sponsored by law schools at the
mainland's University of International Business and Economics
and at Taiwan's Soochow University.
</P>
<P>
An quoted statistics from the central government on the
cross-straits trade, showing that by the end of 1997, it was worth
116.4 billion US dollars, with the mainland suffering a deficit of
80 billion US dollars. The mainland also had 18.4 billion US
dollars worth of investment from Taiwan, and in 1997 alone,
cross-Straits trade stood at 19.84 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is the mainland's fifth largest trade partner and the
mainland and Hong Kong have become Taiwan's second largest market,
third largest trade partner, and the third investment spot.
</P>
<P>
The two benefit each other in the economy and the mainland will
further open up by depending even more on Taiwanese funds,
technology, and markets, while Taiwan needs new markets to improve
the viability of its products and boost its technology, An said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that commercial and industrial sectors
will help to remove barriers and develop cross-Strait's trade for
the economic prosperity of both sides.

<HEADLINE> Officials Becoming Modern Farmers Because of Institutional Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- It's no more shuffling papers
and no more boring meetings for Yang Zhigang, who used to work in
a county magistrate's office in east China's Jiangxi Province,
just life in the countryside and the joy of farming.
</P>
<P>
This new life Yang chose for himself began several months ago
when he resigned his position as deputy magistrate of Wuning
County and started working 33 hectares of barren hillside and 5.3
hectares of water under contract.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old Yang explains his decision by saying,
"Government institutions are overstaffed, and I just don't want to
stay idle every day," so he's at the head of a group of farmers,
planting fruit trees and herbal medicines and starting to breed
pigs, chicken, ducks and fish. He is also planning to set up
places to process his farm products.
</P>
<P>
Yang's move represents a new trend among some government
employees. The new Chinese cabinet that was formed earlier this
month has announced a bold reform plan that requires both the
central and local governments to cut the number of employees in
half by combining redundant departments.
</P>
<P>
Each year China spends nearly half its revenues on the salaries
of more than 30 million officials whose work is often redundant,
bureaucratic, and terribly inefficient, and some employees are
increasingly aware of the inevitability of major institutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, some redundant employees will be
transferred to industrial and commercial administration, or tax
and supervisory departments, while others will just have to find
new jobs in various other sectors.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 4 Injured in Floods in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Floods triggered by torrential
rain over the past few days killed one people and injured four
others in Iran's western province of Lorestan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Residential units of over 70 villages in the province suffered
damages of varied degrees caused by floods, which cut off roads to
560 villages and destroyed orchards and farmlands, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
In the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, floods inundated
12 villages, damaging or totally destroying 30 residential units,
ruining farmlands and gardens and knocking off power and water
supply in the surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the central province of Isfahan, more than 200
residential units and local bridges were totally destroyed and
more than 500 heads of livestock perished as a result of the
floods, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Floods also submerged over 200 hectares of farmlands in the
southwestern province of Khuzestan and cut off gas supply to some
cities and towns, the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Women's world welterweight
champion Jane Couch won a legal battle as an industrial tribunal
ruled on Monday that the British Boxing Board of Control was wrong
to refuse to grant a woman boxer a licence.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal rejected the boards' argument that pre-menstrual
tension made women unstable and ruled in favor of Couch.
</P>
<P>
Couch was supported by Britain's Equal Opportunities Commission
which said she was being denied the opportunity to box
professionally because of her sex.
</P>
<P>
The commission said victory in the courts would open the door
of professional boxing to all suitably qualified women.

<HEADLINE> Officials Become Modern Farmers Because of Institutional Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Wuning, approximately 200 kilometers from Nanchang,
Jiangxi's capital, nearly a fifth of the county government
officials have resigned their posts and got involved in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
One former official with the Organization Department of the
Wuning County Communist Party Committee, Ye Zhijun, said they
should play a leading role in commercialization and specialization
in agriculture. The 37-year-old Ye has a contract on 460 hectares
of barren hillsides and 660 hectares of water, and in addition to
planting fruit trees and breeding fish he is contemplating the
possibility of using his farm for tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wuning county magistrate, Wei Hongbin, these
farmer-officials had cultivated thousands of hectares of hillside
and thousands of hectares of unused water space by the end of
1997, and the figures keep growing.
</P>
<P>
The officials are using their own potential and have created
new job opportunities in the countryside with their farms, Wei
said, explaining that they have taught farmers how to improve farm
technology.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangxi provincial government has praised the practice in
Wuning. And it's no wonder, since the director of the provincial
government's Finance Department, Yong Zhongcheng, said that there
are more than a million government-supported officials in Jiangxi
who account for a fortieth of the population, but 60 percent of
the province's annual revenues is spent on their salaries.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the number of officials could not only save the
government money that could be used for developing the economy,
but it could also improve officials' work and the government's
efficiency, Yong said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Launch Development Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG March 30 (Xinhua) -- Finance officials from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have recommended
the establishment of a fund to support development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was discussed by senior finance officials at a
meeting of the SADC's finance and investment sector coordinating
unit, led by South Africa's Finance Department, Business Day
paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fund would primarily be financed by the governments of the
14-nation bloc although the private sector might be allowed to
make contributions, said Bongi Kunene, director in charge of the
SADC's finance and investment sector.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed the role the World Bank might play
amid changing patterns in developmenp finance. The bank has
signalled a willingness to contribute to such a fund to reduce
political risk.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an SADC development fund, which might be managed
by South Africa's Development Bank of Southern Africa, marks a
radical shift from an earlier notion of an SADC development bank.
</P>
<P>
One of the suggested functions of the fund is to provide
cushioning against revenue loss resulting drom tariff elimination
under the planned SADC's free trade area.
</P>
<P>
The other possibility was for the fund to function along the
lines of the European Union's cohesive program.
</P>
<P>
It was also recommended that SADC countries should work
towards macroeconomic convergence.
</P>
<P>
Kunene said her unit would now draft principles for an SADC
finance and investment protocol, which would be presented to
finance ministers in June for consideration.

speaking today at the opening ceremony of a course on theory and
practice of the United Front and multi-party cooperation, urged
greater understanding of the political significance of perfecting

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians marking the 22nd
anniversary of the Land Day clashed with Israeli troops in the
West Bank cities of Bethlehem and Ramallah on Monday. At least 10
people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center, an East
Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service, reported that a large
number of Palestinians clashed with Israeli troops near the
Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse the Palestinians, wounding seven people, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinian youths were reportedly injured by rubber
bullets in clashes with Israeli troops at the Maloufuyeh
check-point near Ramallah Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, 1976, six Israeli Arabs lost their lives in
clashes with Israel soldiers over a land dispute erupted following
Israeli government's decision to confiscate land owned by Arab
villagers in the Galilee area in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Arabs and Palestinians mark the incident each year
to protest against the land policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Council has called on all
Palestinians inside Palestine and elsewhere to commemorate the
anniversary on Monday with popular and mass demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police and defense forces are on high alert Monday on
both sides of the 1967 ceasefire line, also known as the Green
Line, as Israeli Arabs plan a series of strikes, marches and
demonstrations to mark the Land Day.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Rises 10.7 percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 1996 was estimated at 1,192.4 billion HK dollars
(152.87 billion U.S. dollars) at current market prices,
representing an increase of 10.7 percent over the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary figures released by the Census and Statistics
Department here Monday show that taking the size of the population
into consideration, per capita GDP at current market prices
increased by eight percent to 188,933 HK dollars (24,222 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
After discounting price changes, the real Gross National Income
(GNI) recorded an increase of 4.6 percent in 1996, not much below
the five percent growth in GDP at constant prices, when further
adjusted for change in the terms of trade.
</P>
<P>
Total external factor income inflow into Hong Kong was 383.8
billion HK dollars (49.21 billion U.S. dollars), within which
direct investment income (DII) and portfolio investment income
(PII) rose by 12.3 percent and 8.6 percent respectively in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Total factor income outflow grew by 5.4 percent to 393 billion
HK dollars (50.38 billion U.S. dollars), within which DII and PII
gained by 13.3 percent and 19.5 percent respectively in the year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figures, a Government Secretariat
Spokesman said that Hong Kong is a highly externally oriented
economy with substantial international transaction flows.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting this, he said both the external factor income inflow
and external factor income outflow continued to be sizable in
1996. The overall factor income account was broadly balanced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that both DII inflow and outflow recorded
robust growth in 1996, reflecting good return from both outward
direct investment and inward direct investment to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
PII outflow showed a much faster increase than PII inflow in
1996. This was due to the faster expansion and relatively better
performance of the local stock market as compared to many of the
major stock market overseas, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Globalization Reduces Macro-economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Monday said that the globalization of the world economy had
reduced the autonomy of the developing countries in determining
their macro-economic policies.
</P>
<P>
He was opening a Conference on Defending Workers' Human Rights
in the Global Economy sponsored by the African Regional
Organization (AFRO) oF the Intepnational Confederation of Free
Trade Unions (ICFTU).
</P>
<P>
Equally, the president noted, the flexibility of trade unions
to determine and ensure strict application of employment policies
has also been eroded.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the economic globalization had a
positive impact on economic growth of many countries, Moi pointed
out that employment security of workers had been reduced over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of full time workers with prospects for career
development is falling in relation to that of casual workers, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Moi called for fair compensation for workers as
the short term effects of economic reforms had not been asy on
the welfare of orkers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, ICFTU-ADRO General Secretary
Andrew Kailembo noted that "unless the global market is
re-oriented, economic development will continue to benefit just a
few powerful multi-nationals."
</P>
<P>
The multi-national corporations will increase their trade and
investments in developing countries, but the ordinary people and
the countries in which they operate "will gain close to nothing
in return", he added.
</P>
<P>
J.J. Mugalla, Secretary General of Kenyan Central Organization
of TradeUnions, Monday told the three-day meeting that
"Globalization is producing wealth and riches for the minority
and poverty and insecurity for the majority", adding that "the
gap between the poor and the rich s widening."
</P>
<P>
The meting is aimed at discussing the issue of the "Social
Clause" which has something to do with the use of slave labour,
forced labour and child labour in the production of goods and
services for international trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, the number of child workers between
5 and 14 years of age in Africa is around 80 million and the
figure will rise with at least onE million new child workers
annually in the next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discus, among other things, the African
development challenges with special reference to Structural
Adjustment Programs, and equal opportunity for women and men.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- American arms manufacturers, who stand to gain billions of
dollars in sales of weapons, communication systems and other
military equipment if the Senate approves NATO expansion, have
made enormous investments in lobbyists and campaign contributions
to promote their cause in Washington.
</P>
<P>
-- As a White House envoy announced that he would return from
the Middle East to brief President Clinton on the reaction to new
peace proposals, American Jewish leaders said they had been
assured by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright that the
United States would not present Israel with an ultimatum for a
West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Cambodia's ousted co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh
returned to Phnom Penh Sunday, almost nine months after he was
toppled from power while out of the country and went into exile.
Analysts said his return was another step toward the goal of a
free and fair poll on July 26, but they added that more problems
and political tensions were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
-- Interim premier Sergei Kiriyenko said he wants to bring new
faces into Russia's government and will not bargain over cabinet
lists to win parliamentary approval for his nomination as prime
minister. President Boris Yeltsin dismissed prime minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and his government last Monday, and named Kiriyenko,
35, interim premier, then nominated him Friday for the permanent
job.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- A Senate panel unveiled only parts of a much-anticipated
tobacco bill, avoiding the question of legal relief for the
industry. Committee negotiators had reached a tentative agreement
on the legal protections, but, facing almost certain opposition,
chose against disclosing it.
</P>
<P>
-- Oil producers will meet in Vienna to clarify ambiguities in
the agreement OPEC is expected to ratify early this week. The way
the details are resolved could affect the size of the production
cuts. The agreement, hashed out more than a week ago by Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, will produce at least 1.5 billion
barrels a day of cuts from current worldwide production
levels.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Second in TB Infection Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, whth its tuberculosis
infection rate of 300 in every 100,000 people, is the second
after the Democratic Republic of Congo with 330 people in every
100,000, The New Vision reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The other top countries in the list of tb infection rate are
the Philippines with 280 in every 100,000, Afganistan with 278,
South Africa and Peru with 250, Nigeria with 222, India and
Indonesia with 220, the paper cited the World Health Organisation
report on TB infection as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Sam Okware, the commissioner communicable disease control
of the country, said his country has started applying Directly
Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) two years ago, and it will
cover the whole country, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The problem the country faces with is the financial
difficulties. Uganda has only 7 U.S. dollars of health
expenditure for each person in its budget.
</P>
<P>
"We might need some assistance to carry out the program
effictively," said Okware.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has its napional tuberculosis and leprosy program, but
it doesn't work properly due to financial problem.
</P>
<P>
The other problem bothering the country is the expired drugs
provided by foreign donors to save loss of property.
</P>
<P>
Francis Adatu-Engwau, the program manager of the national
tuberculosis and leprosy program, called local leaders to
cooperate with health workers in fighting the deadly disease. He
appealed to use TB drugs properly to avoid drug-resistant TB.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Erupts in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting is being
reported in and around Somalia's southern port town of Kismaio
between forces from the Marehan subclan and those of Majerten
subclan dominating the town.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said nearly 200 heavily armed men from the
Marehan subclan stormed into the town just before dawn Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Loud noise from rocket propelled grenades, attack F-1 hand
grenades, heavy machine guns and assault rifles has terrorized
and awakened in bewilderment the town residents.
</P>
<P>
According to a radio operator in the town of Kismaio, 500 km
south of the capital, the fighting continued until 11:00 am
(local time) Monday morning as the Majerten, Ogaden and
Dhulbahante militiamen on one side fought bitterly against the
invaders.
</P>
<P>
The fighting spread to the village of Gobwein, about 9 km
north of the town, at 9:00 am as the invading militiamen of
Marehan started to retreat backwards.
</P>
<P>
There is no exact number of casualties so far, but the radio
operators are speaking about the death of more than 30 people,
mainly civilians, while nearly 75 others are hospitalized in
Kismaio for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
"Two of my brothers and my cousin have all died in the
fighting last night," said one of the radio operators in the
town.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the town said the dead and the wounded collected
from the streets of Kismaio are from both sides, but it is
believed that the retreating militiamen have also taken some of
their wounded men with them.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the clashes seemed to have subsided
with each side worrying about their losses.
</P>
<P>
This unprecedented fighting could be characterized as one of
the worst and most catastrophic armed clashes between the two
groups ever since the Marehan militiamen were driven out of the
town last year.
</P>
<P>
The town of Kismaio has been a focal poin for armed
insurgencies between the two sides ever since misunderstanding
arose over the control of the key positions of the town, the air
and seaports.

weeks, linked to Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians and Israel are cool to the plan. Israel
has said the withdrawal scope is unacceptable and that it would
pull out from no more than 9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that Israel carry out three significant
pullbacks by summer this year under U.S.-brokered agreements
signed last year between the two sides.

<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Wu Yi, in a
meeting this afternoon with Jacques Dondoux, France's Secretary of
State to the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry in charge
of external trade, said that China's opening policy will never
waver and that China will open further to the outside.
</P>
<P>
The practice over the past two decades has shown that China has
no choice but to take the road of reform and opening-up, she said,
but added that this needs to accord with China's own development.
</P>
<P>
She said that China has noticed the new China policy of the
European Commission and will develop a good relationship with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Wu also discussed China's state-owned enterprise reforms and
Sino-foreign nuclear energy cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dondoux, who is here as guest of the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that France is
satisfied with China's position on the financial crisis in Asia,
and that France hopes to further the bilateral partnership and it
supports China's entry into the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Official on Globalization, Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth and higher
consumption levels expected from the globalization process do not
automatically lead to improving people's lives. They are only
the means to achieve equitable and healthy human development,
resident representative of the UNDP Carlos Lopes said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a six-day workshop organized by the
Southern and Eastern African Trade, Information and Negotiations
Initiative (SEATINI) in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said, since 1980s, the world has experienced rapid
transformations of what is now called a complex global market.
The invisible hands operate globally. The deregulation of
domestic markets and new levels of international competition have
become known universal features.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the benefits of this new economic trends are
not being distributed evenly across and within borders. Growing
income divergence and increasing inequality in the world's
population has been the rather persistent feature."
</P>
<P>
The rich have become richer while the poor become poorer as
polarization increases at levels never experienced before in
economic history. The richest 20 percent of the world population
gained its income share substantially in the last three decades,
now dominating 83 percent of the world GNP. During the same
period, the ratio of average GNP per capita between the poorest
and richest has doubled, he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa, on the other hand, has failed to reap rewards from the
globalization and liberalization process. The region accounts
for only two percent of the total value of exports, compared to
17 percent in Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan), 48 percent in
Europe, and 15 percent in north America.
</P>
<P>
"The picture is also grim on the human development side in the
region. 40 percent of people in Sub-Saharan Africa are estimated
to be deprived of essential elements of human life such as
longevity, knowledge and decent living standards," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no country in the world, regardless of its
size, economic or political regime, can avoid facing the
realities of globalization. What each country can do is to
better manage the globalization proess domestically and
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries must collectively resolve the
international trade regimes that affect their development
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to gain from the globalization and liberalization
process, developing countries must be capacitated with adequate
knowledge and tools. It is only then the states can implement
sound domestic policies and be strategic in their representation
during the international trade negotiation fora, he said.

<HEADLINE> Workshop Opens in Zimbabwe on Regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A six-day economic workshop of
the Southern and Eastern African Trade, Information and
Negotiations Initiative (SEATINI) started Monday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, attended by more than 100 scholars,
administrators, international negotiators, donors and
practitioners from many parts of the world, will analyse the new
trading regime under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
consider a common framework of action at the WTO meeting in
Geneva in May this year.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Chandrakant Patel from the office of
special coordinator for the least developed countries (LDCS) and
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
said the importance of this workshop arises from the fact that it
brings together participants to resolve a key policy challenge to
countries in Africa, namely how to strengthen their participation
in the trading system through more effective articulation of
their interests and priorities in the multilateral trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, Zimbabwean Minister of Industry and
Commerce N. Shamuyarira noted that the entire developing world is
entering a phase of very delicate and difficult negotiations with
the developed world in the context of the WTO and the Lome
Convention. Developing countries need more information and hard
facts on which to base their decisions.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the second ministerial conference of the
WTO to be held from May 18 to 20, the Organisation of African
Unity (OAU) has suggested what it calls a positive agenda of
issues that concern Africa, which include market access,
industrialisation and investments, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to negotiations for a new economic relationship
between the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group and the
European Union, Shamuyarira said, "The thrust of the ACP position
is to retain advantages in the key clauses of the Lome Convention
that provide market access on concessionary terms, while
jettisoning those clauses inspired by a past colonial era."
</P>
<P>
"Of great importance to the ACP countries is the
non-reciprocal trading arrangement. They insist that this
arrangement should be retained for a given period while they
adjust, as well as industrialise their economy," the minister
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Lebanese, Syrian Stance on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi said Monday that his country supports Lebanese and
Syrian stance on Israeli proposal to conditionally withdraw from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz,
Kharrazi told a news conference that the Israeli offer was actually
a trap aimed at separating Lebanon from the Syrian track in the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to comply with the United Nations Resolution
425 and withdraw from south Lebanon provided negotiated security
arrangements are agreed by the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
These arrangements include the deployment of Lebanese troops in
the areas to be vacated by Israeli forces and the disarmament of
the Iranian-backed Hezbullah (Party of God) and the reintegration
of members of the pro-Israeli militia, the South Lebanese
Army (SLA), into the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
The offer was vehemently rejected by Lebanon and Syria, who
argued that the U.N. resolution 425 calls on Israel to leave
Lebanon without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted by the U.N. in 1978 following Israeli
first invasion of Lebanon. It calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also warned that Israel was likely
to launch new heavy assaults on south Lebanon in a bid to press
the Lebanese government to accept its demands.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Beirut International Airport Monday
morning, Kharrazi said that Lebanon has been in the front line of
the battle against the "Jewish enemy." He expressed concern about
the continuous Israeli attack on south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 with the declaimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attack,
military confrontations between Israeli occupying forces and
Lebanese resistance fighters take place almost everyday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi arrived here from Syria for a three-day visit. He is
expected to hold talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House
Speaker Nabih Berry, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and other
officials on regional developments and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He will also deliver a letter from Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami to Hrawi.

MANILA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here on Monday that he was "most optimistic of productive
results" of the Second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to be held in
London.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Ramos said
that unavoidable commitments in the country prevented him from
joining the ASEM, but he has designated Senate President Neptali
Gonzales and Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon as his
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The president said he looks to "the adoption of major
initiatives, notably the Asia-Europe Cooperation Framework, as
well as the action plans on investment promotion and on trade
facilitation."
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the second ASEM takes on added significance at it
will be held in the midst of a currency and financial crisis
gripping East and Southeast Asia.

"Both our regions certainly will benefit from a concerted
response to this crisis, particularly cooperation on its early
resolution and more significantly, on the restoration of economic
dynamism in the Asian region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors want to buy Indonesian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors from the United
States and Europe have expressed interest in buying the Indonesian
government's stakes in five publicly-listed state-owned
enterprises, a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government warmly welcomes their interest, but has yet to
decide on this, Finance Minister Fuad Bawazier said after meeting
with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the foreign investors' interest in owning the
government's shares in the state enterprises reflects their
confidence that Indonesia would be able to weather its economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't see any good prospects (in Indonesia), they
would not make any offer to buy the shares," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that once this is realized, confidence in the
Indonesian economy will easily be restored.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian economy has been burdened by the detrimental
impacts of the sharp plunge in the rupiah (national currency)
since July last year. The rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of
its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
This has caused most state-owned and private companies to
become technical bankrupt as their foreign debts surpass their
equity. Many foreign banks have refused to accept their credit
letters (C/Ls) for imports.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a total of 164 state firms, 70 percent of which
were considered to be financially unhealthy as of last year.

torrential rain lashed the Tornado-hit areas in the eastern Indian
State of West Bengal on Monday, reported the Press Trust of India
(PTI).
</P>
<P>
The storm, with a wind speed of 70 kmph and heavy showers,
paralysed relief operations and normal life in the district of
Midnapore, which was ripped last week by Tornado that killed 175
people and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no report of new casualties in the
storm-ripped area.
</P>
<P>
The storm, triggered by a low pressure along West Bengal coast,
uprooted trees, blew away thatched houses, and snapped electric
wires and telecommunication links, according to the PTI report
from the area.
</P>
<P>
Tarpaulin sheets and straw which were used in temporary sheds
to house the homeless were blown off, said Midnapore District
Magistrate Arun Bal, adding that villagers have been moved to
safer places.
</P>
<P>
Civil defense personnel, fire brigade and police have been
deployed to clear the debris in the area.

<HEADLINE> Dar Police Arrest 50 Rioters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The police have arrested
more than 50 people after hundreds of rioters burned two
government vehicles and attacked offices of the Tanzanian ruling
party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) in Dar es Salaam Sunday
afternoon, local newspapers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The riot, the second in seven weeks, happened in areas near
the Mwembechai Mosque in the downtown, where mobsters, mostly
young men set fire on two government-owned vehicles.
</P>
<P>
They have also ransacked CCM offices at Mwembechai, Ndugumbi,
Makurumla and Kagera Mikoroshoni areas. The Ndugumbi office was
burnt.
</P>
<P>
Police and the Field Force Unit used tear gas to disperse the
mob who are armed with clubs, stones.
</P>
<P>
The Morogoro Road, where the mosque is located, was closed
until 7:45 pm after the security order came back to normal.
</P>
<P>
The riot is reported to have happened after the police banned
a meeting of the Committee for Moslem Women on Saturday.
Recently, some 16 Moslem women, acquitted of charges in the
Mwembechai riot case last month, demanded an apology from the
government for being maltreated in custody by the police.
</P>
<P>
The women were held during a violent riot near the Mwembechai
Mosque in mid-February in Dar es Salaam, in which two people,
including a Moslem school teacher, were killed, and more than 200
people were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Five Tanzanian Women Missing after Canoe Capsizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A boat capsized in the
Indian Ocean near Tanzania's Island of Pemba, leaving five women
missing, Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The South Pemba Regional Police Commander, Hamdan Ali Uledi,
told the paper that the ill-fated boat was sailing Saturday from
Makungwe to Makombeni village when sea tide became turbulent with
a storm.
</P>
<P>
The sea disaster, the first this year, struck the 20-people
boat at 10 am after it sailed only a kilometer away from the
shore. Fifteen people managed to swim to the bank while the five
women were missing, Uledi said.
</P>
<P>
The missing persons, who are feared dead, have been identified
as Mchanga Ramadhan Komobo, 15, Fatuma Mwalimu Haji, 15, Nueza
Vuai, 20, and Kazija Makame, 15. The fifth has so far not been

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Vow to Donate Organs After Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- While most Chinese still take the
traditional view that the remains of deceased persons should not
be dissected, some 600 residents in Nanjing have chosen to donate
their organs for medical use after their deaths.
</P>
<P>
They have joined an organ donation group, China's first, which
was founded in Nanjing in February. Among the committed donors,
the oldest is 93 while the youngest is 18.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to find that more people will donate their organs,"
said the group's initiator, Huang Fuyin, who has received many
inquiries from 27 provinces, cities and autonomous regions,
expressing a willingness to join the move.
</P>
<P>
In Wujing, a city in east China's Jiangsu Province, three
retired teachers in their 80s urged the city to set up a similar
organization dealing with local organ donations. "We hope organ
donations could save more lives in the future," they said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yi, a retired engineer in his 70s, traveled a long way to
Beijing from Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, to sign papers
on cornea donations with the Eye Bank of the Tongren Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The result of a Beijing survey shows that, of the 500
respondents, 48.6 percent expressed a willingness to donate their
corneas, contrasting sharply with only 15 people whose answers
were "no."
</P>
<P>
A report from a Nanjing university also revealed 34 percent of
surveyed students said they plan to donate their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Experts describe organic exhaustion as one of the most serious
threats to people's health and life, and acknowledged that organ
transplants have become a popular means of resuing human life in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
However, China is short of organs for transplant. State sources
said only 2,000 people get organs for transplant each year,
contrasting sharply with 100,000 patients suffering organic
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
"The move now is gaining more attention than before, thanks to
more powerful publicity by newspapers, TV and radio," said
Huang. The cities of Nanjing and Xi'an have opened centers
responsible for organ donations. Volunteers in Xuzhou have been
awarded commemorative medals thanking them for their kindness.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Nanjing also said that the legal framework for
organ donations is being prepared and urged people to become more
aware of organ donations to save lives.

<HEADLINE> BMW Wins Contest for Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The British engineering group
Vickers PLC has agreed to sell the luxury car-maker Rolls-Royce to
BMW AG of Germany for 340 million pounds (572 million U.S.
dollars), BMW confirmed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the decision by Vickers, a BMW spokesman said in
Munich: "We are honored and also obligated to meet the
expectations of our British partner."
</P>
<P>
While confirming the 340 million pound price tag, the spokesman
said the company would detail its plan about Rolls-Royce at a press
conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vickers, which says it wants to concentrate on its defense
business, put Rolls-Royce up for sale last October, provoking a
fierce contest between BMW and Germany's largest car-maker
Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
Vickers chairman Colin Chandler announced Monday that after
carefully considering a number of proposals, the company found that
BMW's offer was the most attractive one in terms of achieving best
value for shareholders and ensuring the continued success of
Rolls-Royce, the last British-owned car company.
</P>
<P>
BMW, which supplies engines for Silver Seraph, the latest model
of Rolls-Royce, had threatened to withhold supplies if a rival
company won the bidding.
</P>
<P>
The Germany car-maker is expected to invest heavily in
Rolls-Royce over the next 10 years to increase the sales of the
luxury car. Vickers rolled out 1,918 Rolls-Royce last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Train Ghanaian Soldiers Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States is to begin
training of Ghanaian soldiers next Wednesday, according to the
United States Information Service (USIS) here.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued by USIS at the weekend, said about 70
soldiers from the U.S. army, accompanied by a Belgian military
training element along with support troops may be deployed
Wednesday "to begin training a battalion size unit in Ghana".
</P>
<P>
The decision of the U.S. Defense Department was announced at
the weekend, barely five days after U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived in Ghana to begin his six-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
The effort is aimed at increasing Ghana's peacekeeping skills
as part of the U.S. African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI),
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said since July last year, when the 3rd Special Forces
Group of the U.S. army started operations, forces in Senegal,
Uganda and Malawi have been trained, while Mali is undergoing its
own training.
</P>
<P>
The ACRI program also entails "follow-on sustainment training
twice a year after the completion of the initial training," the
statement said, citing Senegal and Uganda as beneficiaries of the
sustainment training which started this month.
</P>
<P>
The need to create "highly effective rapidly deployable
peacekeeping units that can operate jointly in the event of a
humanitarian crisis or in a traditional peacekeeping operation"
requires the setting up of the ACRI, which USIS described as a
bilateral training initiative intended to work with the African
states.
</P>
<P>
ACRI is also conducted in tandem with African partners, the
Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, while
complementing the training efforts of Britain and France as well
as other African countries, USIS said.

HANOI, March 30 (xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production
rose 13 percent during the period up to March 20 this year
compared to the same period last year, according to latest
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Production in the state-owned and foreign-invested industrial

and power -- Vietnam's key industrial products, went up by 19.6
percent, 15.6 per cent and 15.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Production also increased in many foreign-invested industries,
such as sugar refining, aqua-produce processing, cement,

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Rongji Meets Mozambican President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that China is willing to share its experience in economic
construction with Mozambique and work together with the country to
elevate bilateral ties in all fields to a new height.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks in a meeting this afternoon with
visiting Mozambican President Joaquim Alberto Chissano, who is on
a week-long visit to China as the guest of Chinese president Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Calling President Chissano "an old friend of the Chinese
people", Zhu said that the Chinese side attaches great importance
to Chissano's current China trip and believes that his visit would
boost the friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Mozambique have enjoyed a stable
political relationship since the two countries forged diplomatic
ties 23 years ago. China values its relations with Mozambique and
regards the country as a "reliable friend".
</P>
<P>
Chissano said Zhu had made a good explanation of the policy of
the new Chinese government at a press conference soon after he
became the Chinese premier. "I have noticed the determination of
the Chinese government to step up reforms and open wider to the
outside world, as well as the bright prospects of Mozambique-China
relations", Chissano told Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on further enhancing
bilateral economic and trade links. Apart from cooperation between
the two governments, Zhu said, the Chinese government also
encourages Chinese enterprises to seek cooperative projects that
have resources and markets in Mozambique, medium-sized and small
assembly plants in particular.
</P>
<P>
Chissano voiced his admiration to China for its economic
achievements and said that his nation is ready to draw on China's
experience in governing and building the country. He hoped for
increased cooperation between the state-owned and the private-run
enterprises of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chissano and Zhu also briefed each other on their respective
domestic economic situations.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased with and appreciates Mozambique's economic
progress and its positive role in regional affairs, the Chinese
premier said.

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chen Xinhua, Chinese vice
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, held talks
here today with Jacques Dondoux, Secretary of State to French
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry in Charge of External
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Chen said trade between the two countries developed smoothly
last year and that he hoped to maintain the momentum.
</P>
<P>
Dondoux said China is an important trade partner of France, and
that he hoped more French businesses would invest in China,
especially in the service sector, industry and finance.
</P>
<P>
Chen assured him that the Chinese government would keep the
"long-term and stable" policy, since the ones who made it are new
Premier Zhu Rongji and Vice Premier Li Lanqing when they served as
vice premiers in the last government.
</P>
<P>
Chen also thanked the European Union and French government for
supporting China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
and said he hoped France would continue to play a positive role in
this process.
</P>
<P>
In return, Dondoux suggested that China should put forward a
detailed timetable to show its sincerity and accelerate its entry
into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Noting the divergence of views, both sides agreed that it would
be wise to set up a bilateral discussion system between their
trade experts.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed possible cooperation in the fields of
nuclear power, energy, transportation and food.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Campaign Against Pornographic Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A two-month special campaign
against pornographic materials will be launched throughout Hong
Kong, starting April, to enhance public awareness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Gary Yeung Yiu-shing, assistant
commissioner for the Television and Entertainment Licensing
Authority (TELA) at a press briefing here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeung noted that a similar campaign was first launched last
year which had produced good results in halting the proliferation
of obscene articles, in particular pornographic video compact
discs (VCDs).
</P>
<P>
There were 1,114 prosecutions against breaches of the Control
of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance, resulting in the
seizure of more than 639,000 obscene and indecent articles
including 541,000 VCDs and CD-ROMs. These represented an increase
of 25 percent in prosecution and 195 percent in seizures when
compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Yeung said: "the law enforcement agencies recognize the
importance of sustaining the effectiveness of enforcement action.
The Police, the Customs and Excise Department and TELA have
therefore agreed to conduct a two-month campaign against
pornographic materials."
</P>
<P>
During the campaign period, he said TELA will arrange talks to
schools and youth centers, and monitor articles on sale in the
market and issue summonses against publishers if their
publications do not comply with statutory requirements.
</P>
<P>
The police will concentrate their efforts at retail and
wholesale outlets, such as video and computer shops in the
districts; while the Customs and Excise Department will tackle the
problem at entry points and in the course of their copyright
protection work.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that through our intensive efforts, there will be
increased public awareness of the problem of access to
pornographic materials by young people," Yeung said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Construction Output for 1997 Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The gross value of construction
work, in nominal terms, performed by main contractors of Hong Kong
amounted to 130.7 billion HK dollars (16.77 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an increase of 12.4 percent from the
previous year, according to official statistics released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results issued by the Census and Statistics
Department showed that the gross value of construction work, in
nominal terms, performed by main contractors increased by 7.2
percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 from the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
A local government spokesman said that construction output at
private sector sites rose strongly in 1997, bolstered by robust
building activity. The slowdown in construction output at public
sector sites was attributable mainly to the winding down of
projects under the Airport Core Program, he added.

<HEADLINE> Over-Production of Plate Glass Unlikely to Change in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese market for plate
glass will still be a buyer's market with the supply and demand
remaining at last year's level.
</P>
<P>
According to a projection by the National Light Industry
Council, China's production of plate glass will be 168 million
standard-weight cases.
</P>
<P>
With the additional 12 million cases of plate glass in stock,
the projection says, market supply will far exceed the demand of
155 million cases.
</P>
<P>
The annual plate glass export in 1996 and 1997 was 37 million
square meters. Because of the Asian financial turmoil, this year's
export is expected to have very little impact on lowering the
supply-demand difference.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the real production increase is inconsistent with
proper, optimal growth of the plate glass industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, for instance, the construction of production
lines with float glass technology increased the production
capacity of plate glass in 1996 to what was planned for 2000.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 12 such lines became operational, which resulted in a
production increase of 26 million cases. Ten lines started
operation in 1996 and 1997, turning out 23 million and 20 million
cases, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Six or seven production lines will be completed this year,
according to the council, and their combined production capacity
will be 15 million cases.

<HEADLINE> HK Government to Provide "Speedy News" on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
 Special Administrative Region (SAR) has begun providing a news
service "Speedy News" on the Internet, thus allowing the public to
get access to government press release almost at the same time
when the media receive the same materials, an official spokesman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The "Speedy News" would be a major improvement to the
dissemination of information to the public by means of the
Internet, the spokesman for the Information Service Department
(ISD) of the SAR government said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "In the past, only major press releases were uploaded
manually onto the Internet after they have been issued to the
media. All items were uploaded in the form of a Daily Information
Bulletin the following day."
</P>
<P>
"With the installation of a specially-designed computer
program, press releases issued by the ISD can now be converted
into Internet file format and then be uploaded onto the government
web site automatically and in a speedy manner throughout the day,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, press releases in both English and
Chinese would be uploaded within five minutes after they had been
sent to the media via a dedicated network. Internet users could
choose from the daily index page the press releases, which were
arranged in the chronological order, they were interested in, he
added.
</P>
<P>
By clicking "Daily Information Bulletin," Internet users can
read press releases, speeches and transcripts of remarks and
statements made by senior officials of the SAR, statistical
reports and important announcements, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he went on to say, major press releases will be
further categorized to enable easy access to them from different
sections of the web site.
</P>
<P>
The daily "hit" at the index page of the web site has increased
10-fold from 467 in December 1995, when the home page, or the
"Government Information Center," was launched, to 5,143 last
month. Over 22,398,000 visits to all pages of the web site were
recorded during the period.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Down Slightly on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined slightly
in moderate trading on the Singapore market as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 5.37 points to close
at 1648.56 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The closing of corporate reporting season, stability in
financial markets around the region and lack of fresh factors
contributed to some lethargy in the market, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They said that with the STII failing to move higher, most
investors decided to square their positions and stay sidelined.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 210.47 million units, valued
at 269.45 million Singapore dollars (168.41 million U.S. dollars).
Declines overwhelmed advances by 315 to 50, while 246 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Uniphoenix was the most actively traded stock as it registered
a turnover of 12.74 million units. It was followed by Renong Bhd
which had 8.74 million shares traded. M. Resources was next with
7.22 million units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
SIA (the Singapore Airlines) Foreign led the gainers of the day
as it rose by 30 cents to finish at 11.7 Singapore dollars. SPH
(Singapore Press Holdings) increased by 20 cents to end at 18.7
Singapore dollars. Auric Pac was up by 18 cents to close at 1.54
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 1.7 dollars to end at 36.3 Singapore dollars. DBS
(Development Bank of Singapore) fell by 1.4 dollars to close at
8.35 Singapore dollars, while DBS Foreign was 1.3 dollars lower to
finish at 12 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls for Collective Efforts for Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif called here Monday for collective efforts to make the
privatization process a success for restructuring the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot on its own undertake this gigantic
effort," said Sharif while addressing the inaugural session of a
two-day Official Pakistan Privatization Summit jointly organized
by the Privatization Commission, the Finance Ministry of Pakistan
and the First Conferences of U.K..
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that "like any other transition, this process may
prove to be painful in the short run and would require
restructuring the old paradigms about economy and the state's
role."
</P>
<P>
He called for commitment and support from all the stake holders
including local business community, international investment
community, donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process in Pakistan, he said, should be
viewed in the context of financial and fiscal difficulties being
faced by the state and the inertia that has unfortunately crept
into the public sector over the years.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a hemorrhage in the public sector which
has to be stemmed in order for the country to pull out of the
continuous cycle of fiscal and financial indiscipline,
mismanagement and borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Strong government commitment is absolutely necessary for
successful privatization, he said, adding that commitment to the
ultimate objectives of privatization are extremely important
throughout the policy cycle.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the transaction process should be
characterized by a maximum amount of public transparency and the
privatization program should aim for maximum sustainable speed.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring benefits of the privatization efforts, Sharif said
it attracts suitable investors who provide investment, technology
transfer and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
"Incentives are created for work force to improve productivity,
and government funds can be released for the social sector and
debt retirement," he added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the summit will highlight tremendous opportunities in
Pakistan's privatization and investment program for local and
international investors.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 delegates from 20 countries attending the summit
will hold a number of table sessions in the next two days focusing
on telecommunications, petroleum and natural resources, water and
power, infrastructure and transport, banking and finance,
industries and production sectors.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Talks in Damascus Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here on Monday that his talks with Syrian leaders on
issues related to the Middle East are fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks before leaving here for Lebanon after
a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he discussed with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa the latest situations in the region, the issue of
south Lebanon in particular.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Khaddam Sunday evening, Kharrazi said
that Iran and Syria are concerned about Israel's expansionist
policies, its future ambitions and its long-term attempts to
change the geography in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel's offer to pull out of south Lebanon is a trick designed
to sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that it is ready to withdraw from south Lebanon
if the Lebanese government agrees to curb cross-border attacks on
the Jewish state by Muslim guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their stances on
key issues, have viewed it as an Israeli attempt to drive a wedge
between them and rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
They maintain that Israel should pull back from south Lebanon,
where it set up a security zone in 1985 to allegedly protect its
northern areas from guerrilla attacks, unconditionally under the
United Nations Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister stressed that Israel's proposal is
aimed at disguising its expansionist policy which has brought the
Middle East peace process to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel came to a halt two
years ago over the future of the Golan Heights, a piece of Syrian
land captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the people and nations in the region are aware of
the hazards of Israel's policy and will reject its proposal to
withdraw conditionally from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Churns Lower against Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar churned
lower Monday as a falling Japanese yen outweighed the positive
impact of a hike in gold prices, while the domestic bond market
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 66.68 U.S. cents, from 67.28 late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America foreign exchange dealer Andrew Le said a rise
in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen had largely
contributed to the Australian dollar's weakness.
</P>
<P>
"The futures market is up a little bit - there is still hope
for a rate cut here - so that's going to combine with the fact the
U.S. dollar/yen is up to see a weaker Aussie dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Le said if the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against the
yen, the Australian dollar could slide below 66 U.S. cents by the
end of the week.
</P>
<P>
The yen slipped against the U.S. dollar as concern remained
over the effectiveness of Japan's economic stimulus package
announced last week.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts are awaiting news of whether the 16 trillion
yen package will be expanded to include an income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
While events in Japan weigh heavily on the Australian dollar,
Le said the local currency was also being supported by a rise in
the price of gold.
</P>
<P>
"Gold is up above 300.00 U.S. dollars, so there is some
conflict there," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, gold bullion closed at 302.40 U.S. dollars, from a
previous close of 301.50.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the local session at 87.65
Japanese yen from 86.99, and at 1.2104 Deutsch marks from 1.2261
on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Tourism Conference Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 tourism and travel
industry leaders and professionals from the Asia-Pacific region
gathered here Monday to discuss the Asian financial crisis and
other challenges facing the region's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Pacific Asia Travel
Association (PATA) 47th Annual congress, PATA Chief Executive
Officer Joe Mclnerney said the Asia-Pacific region's tourism had
enjoyed an unprecedented growth during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, nearly 90 million international travelers
visited the region, up some 60 million from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
But the region and its travel industry are facing a new chapter
filled with challenges such as economic downturn, currency
devaluation and the fire-related haze, Mclnerney said.
</P>
<P>
Mclnerney said the three-day conference will try to seek short-
and long-term solutions to these challenges.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will also discuss marketing policies, consumer
protection, strategic alliances, human resources development and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1952 in Hawaii, PATA is a non-governmental and
non-profit association. It has 79 chapters worldwide and about
16,000 members in the region, including some 40 government
departments, 76 airlines and cruise lines, 2,200 travel and
tourism-related businesses and organizations.
</P>
<P>
The last PATA annual congress was held in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Canadian Trade Ties Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China and Canada have enormous
potential for expanding trade and mutual investment as well as
financial and multilateral trade cooperation, foreign trade
ministers for the two countries agreed here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng and visiting Canadian International Trade Minister
Sergio Marchi also expressed hope during their talks that the two
countries would make a joint effort to spur bilateral cooperation
in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Shi cited last year's Sino-Canadian trade volume of four
billion U.S. dollars as modest, saying that the two governments
should push two-way trade by solving problems.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the expansion of mutual investment and
signing agreements for the protection of mutual investment at an
early date. He said that China has reached such agreements with
more than 70 countries.
</P>
<P>
At present, Canada has invested more than 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars in China and Chinese businesses have also begun to
invest in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's access to the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Shi said that the two countries have not reached agreement
for China's joining the WTO although many rounds of negotiations
have been held and China has made a great effort.
</P>
<P>
He said China has concluded its bilateral negotiations with
more than half of the 35 countries for its WTO entry, and that he
hoped Canada would not become one of the last to reach agreements
with China.
</P>
<P>
At present, Canada imposes anti-dumping rules on 15 kinds of
Chinese commodities, Shi said, adding that the Chinese government
does not allow its businesses to dump their products abroad.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the reason why some Chinese products are
highly competitive is that China has low processing costs, and
Canada should take this into account.
</P>
<P>
Marchi said that Canada attaches great importance to
Canadian-Chinese trade and would like to expand bilateral
cooperation in sectors of power, telecommunications, finance and
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Threatens Boycott of Aussie Food Export Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Monday threatened a trade
boycott of Australian wheat and dairy exports unless Australia
withdraws its nearly 200 servicemen in Kuwait, a leading
Australian TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
The boycott could block Australian access to a planned 198
million U.S. dollar expansion of Iraq's dairy market and 132
million U.S. dollars in annual wheat imports under the United
Nations Oil for Food program, the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) Television said earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Australian military contingent of nearly 200
servicemen in Kuwait, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehei Saleh
told ABC Television that Iraq would not do business with hostile
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to keep our trade relationship with Australia
as long as the troops are in front of the Iraqi people," Saleh
told the ABC's World program.
</P>
<P>
Australia has nearly 200 troops in Kuwait, mostly from the
elite Special Air Service regiment, which were dispatched last
month from Australia in a show of support of the United States'
threatened military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the United Nations Oil for Food
program in December 1986, the Australian Wheat Board has sold 2.2
million tons of wheat to Iraq, more than 50 percent of its import
requirements, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
But Saleh warned that unless the government withdrew its
military personnel, Iraq would make a sizable cut in Australian
imports.
</P>
<P>
An Australian Wheat Board spokeswoman said Australia had a very
productive relationship with Iraq and the Iraqi Grain Board in
particular.
</P>
<P>
"The AWB has shipped about 730,000 tones so far for 1997/98 (the
financial year of 1998) and we still expect to ship about one
million tones for the year," the spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Ross Proposes No U.S. Plan to Palestinians: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat has said United States Mideast envoy Dennis Ross has not
proposed any U.S. peace plan to the Palestinians in his current
mission, local newspaper the Jordan Times reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Until this moment the American administration has not
submitted to us any official proposal that will compel us to say
yes or no," the semi-official newspaper quoted Erekat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Erekat arrived here Sunday evening and met with Jordanian
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jawad Anani.
</P>
<P>
What was discussed between Ross and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was no more than ideas of how to break the deadlock of the
peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing our deliberations with the American side,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Jerusalem last Thursday and shuttled
between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
win their acceptance of a proposed U.S. peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly outlined a plan calling on Israel to
withdraw from 13.1 percent more of the West Bank over 12 weeks,
accompanied by Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, both the Palestinians and Israel are reportedly cool
to the plan, which the U.S. has yet to make public for fear of
putting pressure on the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said the withdrawal scope is unacceptable and that
it would not pull out from more than 9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that according to U.S.-brokered
agreements signed last year, Israel should carry out three
significant pullbacks from the West Bank by summer this year.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians now have full or partial control over 27
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the Palestinians are extending "genuine efforts" to
get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the U.S. proposal would correspond to "the
precise and accurate implementation of agreements" signed between
the Palestinians and the Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Ranarridh Pledges to Work to Achieve Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Prince Norodom
Ranarridh, who returned to Phnom Penh earlier Monday after about
nine months of self-exile, said he would work with other parties
to achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"I shall work in cooperation with the established Cambodian
institutions, all political parties, including the Cambodian
People's Party, the National Electoral Commission... in order to
achieve national reconciliation in Cambodia and to improve the
conditions leading to free, fair and credible elections," said the
prince in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The Prince, former first prime minister, was deposed by Hun Sen
after armed conflict between their parties in Phnom Penh on July 5
and 6.
</P>
<P>
The Phnom Penh Military Court sentenced the prince in absentia
to 35 years in prison on March 4 and 18, charging him for
illegally importing weapons and attempting to overthrow the legal
government of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk granted pardon to him on March 21 after
receiving a direct appeal from the second Prime Minister Hun Sen,
making him eligible to participate in the general elections
scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
Ranarridh's FUNCINPEC party and the Cambodian People's Party
led by Hun Sen are expected to be the main rivals in the elections.
</P>
<P>
About two thousand people held demonstrations Saturday in the
city against the return of Prince Ranarridh and his top military
commanders, which was accompanied by a top-level delegation
including U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's Special
representative to Cambodia, Lakhan Mehrotra.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Revise Land-Use Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province,
facing overpopulation and a shortage of cultivated land, will
revise its land-use plan this year, a local official said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Fanglei, director of the provincial land
administration bureau, the new plan would help stop the decline of
cultivated land caused by rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to launch an overall check on the one
million hectares of basic farmland this year to ensure that 80
percent of the cultivated land remains under top protection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, land-use management will be strengthened, according
to Lin. He added that land administration departments will
participate in the approval process for new construction projects
regarding land use.
</P>
<P>
With a per-capita arable land of 0.04 hectares, the province
has to import one billion kilograms of grain every year from other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The occupation of arable land for non-farming purposes has
worsened the situation. A recent survey shows that, in the past
seven years, half of more than 700,000 hectares of construction
formerly was farmland.
</P>
<P>
The province has intensified its law enforcement in land
use. So far, the local government has handled 40,000 cases of the
illegal use of land and taken back land-use rights for 200
hectares.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat to Discuss U.S. Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat will hold talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on a U.S. peace plan in Egypt's Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Shiekh on Monday, the Al-Akhbar newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat will also brief Mubarak on his three
rounds of meetings with United States Mideast envoy Dennis Ross,
the Arabic-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Israel last Thursday and reportedly shuttled
between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a
bid to win their acceptance of the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly formulated a plan calling on Israel to
withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, linked
to Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians and Israel are cool to the plan, which the
U.S. has yet to make public for fear of putting pressure on the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said the withdrawal scope is unacceptable and that
it would pull out from no more than 9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that Israel carry out three significant
pullbacks by summer this year under U.S.-brokered agreements
signed last year between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday
to hold talks with Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross' visit to Egypt is aimed at highlighting the U.S. idea to
push forward the peace process, Moussa told reporters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He rejected claims that Egypt may pressurize the Palestinians
into accepting U.S. ideas to break the peace impasse, stressing
that Egypt would accept nothing short of a balanced peace.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is not to offer the Palestinians on a plate to the
(Israeli) Likud government. Egypt can not do this nor does it
accept it. All that Egypt can do is to make reasoning when it gets
convinced," the Egyptian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Egypt's readiness to cooperate with the U.S.
proposal, which he said should go in line with the signed
agreements based on the land-for-peace principle.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>

Paris, Montpellier, Grenoble and a dozen other major cities against
the alliance between rightwing politicians and National Front in the
regional elections. Meanwhile, President Jacques Chirac will begin
on Monday consultations on modernizing the public life of France in
the wake of the turmoil in the regional elections.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States threatens to withdraw from the Middle East
 peace process and to let Israel and Palestinians to deal with
each other all alone. According to the Israeli daily Ma'ariv on
Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madelein Albright told American
Jewish leaders in a telephone conversation that the United States
can not go on like this as a mediator, and one of the possibility
is a pure and simple withdrawal from the process.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Following turmoil in the regional elections caused by the
alliance between the National Front and some rightwing politicians,
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin are
entering a speeding track in a competition for initiatives to
modernize the political life of France. Chirac will begin
consultations with the heads of 13 mainstream rightwing political
parties, while the Socialist government has announced that it will
present a draft law to reform the polling method in regional
elections before Summer.
</P>
<P>
-- Four years after the genocide in Rwanda, the policy adopted by
former French President Francois Mitterrand for the Great Lakes
region still remains a mystery. No official investigation has been
launched into the downing of the French military helicopter which
carried the presidents of Rwanda and Burundin on April 6, 1994. The
killing of the two presidents triggered the massacres in Rwanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of Languages at
Makerere University in Uganda has published science textbooks for
lower primary children in local languages, The Monitor reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The textbooks are to be introduced as a part of textbooks for
Universal Primary Education (UPE), the paper added.
</P>
<P>
UPE is a scheme of the country to provide free education for
four children for every family.
</P>
<P>
The new science books are published in two local languages --
Luganda and Runyakitara, with the former used in the central part
of the country while the latter is spoken by people in southwest
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has more than 40 tribes. Every tribe has its own
language so that it is hard for an uneducated person to have a
conversation with others from another tribe.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, school children start their schooling in English,
while local languages are used in middle school.
</P>
<P>
Many lower primary class children complain they have
difficulty to understand some content of their syllabus in
English.
</P>
<P>
The science textbooks were translated by local scholars under
the sponsorship of senior lecturers of the Language Institute of
Makerere University, the most famous university in the country.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Plans to Visit Iran Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has reiterated to maintain good relations with
Iran, saying that he would visit Iran soon, apparently another
gesture to maintain his independent foreign deplomatic policy.
</P>
<P>
"I will visit Iran shortly and I do not hide those things,"
Mandela told CNN television Sunday hours after seeing off
visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said last Friday that he would not betray friends who
had helped the country in apartheid era, such as Libya, Iran and
Cuba, three countries Washington treats as pariah states.
</P>
<P>
In his latest remarks, Mandela said "Libya, Cuba and Iran are
my friends," noting those countries' support for the
anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa "when the United States,
as other Western Powers, at the time of struggle were really
helping our enemy."
</P>
<P>
Mandela also repeated his opposition to the Growth and
Opportunity Bill on trade relations which is before the U.S.
Senate. The bill offers trade bonuses to African countries that
back democracy and apply International Monetary Fund reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We resist any attempt by any country to impose conditions on
our freedom of trade. That we cannot accept. And the provisions
of this bill will restrict our freedom to trade with countries,
something that I found totally unacceptable," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has several times upset Washington since he took power
after the first non-racial elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, then Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani visited South Africa and the two countries have been
in good relations.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also expressed willingness to play a role in resolving
differences between Washington and those regimes it opposes.
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of the United States are not our enemies... We
are ready, and there are many influential heads of state who are
ready to help ensuring that the relations between the U.S. and
those countries are sorted out peacefully in a way that will
please both countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Unites States of America plays an important role in world
affairs but... American foreign policy should be consistent with
the provision of the United Nations Charters which call upon all
the countries to settle their disputes by peaceful means," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the first American president ever to visit South
Africa, spent four days in the country. He left Johannesburg
Sunday for Botswana, the fifth country visited on his six-nation
African tour.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge in Tokyo After Early Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo on
Monday with the key Nikkei index losing more than 500 points just
before the close of the session, on diminishing expectations that
the government will use public funds to prop it up.
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei average on the First Section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange finished at 16,263.04, down 476.22 points or 2.84
percent from last Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
The index jumped to a high of 17,009.89 soon after the market
opened, but plummeted toward closing to hit a low of 16,238.56.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all issues
on the major section, dropped 17.28 points or 1.37 percent to
1,241.27.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section went up to an estimated 360 million
shares from Friday's 300 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks rose more than 200 points early in the morning
over a news report that the Japanese government and the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party plan to continue special income tax cuts
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the market lost impetus amid the yen's depreciation in the
foreign exchange market, and turned negative in the afternoon,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors, which had waited until the last minute
for a boost in the market by a public fund infusion for the fiscal
year-end, began selling on disappointment, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,327 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outweighed gainers 791 to 317, with 123 remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Israeli Rightwing Camp Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- As United States peace envoy
Dennis Ross is continuing his peace mediation here, Israeli
rightwing camp threatened to topple the government if it succumbs
to the U.S. pressure on Israeli further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Ross held a third round of talks Sunday night separately with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in an attempt to
pin down the size of Israeli second further redeployment in the
West Bank. No breakthrough was reported as the talks stalled over
Israeli demand for reciprocity from the PNA.
</P>
<P>
While Ross was trying to persuade the two sides to come close
on the scope of Israeli pullout, a leading rightwing party within
Israeli ruling coalition issued a strong warning to Netanyahu
against relinquishing land.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of National Religious Party (NRP) held a
special meeting Sunday night and formulated a list of demands for
Netanyahu's talks with Ross. Top on the list was a demand that
Israel should not give up more than 35 percent of the West Bank in
a final settlement. This means that the second redeployment could
not exceed over 9 percent, which the U.S. and the PNA have both
regarded as too little.
</P>
<P>
The hardline party made it clear that if its demands were not
met, then it would not stay in the coalition. NRP lawmaker Hanan
Porat claimed that the U.S. proposal of 13.1 percent redeployment
was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Porat, as well as two other NRP lawmakers Nissim Slomiansky
and Zvi Hendel, is a member of the Land of Israel Front that is
strongly opposed to giving up larger part of West Bank. The Front
includes 10 lawmakers from different parties.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, hardline Likud lawmaker and a Front member Zeev
Begin made it clear that he and other members would topple the
government if it hands over more land to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the inaction on the part of
Netanyahu in making decision on the second redeployment is
largely due to the strong opposition from his rightwing coalition
partners. The coalition is holding only one-seat majority in the
120-member Knesset (Parliament), and it cannot afford to alienate
any coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
One scenario could be that even the Land of Israel Front voted
against the government over the redeployment, the opposition
Labor Party would possibly come to rescue by voting for it.
</P>
<P>
But in this case, Netanyahu might have to renew his call for
setting up a national unity government with the Labor in order to
push forward the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the centrist coalition party Yisrael Baaliya issued
a call Sunday for achieving national unity so to thwart the
balckmailing by rightwing parties led by the NRP. Yisrael
Baaliya's lawmaker Roman Bronfman said he would begin a series of
talks this week to facilitate the creation of a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
Bronfman reasoned that with such hawkish party like the NRP in
the government, it would be impossible for Netanyahu to continue
the peace process. The U.S. has declared that the peace process is
nearing its end and Washington could wash its hands off the
process, so it is high time for settling up a unity government.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Labor has been cool towards the suggestion of
joining a unity government with the Likud. The head of Labor
reaction team in the Knesset (Parliament) Dalia Itzik commented
on Bronfman's call by saying: "Labor has no desire to join a
Netanyahu-led government. Our aim is to bring him down as soon as
possible and go immediately to new elections - the sooner, the
better."

<HEADLINE> Newly Appointed Chinese Ministers Discuss Work Goals  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, today has given two pages on the work plans of
15 newly elected ministers.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, the minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, said the agency gained a role in
macro-economic control as a result of the latest institutional
restructuring while becoming less involved in specific affairs.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, we will focus our effort on the major issues in
national development and strive to do a better job in exercising
macro-economic control," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our first task is to ensure that the economic growth rate will
reach eight percent," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Whether the goal can be reached has a bearing on the overall
situation of the national economy and, to realize the goal, China
will take measures to boost domestic demand and increase
infrastructure investment, he said.
</P>

MANILA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
seeking the assistance of foreign countries to douse the on-going
forest fires in the western provinces of Palawan and Davao del
Norte, Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat said on Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Initiates Airport Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is taking
active measures, including the adoption of a share-holding system
and Sino-foreign joint management, to upgrade its heavily
debt-ridden airport industry.
</P>
<P>
Revitalizing airports is an effort to help the civil aviation
industry respond to the growth of national economy, said Xia
Xinghua, director of Department of System Restructuring and
Regulation of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
Xia noted, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua, that CAAC
will issue a regulation late this year. In line with the
regulation, foreign investors will be allowed to enter more
sectors in airports and can participate in high-level management.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign investment still cannot surpass 49 percent of
the registered capital of an aviation enterprise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tianhe Airport of Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, is making preparations for the introduction of funds and
advanced management experience from a Hong Kong-based enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The test airport will become the first airport involving
Sino-foreign joint management, Xia said.
</P>
<P>
"Joint management provides an opportunity for airports to
deepen reform and open wider to the outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Airports are basic for commercial use, and the government will
put its major investment into air traffic management and flight
operations such as runways.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing, lending and renting will be introduced to build and
manage the terminal area. Foreign investment will also be
encouraged in the areas of ground service, aircraft maintenance,
and hotels.
</P>
<P>
Xia said that one unsolved problem in the construction of
airports is how to use foreign funds efficiently for a long period
of time.
</P>
<P>
Airports call for huge investments, ranging from 1-to-10
billion yuan, but they also are public facilities serving air
carriers instead of a production unit. The length of time required
to gain returns on investment has depreciated the attraction of
airport industry for overseas investors.

<P>
Xia also noted that more airports will be offered on stock
exchanges to gain funds for expansion at low cost and to introduce
share-holding systems.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Capital International Airport and New Baiyun Airport of
Guangzhou have been absorbed in the CAAC plan for share-holding
renovation. Capital Airport also will be listed on overseas stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, Shanghai Hongqiao International and Shenzhen Huangtian
airports were listed on domestic stock exchanges recently, gaining
several billion yuan for expansion and renovation.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yuankang, deputy director-general of CAAC, said airports
with good conditions are supported to be listed on stock
exchanges, and big airports can be listed overseas to lower debts.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC investment policy also calls for the engagement of
local government. Only a dozen out of 124 existing airports under
CAAC received local government funding.
</P>
<P>
"For the airports that mainly serve a local economy, the
investment from local government is still not enough. It is hard
to maintain the demanded growth of the airport industry with the
mere funds from the central government," said Xia, adding that
local governments will obtain more management rights if they
set aside more funds.
</P>
<P>
According to a CAAC project, China will build, expand, or
upgrade all the airports in provincial capitals and municipalities
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), at a cost of
nearly 100 billion yuan. In 1998, 13 airports, including Guangzhou
New Baiyun and Hangzhou Xiaoshan, will be built and expanded.
</P>
<P>
"To get the huge investment, the airport investment system
should go on the track of reform," Xia said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the airport management system should be
transferred from direct management by airport itself. Airport
commercial areas should adopt a competitive mechanism such as
renting, contracting, and selling special management rights to
promote its development.
</P>
<P>
Another source said the CAAC is spreading a standard management
system in airports and airlines, which specifies industrial
standards for enterprises and different levels of managers and
employees in an effort to increase the industry's efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Rage in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 30 (Xinhua)-- Some 490 forest fires raged in
Vietnam's 19 provinces in the first three months of this year,
destroying 7,948 hectares of forests.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam News Agency reported Monday that the figure
presents a sharp increase over that of last year which saw a total
of 1,424 hectares of forests destroyed by 295 fires.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged drought, widespread slash-and-burn farming in the
northern and central regions, and the use of fire in the
restricted areas in the south were the main causes of the forest
fires, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Low water levels in reservoirs near the forests also worsened
the problem, it added.
</P>
<P>
In a move to minimize forest fires, the Vietnamese government
has ordered all provinces and cities to take urgent measures in
forest fire prevention and fighting.

<HEADLINE> HK Police Urges Companies to Step up Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Police Monday appealed
companies in Hong Kong using glass doors with digital locks at
their main entrances to step up security by latching both the
upper and lower parts of the doors.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was issued by a police spokesman after six companies
in commercial buildings in Ngau Tau Kok, Hong Kong, were burgled
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The company operators had left one of the two latches of the
glass doors off, thus allowing burglars to gain assess to the
premises easily, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The glass doors had not been properly locked unless
the doors were fastened by both the upper and lower latches."
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the culprits entered the premises by
inserting a metal plate or a hard object to release the latch.
There was no need for them to prize the locks, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The victimized companies suffered a total loss of 81,300 in
cash and valuable items in the burglaries which occurred between
March 2 and 14.

<HEADLINE> Ross Says U.S. Peace Plan Under Refinement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- United States Middle East Peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross will report back to Washington about
"refinements" to the U.S. peace plan, that had emerged from
several rounds of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders,
Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in the region last Thursday in efforts to
break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, held
a third round of talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat late Sunday night in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Ross told reporters that refinements had been
made to the U.S. peace initiative, which reportedly calls on
Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians, linked to the fulfillment of the Palestinian
commitments to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Ross said that he is going to report the development to
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who will decide the next move to advance the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The peace envoy stressed that he had held "thorough" talks
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on the peace talks, which
have been stalled for months over the extent of Israeli troop's
next pullback in the territories.
</P>
<P>
But Ross did not mention any concrete progress in the
talks. And Arafat, who looked angry, refused to make comments on
his meeting with Ross.
</P>
<P>
Before Ross went to Gaza, he also met with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications adviser, said the
meeting focused on Israel's security requirements and the
reciprocity issue, in contrast to early reports that they would
discuss the scope of the Israeli redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his first two rounds of talks with Ross,
Arafat did not give a positive response to the implementation of
the Palestinian undertakings on security matters. "Without
reciprocity, there can be no talk of percentage," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross intends to fly to Egypt on Monday morning to discuss
the peace process with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
return to Israel in the afternoon for another meeting with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, no further meetings are scheduled with Arafat
because Ross is due to visit the Netherlands on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Participate in SADC Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will participate in the
second Southern African Development Community (SADC) joint
peacekeeping military exercise in South Africa in November this
year, The Herald daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Exercise Blue Crane, the peacekeeping operation to be
held with the assistance of the British military advisory team,
will bring together soldiers from other SADC member countries for
extensive training.
</P>
<P>
South African High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Kingsley Mamabolo
confirmed at the weekend that his country would host the second
peacekeeping military exercise.
</P>
<P>
South Africa participated in the Exercise Blue Hungwe in
Nyanga in Zimbabwe last year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Mamabolo, the exercise was an initiative of the
Zimbabwe defense force and was supported by the British military
advisory team.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa viewed its participation in the exercise as an
opportunity to exchange information, to share experiences, to
standardize operation procedures and to interact with
counterparts in SADC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Exercise Blue Hungwe, hosted by Zimbabwe last April, was the
first-ever joint military exercise grouping eight SADC countries
and was hailed as a milestone which opened a chapter in cementing
regional cooperation and co-existence in the field of defense.
</P>
<P>
On defense relations between Zimbabwe and South Africa,
Mamabolo said the two countries had made significant progress in
the areas of bilateral training programs and joint operations.

<HEADLINE> China to Learn Lessons From Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A signed article in the
today's Beijing-based "China Daily" said it is high time
for China to draw a lesson from the stumbling tigers and try to
keep its economy from being affected.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Gao Shangquan, a noted Chinese
economist and former Vice-Minister of the State Commission for
Economic Restructuring, said that speculative activities against
Southeast Asian currencies triggered the financial turmoil in the
region last July.
</P>
<P>
However, weak points in the fundamentals and financial systems
of Southeast Asian economies were mainly responsible for the
nations' troubles.
</P>
<P>
These weak points include economic bubbles, loose regulation
over the financial sector, a large proportion of non-performing
bank loans, overdue dependence on short-term foreign debts and
huge deficits for balance of international payment, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
China must focus on the following seven issues:
</P>
<P>
-- The government should avoid being too closely and frequently
involved in business activities. In addition, market-based
relations should be established between banks and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
-- Large-scale enterprises should be built with market-based
instruments. Market forces, instead of the government, should
decide whether two or more firms are to merge into a giant group.
</P>
<P>
-- The government should help its state-owned commercial banks
cut the bad assets and help banks shake off their huge bad loans
in order to effectively avoid financial risks.
</P>
<P>
-- China should adjust its economic structure and promote
material economy, technological renovation, consummation of
industrial make-up and enhancement of labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
-- The state should fix its structure of foreign
investment. The influx of short-term foreign debt and foreign
investment in securities should be limited.
</P>
<P>
-- The country should strengthen regulation over the financial
sector and further improve its system of financial supervision and
control.
</P>
<P>
-- It is important to enhance public awareness of financial
risks and confidence in the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Fei Wenjing, a 22-year-old woman
living in the suburbs of Tai'an, a city in east China's Shandong
Province, earned more than one million yuan from her contracted
pig farm last year.
</P>
<P>
Fei, a college graduate, said the secret to her success besides
her knowledge and interests in modern farmland exploitation was
the opportunity provided her by the government's preferential
policy.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the provincial agricultural
administration, Shandong has auctioned the operating rights for
134,000 hectares of wasteland and transferred the rights for
67,000 hectares of land to more than 100,000 private farmland
owners like Fei.
</P>
<P>
In addition to private ownership, cooperative operations of
farmland in form of share-holding, technology and production
materials have been introduced to the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The farmers each claimed an averaged 1.3 hectares of land and
are mainly engaged in growing grain, vegetables, oil-bearing
crops, fruit, flowers and herbs as well as animal husbandry and
aquatic breeding.
</P>
<P>
The official said most of the farmers are maintaining close
ties with research institutions and agronomists in seeding,
growing and marketing. The machinery used in agricultural
production on this kind of private farmlands is 30 percent higher
than the provincial average.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Region Uses Cotton By-products for Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have successfully turned cotton
stalks, seed dregs and other by-products into a major feed source
for livestock in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The region, China's largest cotton producer, turns out more
than a million tons of cotton annually and has large amounts of
cotton by-products. But local people used the poison-bearing
cotton by-products either as firewood or fertilizer, which
contributed to environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the regional Academy of Agricultural Sciences
began work on a project concerning cotton-stalk ensilage and
harvesting machines.
</P>
<P>
Now the agronomists have invented cotton-stalk harvesting
machines, cotton-stalk silage technology, cotton-seed dregs and
hulls synthetic fodder, and detoxified cotton protein feed. This
paved the way to change cotton by-products into edible forage.
</P>
<P>
The achievements have been tried in nine pilot areas involving
145,000 tons of feed production and 620 related farm machines, and
widely acclaimed by cotton growers and livestock farmers.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Removes Energy Minister, Takes Measures to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Sunday removed Energy and Mineral Resources Minister M.
Noor Uddin Khan as part of her move to streamline the country's
power supply system.
</P>
<P>
Noor Uddin Khan was made minister without portfolio, according
to a Cabinet Division circular issued on Sunday. The circular did
not give details.
</P>
<P>
No replacement has been announced so far, and Hasina is
expected to take over the charge of the energy minister for the
time being to solve the electricity problem, reports said.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting last week, Hasina expressed her
dissatisfaction over the performance of the Energy Ministry and
its failure to improve the power supply in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country has a power shortage of 450 megawatts everyday
against the minimum nationwide demand for 2200 megawatts,
according to officials with the Power Development Board (PDB). The
capital city of Dhaka alone is facing 170 to 180 megawatts of
shortage every day on average, against the peak hour demand of 625
megawatts, and as a result, power is cut off in many parts of the
city three or four times a day.
</P>
<P>
The government is under strong criticism for its failure to
solve the power crisis, and local business chambers, foreign
investors, organizations and ordinary residents have been strongly
demanding for a solution of the power crisis.
</P>
<P>
The PDP blamed the sudden fall in gas pressure, falling water
level and the closing down of some power generating units for
routine maintenance for the low power generation, leading to
massive loadshedding.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the PDB said the change in the Energy Ministry
would not help improve the situation of power supply. "It is not
the fault of the minister. We simply do not have the capacity of
generating adequate electricity to meet the growing demand," a
senior official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The power crisis is unlikely to end until the end of the year
when some power plants will be put into operation, PDB officials
said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to increase power supply, the government on Sunday
took a number of decisions to streamline the country's power
supply system, including the establishment of inter-agency
coordination, proper load management, reducing frequent
loadshedding and generation of additional electricity.
</P>
<P>
And a monitoring cell to supervise round-the-clock the power
situation across the country has been set up at the prime
minister's office, to be managed by the Armed Forces Division,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has given a directive to increase the
generation capacity of the existing power plants through proper
management and renovation, and has directed authorities concerned
to giver prior notice to the clients regarding timings of
loadshedding, according to the reports.

semi-conductor manufacturing equipment by the year 2000,
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of tariff on IT products will provide better
market access for Malaysia's exports, she told reporters after
opening a two-day workshop on "The implication of Uruguay Round
Agreement for international trade in technology-based products"
here.
</P>
<P>
As such, it would be beneficial for the Malaysian industry to
seek market opportunities for contract manufacturing, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said another area worth considering is in
developing niche products and downstream value-added applications
such as in software development.
</P>
<P>
"The industry needs to build its competitive advantage by
entering into joint-ventures and smart partnership that will
promote transfer of technology," she added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is an important trader in IT products, accounting for
about five percent share of the global IT trade. Its current
strength in the IT sector is in the area of component
manufacturing and assembly.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Malaysia's exports of IT related products totaled 79.6
billion ringgit (about 22.359 billion U.S. dollars) while imports
were 65.6 billion ringgit (about 18.427 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In order to further enhance its exports of IT products,
Malaysia became a signatory to the declaration of trade in IT
products or the Information Technology Agreement.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Used To Control Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwest China
has made remarkable progress in using World Bank loans to improve
soil erosion in the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province had brought an
840-square-kilometer area of soil erosion under control,
accounting for 65 percent of the planned coverage.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 an eight-year World Bank project was introduced into
the province, aimed at improving a 1,506-square-kilometer area of
soil erosion involving 578 million yuan of investment, of which 40
million U.S. dollars will be provided by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project covers six counties and cities with 4,300 square
kilometers and 510,000 people. By last year, 370 million yuan had
been spent on the project to increase 16,000 hectares of terraced
fields, 38,000 hectares of forests and 20,000 hectares of
grassland.
</P>
<P>
The Malian River watershed, one of the most serious
soil-erosion areas, is one example. Local farmers have raised
per-capita grain production from 383 kilograms to 410 kilograms
because of the improved environment and farmland.
</P>
<P>
Soil-erosion area amounted to more than 70 percent of the
640,000-square-kilometer Loess Plateau, depositing 1.6 billion
tons of silt into the Yellow River annually.

<HEADLINE> More Herdsmen Say Farewell to Nomadic Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 150,000 herdsmen and
their families in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have bid
farewell to a traditional nomadic way of life by settling down to
a fixed address.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 67 percent of the herding households in
Xinjiang, which is one of the five major pastoral regions of China.
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions on the vast grassland are severe, making the
life of a herdsman difficult, especially in winter. In 1986 the
autonomous region began to take measures to help settle the
nomadic population.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has earmarked funds to assist the
settlement scheme apart from providing preferential terms such as
tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has helped many herdsmen previously living in the
high mountains to find new houses on the plains.

exploration of mineral resources, which now are in the hands of
the central government.
</P>

Hainan has also pledged to let overseas investors enjoy the
same treatment enjoyed as local investors.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Teachers Abandon Jobs Due to Won's Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 30 (Xinhua) -- More employed foreigners teaching
English in South Korea are giving up their jobs as their pays have
sharply fallen in value resulting from the devaluation of the won
caused by the ongoing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, 126 of 856 foreign teachers, whose pays
stood at between 1.4 million won (about 1,000 U.S. dollars) and
1.8 million won (about 1,300 dollars) each month, quitted their
jobs in the economic crisis-engulfed country.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, the South Korean won has depreciated more
than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the country's per capita income down to 9,400
dollars from the previous year's 10,548 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and economists predicted that the nation's per capita
income will further drop to some 6,600 dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
All foreign teachers, whose contracts are to expire in July,
were hired by the nation as part of the efforts last year to
improve English education for the students of junior and senior
schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry originally planned to hire 1,200 foreign
teachers for English education this year.
</P>
<P>
But the number will have to be reduced due to the austerity
measures required by the International Monetary Fund, which agreed
last December to extend a rescue loan of 57 billion dollars to
South Korea in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange to Rate Advisers' Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) will launch a "credit rating" system for institutions
offering financial advisory services for listed companies, the
Bangkok Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The system is aimed at encouraging greater responsibility among
the financial institutions and investment banks involved, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
SET President Singh Tangtatswas said ratings would encourage
development of better quality services by financial institutions,
and indirectly lead to improved protection of investors.
</P>
<P>
Many listed firms have turned to local finance firms and
investment banks for advice on rehabilitation programs, debt
restructuring and raising new capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Singh, many companies had suffered damages from
poorly crafted, impractical rehabilitation plans suggested by
their advisers.
</P>
<P>
Under the "credit rating" system, if results of a
rehabilitation plan are found to be unsatisfactory, with
performance at, for example, just 20 percent of original forecast,
market regulators will order an immediate downgrade in the rating
of the adviser.
</P>
<P>
Regulators will also suggest that the Securities and Exchange
Commission withdraw the licenses of poorly rated firms, preventing
advisers from providing services to other listed firms in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Market officials will also warn firms seeking advisory services
or launching a new public offering to avoid financial institutions
with a poor rating.
</P>
<P>
The system is part of SET's efforts to encourage the
development of good governance among listed companies.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia-IMF Meeting Fails to Solve Private Sector's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The question of the private
sector's foreign debts remains unsolved as the talks between
Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the
country's economic reform entered the 12th day on Sunday, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, the question of the private sector's foreign
debts is the most difficult thing to solve. But I am sure it can
be solved soon. We are in constant contact with the IMF
headquarters in Washington, the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the
Japanese Finance Minister," Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December last year, Indonesia's foreign debts
totaled 137.424 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The talks have reached the final stage, but ways and means to
tackle the 74 billion dollar private debts have yet to reach a
conclusion, official Antara news agency Monday quoted the minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the private sector's foreign debts is
included in the five-point agenda discussed at the meeting to
review Indonesia's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In the last 12 days, both sides have been discussing corporate
debt, bank restructuring, budget and subsidies, monetary policy
and structural reform. "Talks on the other four areas are mostly
concluded...only some details remain," Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Indonesia proposed to follow the "Mexican Model" in
settling its private foreign debts. The IMF team led by its
Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss has agreed to the proposal in
principle.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah (national currency) has been under severe
pressure since July last year, plunging to its lowest level of
17,000 to the greenback in January, compared to 2,450 rupiah in
the pre-crisis period in July. It is trading at about 8,300 per
dollar now.
</P>
<P>
This has caused most indebted companies to become technical
bankrupt as their foreign debts surpass their equity.

the central mountain city of Kandy, which was damaged last January
by a Tamil rebel vehicle bomb, official sources here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The entrance, outer wall, roof and some other parts of the
temple sustained extensive damage due to the explosion, which
killed at least 17 people and injured many others.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of the Archeological Department Shiran
Deraniyagala was quoted as saying that the moonstone and other
portions of immense artistic, archeological and cultural value
were also destroyed by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
His department was doing all it could to restore all sections
destroyed in the explosion. Photographs of the damaged parts had
been presented to Indian Director General of Archeology Professor
Ravo for advice, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Assistance had similarly been sought from Germany.
</P>
<P>
The temple, where Sri Lanka Buddhists go to pay their homage to
the sacred relic believed to be belonging to the Buddha, is
regarded as one of the most important symbols of the island
country.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction work is estimated to take about two years to

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters have brought under
control the blazes that ravaged the Doi Inthanon National Park in
Chiang Mai, northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The fires have destroyed more than 17,000 rai (2,720 hectares)
of forest since March 20, according to the Nation newspaper on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Anuisidh Methawalalak, the park's chief, as
saying that small fires could continue for another two months but
firefighters could manage to handle the situation, with the
support of various agencies and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time that such serious fires have broken out
in the virgin forest at such a great altitude, where it is
normally saturated with moisture," Anuisidh said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fire-raged areas could partly recover naturally,
though some of the areas could take as long as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob, who directed the
fire control, said he had formed another 15 fire-monitoring units
in the park to help the 14 fire-control units already in
operation.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that hill-tribe people and members of the Northern
Farmers' Network (NFN) had deliberately set the fires in a bid to
expand their farmland.
</P>
<P>
But an NFN spokesman denied the charge, saying the fires were a
natural disaster partly caused by El-Nino.
</P>
<P>
Several fires have been reported in other parts of the country
and have destroyed large areas of forests. Some of the fires were
still raging.

by only 0.25 second. Her compatriot Claudia Pechstein got the
bronze in 1:57.30.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the second time that the three German ladies shone
at the worlds. They swept through the 3,000 meters on the first
day of the championships, with Niemann taking the gold, Pechstein
the silver and Friesinger the bronze.
</P>
<P>
While the three German speed skaters excelled in women's events,
the Dutches did an excellent job in men's 10,000 as well as 5,000
meters events.
</P>
<P>
Following Friday's gold and silver in men's 5,000 meters, the
Dutch demonstrated once again Sunday their strengths in men's
10,000 meters event.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic gold medalist Gianni Romme broke his own world
record of the 10,000 meters by 6.62 seconds, clocking 13:08.71.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, his compatriot Bob de Jong took the silver in
13:22.64, while Germany's Frank Dittrich got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The men's 1,000 meters seemed to be Canada's specialty.
Sylvain Bouchard sprinted to gold in 1:09.60, with 0.56 second
faster than the world record, which was set by his countryman
Jeremy Wotherspoon in the same Olympic Oval last year.
</P>
<P>
Wotherspoon lost his title by 0.07 second. He got the silver
while Japanese skater Hiroyasu Shimizu took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The three-day world championships ended on Sunday, with Germany
being the single biggest winner of medals here, raking in one
third of the 30 medals.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Canada ranked second, with each getting six
medals. They were followed by Japan, which won three medals,
including one gold.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Norway each took home one gold. Russia
won a silver, while Italy and Belgium got a bronze respectively.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Launch Windows 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft plans the worldwide
release of Windows 98, a new generation of its operating system,
in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In a recent visit to China Pieter Knook, vice president of
Microsoft's Far East Region, also revealed that the Chinese
version of Windows 98 is scheduled for release in the fall.
</P>
<P>
The delay in introducing Chinese versions of relevant
English-based software products has been reduced from the previous
two months to less than 40 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, last September we simultaneously launched both the
English and Chinese versions of Internet Explorer 4.0. in Los
Angeles and Beijing," Knook said.
</P>
<P>
In a preview held here Friday, technicians for the
U.S. software giant said the new product is mainly directed at
family users, as well as medium- or small-sized enterprises. The
new products, based on Windows 95 which was introduced three years
ago, can run faster and is more stable with a more powerful
systems management.
</P>
<P>
The '98 version has a seamless connection with the Internet,
which enables users to quickly surf the Net on the same interface.
</P>
<P>
The company has already distributed Beta testing copies for
professional users.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese is now one of the five major languages used by
Microsoft-developed software products," said Jia-Bin Duh,
president of Microsoft (China), adding that this indicates the
importance of the China market to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show China's software sales last year were
11.2 billion yuan, up 20.1 percent over 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Hotels in China are urged to grasp
the international trend and nurture a good enterprise culture in a
timely manner to meet future challenges.
</P>
<P>
China now has 5,000 tourism hotels, of which most were built to
cope with traditional tourism characteristic of large-scale,
package tours with low prices and standard services, said experts
at a recent hotel industry seminar here.
</P>
<P>
However, as the worldwide travel industry entered a new year,
tourists' needs are expected to become more diverse and spur a
demand for more variety in hotels.
</P>
<P>
As more tourists plan to visit China, international hotel
giants are preparing to enter the China market, which will
increase competition, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Facing new opportunities and challenges, we have a mixed
feeling of hope and anxiety," one expert said.
</P>
<P>
Hotel experts from 24 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities attended the seminar held in Haikou this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing welcomes Hong Kong
companies' participation in the restructuring of its state-owned
enterprises (SOE), said Yang Taiqi, vice director of the Municipal
Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
As the largest industrial center in southwest China, Chongqing
has established a modern enterprise system in 100 of its more than
300 large and medium SOEs and reformed other ailing SOEs through
mergers, bankruptcies and closures. The city plans to restructure
many medium and small SOEs with the help of overseas investment
and participation, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"Chongqing welcomes large Hong Kong companies to form
multinational companies with local large SOEs with sales exceeding
2-to-10 billion yuan each," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Medium and small enterprises in Hong Kong will also get the
opportunity to take part in restructuring local medium and small
enterprises by merger, shareholding, contracted operation and
joint investment.
</P>
<P>
The city especially needs investors to develop high-tech
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
With abundant labor resources, cheaper land than coastal areas
and a huge market potential with 30 million population, Chongqing
is an ideal place for investment, Yang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Anni Friesinger set a
world record in the women's 1,500 meters, becoming the first women
to smash the one minute 57 second barrier at the Speedskating
World Championships in Calgary, Canada, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Friesinger, who finished fifth in the same event at the Nagano
Olympics, clocked in 1:56.93, eclipising the old mark of 1:57.58
set by Marianne Timmer of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"My biggest problem is my starts so I knew I had to open fast
and I did," said Friesinger, a soldier in the German army. "To win
I knew it would take a world record but I didn't expect it would
be me."
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old, who started speed skating at the age of nine,
bettered her personal best by over two seconds.
</P>
<P>
Gianni Romme of the Netherlands rewrote his own world record in
13:08.71 in the men's 10,000m, over 6 seconds faster than his old
mark of 13:15.33.
</P>
<P>
Romme also set a world record in the men's 5,000m on the
opening day.
</P>
<P>
Japanese speedster Hiroyasu Shimizu also set three records in
two events over the final two days. After his double world records
Saturday, he clocked 1:09.83 in the men's 1,000m on Sunday. His
mark was just 10 minutes fresh before it was broken by Canada's

1,000m in a record time of 1:09.60, while runner-up and teammate

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Air Force Plane Crash Kills 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- At least twenty-eight people were
killed Sunday when a Peruvian Air Force cargo plane carrying more
than 50 people crashed in a shantytown in northern Peru, President
Alberto Fujimori said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty more passengers were injured in the crash, and 15 people
survived after the plane plunged into a canal and split in two,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The air force pilot, whose plane suffered engine problems,
narrowly avoided an otherwise much worse disaster by guiding the
aircraft over dozens of homes to crash-land in an irrigation
channel that ran through the center of the shantytown, Fujimori
said.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who was informed of the crash while on a visit to the
city of Trujillo, said he was told the pilot was unable to avert
the crash but was able to steer away from the inhabited areas by
operating the craft as a glider.
</P>
<P>
The plane was ferrying civilians between towns in northern Peru
because violent El Nino-driven storms had triggered floods and
mudslides, blocking some land routes.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who spoke in the nearby town of Trujillo, said some
surviving passengers were able to walk away from the crash
site. The plane's five-member crew survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
Teams of rescuers dragged bodies from the fuselage and
transported those injured in the crash to Piura's city hospital.
They also began to haul the plane's wreckage from the canal.

<P>
SOFIA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Bulgarian woman recently gave
birth to her 22nd child, making a record in the country's history,
reported the biggest Bulgarian newspaper, Dneven Trud, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Teventana Stefanova, a 38-year-old Gypsy woman living in the
Kisselevo suburb of the north Bulgaria city of Lom, got married at
the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
From then on, she has been giving birth at the rate of one
child one year.
</P>
<P>
Stefanova and her husband, together with their 15 kids, are now
living in a house without electricity and water. Their seven
grown-up children had left them to make a living by their own.
</P>
<P>
Due to a decline in birth rate and a rise in morality,
Bulgaria's population has been continuously dropping in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the Gypsy population still maintained a high birth
rate, with the past six years seeing some 12,000 Gypsy newborns,
or 20 percent out of the total of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Gypsy families are living in poverty as a result of
raising too many children.

<HEADLINE> ADB Lending Mostly Confines to Human Development, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 29 (Xinhua) -- President of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) Mitsuo Sato said Sunday that ADB's lending
to Pakistan will mostly confine to human development and poverty
alleviation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here at the end of his three-day
visit to Pakistan, Sato said that the Bank will extend all
possible cooperation and assistance to help Pakistan achieve
sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank will continue the way it can to help Pakistan in
social sector, particularly to alleviate poverty," said the ADB
president.
</P>
<P>
According to Sato, the lending program agreed with the
Pakistani government this month comprises five loans for a total
of 677 million U.S. dollars, of which 112 million dollars are from
the Asian Development Fund and 565 million dollars from ADB's
Ordinary Capital Resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that human development, with particular focus on gender
needs, remains the foremost priority of the Bank strategy for
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"This will be addressed through assistance to education,
health, population, and urban development," Sato added.
</P>
<P>
It is the policy of the Bank to provide assistance to those
countries which are making efforts to transform their economies
and Pakistan qualifies for that, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said on the occasion that ADB has
become the largest donor for Pakistan as the recent tranche of 600
million dollars is the biggest ever donation for one year.

the world number one ranking on Sunday by beating American Andre
Agassi 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 in the final of the Lipton Tennis
Championships at key Biscayne, Florida.

rankings and the 14th player to achieve number one status in the
25-year history of the ranking system.

<P>
Rios' victory Sunday ended Pete Sampras' 102 consecutive weeks
in the top spot. Sampras has been number one for a total of 218
weeks over his career.

<P>
Rios has won the BellSouth Open in Auckland in January and at
the Indian Wells event leading up to the Lipton. He also reached
the final of the Australian Open.

<P>
Both Agassi and Rios came to the final match with identical
24-3 records for the year.
</P>
<P>
Rios blasted 12 aces past Agassi and scored 48 outright winners
to Agassi's 25 in the one hour, 57 minute match.
</P>
<P>
Agassi pulled back from 4-1 down in the first set to even the
score at 4-4, but Rios's game was too strong for him.
</P>
<P>
In the final game of the first set, on Rios's fourth set point
of the game, Agassi double faulted to give the Chilean the lead
and from then, Rios was in charge of the match.
</P>
<P>
He broke Agassi's serve in the fourth game of the second set
and the seventh game of the third set to earn the straight sets
victory.

WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Marcelo Rios had the
greatest day of his life on Sunday when he beat Andre Agassi in
the Lipton tennis finals to claim the No. 1 spot in the world.
</P>
<P>
Rios had his near-flawless performance to outpower Agassi 7-5,
6-3, 6-4 as the Chilean and American fans traded chants in Key
Biscayne, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Currently ranked third, Rios will end Sampras' streak of 102
consecutive weeks atop the rankings on Monday, and become the
first South American to be No. 1 since the ATP rankings began in
1973.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was upset in the third round by Wayne Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, Rios was the second player to be ranked first
without winning a Grand Slam. The other was Ivan Lendl in 1983,
who went on to win eight majors.
</P>
<P>
The Lipton title was the most prestigious for Rios which
awarded him the first prize of 360,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
As hundreds of Chilean fans flocked to Florida, Rios had an
early lead of 3-0 before Agassi pulled back at 5-5 in the first
set.
</P>
<P>
As Agassi committed double faults, Rios fixed his eyes to taste
the No.1 spotting by winning a stretch of seven games later.

items in leading Australian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:

hopes that Australia can ride out both the Asia crisis and

The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's 40 billion Australian dollar (27.2 billion U.S.

insurance continue to push the system to a breaking point.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government will review guidelines on how
ministers disclose their financial interests after attacks on
Resources Minister Wrawick Parer. The government leader in the

members' interests contained "many ambiguities".
