<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
president Nelson Mandela Thursday met at his Johannesburg home
freed hostages Callie and Monique Strydom and their parents, the
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy that you are with us. What a trauma this was to
you, your family and all of us," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Callie and Monique were set free three weeks ago after having
been held hostages for more than four months by a Muslim rebel
group in the Philipino island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the two's return to freedom is bittersweet, as
one of those taken hostage with them, a Filipino dive instructor,
is still being held captive.
</P>
<P>
"I will appeal to the South African government and Libyan
leader Muammar Gadaffi to persuade the rebels to release him. His
wife is pregnant and it is really unfair that they release the
others and not him," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Gadaffi for the role he played in securing the two
South Africans' release.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Lebanon at Odds over Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Troubles seem to appear in
repatriating to Lebanon the 266 illegal immigrants, who were saved
from drowning Wednesday by Cyprus authority when their boat sank
off the western island.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants, mainly Iranians and Kurds, are now on
two Cyprus boats in the Limassol port, on the island's southern
coast.
</P>
<P>
According to local media Friday, Constantin Tabet, Lebanese
charge d'affaires in Nicosia, said that his country would not
accept the immigrants, as the Lebanese authorities have not yet
found the specific boat in its ship register, adding that there was
no evidence that the boat has sailed from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Interior Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou Friday said
he had asked for a Lebanese delegation to visit Cyprus to determine
the facts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the specific boat had sailed from Lebanon for
either Greece or Italy and that the Italian and Greek authorities
had been notified.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou noted that he had given instructions to the
Foreign Ministry to send a representation in writing to the
Lebanese charge d'affaires in Cyprus, accompanied with evidence and
documents.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Lebanon has to take its responsibilities, under an
agreement signed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral agreement signed between Cyprus and Lebanon last
year made provisions for the return of illegal immigrants if proved
their origin of departure.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou added that until the matter is settled, no illegal
immigrant would be allowed off the two boats they are restricted
on, and that they would all be boarded onto a larger boat, when
they will be ready to depart.
</P>
<P>
Tabet said he would try to convince his government to send a
representative to Cyprus within the next couple of days, to discuss
the problem and make an effort to solve it as soon as possible.

ADDIS ABABA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians are making use

<HEADLINE> Eastern, Southern African Region Has Safe Airspace: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- An official from the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Friday refuted
claims that it is not safe flying in the sky of the eastern and
southern African region.
</P>
<P>
The region has up to standard communication facilities and has
safe airspace, Lambert Ndiwaita, an officer of airdrome and ground
aids with the ICAO Eastern and Southern African region office
based in Nairobi, Kenya, was quoted by media here as saying.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the past when the region depended on land telephones,
almost all the countries in the region are now using the Vertical
Small Aperture Terminal satellite communication and have very high
frequency omni-directional range, he said while attending a five-
day international workshop on airdrome emergency planning in the
eastern and southern Africa region, which ended here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ndiwaita was reacting to a statement issued earlier by the
South African Pilot Association saying the airspace north of the
Limpopo River, which runs across South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe
and Mozambique, is not safe and therefore not worth flying through.
</P>
<P>
"In relation to the air traffic we have in the region, the
facilities available suits the safety purposes, we may need to
increase them in future when we have more traffic," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said there are many issues which should be considered before
establishing whether the airspace or airports are safe or not.
</P>
<P>
These include communication facilities, licensing pilots,
aircrew, air traffic controller authority, certification of air
worthiness inspectors and aviation security, he added.

<P>
In a resolution which was unanimously adopted, the Security
Council welcomed the intention of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to appoint a special representative who will be responsible
for all aspects of the United Nations work in fulfillment of the
mandate of the UNMEE.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested the secretary-general to
coordinate with the Organization of African Unity in the
implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the two countries to take whatever
action may be necessary to ensure the UNMEE's access, safety and
freedom of movement, and to provide the assistance, support and
protection required for the performance of its mandate in all
areas of its operation.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the parties to proceed immediately with
demining in order to ensure safety access of United Nations and
associated personnel to the areas being monitored.
</P>
<P>
It urged the parties to continue negotiations and conclude
without delay a comprehensive and final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cease-fire agreement in June
after two years of an intermittent border war which claimed tens
of thousands of lives and left more than a million people homeless.

<P>
Along with the leaders of the world's major powers, the city is
expecting about 10,000 persons to be on hand in various functions
at what is a major media event and showcase.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that on Friday the government
's man in charge of organization Achille Vinci Giacchi was in town
to look at the venues chosen for the summit meetings, the Ducal
Palace and the Cotton Warehouses.
</P>
<P>
According to Vinci Giacchi, a diplomat, "to imagine the G8 as
nothing but a meeting of the wealthy is an over-dramatization;
globalization is inevitable, and good for economic development,
but has less favorable aspects that need examination."
</P>
<P>
He also said the first thing would be to show that Genoa is a
welcoming city ready to discuss the issues raised by those wanting
to protest against the G8 and what it represents: "we'll do this
with a series of events we are currently working on. Then we will
have to find the venues needed for those who will be involved."

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains that have
been pelting Guatemala since Tuesday have caused the death of 15
people.
</P>
<P>
The downpour Thursday destroyed several homes in a
subdivisisonn of the Guatemalan capital, killing three children
and an old woman, said rescue workers.
</P>
<P>
The worst tragedy occurred in the northern department of Alta
Verapaz, some 350 kilometers north of Guatemalan City, where a

River and was dragged away by current.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday rescue workers recovered the bodies of eight men
and three women and continued to search for other two children and
two adults.
</P>
<P>
The rains have destroyed two bridges and dozens of houses,
leaving thousands of people homeless especially in the southern
coast and the Atlantic littoral.
</P>
<P>
The rains are the effect of a tropical system that moves in the
Caribbean region and will bring rains for another 48 hours,

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- As the water level in dams has fallen to the lowest
level of the last 30 years, Turkey is faced with an energy shortage
of some 6 billion kilowatt hours this year, reported Anatolia News
Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The energy shortage has worsened because the government's energy
plans couldn't be put into effect for the last two and a half
years, according to Yurdakul Yigitguden, undersecretary of the
Energy and Natural Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 29 projects should be put into effect as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The exchange market in Lebanon is stable and the U.S.
dollar exchange rate is fixed at 1,514 Lebanon pounds since early
2000, said Governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon Riad Salame.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no extra interference by the central bank in
the exchange rate and the interest rates are stable as well.
</P>
<P>
The bank's foreign reserves increased from 1 billion U.S.
dollars seven years ago to 7 billion dollars at present, said the
governor.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The Central Bank of Morocco announced that its net
foreign reserves shrank from 5.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
1999 to 5 billion dollars at the end of July, down by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of dirham will lead to higher prices of the
imported essential commodities, as the case of oil prices,
economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
The problem was triggered by the continued decrease of the
European single currency euro against the U.S. dollar, said a bank
analyst.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The value of Tunisia's exports of phosphate and its
products in the first seven months of 2000 reached 399.3 million
dinars (287.3 million U.S. dollars), up by 4.72 percent from that
of the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The value of Tunisia's imports of phosphate and its products
amounted to 134.1 million dinars (96.47 million dollars), up by 30.
33 percent from that of the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Thus the trade balance registered a surplus of 265.2 million
dinars (190.79 million dollars) compared with a surplus of 280.7
million dinars (200.9 million dollars)in the same period of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Side Returns to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has decided to return to the fourth round of U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks in New York Friday after a two-day
absence, the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said, through his spokesman, that he is not looking for
excuses to leave the dialogue because such a move would perpetuate
the division of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's statement, issued as the
Cyprus talks opened Tuesday, raised concerns among the Greek
Cypriot side with regard to references stressing the need for
explicit recognition of the equal status of the island's two
Cypriot communities in the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou, who is also in New
York, said "all unclear references, everything that could have been
exploited by the Turkish side, have been fully annulled and
revoked."
</P>
<P>
He said that Clerides has received assurances, through public
statements and in private, that the negotiations will continue
strictly within the framework of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolutions defined political equality not as numerical
equality but sufficient representation in the governance of the
federal state which will emerge from the talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the tiny Mediterranean island in the wake of a
failed coup in Nicosia seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island with
a bicommunal bizonal federation formula, but all efforts have been
so far failed.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been held
since last December, in an effort to find a way for a Cyprus
solution. The fourth round of talks are underway in New York.

<HEADLINE> Angola Calls for Aid to Continue Landmine Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government Friday
appealed to the international community for continued assistance
to help clear the large number of landmines across the country,
Angola's official news agency Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the countries in the world with the largest
number of planted landmines. During the 25-year civil war between
the government troops and rebels led by Jonas Savimbi, some 11
million landmines were planted in the country, with a population
of only 12 million.
</P>
<P>
According to Rolando Neto, Angola's delegate to the Second
International Conference on Anti-personnel Landmines currently
held in Geneva, some 15,000 of the mines were already removed
during the period from 1996 to the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This covered more than 5,000 kilometers of road and 8,000
square kilometers of land, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said despite the efforts and progress made by the
Angolan government in clearing landmines, the bulk of them still
remain underground and there were 1,117 people wounded or killed
during 735 landmine explosions over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sees Palestinian Proposal Not Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel said Friday
that the proposal made by the Palestinian side for Islamic
sovereignty over holy places in Jerusalem did not look promising.
</P>
<P>
Acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami made the
statement after meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Al-Khalil at the United Nations in the morning. It is Israel's
first official reaction to the proposal which Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat put to U.S. President Bill Clinton on September 6.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Ben-Ami said, "It doesn't matter to us
very much if it is Palestinian or Islamic. It's the same, so the
idea doesn't look as a real starter for a solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are interested but we have not yet seen an
Israeli readiness to accept it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said the idea was an alternative to exclusive
Palestinian sovereignty over the holy places, the traditional
demand of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
"We are reviewing all the core issues and looking into the
positions of the other side, and the other side is looking at our
positions. We will see how we proceed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been trying to mediate a solution to the
Jerusalem dispute. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Middle East envoy Dennis Ross held meetings with the two sides in
New York Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ross will see both sides again Friday and Albright will see the
Palestinian negotiators later in the day.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces
eliminated 10 militants and detained 20 others suspected of
involving in rebel armed groups during new operations in Chechnya
Friday, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces killed four rebels planting landmines in the
Chechen capital of Grozny and captured another four gunmen, the
Itar-Tass news agency cited the press center of the Russian
Combined Groupings in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Six suspects were arrested in the Urus-Martan district, among
them a subordinate of rebel field commander Sagarayev, whose band
has been involved in a number of terrorist bombings, said the
press center.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal units conducted a number of successful
operations against the rebels in the republic's mountains, killing
three militants near the Sharo-Argun river, who were driving a
herd of horses carrying weapons, said the press center.
</P>
<P>
After Friday's operations, Russian servicemen found three dead
men, identified as armed gangsters, at a graveyard in the Shatoi
district. Now the federal is searching for wounded rebels in the
area, the press center said.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces also destroyed two cashes of ammunition,
tents, rebel shelters, and two cross-country vehicles, it added.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Chechnya has remained tense since Moscow
announced the breakaway republic was liberated several months ago.
The Russian military has repeatedly said that rebel remnants in
small groups had kept trying to interrupt the normalization of the
population's life and striving to draw local residents in various
destructive activities.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the reports of rising fresh clashes between Russian
troops and the Chechen separatists have appeared more frequently
in Russian media, bringing about increasing fear that the
guerrilla war by rebels is getting intensive and may take some
effect.

<HEADLINE> Nicosia Irked by Annan's Statement on Equality of Two Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The political parties in
Cyprus have been expressing their indignation over a statement made
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday in which he
referred to the "political equality" of the two Cypriot sides on
the island.
</P>
<P>
In his statement during separate meetings with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, Annan
talked about the "equal status" of the two parties on the divided
Mediterranean island, which must be recognized explicitly in a
comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
The statement, made on the first day of the fourth round of U.N.
-sponsored proximity talks, triggered great controversy and kept
Clerides, leader of the Greek Cypriots, away from the talks for
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the National Council, the top advisory body to the
president on the Cyprus issue, continued Friday its marathon
session in New York on development in the proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Rally party branded Annan's statement as "
unfortunate." And the socialist Kisos Movement said the U.N. chief,
instead of upholding U.N. decisions, sought to "promote
unacceptable Turkish demands, obviously with the encouragement of
the Americans and Britain."
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party's parliamentary spokesman Tassos
Papadopoulos termed the statement as a bad development. He
suggested the Greek Cypriot side ignore Annan's "conclusions" and
continue to cite U.N. resolutions as a basis for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister George Iacovou criticized in particular
the reference to the "new partnership" and absence of the word "
communities" in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators here claimed that it was a clear attempt
by Annan, with the backing of Britain and the Americans, to
introduce confederation on the island.
</P>
<P>
They believed that Annan, by going out of his way to stress that
each Cypriot leader represented his own side and no one else,
appeared to be bowing to the oft-repeated Denktash demand.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed coup
seeking union with Greece. The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally
declared a republic in northern Cyprus in 1983, which is only
recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks have been held and
the fourth round is underway in New York to pave the way for
substantive negotiations to reach a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>

So far the Turkish Cypriot side has been refusing to negotiate
face-to-face with the Greek Cypriot side unless its breakaway
regime is recognized.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side has expressed welcome to Annan's statement,
local media reported Friday.
</P>

Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit considered Annan's
statement as a positive step. "So far we have been stressing the
principle that there are two separate states in Cyprus. This fact
gradually began to be accepted," he said.

For his part, Denktash said Annan's statement "has stolen all my
ideas."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Loans to Fight AIDS in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Directors of the
World Bank has agreed to commit an initial amount of 500 million U.
S. dollars over next three years as part of its approved Multi-
Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued by Zambia country office of
the bank on Friday, the first two countries to benefit from the
program are Ethiopia and Kenya, which will receive 59.7 million
dollars and 50 million dollars respectively in soft loans from the
International Development Association.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the two countries, several other countries including
Zambia have already requested the bank to support their ongoing
response to the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The bank expects many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to
seek support under the MAP in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS now poses the paramount threat to the development
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly 25 million Africans are living with
HIV/AIDS, the vast majority of whom are adults, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for more than 70 percent of all HIV/
AIDS cases globally, and is the only region where women living
with HIV/AIDS outnumber men, it added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 15 million people in Africa have died
of AIDS, with devastating social and economic impact.
</P>
<P>
While imposing an unsustainable and mounting burden on
households, firms and the public sector, the epidemic is costing
the region close to 1 percent of its economic growth each year,
said the bank.

KAMPALA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,793 juveniles,
mostly school children, have been involved in road accidents in
Uganda over the last three years, the newly released police
traffic statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, 1,543 juveniles, most of them as pedestrians,
were involved in road accidents, and 217 of these children were
killed by speeding motorists, while 62 died as passengers in
vehicles involved in motor accidents.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also indicate that another 838 were seriously
injured and 381 sustained slight injuries.
</P>
<P>
The figures escalated last year compared to the 1,267 children

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Friday met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee at the White House to discuss issues of mutual concern,
including trade, nuclear non-proliferation, environmental
protection and regional security.
</P>
<P>
"India and the United States have forged a bond," Clinton told
reporters before the meeting. "Our challenge is to turn our common
bond into common achievements."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, who arrived here after attending the United Nations
Millennium summit in New York on a reciprocal visit to Clinton's
India trip in March, responded that "this is a time of new hope
and new opportunities in Indo-American ties."
</P>
<P>
Clinton had earlier greeted the 73-year-old Indian prime
minister with a ceremonial welcome on the White House South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will first have a 40-minute private talk,
followed by an additional 30 minutes accompanied by top aides from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
As Vajpayee has been suffering from a knee ailment, a joint
press conference scheduled later Friday was canceled at the Indian
side's request.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee began his four-day official visit Thursday by
addressing a joint session of the U.S. Congress. U.S. Vice

<HEADLINE> Canada's Central Bank to Change Way of Setting Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's central bank will
adopt a U.S.-style system later this year to control inflation by
setting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Bank of Canada rate is adjusted whenever
Governor Gordon Thiessen sees fit while, under the new system, the
bank will schedule eight policy meetings throughout the year to
decide on interest rates, The Globe and Mail newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The system is similar to the one employed by central banks in
the United States, the European Union, Britain and Japan, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Thiessen and other Bank of Canada officials are in Calgary this
week for a meeting of the bank's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
The bank governor said Thursday that the dates of the eight
policy meetings haven't been determined.
</P>
<P>
"The scheduling of these eight dates would be based on the
timing of the flows of economic information that the bank relies
on to gauge the economic situation in Canada," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence in the new system, saying it "
would improve the implementation and the effectiveness of monetary
policy in Canada as well."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Expansion of U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Friday
that it would continue to support an expansion of the United
Nations Security Council in both categories of its membership.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the
General Assembly, Syed Hamid Albar, minister of foreign affairs of
Malaysia, said any expansion in the permanent category should
include both industrialized and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
If there is no agreement on expansion of the permanent
membership, the council should be enlarged for the time being in
the non-permanent category, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"A central objective of a reform of the Security Council should
be to ensure its effectiveness in the maintenance of international
peace and security," the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"Equally important is the need to enhance the council's unity
of purpose among its members, especially the permanent members, so
as to avoid the situation that necessitated the taking of
international action outside of the council by NATO, as in the
case of Kosovo, when the council was unable to act," the foreign
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the special circumstances of Kosovo, future
international interventions should be made only with the expressed
approval of the U.N. Security Council, in the interest of
preserving the role and authority of the council as enshrined in
the Charter of the United Nations, as well as in ensuring the
legality and legitimacy of all such actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the work of the Security Council that should
be thoroughly reviewed relates to the imposition of sanctions on
member states which have often brought untold sufferings on the
general populace, particularly women and children, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions regimes of the future should be established only when
absolutely necessary and should be specifically targeted, time-
bound, subject to regular review and lifted when no longer
necessary, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
confirmed Friday its commitment to help Ukraine overcome its
difficulty in energy supply after the definite closure of the
Chernobyl nuclear center in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique with Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma who
is on a visit here, French President Jacques Chirac said that the
EU will provide 430 million euros (370 million U.S. dollars) of
aid to Ukraine to help it close the Chernobyl nuclear center.
</P>
<P>
"We confirmed our commitment concerning the implementation of
the protocol of agreement reached by the Group of Seven countries,
the Commission of the European Union and Ukraine on the closure of
the Chernobyl nuclear center and other questions connected," said
the communique.
</P>
<P>
France is the current presidency state of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU praised the Ukrainian government for its reform of the
country's energy sector, including privatizing distribution
companies, improving payment of imported products, increasing
independence of authorities in charge of nuclear problems, and
seeking better efficiency in energy uses.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will continue to help Ukraine in financing the
establishment of capacities of (energy) substitution and other
projects in the energy field with the least cost," said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued after a summit meeting at the Elysee
presidential palace between Jacques Chirac and Kuchma.

<HEADLINE> United Arab Emirates Affirms Solidarity With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab
Emirates Friday affirmed its solidarity with the Palestinian
people and their leadership, represented by the Palestinian
Authority, in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi, minister of
foreign affairs of the United Arab Emirates, said the Middle East
peace process witnessed important developments recently during
which major efforts were exerted with the objective of arriving at
equitable and fair solutions based on the resolutions of the
United Nations and the principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Despite all those efforts and all the flexible and constructive
proposals put forward by the Palestinian side for finding a
comprehensive and just solution to the Palestine issue in all its
aspects, the Israelis persisted in its positions of
procrastination, delay and stalling and not abiding by its
undertakings in the agreements it has concluded with the
Palestinian side, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister renewed the call to the cosponsors of the
Middle East peace process and the other effective states, and in
particular the United Sates, to continue exerting the political
and diplomatic efforts that support and promote the negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israeli sides with the aim of finding
a just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestine issue.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the foreign minister reaffirmed his country's
unceasing support for Syria in its efforts to regain the territory
of the Syrian Arab Golan up to the line existing on June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to demand that Israel
resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the basis of the
relevant United Nations resolutions, in the interest of attaining
peace, stability and growth for all the states and peoples of the
region.

<HEADLINE> Kursk Disaster Cause Still Vague: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian governmental
commission on the accident of the submarine Kursk sinking in the
Barents Sea on August 12 has rejected 11 original explanations for
the disaster, but still cannot conclude what caused the tragedy
indeed, Russian Deputy Premier Ilya Klebanov said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
There remain three possible reasons to be further inquired, but
none of them can be directly corroborated now, Klebanov, who is
also the chairman of the commission, told a hearing at the State
Duma, lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
One explanation presumes that the submarine hit a World War II
mine, the second is that the Kursk collided with another submarine,
and the third is that an explosion took place inside the submarine
's torpedo compartment.
</P>
<P>
Russia has asked Western countries to examine their submarines
that were in the Barents Sea in August when the Kursk submarine
sank, but received no answer, Klebanov told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
He said it is "most likely" that the tapping from the Kursk
heard in the first days after the sinking was produced by a
mechanical device, not by humans.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to simulate the third situation at a testing ground
have so far failed. Sabotage and errors on the part of the crew
were rejected as possible causes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although the radiation background in the Barents Sea is normal,
the submarine must be raised "for various reasons," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He attributed "inconsistencies in reporting the disaster" to
the overwhelming amount of incoming information, especially during
the first three days after the sinking, and an inability to sort
it out.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reiterates Support for Cyprus Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Greece and the rest of the international community, the
only legal authority on Cyprus was the Cyprus Republic and no one
would allow the recognition of the Turkish Cypriot regime led by
Rauf Denktash, said Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas at
a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Reppas was referring to the controversial statement made by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday afternoon as the two
communities on Cyprus began their fourth round of the U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
Annan said in his statement that the equal status of the parties
must and should be recognized explicitly in the comprehensive
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Cyprus issue as being in a crucial phase, Reppas
said that Athens backed the efforts of the Cypriot government for
the solution of the Cyprus problem and was waiting for Annan's
response with regard to his statement before it decided its
position.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou exerted
pressures on Clerides, who is now hesitating whether Nicosia
should continue such talks with the Turkish Cypriot side or not.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been deadlocked for many years primarily over
the refusal of Denktash to meet directly with Clerides or to
discuss substantive issues unless northern Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus have insisted that Cyprus must be reunited in
a federation formula in line with the U.N. resolutions, but Turkey
and northern Cyprus demand that a confederation formed by two
sovereign states be set up on the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) has criticized Annan's
statement and urged the Greek government to firmly support
Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Former Greek Defense and Education Minister Gerassimos Arsenis
Friday called on Athens to help Cyprus maintain a firm stance
against multiple pressures.
</P>
<P>
Describing Annan's statement as "provocative and unacceptable,"
Arsenis warned that to accept Annan's recommendation to continue
Cyprus proximity talks on this basis would be extremely dangerous
for the future of Greece in general since legalizing northern
Cyprus would turn Cyprus into a Turkish protectorate and open up
new fronts in the Aegean Sea and the northeastern Greek region of
Thrace.

foreign ministers of the Group of 77, being held at the U.N.

</P>
<P>
With the support, the United Nations can persuade
industrialized nations to open more their markets to developing-
country products, reverse the decline of development aid, cancel
the debts of poor countries and accept a more equitable process
for arbitrating or mediating in disputes between creditors and
debtors, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Only as an efficient, open and flexible organization can the
United Nations hope to influence the course of globalization," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking high of the April Havana South summit, Annan said that
the recent U.N. Millennium Summit Declaration had reproduced many
points from the Group of 77 Havana Declaration, which focuses on
poverty, disease, violence, transnational crime and environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that "the cry of anguish" of developing countries on
the impact of globalization "did not go unheard."

<HEADLINE> Twenty Killed In Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Twenty people including 14
so-called militants and three Indian soldiers were killed since
Thursday evening in Kashmir, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an official spokesman as saying that gunmen
abducted a local leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party,
Ilyas Ahmad Pir, on the outskirts of Srinagar last night and took
him to unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
Four militants were killed in two separate encounters with
local security forces in frontier district of Kupwara Thursday
evening, from whom four AK assault rifles and some ammunition were
recovered, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
An local policeman was killed and another seriously wounded
when militants attacked a police party posted on guard at a shrine
in Baramulla district last night.
</P>
<P>
Two Indian soldiers and a defense committee member in the area
also lost their lives in the encounter, PTI said, adding militants
had triggered a series of blasts enroute to their hideout where
the encounter took place.
</P>
<P>
Indian troops shot dead four militants in Poonch District on
Friday in a gun battle, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the insecurity in the area, authorities in Indian-
controlled Kashmir issued orders Thursday for construction of 1000
household bunkers and 100 community bunkers in the shelling prone
areas of border districts of Baramulla and Kupwara, an official
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the household bunkers would be done at the
cost of 20,000 rupees (near 435 U.S. dollars) by beneficiaries
themselves who would be paid 17,445 rupees (about 380 dollars) in
three installments, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The community bunkers would cost 35000 rupees (760 dollars), he
said, adding that, in all, 50 million rupees (108,700 dollars)
would be spent on the construction of the bunkers in the first
phase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government alerted all states today to
take suitable security precautions in the wake of intelligence
inputs on the movement of about 100 militants with arms and
explosives from Pakistan to carry out bomb blasts across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Home Affairs asked all state governments to
follow a "strong security drill" against the devious plans of
terrorist groups to target vulnerable places.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the ministry said the ministry had asked the state
government to maintain a "very close and careful eye" on all kinds
of subversive forces through "regular patrolling, surprise checks
and close interaction and coordination among all concerned
agencies" to monitor, check and cross-check all developments and
anticipated events on a strong note of urgency.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial
production increased 0.3 percent in August after revised figures
showed it was flat in July, the Federal Reserve reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Fed estimated one month ago the industrial production
increased 0.4 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output inched up 0.1 percent in both July and
August, a slower rate than in the first half of the year, when
increases in manufacturing production averaged a little more than
0.5 percent per month. Mining output was unchanged in August,
while production at utilities surged 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Capacity utilization for total industry rose 0.1 percentage
point to 82.3 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since

A spate of economic reports indicate the Fed's rate increases are
working, leading many economists to predict that the central bank
will avoid raising rates for the rest of the year.

In another report, the Commerce Department said that businesses

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Fall 0.1 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer prices
fell 0.1 percent in August as a sharp drop in energy costs swamped
higher prices for clothes, prescription drugs and other items, the
Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.1 percent decline in the Consumer Price Index, the most
closely watched inflation gauge, was a better showing on inflation
than many analysts expected. They predicted that prices would
actually rise. In July, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In August, energy prices fell by 2.9 percent, the best showing
since February 1991. That decrease was led by gasoline prices,
which fell a huge 6 percent, also the biggest drop since February
1991. Natural gas prices dropped 0.7 percent, the largest decline
since December 1999. Fuel-oil prices fell by a slim 0.1 percent
and electricity prices showed no change.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose 0.2 percent, the biggest gain since June.
Higher prices for vegetables, pork and beef overwhelmed lower
prices for poultry.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation rose for the fifth month in a row by a modest 0.
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 3.4 percent, compared with a 2.7 percent increase for all
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The pickup has come from higher energy costs, a result of
production limits by oil-producing nations. In the first eight
months of this year, energy prices rose at an annual rate of 14.3
percent, compared with a 13.4 percent advance for all of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Expansion of U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Friday
that it would continue to support an expansion of the United
Nations in both categories of its membership.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the
General Assembly, Syed Hamid Albar, minister of foreign affairs of
Malaysia, said any expansion in the permanent category should
include both industrialized and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
If there is no agreement on expansion of the permanent
membership, the council should be enlarged for the time being in
the non-permanent category, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"A central objective of a reform of the Security Council should
be to ensure its effectiveness in the maintenance of international
peace and security," the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"Equally important is the need to enhance the council's unity
of purpose among its members, especially the permanent members, so
as to avoid the situation that necessitated the taking of
international action outside of the council by NATO, as in the
case of Kosovo, when the council was unable to act," the foreign
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the special circumstances of Kosovo, future
international interventions should be made only with the expressed
approval of the U.N. Security Council, in the interest of
preserving the role and authority of the council as enshrined in
the Charter of the United Nations, as well as in ensuring the
legality and legitimacy of all such actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the work of the Security Council that should
be thoroughly reviewed relates to the imposition of sanctions on
member states which have often brought untold sufferings on the
general populace, particularly women and children, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions regimes of the future should be established only when
absolutely necessary and should be specifically targeted, time-
bound, subject to regular review and lifted when no longer
necessary, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Directive For Measuring Standardization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Friday that it has adopted a proposal for a directive on measuring
instruments in a bid to ensure consumer protection and improve the
European single market.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's (EU) executive arm said the measuring
instruments are of EU-wide significance. The concerned instruments
include taxi-meters, petrol pump counters, breath-alyzers, water-,
gas- and electricity-meters and automatic weighing instruments
used in production lines for pre-packed products.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for Enterprise Erkki Liikanen said the draft
has been widely discussed with EU member states, business sectors,
users, consumers and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
"By guaranteeing certainty of measurement and alignment with
international standards, it opens a large market to manufacturers
in and outside the European Union," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representing a significant simplification, the legal proposal
will replace 11 existing directives and many laws at the national
level.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposal is intended to improve EU's internal market
and to ensure the protection of consumers and trust between
parties in transactions.
</P>
<P>
It will also give manufacturers a choice of conformity
assessment procedures and allow them to fully benefit from
technology progress and international standardization work, the EU
executive said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, UNTAET to Cooperate in Bordering Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (
UNTAET) Friday signed an agreement on cooperation to settle the
problems on the border areas between Indonesia and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, called Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), was
signed in Bali, Indonesia, by Indonesian Coordinating Minister for
Political, Social and Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
and UNTAET Chief Sergio De Millo, reports reaching here Friday
evening said.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the MoU is one of the efforts made by Indonesia,
the UNTAET and all international community to end the problems
taking place along the border areas, especially the refugee
problem in East Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia," said Susilo.
</P>
<P>
With the aim to coordinate each step among the concerned
parties, especially for Indonesian government to respond to U.N.
Security Council 1319 Resolution, the MoU stipulates that it is a
common responsibility for the Indonesian government, the UNTAET
and other sides to settle the conflicts along the border areas as
well as the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
During the closed-door meeting which was attended by some
Indonesian senior officials and UNTAET chief and East Timorese
leader Xanana Gusmao, Susilo said, the participants also discussed
the refugee issue and held that concrete steps should be taken for
the security along the border area.
</P>
<P>
Many conflicts between U.N. peacekeeping forces in East Timor
and pro-Jakarta East Timorese militiamen have been taken place
along the border areas in recent months, killing and injuring some
U.N. peacekeepers
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET has alleged that intensified activities on the
border was supported by and involved the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, a mob of pro-Jakarta East Timorese militia
attacked and burned the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
Office in Atambua, a city of East Nusa Tenggara province of
Indonesia, killing three of the U.N. agency's relief workers.
</P>
<P>
On September 8, the U.N. passed its Resolution No. 1319, urging
the Indonesian government to disarm and disband the militias in
Indonesia. It also urged the Indonesian government to take
measures to end violence in west Timor where 130,000 East Timorese
refugees still remain.

killed in the police-guerrillas clashes during the last four years,
said Nepali Home Ministry Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 273 civilians, 208 police and 979 guerrillas members

Joshi said the government is ready to hold talks with the
guerrillas and has started basket funding programs in the

activities in the areas.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Needed for Return of Afghan Refugees: UNHCR Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Ms. Sadako Ogata Friday said
international aid for Afghan refugees has decreased and efforts
should be made to create "sustainable return conditions" for them.
</P>
<P>
There are some 2.6 million Afghan refugees still inhabiting in
Pakistan and Iran and they want to return to their homes, Ogata
told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"We will explore the possibility for their return home, even to
create those conditions for the repatriation," said the UNHCR
chief.
</P>
<P>
Many Afghan refugees would like to go back but this is not
happening as the conditions in Afghanistan are bad, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata urged Pakistan to maintain the compassionate attitude
towards the refugees. "Protect them who need protection," she
added.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR chief is on a tour here which will also take her to
Kabul and Tehran in next couple of days. The basic purpose of her
visit, she said, was to ensure the continued asylum and protection
of Afghan refugees as long as conducive conditions were not
created for their return.
</P>
<P>
Afghan refugee problem is a "very serious issue the
international community should not be inattentive to," said Ogata.
</P>
<P>
To a question, she said, the international community needed
more assurances on the "objectives of Taliban and their policy on
women, education and health. And how they manage the humanitarian
and human rights issue."
</P>
<P>
During her visit to Afghanistan, Ogata said, she will
definitely take up the issue of women with the Taliban authorities.
She said their policy on women was one of the strong causes
hampering their recognition by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who arrived here Thursday, held meetings with Pakistan
President Rafiq Tarar and Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf
earlier Friday to discuss the issue of Afghan refugees.

<HEADLINE> Former EU Commissioner Criticizes French Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Former European Commissioner
Karel Van Miert has criticized the French government over its
unilateral solution to truck protesters' demands against rising
fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert blamed the French government for causing its European
Union (EU) partners some serious troubles, local press reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was improper for the French government to unilaterally
reduce duty on diesel fuel under pressure from its truck drivers,
he was quoted by the press.
</P>
<P>
The former EU official from Belgium said that France should
have called a meeting of relevant EU ministers instead of caving
in immediately and causing its European partners the widespread
fuel crisis.
</P>
<P>
Noting that France is holding the EU presidency, Van Miert said
the European Commission could have done more such as urging the
French government to take a European initiative though the EU
executive arm has little to say in transport policy.
</P>
<P>
Angry Belgian truckers followed French haulage workers this
week to blockade some majors roads and ports as well as oil depots
in the country to protest the steep rise in fuel prices. They
hoped to gain the same result as French truckers from government
concessions.
</P>
<P>
The country's main employers' federation VBO estimated that the
five-day protests cost Belgium 10 billion Belgian francs (215
million U.S. dollars) daily.
</P>
<P>
The protesters caused traffic chaos and forced several
businesses and schools to close. Emergency services were warned of
serious consequences if the blockades continued.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor to Visit Russia Later This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder will pay a one-day visit to Moscow on September 25, the
Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the German chancellor's short visit was
reached last week when Russian President Vladimir Putin and
Schroeder met at the Millennium Summit in New York, Interfax cited
diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Moscow, Schroeder will meet with the Russian
president and take part in an official lunch. No other plans for
the chancellor's trip have been made known so far.
</P>
<P>
The sources confirmed that the agreement on Schroeder's planned
visit to Russia at the beginning of January 2001, which was
reached at the Russian-German summit in Berlin, still stands.
</P>
<P>
Before Schroeder's September visit to Moscow, a session of the
Russian-German high-level group for strategic issues on bilateral
financial and economic cooperation will be held in Moscow on
September 18, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the session, the German side will be represented by Deputy
Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weiser, Deputy Economy Minister Axel
Gerlach, Deputy Foreign Minister Wolfgang Ischinger and Klaus
Mangold, a member of the board of governors of the Daimler-
Chrysler concern, they disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-German group for strategic issues was created under
accords reached at the Russian-German Berlin summit in June.
</P>
<P>
Another Interfax report said that Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov will visit Berlin later, probably in mid-November, and the
decision was made by Ivanov and his German counterpart, Joschka
Fischer, during their meeting in New York on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Low-Income Families in Belgium to Get Energy Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government will
issue energy vouchers to low-income families in a bid to help them
face financial difficulties caused by rising fuel prices, the
local press said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Charles Picque said the government
has decided to compensate families on the first 1,000 liters of
heating oil purchased. This means all families under a gross
income of 750,000 Belgian francs (16,129 U.S. dollars) will
receive five Belgian francs per liter of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The energy vouchers will be issued in the coming weeks. Some
600,000 Belgian families are expected to benefit from the new
measures.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government has also adopted another measure to help
low-income families. Belgian Social Integration Minister Johan
Vande Lanotte said his ministry is urging all oil companies to
contribute at least one billion Belgian francs (21.5 million
dollars) toward measures to cushion the spiraling price of heating
fuel among low-income households.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the economic affairs minister asked oil companies to
contribute at least 300 million Belgian francs (6.45 million
dollars), which the social integration minister felt was not
enough.
</P>
<P>
Vande Lanotte said oil multinationals have made huge profits,
so the only fair option for them is to make more contributions.

<HEADLINE> France to Reinforce Troops in Cote d'Ivoire Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- France will reinforce troops in
the capital of Cote d'Ivoire, Abidjan, reported Agence France-
Presse (AFP) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted the French ambassador in Abidjan Francis Lott as
saying that he has informed the leader of Cote d'Ivoire's military
junta, General Robert Guei, of France's plan to reinforce troops
in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that the reinforcement is "nothing particular" and
conforms to the French-Ivoirian agreements on defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The number of French troops stationed in the city will increase
from 510 to 680, according to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The move is apparently connected with Cote d'Ivoire's
presidential election next month, during which conflicts could
take place between the supporters of the junta and the oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Cote d'Ivoire were strained
recently after France asked General Guei not to run for the
presidency while letting all the oppositions join the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The military junta came to power in last December in a coup
d'etat which overthrew President Henri Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
Bedie, who is living in exile in Paris, said last month that he
will return to his country as a presidential candidate.

OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada is moving to toughen
anti-gang laws and give police special powers to combat organized
crime.

Federal Justice Minister Anne McLellan told reporters in
Calcary Thursday that she has asked her deputy minister to invite
Quebec officials for urgent discussions on the province's proposal

McLellan was responding to mounting calls for action following
Wednesday's assassination attempt at Montreal crime reporter

bullets.

The veteran journalist is reported in stable condition in
hospital after undergoing surgery to remove the bullets from his
body.

"It could be bikers or the Mafia or another criminal gang,"
said a colleague working with Le Journal de Montreal.

McLellan reaffirmed the country's determination to crack down
on organized crime after Monday's meeting of federal, provincial
and territorial justice ministers, who decided to create a
steering committee of deputy ministers to combat crime gangs.

PRAGUE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's gross
domestic product (GDP) rose by 3.1 percent in the first half of
this year, demonstrating a trend of continuing economic recovery,
the Czech Statistical Bureau said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the second quarter was slightly higher than the
expected 1.9 percent, but much lower than the growth of 4.4
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The growth was primarily a result of rising domestic demand,
the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The statistical bureau said all indicators showed that the
country's economy was growing and it might raise its forecast for
the country's GDP growth from 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent for the
full year of 2000.

<HEADLINE> French Finance Minister Defends Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy,
Finance and Industry Laurent Fabius on Friday defended the role
played by the euro since its launching last year while expressing
his concern about the turbulence in the exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the single currency published Friday, Fabius
said that France, which holds the rotating presidency of the
European Union, is concerned by "the present turbulence in the
markets" of exchange.
</P>
<P>
"In Versailles, a very clear message has been sent. This
message has not lost its validity," he said in reference to the
communique by the finance ministers of the 11 euro zone countries
last weekend in Versailles outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers said that they were ready to intervene in
the market to support the euro at any moment.
</P>
<P>
Fabius also said that people should not doubt that euro "has
been a success" since its launching in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It has played the role of protecting shield against the
monetary turbulence linked with the crises in Asia and Russia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the interest rates in Europe are lower
than in the United States because of the euro.
</P>
<P>
"How can we not make a linkage between the existence of the
euro and the growth which the euro zone is experiencing at this
moment? " said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The euro has fallen nearly 30 percent in its exchange rate with
the U.S. dollar since January 1999 and the currency dropped to its
lowest this week, raising doubts about the future of the European
monetary union.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Seminar on Internet Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Productivity
Council (HKPC) held a seminar entitled "Hacking in the Real World"
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The seminar aims to help participants better understand how
hackers operate so that effective measures could be taken against
such attacks," said W. C. Keung, director of HKPC.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of e-commerce has fundamentally changed the way
business is conducted today. Using information technology (IT) to
collect and process data can considerably enhance productivity,
but this is only feasible under a safe and secure environment,"
said Keung.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Police Force, hacking incidents grew
from 13 cases in 1998 to 238 in 1999. A total of 168 cases were
reported in the first six months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The adverse effect of hacking often goes beyond financial
losses. A company that is insufficiently protected against attacks
suffers loss in prestige as well. Potential clients may lose
confidence and refrain from using its services," Keung added.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,400 representatives from local companies attended the
seminar, which discussed topics ranging from how a hacker gains
access to a computer to one's legal right and preventive measures
against attacks.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Must Improve Its Ability to Innovate: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore must improve its
ability to innovate so as to stay ahead in the global league of
the New Economy, Minister of State for Communications and
Information Technology Lim Swee Say said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the e-NNOVATOR Awards 2000, Lee cited that in the
World Economic Forum's latest global competitiveness report,
though Singapore came in first in technology transfer, it was
ranked only 14th in its ability to innovate.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said Singapore need to quicken the pace of
innovation and broaden the base of innovators to become an
innovative economy and society.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Singapore has been promoting innovation in
the private sector, public sector and in schools.
</P>
<P>
Since the launch of the Innovation Development Scheme in 1995,
the government has awarded 480 million Singapore dollars (about
277 million U.S. dollar) worth of development grants to 490
companies, out of which 360 are local companies, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
These grants were used to support 636 innovation development
projects at a total development cost of 2.1 billion Singapore
dollars (about 1.12 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, another 1.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 809
million U.S. dollars) grants were granted to support more than 150
research and development projects worth 6.5 billion Singapore
dollars (about 3.78 billion Singapore dollars) in total research
spending.
</P>
<P>
The outcomes are encouraging, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commercialization of products and services has more than
doubled within two years from 6.4 billion Singapore dollars (about
3.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 13.4 billion Singapore
dollars (about 7.75 billion Singapore dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of patents filed in Singapore is on the rise too,
increasing at a rate of 29 percent a year from 1995 to 1999, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With these figures, Lim concluded that private-public sector
partnership goes a long way in helping to promote innovation in
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges Military Aid to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen pledged Friday that the United States will help modernize
the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at the Department of National Defense (
DND)in Camp Aguinaldo, Cohen said the United States will turn over
to the Philippines helicopters and transport planes.
</P>
<P>
During President Joseph Estrada's visit to the United States in
July, Washington has promised to give to the AFP eight UH1-H
helicopters and some C-130 planes to boost the military's airlift
capability.
</P>
<P>
Lack of money is said to be hampering the AFP's 15-year
modernization program. Reports said the AFP's modernization will
cost 331 billion pesos (about 7.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the United States is also making efforts to help
Filipino World War II veterans in the access of health care.
</P>
<P>
The increased Philippine-U.S. military cooperation will improve
the bilateral security between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that an assessment team from the United States and
the Philippines "is conducting a comprehensive examination of
Filipino defense capability."
</P>
<P>
The group expects to finish its work next month, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said this "analysis will help both countries set
priorities to use its scarce resources effectively."
</P>
<P>
Aside from military assistance, the Philippines and the United
States will also embark on environmental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since the passage of the Visiting Forces Agreement, the United
States and the Philippines have resumed joint military exercises
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Balikatan Exercise resumed between
the two sides in the Philippines with over 4,000 U.S. troops
conducting training with their Filipino counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the two countries will continue to expand its joint
military exercises next year and the years to come.
</P>
<P>
American warships will also make visits to Manila, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived Friday afternoon in Manila, the first leg of his
southeast Asian tour, which will also take him to Singapore,
Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Indian Congress Party Admits Membership Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Indian Congress party
admitted on Friday that its membership had come down by half in
tentative figures ahead of a crucial party polls but dismissed
suggestions that it was the result of Sonia Gandhi's leadership.
</P>
<P>
The number of primary members had come down by more than half
from 45.6 million to 22 million, Chairman of Congress Central
Election Authority Ram Niwas Mirdha told the media here.
</P>
<P>
But Mirdha said these were only "tentative" figures and
information from some of the states was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
While membership increased only in three states -- Maharashtra
to the west, Punjab to the northwest and Rajasthan at the center,
it had fallen by half or more in Bihar, Gujarat and Kerala.
</P>
<P>
However, Mirdha indicated the figures was more believable as
the current enrollment drive was "much more genuine" than the ones
earlier during which the number of members was "bloated".
</P>
<P>
According to the Congress official, one of the reasons for the
depleted membership was the new provision under which members have
to pay three years fee and active members have to subscribe to the
party journal "Congress Sandesh".

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Infocomm Development
Authority of Singapore (IDA) Friday released the Code of Practice
for Competition in the country's telecoms sector.
</P>
<P>
The competition code, to be effective on September 29 this year,
seeks to define the boundaries for the conduct of competition in a
fully liberalized telecommunications environment, IDA said.
</P>
<P>
Its objective is to identify the appropriate regulatory regime
conducive to the development of a competitive market place.
</P>
<P>
The Code comprises ten sections, addressing aspects relating to
the regulatory regime in a competitive environment, IDA said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, IDA elaborated, section two defines what
constitute a dominant licensee in the competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
Another major component of the Code is the facilitation of
interconnection and access arrangements between dominant and non-
dominant licensees.
</P>
<P>
It also allows for licensees to engage in voluntary
interconnection negotiations, and dispute resolution process
exists should the licensees fail to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Code strives to set clear boundaries for competitive market
behavior while providing enough space for innovation and rapid
response to the demands of the market.
</P>
<P>
IDA said the Code will be reviewed within three years to ensure
its continued relevance as the market evolves.
</P>
<P>
Singapore fully liberalized its telecommunications sector on
April 1, 2000, expediting by two years an earlier plan, which had
set the freeing-up date on April 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Group Founder to Face Criminal Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Daewoo Group's
former Chairman Kim Woo-choong and 40 senior executives will soon
be charged with their alleged window-dressing of financial
statements for the bankrupt conglomerate, South Korea's Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
FSC said it has decided to file a criminal complaint against
Kim and the 40 executives after a month-long special audit of the
bankrupt Daewoo Group, once the second largest conglomerate in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
FSC will soon file the complaint with the Seoul District
Prosecutor's Office against former Daewoo executives on suspicion
of having fabricated settlements amounting to 22.9 trillion won (
some two billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 40 executives include former Daewoo Motor Presidents Kim
Tae-gou and Kim Shin-chung, former Daewoo Corporation President
Shin Young-kyun and other former and current senior managers.
</P>
<P>
Citing the special audit results of Daewoo Group, FSC said that
equity capital of 12 Daewoo affiliates as of August last year
turned out to be minus 28.6 trillion won as a result of due
diligence, a stark disparity with the 14.3 trillion won reported
by Daewoo to the South Korean government.
</P>
<P>
In terms of subsidiary companies, Daewoo Corporation was found
to actively inflate its assets by 14.6 trillion won, followed by
Daewoo Motor with 3.2 trillion won, Daewoo Heavy Industries with 2.
1 trillion won, Daewoo Electronics with 2 trillion won and Daewoo
Telecom with 600 billion won.
</P>
<P>
Window-dressing settlements were made in various forms of
omitting debts, summing up bad bonds and adding false cost of
research and development on their balance sheets, said FSC.
</P>
<P>
The financial regulator will also request the prosecutor's
office to investigate 11 public accounts involved in the Daewoo
case and cancel the registration of 22 public accountants and
suspend 19 others from doing business.
</P>
<P>
Accountants found to be involved in the illicit practice will
also face punitive measures, including cancellation of their
licenses, added FSC.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. Newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After a week of long-distance sparring, representatives of
Vice President Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush met for the
first time Thursday and agreed to a series of three presidential
debates and one vice presidential debate, beginning early next
month in Boston.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia may resume regular commercial flights between Moscow
and Baghdad for the first time since the Gulf War, challenging a
decade-old U.N. air embargo on Iraq, West European and Russian
diplomats said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In a stinging and highly unusual rebuke of his Justice
Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, President
Clinton said on Thursday that he was "quite troubled" by the
government's actions in the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
-- A blockade of British refineries and storage depots broke up
Thursday and oil trucks rumbled past company gates unimpeded for
the first time in a week. But Prime Minister Tony Blair warned
there was still "some way to go" before most drivers would see gas
back in their neighborhood pumps.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Retail sales rose a slower-than-expected 0.2n percent in
August, while wholesale prices dropped. Separately, small
businesses reported slower sales, earnings and capital spending
for last month.
</P>
<P>
-- A Qatar Airways plane was hijacked by a knife-wielding man
who later surrendered after forcing it to land in Saudi Arabia.
The hijacker was identified as an Iraqi. The plane, headed to
Amman, Jordan, from Qatar's capital, Doha, was carrying over 130
passengers. There were no injuries.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. to Join Hands to Fight Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freeh, who arrived here Wednesday evening for a two-day working
visit, discussed ways with Rushailoto to qualify actions between
the FBI and the Russian Interior Ministry in the struggle against
organized crime, particularly against international terrorism,
according to the Russian media.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved the main result" in the cooperation of
institutions of law and order, Rushailo told the press.
</P>
<P>
"Our departments have built up confidence to a level that makes
it possible to fully implement the political accords of Russian
President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Bill Clinton and to
efficiently battle trans-national crime, terrorism, and economic
and computer offenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday negotiations with Freeh produced a decision on a
new phase in bilateral cooperation; the two sides intend to set up
a Russian-American group to coordinate efforts in "the most
promising spheres of anti-crime activity," Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
Freeh noted in turn the importance of cooperation between the
FBI and the Russian Interior Ministry saying, "Cooperation can
hardly be overestimated against the background of the
globalization of international criminality."
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides have similar interests in taking measures
to end terrorism, money laundering and computer crimes.
</P>
<P>
The joint training of Russian Interior Ministry and FBI
personnel, which has been going on for years, is also very
important, Freeh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States will have joint teams of officers
to help solve computer crimes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, Freeh met with Nikolai Patrushev, director of
Russia's Federal Security Service. They talked about expanding
bilateral cooperation in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Freeh and Mikhail Vanin, head of the Russian State
Customs Committee, also discussed cooperation between their
agencies in fighting crime in foreign trade. The two sides reached
an understanding on cooperation in the detection and prevention of
economic smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Freeh will travel to St. Petersburg later Friday for talks with
representatives of that city's law-enforcement agencies.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Hold Thumbs for Heyns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will be
holding thumbs for double Olympic champion Penny Heyns when she
dives off the blocks in defence of her 100m breaststroke title at
the Millennium Games in Sydney on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Many critics have written off the multiple world record-holder,
who so far this year has failed to display anything close to her
brilliant form.
</P>
<P>
But her first race in the heats on Sunday can show whether
Olympic spectators will see the all-conquering Heyns or a fading
star.
</P>
<P>
Heyns will have to wait until Monday to claim her third Olympic
gold alongside the 100m and 200m medals she won in Atlanta four
years ago, Ryk Neethling could become the country's first medal
winner on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Neethling takes on Australia's incredible Ian Thorpe and tough
Grant Hackett in the 400m freestyle on Saturday, and then will
hopefully join Brendon Dedekind, Roland Schoeman and Nic Folker in
the men's 4x100m freestyle relay final.

<HEADLINE> Ferreira Gets Tough Draw in Olympic Men's Tennis Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Wayne
Ferreira's 14th seeding backfired Friday when he was drawn to play
dangerous German Tommy Haas in the first round of the Olympic
Games men's singles tennis competition starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For Ferreira, who won silver with Pietie Norval in the doubles
at the Barcelona Games in 1992, facing Haas is a tough campaign.
</P>
<P>
He could meet Norwegian Christian Ruud in the second round and
then probably one of Britain's Greg Rusedski, Goran Ivanisevic of
Croatia or Spaniard Alex Corretja in the quarters.
</P>
<P>
If victorious, Ferreira could meet top seed Safin in the semi-
finals, while Brazil's second seed Gustavo Kuerten battles it out
against third seed Magnus Norman of Sweden in the other half of
the draw.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's women's doubles team of Amanda Coetzer and
Liezel Horn, seeded eighth even though they have never played
together before, should have a clear run until the quarter-finals
when they could meet veteran Spanish pairing of Conchita Martinexz
and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, whose second seeding is perhaps
somewhat flattering.
</P>
<P>
Coetzer and Horn will play Petra Mandula and Katalin Marosi-
Aracama of Hungary in their tournament opener.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, a successful Coetzer could meet top
seed Lindsay Davenport in the quarter-final and fourth-seed
Martinez in the semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Although likely to get past Rita Kis Kuti of Hungary in the
opening round, Coetzer goes into the second round against the
winner of former French Open champion Iva Majoli versus Anne
Kremer (Luxembourg).
</P>
<P>
In the other half of the pyramid are second and third seeds
Venus Williams and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's men's doubles pair of David Adams and John-
Laffnie de Jager, the number five seeds, look to have an easy
opener against Mexico's Enrique Abaroa and Alejandro Hernandez,
but could have a tough time in the second round if they meet the
fancied Russians Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin, the newly-
crowned U.S. Open champion.

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met today with Guinean Prime Minister Lamine
Sidime.
</P>
<P>
Li said that despite the distance between the two countries,
the people of the two countries have a time-honored friendship,
and bilateral relations have been developing smoothly since the
establishment of diplomatic relations some 40 years ago. He also
said that Sino-Guinean cooperation in various fields has been
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the CPPCC National Committee and Guinea's
Economic and Social Council have had close exchanges, and that
China is delighted with all the achievements of the Guinean people.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China, an old civilization with a splendid history,
had been bullied by imperialism. Therefore, the war-torn country
had experienced a long period of sadness, adding that since the
founding of the People's Republic of China some five decades ago,
China has seen economic growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
However, China has also experienced frustrations in the course
of development due to mistakes in guiding principles, and its
national economy had been on the verge of collapse, Li said,
adding that China drew on lessons from the past, corrected
mistakes and returned to the right track after the 3rd plenary
session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in 1978.

<P>
From then on, according to Li, China has been focusing on
economic development, pursued the policy of reform and opening-up,
and Chinese people have been able to be more creative and active
in the course of economic development.
</P>
<P>
It took China some 20 years to undergo earthshaking changes, he
said, adding that the Chinese people have come to realize that as
long as economically backward countries find the suitable path of
development, they can then move forward at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the Guinean government and people,
under the leadership of President Lansana Conte, will certainly
overcome difficulties, and will enjoy economic growth and the
improvement of living standards.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Li's remarks on bilateral relations, Sidime said he
believes that his visit will help promote existing friendly ties
between the two countries, adding that China has made enormous
progress in its reform and opening-up drive over the past 20 years,
indicating that the Chinese people have chosen a correct and
suitable path of development.
</P>
<P>
He expressed delight at and admiration for China's achievements.
</P>
<P>
The Guinean prime minister said that his country attaches great
importance to developing relations with China, and is ready to
promote cooperation with the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sidime, on behalf of President Conte and the Guinean government,
expressed gratitude for China's assistance to Guinea over the past
decades.

<HEADLINE> Israel Names New Deputy Military Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military
announced Friday that Major General Moshe Ya'alon is to be the
state's new deputy chief of staff in place of Major General Uzi
Dayan.
</P>
<P>
Ya'alon, named "Boogie", has served in several sensitive posts,
including commander of the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit,
chief of military intelligence and in his present position, as
General Officer Commanding (GOC) Central Command, which includes
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Dayan stepped down Friday and is to take his new post on
September 28 as Prime Minister Ehud Barak's military advisor and
head of the National Security Council, which is charged with
reviewing military policy and defense strategy and reporting to the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who is also the Defense Minister, said on Friday at a
closed handover ceremony for the deputy chief of staff that he
received the green light from Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein
to name Dayan head of the National Security Council while retaining
his military rank, said Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Barak was reacting to criticism from the Israeli Defense Forces
(IDF) Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz that Dayan should have taken the
post as a civilian.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Mofaz sharply criticized both Barak and
Dayan. He also accused Dayan of not keeping understandings reached
regarding when he would leave the post and of creating tensions
that made working together difficult.
</P>
<P>
Dayan responded to Mofaz's criticism, saying respect for fellow
men begins at home. By taking the job and remaining in the army,
Dayan can still be in the running for the next IDF Chief of Staff
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Ya'alon and Dayan are the top candidates to succeed Mofaz as
chief of staff.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Aoun Ready for Talks With Jumblatt on Lebanese Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Lebanese army commander
General Michel Aoun, who lives in exile in Paris, said that he was
ready to open a dialogue with Druze Muslim leader Walid Jumblatt,
who helped Syria oust him 10 years ago, the Oriental Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Walid Jumblatt is serious in his policy of opening up toward
Christians, and I am ready to begin the talk," Aoun was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt, the leader of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP)
and a big winner in recent parliamentary elections, asked Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday in Damascus to adjust the
Lebanese-Syrian relations in the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
He also called for "strengthening Lebanese national
understanding through dialogue with the representatives of the
Lebanese forces," according to an official from his press office.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt will go to Paris over the weekend and may meet Aoun,
the radio quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aoun said that he "was ready to go part or even all the way if
necessary" to reach a national understanding.
</P>
<P>
During the recent election campaign, Jumblatt adopted a position
of
openness toward Christian forces. Jumblatt also called on Aoun to
return to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Aoun was driven out of the Presidential Palace in 1990 by
combined Syrian and Lebanese forces and "banished" the same year
for five years. Since then he has not return to Lebanon, for fear
of being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Aoun had refused to be a part to the Taif Accord which ended the
Lebanese civil war in 1990 because he termed the accord as
legitimizing Syria's military presence in Lebanon. So far, about
35,000 Syrian troops remain in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Negotiation Efforts to Free Sulu Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States gave its
full support Friday to the Philippine government to resolve
peacefully the Sulu hostage crisis that will lead to the safe
release of all 19 captives held by the extremist Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
This was the statement issued by visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen during a joint press conference with his
Philippine counterpart Orlando Mercado here in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Right now the Philippines is facing some difficult internal
challenges on terrorism (and) secessionists in the south," Cohen
said, "the United States strongly supports President Estrada's
effort and his government to secure the prompt and safe release of
American hostage currently being held as well as the other
hostages."
</P>
<P>
Cohen's statement came in the midst of mounting calls from
various sectors for the Philippine government to launch military
strike to rescue the hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The American defense secretary declined to answer the question
on the military option to resolve the long-drawn hostage crisis,
saying that the United States was hoping "the situation can be
handled diplomatically and the hostages can be safely returned."
</P>
<P>
But he said that decision is "a matter of the (Philippine)
government to decide."
</P>
<P>
In the current hostage crisis, American Jeffrey Schilling is
one of the 19 hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf. Besides, the Abu

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Danger From Indoor Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- About one billion people,
mostly women and children, are regularly exposed to levels of
indoor air pollution exceeding World Health Organization (WHO)
guidelines by 100 times, WHO said in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting
both developed and developing countries, WHO said. But the highest
air pollution exposures occur in the indoor environment
particularly in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the world's population are now using solid
fuels, like wood, coal, dung, crop residues and charcoal, to cook
food and heat houses, according to WHO. A deadly combination of
solid fuels, inefficient stoves and poor ventilation triggers off
a complex mix of health damaging pollutants in homes.
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing knowledge about harmful health effects of
air pollution, preventive action is often slow to follow. A group
of health experts meeting in Geneva this week have identified
major peaks to be scaled on the way to creating a WHO strategy on
air pollution and health.
</P>
<P>
WHO called on all 191 members to hammer out a unified
methodology for collecting comparable data worldwide to support
sound, science-based assessments of the impact on health. WHO
believes the database to be created will help identify hot spots
of health-threatening air pollution levels and populations at high
risk.

<HEADLINE> Udinese's Brazilian Duo Lose EU Status in Passport Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Udinese have informed the
Italian Football League that two Brazilian team members caught in
possession of fake Portuguese passports should no longer be
considered European Union (EU) players.
</P>
<P>
Udinese's Warley and Alberto were found to be holding fake
Portuguese passports on arrival in Poland for a UEFA Cup first
round match with Polonia Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Serie A clubs are limited to five non-EU players, of whom only
three can be on the pitch at the same time. A number of foreign
players bypass the rules by obtaining EU passports through family
history.
</P>
<P>
Udinese general manager Pier Paulo Marino said: "We informed
the league on Thursday that Alberto and Warley should be
considered as non-EU players."
</P>
<P>
Warley and Alberto were detained briefly at Warsaw airport but
were given temporary permission to enter the country for the match
after producing Brazilian passports.
</P>
<P>
Mario said Udinese would investigate the matter thoroughly and
believed the players carried the false passports unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
Lazio's Argentine midfielder Juan Veron recently had his status
as a non-EU player revoked after being accused last season of
wrongfully obtaining an Italian passport.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- After seven-year preparation,
the curtain of the 2000 Olympic Games was raised here Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Viewed by billions of spectators worldwide, Australian Governor
General Sir William Deane announced opening of the games, which
inherit tradition and herald future of the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
Before any sports with records go underway, the games itself
has already set a record with the most participants in its history
-- 11,000 athletes from 200 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
And further more, the Sydney Olympic Games will be remembered
in history forever as the Korean Peninsula was reunified for the
first time in Olympic Movement since 1945.
</P>
<P>
Under an IOC's-brokered deal, 180 athletes from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea and South Korea, donned in identical
uniforms, marched side by side for the first time behind a "
unification flag" during the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Koreas formed unified teams for the world table tennis and
youth soccer championships in 1991, but never marched together at
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
At the Melbourne Olympics 44 years ago, athletes from East and
West Germany walked together during the 1956 Games.
</P>
<P>
When the Koreans marched into the center stage hand in hand,
the packed stadium crowd including International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch gave them a standing ovation,
applauding their re-unification at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sports delegation was the 40th marching into the
stadium. The 284 Chinese athletes will compete in 166 events in
24 sports, hoping to collect not less than 16 gold medals in the
first games of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Chinese athletes have
collected a total of 52 gold medals four Games.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong for the first time took part in the Olympics after
China resumed its sovereignty of the territory in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At 2310 local time, Cathy Freeman, an Australian heroine from
Aboriginal descent, lit the cauldron with the Olympic flame, which
was ignited from the sun's rays at a special ceremony in Olympia,
Greece and relayed to the Olympic Stadium after touring the host
country in the last 99 days.
</P>
<P>
The torch was carried into the stadium by a relay of veteran
Australian women athletes before being passed to the world 400
meters champion and Australia's best hope for a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the Sydney Games have vowed to make it the
most environmental friendly in Olympic history. Their efforts are
rewarding and the Games may set an example for next games host
Athens and 2008 Games bidders -- Beijing, Osaka, Paris, Toronto
and Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Days before the opening ceremony, Sydney has already sent a
signal to the world that it is ready for the games although
transportation problems and doping scandal marred at the eve of
the games.
</P>
<P>
Athletes, officials and journalists have complains about the
traffic schedule while bus drivers were furious about their poor
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening of the games, Several athletes including
two weightlifters withdrew from the games due to drugs offence.
</P>
<P>
Former Olympic medalist Traean Ciharean of Romania pulled out
of the competitions on Friday after he tested positive for a
banned substance. On Wednesday, Chen Po-pu of Chinese Taipei
became the first athlete to go home from the Games after it was
announced he had tested for methandienone in August.
</P>
<P>
American drugs chief Barry McCaffrey said hours before the
opening ceremony that random tests by the World Anti-Doping Agency
over the past few months have turned up several positive results.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has been working hard to eliminate doping from sports
and the Sydney Games could be a turning point. For the first time
in Olympics, athletes commit themselves "to a sport without doping
and without drugs" at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The "we won't cheat" clause was inserted into the traditional
Olympic oath, which was read on behalf of all athletes by
Australian women's hockey team captain Rechelle Hawkes at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Apart from drugs offence, the IOC has also been fighting
against the corruption after the money-for-vote story of Salt Lake
City was revealed two years ago. In its reform and battle to re-
establish IOC's credibility, 10 IOC members were expelled.
</P>
<P>
The Games competitions will be in full swing tomorrow, which
will decide 13 gold medals from swimming, shooting, triathlon,
fencing, cycling, weightlifting and judo.

<HEADLINE> Opening Ceremony Illustrates History of Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The opening ceremony of the
Millennium Olympics is a celebration of Australia that began by
the sea, and returns to the harbour city after a journey through
the land and history.
</P>
<P>
The audience were taken on a journey through Australian history,
environment and culture by two characters, a little girl and the
traditional Aboriginal dancer Djakapurra.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that an Olympic Opening Ceremony has had
characters that reappeared in each segment, threading the ceremony
together into a whole.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony bursted into life when 120 stockmen on horses
thundered into the arena. They threw their hats into the crowd
and shot the time honoured Australian greeting "G'day".
</P>
<P>
The little girl walked to the center of the arena, spreaded out
a towel, put zinc cream on her nose, lay down and begun to dream
about Australia. She dreamed of the deep blue ocean, of jellyfish,
singrays and other sea creatures.
</P>
<P>
Her dream gave way Djakapurra, Aboriginal dancers and members
of tribes from all corners of the country, who formed circles
around burning eucalyptus leaves. They conjured a giant Wandjina,
a creation myth spirit symbolising the unity of indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
Firebreathers ignited the bush, regeneating the plants that
bloomed into a rippling sea of Australian wildflowers, trees and
animals. Djakapurra walked through the garden and found the
little girl hidden behind a flower.
</P>
<P>
Fire is a significant feature of the Australian landscape. It
was used by Aboriginal peoples to regenerate the bush, and the
great bushfires that can burn uncontrolled across the landscape
are a recuriing natural disaster, that has helped Australians'
relationship with the land.
</P>
<P>
A three person cycle peddled into the arena. At the center it
stopped to begin a segment that takes us on a journey through
enrly Europeana settlement, the struggle to open up and farm the
land, and on to the Australian suburban dream.
</P>
<P>
This is the cue for a series of groups to sweep into the arena.
They represented the successive waves of immigration, that has
transformed Australia into the cosmopolitan and diverse society it
is today.
</P>
<P>
With 2,000 poeple in the center of the arena, Sydney's landmark
Anzac Bridge rose, and Djakapurra and the little girl met again
amid a crescendo that celebrated the city of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Syndey 2000 Olympic Band heralded the arrival of the Parade
of Athletes.
</P>
<P>
Once the athletes were assembled, a huge Olympic flag was
passed over the crowd from the southern grandstand as Vanessa
Amorosi performed "Heroes Live Forever". The official Olympic
Flag was then raised.
</P>
<P>
As the Olympic Torch entered the stadium, Tina Arena performed
"The Flame". Once alight, the Cauldron flame is five meters high
and three meters wide, clearly visible outside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Opening Ceremony concluded with a spectacular display of
fireworks.

<HEADLINE> Birch, Hero behind Sydney Olympics Opening Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Only when the Sydney Olympics
Games opening ceremony finished could director Ric Birch relieve
for the spectacular extravaganza which he had been planning for
more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
The lighting of the cauldron has been an icing on the cake in
the ceremony and it is the most tightly kept secret. Birch
revealed that the very first idea came to him in Monte Carlo, when
Sydney was announced as the host city for 2000. "It's been refined
since then, but the basic design is still there," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony finishes, Birch added:"Times change, but
this has to be an expression of the host city, and must reflect
its culture, and it must reflect it in Sydney in 2000. I think
we've done that."
</P>
<P>
Birch thought that it could be impossible to hold any ceremony
bigger than this one. "I don't think the ceremonies can get much
bigger - I think Sydney is just about the limit. We were only
able to attempt this ceremony at this complexity because we were
involved in the design of the stadium - it would be impossible to
conduct this in an existing stadium," he said.
</P>
<P>
Having already been involved with the Olympic Games ceremonies
of Los Angeles in 1984 and Barcelona in 1992, Birch has plenty of
experience, but Sydney is the stage of his ultimate production.
</P>
<P>
Birch worked with the architects and was able to incorporate
features including the ring road on ground level, the size of the
entrances, technology, even the position of the cauldron into the
blueprint. This meant wonderful stage props of large dimensions
were easily able to enter and exit the field.
</P>
<P>
Technology advancements have made a huge impact on the Opening
Ceremonies and pushed them to a grand scale, not only with effects,
lighting and sound, but with behind the scene organisation.
</P>
<P>
"The productivity of computers has enabled us to be more and
more ambitious and more and more complex every four years.
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles in 1984 we just started using computers,
especially with the lighting and the database for the performers.
Now, even the cauldron itself has extraordinary computer
technology. The production coordination is enormously complex;
we've got nearly 13,000 performers, 6,000 backstage people, close
to 12,000 athletes and officials, -- just to coordinate that
number of people requires computers or years and years and years
of typewriters," Birch said.
</P>
<P>
Of all the elements of the Opening Ceremony, Birch believed
it's the cauldron that is the strongest symbol for the world. "The
ceremony itself is the curtain raiser to the overture of the stars
coming onto the field, and the cauldron represents the athletes."
</P>
<P>
"When the cauldron is alight, that is the symbol to the rest of
the world that the Olympic Games have truly begun," he said.

<HEADLINE> Baumann Tries Again for Doping-Panel Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Dieter Baumann of Germany left
training camp near Brisbane on Friday night to Sydney in another
attempt to give evidence to a panel examining doping charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration panel of the world governing athletics body
IAAF, was due to resume discussion of the Baumann case on Saturday
for the third day and decide whether he should be allowed to
compete at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time within 48 hours that Baumann, 35, has
broken off training in an attempt to gain a hearing before the
panel. The panel has already turned down requests to be heard from
both the athlete himself and from the German athletics
organisation, DLV.
</P>
<P>
Another DLV submission that the panel was not empowered to deal
with the case was also unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
A mood of pessimism was meanwhile spreading in the German
Olympic team with DLV official Clemens Prokop saying: "This is
certainly not a good sign."
</P>
<P>
Baumann himself said Friday before leaving Brisbane that events
were not happening as he had envisaged. But he observed
philosophically: "However, that is what often happens in life."
</P>
<P>
Baumann, 35, 5,000 meters winner at the Olympic Games in
Barcelona in 1992, was last autumn twice tested positive for the
banned anabolic steroid nandrolone but was cleared after
convincing prosecutors and the DLV that he was the victim of a
conspiracy. He said his toothpaste had been spiked.
</P>
<P>
But the IAAF has the final say and the IAAF council in July
referred the case to its arbitration panel for a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
If the arbitration panel rules that Baumann violated doping
regulations, he faces a two-year suspension.

<HEADLINE> Skeleton Found in Beijing Ancient Tomb Was Female </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The skeleton discovered in a
2,000-year-old tomb in the western part of Beijing was of a woman
who was approximately 160 centimeters tall and 30 years of age.
</P>
<P>
This was just revealed by archaeologists who have been
excavating the ancient tomb for about eight months now.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton was discovered in the front chamber, or the
sitting room of the occupant of the tomb, in July.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult for archaeologists to identify the gender of
the skeleton since parts of the chest, waist and pelvis have
decayed.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists cleaned and fixed the pieces together and x-
rayed the bones after they moved the skeleton piece by piece into
the lab.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have not yet been able to identify the skeleton
or how long it had been buried. The occupant of the tomb is still
unknown since the coffin is yet to be opened.

<P>
SHENYANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The last section of an
expressway linking Beijing and Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, opened to traffic today.
</P>
<P>
The 658.3 km long Beijing-Liaoning expressway is now completely
operational.
</P>
<P>
The 191-km-long Jinzhou-Shenyang section begins at Jinzhou City
in Liaoning. This section is a major component of the Beijing-
Shenyang expressway, a key State project.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the expressway was 20 billion yuan (about 2.4
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The expressway, which began construction in 1996, runs through
Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities, and Hebei and Liaoning
Provinces.
</P>
<P>
The top speed allowed on the six-lane expressway is 120 kmp/h,
reducing the drive time from Beijing to Shenyang to half what it
was before.
</P>
<P>
The expressway is installed with an advanced traffic monitoring
system, telecommunication equipment and toll-taking facilities.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Liaoning has opened many expressways linking Shenyang
with other major cities across the province. The total expressway
length in the province is 1,259 km.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tomb Opens to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A 2,000-year-old Han Dynasty
tomb in western Beijing being excavated by Chinese archaeologists
was opened to the public today.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 200 people visited the excavation site, which
costs 30 yuan per entry. An additional 8 people went into the core
working area for a cost of 80 yuan per entry.
</P>
<P>
"Opening the excavation site to the public will help promote
archaeological knowledge among the citizens and enhance their
awareness of relics protection," said Yang Boxian, a cultural
official from the Shijingshan District, where the tomb is located.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of visitors is strictly limited,
archaeologists are concerned about the possible adverse impact
from allowing visitors to the site.
</P>
<P>
"Archaeological excavation is a serious thing that must be
handled very carefully with the least disturbances," said Wang
Wuyu, head of the excavation team.
</P>
<P>
Supporters, however, argued that the tomb had already been
robbed so there will not be any major discoveries.
</P>
<P>
"Excavation is not for archaeologists alone. The important
thing is for all the Chinese to take care of their own culture,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was discovered when the police arrested a group of
tomb robbers earlier this year. It is believed to be one of three
major archaeological discoveries in the Beijing area in the last
five decades.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists believe that the tomb belongs to a Han Dynasty
prince or his wife. They have dug up lacquerware items and other
relics and is soon to open up the coffin.

<HEADLINE> Stonecutters Bridge to Be HK's Prominent Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will have one
more prominent architecture when Stonecutters Bridge, with a span
of over 1,000 meters, is completed in 2007 as scheduled, said Hong
Kong's Director of Highways Y.C. Lo Friday.
</P>
<P>
"When Stonecutters Bridge is completed, we shall have a new
landmark structure in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stonecutters Bridge, which will straddle the Rambler Channel at
the entrance to the busy Kwai Chung Container Port, is likely to
become the longest span cable-stayed bridge in the world.
</P>
<P>
Together with the proposed Tsing Lung Bridge, a major element
of Route 10 - North Lantau to Yuen Long Highway, Stonecutters
Bridge is a continuation of building for the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The completion of these mega projects will further enhance Hong
Kong's strategic road network for cross-boundary traffic, said Lo.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the results of the Stonecutters Bridge Design
Competition at the prize presentation ceremony, Lo said that the
bridge would help maintain Hong Kong as a vibrant and important
center of international trade, and make the landscape of Hong Kong
more fascinating.
</P>
<P>
The Stonecutters Bridge, together with Tsing Ma Bridge, Kap
Shui Mun Bridge and Ting Kau Bridge, the three long span bridges
completed within the last 10 years, will provide convenience for
people and help sustain continuous development of the economy of
Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They not only serve their basic function of being part of the
highway network, but also become part of the Hong Kong landscape,"
Lo said.
</P>
<P>
Stonecutters Bridge is the major component of the Route 9 (
Tsing Yi - Cheung Sha Wan). The estimated project cost of the
route is about 17 billion HK dollars (2.2 billion U.S. dollars),
of which about 5 billion HK dollars (641 million U.S. dollars)
will be for the construction of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated construction commencement date of the route
will be 2002 for completion in 2007.

<HEADLINE> HK's Welfare System Comparable to Any in Asia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has over the
years built up a highly developed system of welfare services and
institutions which is comparable to any in Asia, said Hong Kong's
Secretary for Health and Welfare E K Yeoh Friday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a safety net for the needy, the vulnerable and the
disadvantaged, there was a range of preventive, developmental and
support services, as well as remedial services for those who
required assistance, Yeoh said at the luncheon meeting of the Hong
Kong Chiu Chow Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the elderly enjoys a sense of security,
belonging, health and worthiness, Yeoh said the government would
be spending 2.7 billion HK dollars (346 million U.S. dollars) in
2000-2001 on elderly welfare services.
</P>
<P>
In 2000-2001, 1.66 billion HK dollars (213 million U.S. dollars)
will be spent on family and child welfare services which include
family casework service, child care service, services for battered
spouses and abused children and family life education.
</P>
<P>
Turning to youth welfare services, Yeoh said, in the current
financial year, 1.1 billion HK dollars (141 million U.S. dollars)
will be spent on services for young people, covering a wide range
of services such as children and youth centers, school social work
service, outreaching social work service and integrated teams.
</P>
<P>
The government is also committed to providing people with
disabilities with the necessary rehabilitation services and
support, so that they can develop their potential and integrate
fully into the community.
</P>
<P>
In 2000-2001, 2.2 billion HK dollars (282 million U.S. dollars)
will be spent on direct rehabilitation services, including care,
education and training of disabled pre-schoolers, as well as day
care and residential services for disabled adults, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tensions High in Israeli Arab Sector Over Barakei Inquiry By Qi Deliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Tensions are running high
among the Israeli Arab population following Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein's decision to let the police launch its inquiry
against Hadash (Communist) Party leader Momammed Barakei.
</P>
<P>
Barakei, an Arab member of the Knesset (parliament), was charged
by police for incitement against the law enforcing police.
</P>
<P>
Police said that on September 4, Barakei came to a site in Umm
Al-Faham, an Arab town in northern Israel where illegally built
houses were being demolished, gave a speech to residents watching
the demolition and urged them to take actions against the police if
they demolish their houses again in the future.
</P>
<P>
As asked by the Police, Rubinstein on Wednesday decided to give
the police a green light to investigate Barakei on "suspicion that
he incited violence against the police and encouraged Israeli Arabs
in northern Israel to take actions to protect their homes."
</P>
<P>
Following Rubinstern's decision, Israeli Arab leaders, including
the Monitoring Committee of Arab Leadership, have called several
meetings to decide what actions that Arabs will take to protect
themselves and against the police inquiry.
</P>
<P>
While denouncing Rubinstein's decision, the committee decided to
call for mass demonstrations wherever Barakei is called for
questioning by the police.
</P>
<P>
The committee also called for the dismissal of northern region
police chief Alik Ron, who was at odds with local Arabs, for his
statement on Tuesday that police wanted to launch the investigation
against Barakei.
</P>
<P>
Barakei, elected by the Israeli Arabs of northern Galilee during
the 1999 elections, was not alone in his fight against the planned
police inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Malik Dehamshe, leader of the United Arab List which has
five members in the Knesset, has voiced this total support for
Barakei. Dehamshe said on Thursday that if the policemen try to
demolish Arab homes and break the legs and arms of those trying to
prevent them, the later have the right to do the same.
</P>
<P>
The population of Israeli Arabs has been increasing very fast in
recent years and it stood at around 1.1 Million till now and most
of them are living in northern Israel. Israel's total population
was 6.3 million by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Arabs blamed the government for not paying enough
attention to their social and welfare problems and said they did
not receive equal treatment compared to the Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
Local Arab Councils, which oversee the development of the Arab
towns and villages, told the government long time ago that they
have run out of money due to less allocations from the government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
It will be difficult for Rubsintern and police to press criminal
charges against Barakei and other Arab Knesset members because
parliamentary immunity for speeches can not be stripped under any
circumstances, and the police investigation against Barakei would
add more fire to the existing tensions among the Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
To ease this tension, President Moshe Katsav called on Arab
leaders on Thursday and told them he will offer his assistance to
help solve some problem facing the Arab sector.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Thursday that the Israeli
Arabs are "loyal citizens" and promised to work to improve their
social and welfare status.
</P>
<P>
No matter how the police will conduct investigation against
Barakei, the problem of demolition of Arab homes built without the
so-called permits needs the government to address too.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main reasons that (Arab) people are forced to build
homes without permits is because municipal zoning plans are either
non-existent or so out of date that they do not relate to the needs
of our communities," Mohammed Zeidan, Chairmen of the Monitoring
Committee of Arab Leadership stated on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere in the Arab communities is extremely tense and
all members of the monitoring committee fully support Barakei,
because the demolition of homes is an extremely sensitive issue on
which all Arab leaders are united," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners To Pay Entry Fee To Indian Monuments In Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Archaeological Survey of
India (ASI), which is in charge of ancient site maintenance in the
country, decided to raise entrance fee to monuments and charge
foreign visitors in U.S. dollars, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The entrance fee would be increased to 10 rupees (near 0.22 U.S.
dollars) from the existing 5 rupees (0.11 dollars) for domestic
tourists while foreigners would have to pay 10 dollars instead of
current level of 5 dollars, PTI quoted ASI Direct General Komal
Anand as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, Anand said in Agra, an ancient city 200
kilometers southeast of here, that a national culture fund would
be set up for the better maintenance of national monuments.
</P>
<P>
The fund would be used for reservation and refurbishment of the
monuments, Anand said. However, she did not specify when the new
rates would come into force.
</P>
<P>
The new rules would make visit little cheaper for foreign
tourists to the famous Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders in the
world, as Agra Development Authority is now charging 500 rupees (
some 11 dollars) from them as road tax.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Electoral Body Urged to Act Tough Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's ruling Chama
Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party has asked the Zanzibar Electoral
Commission (ZEC) to act tough against acts of violence and
hooliganism in the run-up to the general elections to be held on
October 29, the official Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, the CCM claimed that acts of
hooliganism being practiced by the opposition Civic United Front (
CUF) supporters are a threat to peace and political stability in
the Indian Ocean Isles.
</P>
<P>
It further said the CUF's violence was a special ploy designed
to disrupt peace and create an environment of fear, which will
make the October elections not "free and fair".
</P>
<P>
The party urged ZEC to condemn the acts and take concrete steps
to control the situation before it gets out of hand, citing recent
illegal demonstrations and a stone throwing incident which took
place last weekend and left six people injured .
</P>
<P>
The ZEC said on Tuesday it was about to hold a joint meeting
with police officers and representatives of all political parties
taking part in next month's elections to discuss ways of
controlling the increasing violence.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But with its own government and
parliament, it is a semi-autonomous region in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It will go to polls simultaneously with the mainland in the
second multi-party elections this year, choosing its own president
as well as a new leader of the Union government.

<HEADLINE> Aid Flights to Central Angolan Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Humanitarian aid flights for
war-displaced Angolans in the country's central coastal Benguela
province have been resumed recently after a 50-day suspension, the
official Angolan news agency Angop reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of flights to this region will secure food
assistance for over 16,000 displaced persons and thousands of
local residents, according to the humanitarian aid project co-
ordinator Januario Dotolo.
</P>
<P>
Dotolo said that the second phase of the assistance will focus
on providing seeds, working tools and ensuring food security.
</P>
<P>
The assistance project started in March, 2000, establishing 37
kitchens and a few camping centers for the displaced persons in
the northeastern Balombo district in Benguela province.
</P>
<P>
According to local analysts, the suspension of the aid flights
to the region was mainly due to the rampant guerrilla actions
launched by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Balombo district is neighboring the war-torn Huambo
province, where there have been the most fierce battles between
the Angolan government troops and the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Composite Index
increased 9.09 points or 1.5 percent to end the week at 612.99
points on Friday, while the sub-index edged up 9.75 points or 0.2
percent to 4710.8 points.
</P>
<P>
The turnover this week stood at 37.96 billion yuan, 15.29
percent less than last week's 44.81 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Continuing last week's rebound, the market went in its upward
trend early this week, according to Homeway, China's leading
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, cheered by the news that Sinopec began to have a
global issue, and that the oil price continued to rise, big-cap
blue chips and petroleum-chem shares performed actively, leading
up the index to the high level of 617.92 points.
</P>
<P>
As the heavy selling pressure was near the 620-point level, the
market failed to touch the target this week. News of the second
board market and the listing of state-owned shares also affected
the market.
</P>
<P>
To set up the second board market as quickly as possible is one
of the important measures for China's stock market reform. With
more news coming about the establishment of China's second board
stock market, investors were more and more concerned about issues
on the new market, including the market name, timing, place, scale,
differentiation, funds flow, liquidity, listing rules, risks and
market future, etc.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the
confirmed news is that the second board market will debut on the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and about fifty enterprises are expected
to be firstly listed among 300 applicants.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said the government formally approved the
merger of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges last month and
the second board market has been proposed to be set up by early
2001.
</P>
<P>
Before the decision on the second board market is clear, the
market will not have a clear direction. Taking a wait-and-see
attitude is what investors can do at present, according to Homeway.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share Index
closed the week flat at 119.12 points. Trading was suspended on
Wednesday due to a public holiday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
For most of the week, buyers and sellers were in a tug war,
with most people on the sidelines with caution. Trading was in a
mixed fashion, and market breadth had taken on a negative slant,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Not much lay behind the lackluster except for technical reasons.
The market never tried to get a lift from a friendly batch of
economic news that should have strengthened the belief of a robust
economy in China.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predict that fairly narrow-range trading will
continue to dominate the sessions ahead and any of the advance may
be hampered with no leaderships as investors are offered no
further encouragement in a buying mood.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market
pared gains this week in shrinking trade volume and with much
negativity.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai B-share index dipped 1.47 points or 2.10 percent
to 68.50 at the end of the week, and the five-day turnover
contracted to 69.94 million U.S. dollars, which was 33.26 percent
less than the total of last week.
</P>
<P>
After opening on a strong note, the market failed to sustain
gains and gradually lost ground in four consecutive sessions of
decline. For most of the week, buyers and sellers were in a tug
war, with most people on the sidelines with caution, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China's domestic securities
investment funds market moved within corrections on Friday,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Of 22 discounted funds, only Fund Jintai and Fund Yuyang
advanced, with the rest either remaining unchanged or declining.
They mainly moved around previous close price levels. The trading
volume of Fund Xinghe was clearly expanded, but those of most
other funds were contracted.
</P>
<P>
As for restructured funds, Fund Jinding's placement expansion
was approved, and its expansion prospectus was published. After
its trading was resumed this afternoon, Fund Jinding went
downwards, reflecting that some holders were reluctant to
participate in the placement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Fund Tongzhi that had moved upwards strongly for two days
opened low today, down 4.4 percent at the close, becoming the top
loser today, followed by Fund Handing, Zhujiang, and Jinding,
which were all restructured funds, down from 1.7 percent to 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Another restructured fund Yuze, however, was the top gainer
today. The market showed that restructured funds still moved in
their own way.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries were on
track to rally after the slump of last week. Four of the six
outstanding T-bonds saw a tame rise of 0.17 yuan with the other
two unchanged for the week.
</P>

To date, the ministry has issued treasuries valued at 392
billion yuan, including 190 billion yuan of certificates and 102
billion yuan of book-entries, accounting for 68 percent of the

<HEADLINE> National Day Holiday to Greatly Benefit Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that as many as
100,000 tourists from the inland areas of China might come to the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) during the seven-day
holiday period from October 1 to 7.
</P>
<P>
People with the tourism sector in Macao said the tourists will
spend 25 million patacas (about 3.1 million U.S. dollars) here and
the businesses dealing in special local products, souvenirs, gold
ornaments and catering will benefit the most.
</P>
<P>
Following Hong Kong, the inland areas have been the second
leading source of tourists for Macao. During the first half of
this year, tourists from the inland areas accounted for 23.5
percent of the total tourists to the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
However, Macao is short of tourist guides proficient in
Mandarin. Only 150 out of the 500 tourist guides in Macao know
Mandarin while others speak the local spoken language of Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been a pillar sector of the local economy. This
year, the tourism authorities plan to attract 8 million tourists,
nearly 20 times Macao's population.

HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief Secretary for

The Sheikh had also noted that Hong Kong had received a good
report from the Evaluation Committee which had visited the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region earlier this year, said Chan.
</P>
<P>
"He assured me that the voting on who will win the bid for the
2006 Asian Games will be done on a fair basis, and he encouraged

<HEADLINE> Asia Has a Crucial Role in Protecting Ozone Layer: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Asian countries have to play
their part in protecting the ozone layer, the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of this year's International Day for the
Preservation of the Ozone Layer Saturday, UNEP Executive Director
Klaus Toepfer said in a press release that attention has to shift
from the industrialized countries, which have led the way in
lowering chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) output, to the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developing countries to phase out CFC emissions by
2010, the deadline agreed under the Montreal Protocol.
</P>
<P>
UNEP recently released an update report on which developing
countries will reach their commitments to reduce and phase out
consumption and production of ozone-depleting substances under the
1997 Montreal Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"The trend of compliance is favorable, but we cannot be
complacent. Stakes are very high and together we have to ensure
the continued success of the Protocol," Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
As part of awareness raising activities throughout the world, a
new code of practice to guide the handling of ozone-depleting
substances used in refrigeration and air conditioning in Thailand
was launched Friday.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said a significant problem in developing countries was
the release of refrigerants into the atmosphere during maintenance
and servicing of older equipment.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer met in China and adopted
critical decisions ensuring further
financial support to help developing countries phase out CFCs and
other ozone- depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
However, earlier this month satellites confirmed the current
ozone "hole" over the Antarctic is the largest ever recorded. The
hole measures a record 28.3 million square kilometers, over one
million square kilometers larger than the previous record in 1998.
</P>
<P>
While the ozone layer continues to weaken as the emissions of
past decades gradually drift up to the stratosphere, it is
expected to start recovering in the coming years as more and more
countries adopt ozone-friendly technologies.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent meeting of the UNEP Environmental Effects
Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol emphasized that the
timing for this recovery remains uncertain. In particular, the
Panel noted that the interactions between global warming effects
and ozone depletion could delay ozone recovery by an additional
decade.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's International Day for the
Preservation of the Ozone Layer is "Save Our Sky: Protect Yourself;
Protect the Ozone Layer".

<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military said
Friday that its artillery Thursday killed over 20 rebels and
injured scores of others in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
These militants were eliminated while Russian federal troops
shelled five rebel concentrations in the Vedeno and Nozhai-Yurt
districts of Chechnya, the Interfax news agency quoted the Russian
armed forces' command in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian sappers disposed two bombing devices near checkpoints
in the Vedeno district, one under the railroad bed in the
Naurskaya district and the other in the railway station of
Gudermes, Chechnya's second biggest city.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, rebels fired at federal positions 12
times. Federal units detained 47 suspects and seized 18 automatic
weapons, the command said.
</P>
<P>
In the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russian sappers found and
removed four bombing devices planted on the shoulders of roads,
the command press center said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Russian units also destroyed three rebel bunkers, a truck and
three illicit miniature oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian air force Su-24 bombers flew seven combat
missions and Mi-24 armed helicopters flew over 20 sorties to carry
out air strikes on three rebel camps in the Chechen mountains, the
press center said.
</P>
<P>
Mi-24 helicopters fired missiles at a rebel group that was
poised to attack a Russian military convoy, killing some of the
rebels and scattering the others, it said.

municipalities will form a partnership with seven prefectures of
Tibet to promote the development of autonomous region.

Since then, aid by these regions has greatly helped the
development of infrastructure, culture, education, health and

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes New Measures to Boost Rice Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government decided
to dismantle the country's system of export quotas as well as the
practice of licensing exports through state appointed firms in
order to boost rice export, Vietnam News (VNS) reported here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to go into effect as of early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the country's new government policies
encouraging rice export have contributed greatly to the
development of the domestic rice market.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, Vietnamese Ministry of Trade will
coordinate with other ministries and agencies to draw up a new
mechanism governing market control and stabilization.
</P>
<P>
The new document will lay out measures aiming at ensuring
stable rice supplies, food security, and an end to unorganized
rice trade.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam expects that 500,000 tons of rice will be exported this
month, bringing the total export since the beginning of the year
to between 2.8 and 2.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's rice export plan this year remains unchanged though
rice cultivation has been badly hit by floods and storms.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Vietnam officially joined the international rice
market, and since then its export volume has increased
considerably thanks to the constant improvement of rice quality.
</P>
<P>
Rice export increased from 1.4 million tons in 1989 to 4.5
million tons last year. As a result, Vietnamese rice accounted for
20 percent of the world market as of last year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopeful of U.S. Military Aid Amid Cohen's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday it is hopeful that the visit of the U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen would give a much-needed impetus to the
modernization efforts of the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that President Joseph Estrada would discuss the matter with
Secretary Cohen, who is scheduled to pay him a courtesy call in
the presidential palace Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Cohen received a warm welcome by his Philippine counterpart
Orlando Mercado following the former's arrival in Manila Friday
afternoon. After a short welcome ceremony, Cohen and Mercado went
directly for a close-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are examining our foreign military assistance. We are
looking into the military's requirements, particularly that of our
Army and Navy," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the president would follow up with Cohen the
promise of U.S. officials to help the Philippines in its military
modernization program.
</P>
<P>
During Estrada's working visit to the United States in July, he
received a commitment from U.S. President Bill Clinton to help the
Philippines modernize its military forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government stressed the immediate needs of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), particularly boats for
patrol and helicopters for search-and-rescue operations.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Composite Index
closed at 612.99 points on Friday, slightly down 0.12 points or 0.
02 percent from the last close, at the Shenzhen Stock Exchange,
one of the two bourses in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the stock exchange's sub-index also dropped from the
previous close, sliding 17.01 points or 0.36 percent to close at 4,
710.8 points on Friday, with a total turnover of 7.28 billion yuan,
which was 11 percent less than Thursday's 8.18 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Composite Index Friday opened lower at 612.65
points from Thursday's close of 613.11. The market index touched
the low level of 609.28 points in the afternoon and then rebounded
near the market close.
</P>
<P>
According to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company, analysts believe that the Shenzhen
market opened lower, because it was the weekend, when investors
were concerned about the news of the second board market and the
listing of state-owned shares. Only the ST shares performed
actively.
</P>
<P>
South Huiton Co., Ltd. was the top gainer with its price up 6.
86 percent to 16.99 yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Yorkpoint Science &AMP; Technology Co,. Ltd., once the
first stock whose price was over 100 yuan per share in China, was
the biggest loser today with its price down 5.18 percent to 56.16
yuan, hit by heavy selling.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predict that the A-share market is likely to
settle at the 610-point level next week.

</P>
<P>
Following the recent tumble, the Shenzhen B-share index
continued to go down in afternoon trading owing to lack of
conviction for a sure direction, which led investors to hold their
money from trading.

negative side and the Shenzhen B-share market is likely to
continue to move in a tight range with light volume next week, as
most investors are cautious to put their money into the market.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Majority Backs PM's Civic Reforms: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Israelis
support the sweeping civic reforms proposed by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, according to a survey conducted on behalf of the Israeli
leading daily The Jerusalem Post published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reform proposals polled by the Smith Institute, a long-
established polling company in Israel, included allowing stores in
city centers to remain open, public transportation to operate, and
state-run airline El Al to fly on Shabbat, and permitting civil
marriages.
</P>
<P>
The most popular move is removing the ban imposed on El Al,
which is intended to facilitate the airline's privatization. Sixty-
four percent of the 502 respondents are in favor, which 34 percent
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
Even among those who consider themselves "traditional", there
was backing for Shabbat flights from 51 percent of those
questioned.
</P>
<P>
The most controversial issue was that of opening shops in malls
and commercial centers, with 53 percent saying it would be a good
idea and 45 percent objecting.
</P>
<P>
On civil marriage, the margin of support was of 56 percent to 41
percent, and on public transportation on Shabbat, which was
intended by the prime minister to provide bus services particularly
for the careless immigrants in Tel Aviv area, the approval rating
was nearly as high as on El Al, with 60 percent approving and 38
percent opposing.
</P>
<P>
Among secular respondents, 91 percent said El Al should fly on
Shabbat. Support for all the proposals was overwhelming, with the
lowest level of support coming for opening shops, with 77 percent
in favor and 21 percent against.
</P>
<P>
Among those classified as "religious and haredi (ultra-
Orthodox)", opposition to all the suggestions was far greater than
the backing expressed by secular participants. Concerning both
public transportation and allowing stores to open, 94 percent said
they are opposed. On civil marriage and El Al, 92 percent objected.
</P>
<P>
The survey, with a 4.5-percent margin of error, represents a
cross-section of Jewish adults in Israel, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The poll followed Barak's announcement that he intends to
promote a "socio-civil" reform plan aimed at modernizing the
Israeli society. The issues questioned in the poll constitute the
bulk of the plan.
</P>
<P>
In response to the findings, the Prime Minister's Office said it
is "sure that the prime minister's proposals reflect the needs and
genuine interests of the large majority of Israelis, religious and
secular alike."
</P>
<P>
The poll also drew criticism from the religious factions of the
society. Knesset (Parliament) Member Avraham Ravitz from the United
Torah Judaism Party was quoted as saying that the respondents
included "a lot of confused people", who are not sure what to make
of the religious-secular dispute.
</P>
<P>
He charged that those leading the reforms are guilty of "
stealing away" the Jewish identity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yisael Meir Lau at his Defense
Ministry office in Tel Aviv and told Lau that "the actions in
advancing and carrying out the components of the civil-social
agenda shall be done through dialogue, attention, and maximum
understanding of all streams among the public, but without damaging
the authority of the executive branch to conduct the affairs of the
state in a manner which serves the needs of its citizens, and
without giving any sector the right to veto decisions of the
elected government."
</P>
<P>
The principles of Barak's social-civic reforms have been
approved by the ruling Labor Party's senior echelon without any
objections, though some members of the executive committee

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A majority of Israelis would like to see sweeping secular
reforms implemented, according to a survey conducted on behalf of
the Jerusalem Post by the Smith Institute. The polls surveyed 502
people on Sunday and Monday, representing a cross-section of Jewish
adults in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The reforms polled included allowing stores in city centers to
remain open, public transportation to operate, and Israel's El Al
airline to fly on Shabbat, and permitting civil marriage.
</P>
<P>
The most popular move, according to the poll, is lifting the ban
imposed on EL Al. Among the general public, 64 percent are in
favor, while 34 percent oppose it.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Arrow defense system Thursday intercepted and shot
down a simulated Scud ballistic missile at a height of 35
kilometers, in a spectacularly successful test.
</P>
<P>
This was the eighth in a series of Arrow test-firings and
defense technology experts described it as an impressive
achievement. The missile intercepted a relatively small incoming
missile head on, and developers succeeded in boosting its speed to
three kilometers per second.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Director-General of
the Defense Ministry, Amos Yaron, congratulated the development
team at Israel Aircraft Industries for their success and for
bolstering the defense capabilities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The largest-ever Israeli sporting team for an Olympic Games
is making its final preparation as the 27th Olympiad gets under way
in Sydney Friday.
</P>
<P>
The team is made up of 40 dashing young men and women and never
before have hopes of a gold medal been so high and perhaps even
realistic.
</P>
<P>
This time, a return without any medals in its luggage really
would be a failure for the team, which is the best Israel has even
prepared for an Olympic Games and is capable of fighting it out
with the best in the world, and winning.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A U.S. source said Thursday night that "nothing is happening"
in the renewed peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians and the
Americans because the Palestinian team doesn't have a mandate to
move forward from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said that the
talks that had resumed this week "are unbelievably difficult."
</P>
<P>
Meeting with reporters in New York Thursday before his talks
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who briefed him on
the bilateral talks in Washington between U.S. officials and
Palestinian negotiators, Ben-Ami said that the work should now
concentrate on "all the issues".
</P>
<P>
He said it should not appear as if the resolution of the
Jerusalem issue finalizes an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Build World's Second Largest Nature Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will incorporate fossil
beds found in a village of southwestern province Mugla in 1993 into
a nature park nearby to establish the second largest outdoor nature
museum in the world, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project, under the auspices of the Culture Ministry and the
Mugla Governorship, will be named the Turolian Nature Park 2000.
The nature park will be the world's second largest one with the
first in the U.S. state of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a local inhabitant in the Ozluce village close to the
Aegean Sea discovered fossils of animals that lived 5-10 million
years ago. Since then, excavations started and will continue until
the middle of November of this year.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said that the fossils belong to the forerunners
of modern-day cattle, giraffes, rhinoceros, large-snouted animals,
pigs and horses.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to take emergent measures to protect
the fossil beds containing the remains of many prehistoric
animals. "The fossils are being collected and sold by locals. We
intend to introduce and promote the region's natural and cultural
wealth to the world by the park project," they said.
</P>
<P>
Mugla Governor Lutfi Yigenoglu said that the city of Mugla and
its environs, neighboring the Aegean Sea, were suited to becoming
an outdoor museum.
</P>
<P>
In order to have an outdoor nature museum established at the
Ozluce fossil beds, they needed funds to conduct preliminary
surveys, and carry out construction and renovation activities, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
He said that they would work in collaboration with Greece to
secure the funds from the European Union's environment and culture
fund.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia on Singapore Senior Minister's Memoirs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Friday
Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's second volume of memoirs
should not strain the good ties between Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's policy towards Singapore remains one of fostering
the spirit of neighborliness based on mutual respect and
understanding for the benefit of both countries, the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It should be regarded as a portrayal of history as viewed by
Lee, and not the official viewpoint of the Singapore government,
it said.
</P>
<P>
"As the memoirs are the interpretations and personal views of
Lee Kuan Yew and might have formed the basis of the Singapore
government's policy sometime in the past, it cannot be considered
the Singapore government's official stand now on bilateral ties
between the two countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The memoirs, among other things, touched on the history of
relations between Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Extracts of the memoirs were published in the Singapore Straits
Times newspaper last week.
</P>
<P>
Lee served as Singapore's first prime minister for 31 years
until 1990.
</P>
<P>
Lee will launch the second volume of his memoirs entitled "From
Third World to First" on his 77th birthday in Singapore Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Central Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party Le Kha Phieu
said that Vietnam News Agency (VNA) must strive harder to maintain
a strong and reliable strategic information center of Vietnamese
Party and State.
</P>
<P>
Phieu made the remarks in an open letter on Friday to VNA on
its 55th anniversary on September 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
He described VNA as an important part of the nation's
revolutionary press and said it should work harder to become a
strong multimedia group of high quality and effectiveness.

<P>
In this way, it would better serve the people's cause of
national independence and socialism in the light of Marxism-
Leninism and Ho Chi Minh's Thought, Phieu noted.
</P>
<P>
VNA has always played the role of a clearly-oriented and
crucial information mainstream in the country's political and
ideological fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that VNA is also vital in disseminating policies of
the Party and the State; reflecting the people's legitimate
aspirations; and actively participating in the country's struggle
against corruption, red tape and other social evils.

LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Southern African
Countries are not ready for the Free Trade Area because the sector
is characterized by so many weak elements, visiting president of

Gerald Doornbos has said.

Zambian newspaper the Post Friday quoted Doornbos as saying
that most developing countries have a lot of problems in the
agricultural commodity production costs and are not ready for the
FTA, which will be launched by the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) next month, because they are still
undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
"Governments in developing countries must be aware of the low
prices of agricultural commodities and look at ways of
strengthening the sector," the president said, adding "farmers
cannot enter the FTA if their base is not developed."
</P>
<P>
He also called for unity among farmers in the country in order
to develop a strong market position as they enter an integrated
market.

<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Oil companies bowed to public outrage on Thursday and
abandoned a two-penny (0.028-U.S. dollar) per liter petrol price
rise that had been announced just as tankers started rolling to
end the fuel drought.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- As the full-scale restoration of Britain's petrol supplies
finally got under way Thursday night, the Chancellor of Exchequer,
Gordon Brown, dug in his heels against any early tax concessions
on fuel prices before next March, despite a 60-day deadline for
action imposed by pickets when they lifted their crippling
blockades.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing volumes of fuel began to reach petrol stations
Thursday night as Prime Minister Tony Blair counted the cost of a
week-long dispute that threatened to paralyze the nation and that
seriously damaged his reputation for competent government.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Slowly but surely, tankers started restocking Britain's
empty filling stations Thursday. But the nation was warned that it
will not be back to normal for several days, and possibly weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The fuel crisis has inflicted immediate damage on the
government's standing with the voters, sending into reverse this
summer's improvement in Tony Blair's poll ratings, according to
the latest Gallup survey.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Awakening spirits guide the
hero girl from Deep Sea Dreaming to Djakapurra Munyarryun the
songman, who calls for the new generation of spirits.
</P>
<P>
Ingigenous people from across Australia and the Torres Strait
islands have united for this ceremony to awaken this site at
Homebush and welcome the world.
</P>
<P>
The spirits were drawn to the heartbeat of the land by the
chant and dance of the women of the Central Desert singing "The
Seven Emu Sisters". The women rebirthed the land and awakened its
spirit as ochre filled the air.
</P>
<P>
To the percussion of Kulups rattling, the men and women from
the Torres Strait Islands danced "Aumuller", the rhythm dance,
that celebrated the poeples and energies of the Torres Strait
Islands.
</P>
<P>
Songmen then began the Dhum Dhum dance of the red kangaroo, as
the Koorie clan of New South Wales dance to the clap of boomerangs.
Young men and women, the new generation of the host lands, revived
ancient steps celebrating their survival, and welcoming the
newcomers to their land.
</P>
<P>
The clan then ganthered around drums of burning eucalyptus
leaves, rekindling kinship and clensing this site on Darug lands.
The birthing of the Gjorn Gjorn, helpers of the ancestral creation
spirit hover. As the clans united they rekindled and demonstrated
their community, kinship and spiritual relationships with the land,
paying respect and honour to the Aboriginal language groups of
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
As the clans united, they birthed the Wandjina-ancestral
creation spirit and lawmaker. With a roar of thunder, the
Wandjina flung a lightening bolt to ignite the bushfire, that will
generate the land.
</P>
<P>
The "Awakening" music was desinged by David Page and Stephen
Page, with songman as Reginald Nundihirribala.

<HEADLINE> Opening Ceremony Commemorates History of Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The opening ceremony of the
Millennium Olympics is a celebration of Australia that began by
the sea, and returns to the harbour city after a journey through
the land and history.
</P>
<P>
The audience were taken on a journey through Australian history,
environment and culture by two characters, a little girl and the
traditional Aboriginal dancer Djakapurra.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that an Olympic Opening Ceremony has had
characters that reappeared in each segment, threading the ceremony
together into a whole.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony bursted into life when 120 stockmen on horses
thundered into the arena. They threw their hats into the crowd
and shot the time honoured Australian greeting "G'day".
</P>
<P>
The little girl walked to the center of the arena, spreaded out
a towel, put zinc cream on her nose, lay down and begun to dream
about Australia. She dreamed of the deep blue ocean, of jellyfish,
singrays and other sea creatures.
</P>
<P>
Her dream gave way Djakapurra, Aboriginal dancers and members
of tribes from all corners of the country, who formed circles
around burning eucalyptus leaves. They conjured a giant Wandjina,
a creation myth spirit symbolising the unity of indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
Firebreathers ignited the bush, regeneating the plants that
bloomed into a rippling sea of Australian wildflowers, trees and
animals. Djakapurra walked through the garden and found the
little girl hidden behind a flower.
</P>
<P>
Fire is a significant feature of the Australian landscape. It
was used by Aboriginal peoples to regenerate the bush, and the
great bushfires that can burn uncontrolled across the landscape
are a recuriing natural disaster, that has helped Australians'
relationship with the land.
</P>
<P>
A three person cycle peddled into the arena. At the center it
stopped to begin a segment that takes us on a journey through
enrly Europeana settlement, the struggle to open up and farm the
land, and on to the Australian suburban dream.
</P>
<P>
This is the cue for a series of groups to sweep into the arena.
They represented the successive waves of immigration, that has
transformed Australia into the cosmopolitan and diverse society it
is today.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A case has been filed Thursday
in a magistrate's court in Gopalganj, 230 kilometers southwest of
Dhaka, with sedition charges against 20 persons for planting a
powerful time bomb allegedly to kill Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
and her cabinet members on July 21, according to sources of the
ruling Awami League Friday.

container weighing 76 kgs was planted in the ground only 50 feet
from the rostrum from where Hasina had addressed a public rally.

when a local boy detected some wires protruding out from the
ground close to the rostrum. The boy informed local people who
conveyed to police and later an army team of explosive experts
retrieved the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Another similar bomb was found two days after the recovery of
the first bomb. The bomb was found near the Kotalipara helipad

<HEADLINE> Visit to UN Summit Very Successful: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
Pervez Musharraf has termed his visit to New York to attend the
United Nations Millennium Summit as very successful.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely happy and satisfied," he remarked in an opening
statement at a press conference at Karachi Airport immediately on
his return in the wee hours of Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Musharraf said
that he had delivered his Millennium speech before 150 heads of
states and governments projecting Pakistan's point of view and met
with 15 leaders and exchanged views with them.
</P>
<P>
He remarked that he was very satisfied that it was a very
successful trip and that "we were able to project Pakistan in a
very effective manner in every aspect."
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive said that he spoke clearly about the
Kashmir issue at the Millennium Summit and also discussed it with
the world leaders he talked to.
</P>
<P>
He said that his purpose is that the people should take
interest in the matter and think about resolution of this thorny
problem. "To that extent we have been successful," he added.
</P>
<P>
There is an awareness at the international level that Kashmir
is the security problem in the region and it is in the interest of
everyone to defuse the situation and settle the core issue,
observed Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
To another question, the chief executive said that Pakistan-U.S.
relations have their own dimensions and are not linked to U.S.-
India ties.
</P>
<P>
He said his view is that Pakistan's ties with the United States
should be seen independently and "we should not hook it on to US-

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Party Moves Motion to Condemn Police Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) Thursday moved a motion in Parliament
to condemn the raid of its offices by police, the Herald reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moving the motion, MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube said
the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-
pf) was using unlawful means to undermine his party ahead of
presidential elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Ncube told Parliament that the raid was "an attempt by Zanu-pf
to access MDC documents containing information about the party and
strategies for the forthcoming presidential elections".
</P>
<P>
Police searched for weapons in the MDC offices in Harare on
Thursday, but failed to find such things.
</P>
<P>
He urged the House to condemn the "harassment" by police and
called on the police not to act as an agent of Zanu-pf, but to be
political and professional in the discharge of their duties.
</P>
<P>
However, leader of the House Patrick Chinamasa, who is from the
Zanu-pf, said he noted the serious concerns of the MDC lawmakers,
but said it was unfortunate that they were not able to distinguish
between Zanu-pf and police.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Zanu-pf is not the police and the police are not Zanu-
pf."
</P>
<P>
Parliament could not give a judgment on an issue that had not
yet been concluded, said Chinamasa.
</P>
<P>
MDC Leader in Parliament Gibson Sibanda urged Minister of Home
Affair John Nkomo to restore the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said he would look into the matter and issue a statement
to Parliament on Tuesday next week.
</P>
<P>
The MDC Thursday also lodged an urgent application in the High
Court to prevent the police from further searching the party's
offices for arms of war. The court application was expected to be
heard Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Insecurity Rising in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
admitted that there is a serious upsurge of insecurity in the east
African country, the major newspaper East African Standard
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted State Minister Marsden Madoka as saying the
country is experiencing an increase of violent crime like cattle
rustling, banditry, political crimes and ethnic tension.
</P>
<P>
Madoka said on Thursday that deteriorated insecurity is
hampering economic development and he attributed the rising
insecurity to illegal arms from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"National security is at stake because of illegal aliens who
have crossed the borders secretly and the proliferation of
firearms is exacerbated by the conflicts in neighboring countries,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these illegal aliens have been found to engage in
criminal activities such as arms dealings, drug trafficking,
social and economic crimes," said Madoka.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is implementing strategies geared
towards equipping the police so that they can overcome challenges
of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
The government has also committed to improving the welfare of
officers by addressing their remuneration, housing and transport
facilities, according to Madoka.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) has urged the government to take measures to secure
fertilizer supply or the farmers may face a critical shortage of
urea in the coming agriculture season two months away, Times of
Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU President Ajay Vashee was quoted as saying here on
Thursday that there are indications that there would be a serious
shortage of urea on the world market and last minute contingencies
would only serve to hurt Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said that ZNFU is concerned about the preparations for the
2000-2001 farming season.
</P>
<P>
Vashee noted the country's fertilizer requirement stands
between 100,000 tons and 120,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
He said in Ndola, the capital city of Copperbelt province, that
his organization has urged the government to remove value added
tax (VAT) on all inputs for small farmers because the farmers have
no capacity to reclaim the VAT.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agriculture Minister Yotam Ngulube said that the
government is ready to help in the development of the small scale
farming sector.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Attorney-General Denies Corrupt Country Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Attorney General Amos
Wako has protested against the ranking of Kenyan among the ten
most corrupt countries in the world by the Transparency
International.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Germany-based organization's rating, which
placed Kenya 82nd out of 90 countries, Wako claimed the ranking
was unfair.
</P>
<P>
"We hear and know what is happening in a number of countries,"
he said. "I know what is happening in Kenya and the ranking cannot
be correct."
</P>
<P>
Wako said that the rating failed to acknowledge Kenya's anti-
graft measures in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He defended Kenya's record by citing the publication of the
Anti-corruption and Economic Crimes Bill and a code of conduct for
public servants.
</P>
<P>
The report, released on Tuesday by the organization, ranked
Nigeria as the most corrupt nation in the world, and acknowledged
the anti-graft measures can not bring about results overnight.
</P>
<P>
However Wako credited the organization with having done a good
job by sensitizing the international community to corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the ranking, the government is committed to a zero
tolerance policy towards corruption," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Fenced in 1.86 sq. km of area,
the Kunshan Export Processing Zone in east China's Jiangsu
Province has passed a state-level appraisal to become the first
operational foreign trade processing zone in the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest government body, approved 15
export processing zones including Kunshan in April.
</P>
<P>
Imported cargo through the zones can be exempt from tariffs and
other complicated local duties before being exported.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the zone marks a gradual shift in
processing trade, which has witnessed dramatic increase in the
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the operational area in Kunshan cost 100
million yuan (12 million US dollars), which will be expanded to 2.
86 km. The zone is equipped with electronic monitoring and
surveillance systems.
</P>
<P>
Companies in the zone are mainly engaged in producing
electronic appliances and components. These companies have
invested some 400 million US dollars in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Processing trade has squeezed half the share of China's export.
However, it has provided opportunities for smugglers by using fake
customs documents and dealing in counterfeit cargo. The fenced
area will greatly help curb smuggling activities.

<P>
HANGZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A powerful typhoon has
submerged 20,000 hectares of farmland, severely damaged more than
60 old seawalls and 224 boats in Zhoushan, east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
In Zhoushan, Typhoon "Saomai" also damaged 128 wharves,
destroyed 2,540 rooms and left two boats capsized, disaster relief
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the town areas in Zhoushan are under water. In the town
of Gaoting, water is as deep as one meter.
</P>
<P>
The government has evacuated more than 20,000 people to safety.
</P>
<P>
Saomai also wreaked havoc on Ningbo, another city in the
coastal province. The local education commission has requested
primary and second schools in the city to remain closed until the
typhoon has abated.
</P>
<P>
Vessels have started to stop transporting passengers across the
sea since September 13.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the Zhejiang Provincial Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters, the typhoon brought strong winds
and downpour in the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo was also hit by water and most of the districts are
submerged under 30-40 centimeters of water. Water in some
districts is one meter deep.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the tide has reached record high levels because
this is also traditionally a high-tide season.
</P>
<P>
The center of the typhoon is slowly moving northward.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon caused Japan's heaviest rain in a century on
Tuesday, triggering flooding and landslides that killed at least
seven people.

WELLINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's crude
petroleum production for the year from July 1999 to June 2000 was
1.27 million tons, 13.1 percent less than in the previous year,

WELLINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand sees
increasing homicides, hard drug offenses and sex crimes but
decreasing recorded crime in general, according to New Zealand
Police Commissioner Rob Robinson.
</P>
<P>
During the year from July 1999 to June 2000, total recorded
crime dropped 5.1 percent, which represented 23,000 fewer offenses,
Robinson said in the latest press release. He attributed the
reduction to cooperative work with community groups and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
There were 104 homicides in New Zealand with a population of 3.
8 million in the year, 10 more than the previous year and 2,641
grievous assaults, an 8.9-percent increase. Sexual violation was
up 3.5 percent with 744 cases reported.

<P>
Despite the increase in homicides, the resolution rates
increased to 78 percent from 70 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Wellington, crime was down 4.7 percent,
but there were 45 hard drug crimes recorded, a 102.3-percent

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Drops Ahead of Rate Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso was
slightly weaker against the U.S. dollar early Friday ahead of the
country's central bank's possible further intervention.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 45.615, weaker compared to the previous close
of 45.605.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said banks stayed at the sidelines, keeping a watchful
eye for another rate hike announcement.
</P>
<P>
"Banks are on guard and are not too enthusiastic for the dollar
pending the rate hike announcement," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The policy-making Monetary Board meets Friday to decide whether
it will raise overnight rates again to further ease pressure on
the peso which dived to a new 32-month intra-day low of 45.950
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank raised its overnight borrowing rate to 11%
from 10% and its overnight lending rate to 13.25% from 12.25%
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the peso is seen trading within a tight 45.6 to 45.
8 range against the dollar for the rest of Friday's session, but
may have a chance to test the 45.5 support level in case the
central bank raises its overnight rates again.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Support for the major
ruling party, the Labor Party, has slumped, with its main rival,
the National Party, surging ahead for the first time since the
November election, according to a local poll published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Business Review-Compaq poll of 750 people puts
support for the major opposition party, the National Party, at 41
percent, ahead of the Labor Party on 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party's support is well down from a post-election
high of 48 percent recorded by the same poll in March 1999, at
which time the then ruling party, the National Party, was polling
at its lowest ever level, 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers here attribute the falling support for the Labor
Party mainly to the drops of the country's business confidence and
the New Zealand dollar to record lows.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Weakens Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- High demand for U.S. dollars
in the energy sector, coupled with low supply of the currency, has
further weakened Kenyan shilling this week.
</P>
<P>
The shilling weakened to an average of 78.08 shillings to the
dollar on Thursday from 72 shillings in early August, the major
newspaper Daily Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said that the Kenya Power and Lighting Company
placed an order for 6 million dollars last week to import fuels
and generators, which was suspected to have weakened the shilling
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the shilling could still remain weak for
some time if demand persists, adding that proceeds from tea
exports were slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Kanga, the chief economist with the Central Bank of
Kenya, said he was sure an inflation target of five percent by the
end of the financial year in June 2001 would be met despite upward
pressure from a weak shilling, drought and higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
An acute drought which has caused severe food shortages, water
and electricity rationing had led some economists to conclude that
Kenya would miss its inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's inflation dropped from a peak of 46 percent in 1993 to
3.5 percent last year. Inflation in the first half of this year
rose to 6.7 percent, partly due to drought, but figures for July
and August showed a dip to 5.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Not to Intervene as Baht Hits 25-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht slipped to a 25-
month low against the U.S. dollar Thursday and appeared set to
reach the 42-baht level, but Bank of Thailand (BOT) sees no need
at the moment to intervene in the market to prop up the currency,
The Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The baht's weakness raised concern that the continuing currency
slide could break the central bank's 3.5-percent inflation target,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the baht weakness to sustained dollar demand,
both offshore and domestic, triggered by political uncertainty and
unfavorable sentiment toward regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
Chatu Mongol Sonakul, the BOT governor, was quoted as saying
the baht is simply tracking regional currency weakness and his
bank won't intervene at this point.
</P>
<P>
However, he didn't say when the central bank would intervene.
</P>
<P>
The baht Thursday briefly dove to 41.86 against the greenback
in early trade before bouncing back to 41.7 in the afternoon
session.
</P>
<P>
A senior dealer at a Thai bank said that if the baht continued
to fall it would have some impact on the central bank's inflation
target.
</P>
<P>
It is widely anticipated that if the baht fell to 42 against
the greenback it would effectively force the BOT to jack up short-
term interest rates in a bid to tame inflation.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said he was
concerned about the falling baht and would raise the issue with
the central bank at the economic ministers' meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Although the government would like to maintain its non-
interference policy at the central bank, the weak baht and low
interest rates worry us and we have to talk with the central bank
about these issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the baht was partly undermined by bearish
sentiment on regional currencies sparked by Wednesday's bombing of
the Jakarta stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Many have said the baht is poised to fall further as the BOT
signaled that it would counter the weakened baht with a low
interest-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
The signal is evident in the central bank's recent request that
commercial banks lower their lending rates to help bolster the
persistently sluggish economy. Many banks have trimmed both
deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points.
</P>
<P>
The baht has also been affected by political uncertainty ahead
of the general election, which must be called by November.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Bombing Kills 4, Injures 20 in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A suicide bomber of the
separatist Tamil Tiger rebels of Sri Lanka exploded himself here
on Friday morning, killing four people and injuring more than 20
others, police said.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place near the National Hospital in the heart of
Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka. It is still unknown whom the
suicide bomber had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports have warned that about 20 Tamil Tiger
suicide bombers had infiltrated Colombo to target both government
and opposition politicians who are busy with election campaigns
for the forthcoming general elections scheduled for October 10.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 political parties and 99 independent groups will
contest the general elections with the ruling People's Alliance
and main opposition United National Party as arch rivals.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the dissolution of the parliament on August 18,
election-related violence is on rapid increase in the country
which is haunted by successive violence especially in the election
campaign. The government has blamed most of the violent incidents
on the Tamil Tiger rebels, whose formidable suicide bombers are
frequent attackers.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga narrowly escaped an
assassination attempt during last December's presidential election
but lost her vision in the right eye. A suicide bomber of Tamil
Tiger rebels carried out the attack.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Looking Good: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Having already grown by 17
percent year-on-year in the first eight months of this year,
Thailand's exports will exceed this year's target, Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai was quoted Friday by The Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Thai export sector has performed exceptionally well despite
the challenges posed by the crisis, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The country's export during the first seven months grew by 21.3
percent to 39 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Along with the upswing in exports, the government is also
encouraged by the continuing fall in unemployment, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Businesses with more than 10 workers have been hiring more
people over the last year, according to the social security office.

<P>
Before the crisis hit Thailand in 1997, about 6.2 million
workers contributed to the social security fund. By early last
year when unemployment was at its peak, the number of workers
contributing to the fund fell to 5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The employment situation has improved to the point that about 5.
92 million workers now contribute to the fund, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Ministry has recently revised the
country's export target for the whole year to a growth rate of 9.5
to 12 percent, from the previous forecast of a 6-percent growth,
or 56.4 billion dollars in total.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the revised target should not be difficult to reach.
To achieve it, he said, exporters will have to focus more on
market demand and international standard requirements.

<HEADLINE> Spain Hopes to Grab 15 Medals in Syndey Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Spain will compete to their
best to grab at least 15 medals at the Syndey Olympic Games, said
Spainish Olympic Committee president here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Alfredo Goyeneche said "Spain has
fielded in a contigent of similar scale with that in Atlanta, and
hope to achieve 15 to 20 medals in Syndey."
</P>
<P>
Goyeneche revealed that the medal hopefuls for Spain are those
events of marathon, mountain bike, yachting, judo and swimming,
with World Cup double champion Margarita Fullana in particular
from the women's mountain bike.
</P>
<P>
"She has the potentials to help Spain achieve five to six gold
medals," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Fulluna, who finished first in the World Championships in Are,
Sweden, in 1999, got the nickname "Spidergirl" for her climbing
proficiency, and her ability to ascend with remarkable power and
agility.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old woman, with a height of 1.70 meters, had a
gruelling season in 1998 that included a crash at the World
Championships. She then teamed with trainer Gert-Jan Theunisse and
began a low-impact regimen that included swimming, in-line skating
and certain elements of gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Spain had garnered 17 medals including five golds,
a sharp drop from the 1992 Barcelona Olympics where they finished
with 25 medals with 13 golds.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks No Less than Three Golds in Women's Weightlifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China's women lifters are
trying to win at least three gold medals at the Sydney Olympic
weightlifting tournaments which start on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China, women's weightlifting powerhouse, is sending four girls
to the Olympics and has confidence to grab at least three out of
four gold medals, headcoach Zhang Wenxi told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We may bag all four golds but we don't want to say that way
because anything is possible." Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's lifters will vie for gold medals in the 53-
kg category with Yang Xia, 63-kg through Chen Xiaomin, 69-kg with
Lin Weining and over-70-kg class with Ding Weiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaomin could become the easiest gold medalist for China
after Chen Rui-lien of Chinese Taipei, who won world title in the
event from 1996-99, was tested positive in March for Metandiemone,
an anabolic steroid. Chen was banned from the Olympics last week.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaomin was former world record holder when she lifted 107.
5 kilograms in the 64-kg category snatch for a new mark in Asian
Championships in 1997. With Chen Rui-Lien suspended, she has no
other strong challengers in the category.
</P>
<P>
For Yang Xia, it would be much difficult to win the gold medal.
The 23-year-old has to overcome the challenge from Li Fengying of
Chinese Taipei. Li won the world champion and set the world mark
of 121.5 kilograms in the clean and jerk last year.
</P>
<P>
Ding Meiyuan, winner of last year's world championships in
Athens with a total of 285 kilograms, will also has to perform
well when she meets Poland's Agata Wrobel.
</P>
<P>
Wrobel twice smashed the world jerk record in the over-75-kg
and set a new mark of 160 kgs at the European championships in
Sofia on April 28. Her total results of 293 kgs also surpassed
Ding's 285 kgs in the world championships last year.
</P>
<P>
"So we have to be cautious and don't say we can win this gold
although Ding lifted many times more than 293 kgs in the practices,
" Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang rated Yang Xia's performance crucial to realize China's
medal goal. "Because she compete as an opener. You known there is
a saying that 'good begin half way'," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Lin Weining, as same as Chen Xiaomin, will miss her arch-rival
Wu Mei-yi of Chinese Taipei and could hand the gold in the 75-kg
to China if she beats Kim-Soon-hee from South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Officials of Indonesia, East Timor Discuss Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Senior Indonesian officials
held closed-door meetings in Bali with East Timor leader Xanana
Gusmao and U.N. officials late on Thursday, reports reaching here
Friday said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first encounter between Indonesian government
officials on the one hand and East Timorese leaders and U.N.
officials on the other since an attack left three U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) workers dead in Atambua,
Indonesia, last week.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Indonesian delegation Coordinating Minister for
Political, Social and Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
said the meeting was aimed at "finding a comprehensive settlement
to the East Timor refugee issue." But Gusmao hinted that the talks
also touched on cross-border incidents.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the meeting, Indonesian officials also held talks with
pro-Jakarta East Timorese militia leaders in Bali.
</P>
<P>
One of the East Timorese militia leaders, Eurico Guterres, said
after the meeting that the Indonesian government offered East
Timorese refugees a vacant island to live on.
</P>
<P>
"I accept the offer as a token of appreciation form the
government of Indonesia. But I don't know what sort of island it
will be."
</P>
<P>
There are still 130,000 East Timorese refugees in Indonesia's
East Nusa Tenggara Province. They left their homes after last year
's U.N.-sponsored vote during which most people voted for
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But, in the past few months conflicts between East Timorese
militiamen and U.N. peacekeeping forces have been increasing and
several U.N. soldiers were killed along the border areas.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, the pro-Jakarta militia killed three UNHCR
workers in Atambua,a city in East Nusa Tenggara Province of
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Two French Journalists Said to Be Freed Within 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government
negotiators are hopeful that two French journalists being held
hostage by the Abu Sayyaf in the southern Philippines will be
freed in the next 24 hours, a TV report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and Roland Madura of the France-2
Television Channel should have been freed last week if not for a
squabble over money between two Abu Sayyaf factions, the ABS-CBN
TV network said.
</P>
<P>
The two French journalists were abducted in July when
interviewing the 21 Sipadan hostages late April. But 20 of the
Sipadan hostages have since won freedom.
</P>
<P>
Former Libyan Ambassador Rajab Azzarouq was quoted as saying
that while they are hopeful, there is nothing definite. "The
negotiation process has already matured" and they "only have to
implement it," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado, on the other
hand,refused to confirm the possible release Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Aventajado told him
that something would happen in the negotiations by Friday or
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Extends State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The state of emergency in Sri
Lanka has been extended till October 4 by voting in the parliament
which was re-summoned Thursday following its dissolution on August
18.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga re-summoned the parliament to
debate on her proclamation of the extension from September 4 to
October 4. Under the constitution, such extension requires
approval of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament voted for the extension by 101 votes in favor
and five against. While the main opposition United National Party
abstained from voting, four Tamil United Liberation Front members
and one member of the Sri Lanka People's Front opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency needed to be extended because of the
ongoing civil war in the country's north and east, where the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been fighting a bloody war
against government troops for 17 years for a separate state for
minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Security reports indicated that the Tiger rebels are targeting
leading politicians of both the government and opposition in the
run-up to the elections scheduled for October 10. On earlier
occasions too they had sent suicide bombers to attack southern
politicians and President Kumaratunga was herself such a target
during last December's presidential election. She escaped the
assassination attempt with the loss of her vision in the right eye
and some other minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency allows for special security measures to
be adopted. But under the constitution the election cannot be held
under a state of emergency. With its expiration on October 4, it
may not be extended again till after the election.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-U.S. Air Trade Grows 14 Percent Annually in Last Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The value of air trade
between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN)has seen an average annual growth rate of 14
percent during the last decade,according to a report issued by the
U.S.-ASEAN Business Council here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by a visiting delegation of top officials
from the U.S.-based council, said that in the 1990-1999 period,
the value of U.S.-ASEAN trade by air route increased from 20.3
billion U.S. dollars to 67.6 billion dollars, equal to 6.5 percent
of the gross domestic product of the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Two-way air trade also has created 350,000 jobs in the region,
it said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai earlier
this week, the delegation said that as regional production of high-
technology items increases, the need for air trade services in
ASEAN countries will grow at an estimated 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also urged the ASEAN countries to fully
liberalize the air trade market and adopt an "open-sky" policy to
further boost the trade.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Indonesia, Brunei, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank To Buy Euros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
announced Thursday that it would buy 2.5 billion euros with the
interest income from foreign currency reserves, but didn't mention
whether the move is designed to support the sagging euro.
</P>
<P>
But ECB Chairman Wim Duisenberg was quoted by the German press,
saying "if you want, you can describe the measure as intervention.
"
</P>
<P>
According to an ECB statement, at the beginning of 1999, the
bank was provided with foreign reserve assets with a then-market
value of about 39.5 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
The ECB holdings of foreign currencies have increased by over 2.
5 billion euros after being invested, and the interest income
comprises mostly US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the announcement, the exchange rate of euros
to US dollars increased to 1:0.8738 at the Frankfurt market, but
fell again to 1:0.8680.
</P>
<P>
The euro has been steadily falling in recent months and dropped
to a historic low of 85.64 U.S. cents before the ECB' announcement.

<HEADLINE> Athens Olympics Organizers Reject Charges of Overspending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Athens 2004 Olympics
organizers rejected accusations of overspending from politicians
and the media on Thursday and denied that their salaries were too
high.
</P>
<P>
Politicians were outraged when newspapers reported earlier this
week that some organizing committee (ATHOC) staff were earning 10
million drachmas (256,800 U.S. dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any Greek should be paid this kind of money...
which is four times the prime minister's salary," ruling socialist
party deputy and former sports minister George Lianis said in an
Athens radio station.
</P>
<P>
ATHOC counter-attacked in a statement saying that the
government had yet to decide remuneration for board members and
the salaries of their staff were below-market.
</P>
<P>
"Athens 2004 executives know their responsibilities well," the
statement said. "Greece is called to overcome in the next four
years problems that have tested...great countries."
</P>
<P>
ATHOC has been under tremendous pressure from the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) to speed up long-delayed preparations for
the Games.
</P>
<P>
Delays mainly in venues construction and other areas had forced
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch to give serious warnings to
Athens in April. Impressive progress however had been made ever
since.
</P>
<P>
The salaries row erupted when Culture Minister Theodoros
Pangalos, who has most of the government responsibility for the
Olympics preparations, cancelled plans to join other Greek
officials at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The media suggested that the minister was angry with ATHOC for
overspending and over the salaries of some committee members.
Pangalos denied the reports, saying he had too much work in Athens.

<HEADLINE> Koreans March under "Unification" Flag for Opening Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, DPR Korea
and South Korea will march side by side under a "unification" flag
with a simple name "Korea" at the opening ceremony of the
Millennium Olympic Games here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
They will wear unified uniforms of dark blue jackets and beige
pants with a badge bearing a blue map of the Korean peninsula,
which were made in Seoul and paid by IOC at a cost of US dollars
30,000 dollars, sources said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Koreas formed unified teams for the World Table
Tennis and Youth Soccer Championships, but never marched together
at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
And it will also be the first time since 1956 when East and
West Germany had their athletes walking side by side in the
Melbourne Olympics.
</P>
<P>
When the opening ceremony in Sydney will miss their national
flags, the Koreas, however, will compete under their own flags and
names in the fortnight games.
</P>

SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) might consider to cut the number of people
involved in Summer Games in the future.
</P>
<P>
IOC said on Friday it would discuss the scale of the games when
Olympic chiefs review the Sydney games after it finishes.
</P>
<P>
IOC director general Francois Carrard said he did not believe
the Games, which open on Friday, were getting too big to handle.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "We will have a postmortem as quickly as possible
after the Sydney Games to see what is really the impact of these
numbers.
</P>
<P>
"The media is 21,000 here. It was around 12,000 in Barcelona (
at the 1992 Games). Everywhere there are increases and we have to
watch that very closely and monitor it. The IOC will sit down and
reconsider where we could possibly put some limits."
</P>
<P>
Triathlon, women's weightlifting and taekwondo will all be
medal events for the first time in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Little Chance for Chinese Men's Lifters for Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese men's weightlifters,
who won two gold medals at the Atlanta Olympic four years ago,
will be hard to take even single gold at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We never guaranteed we could win a gold medal in Sydney even
before Shi Zhiyong withdrew," said Yang Hanxiong, head coach of
the Chinese men's team.
</P>
<P>
Shi, China's gold hopeful in the men's 62-kg category, decided
to quit the Games days before the Chinese team left for Sydney due
to his wrist injury, which he had suffered for nearly two months,
leaving his teammate Le Maosheng the only Chinese lifter in the
class.  The 20-year-old Shi snatched a
world record of 152.5 kilograms at the Asian Weightlifting
Championships in Japan in May to surpass his own world mark of 147.
5-kg set last year in Greece.
</P>
<P>
"He is our number one in the 62-kg and his withdrawal is
certainly an affection to our goal for the gold medal here," Yang
said. "There is nobody who can take his place in our team."
</P>
<P>
Le, world champion in the 62-kg totaling at 320 kilograms after
setting a world record of 180.5 kilograms in the clean and jerk
lift last year in Greece, now will face challengers from Sevdalin
Minchev of Bulgaria, who tops world rankings, and Leonidas Sabanis
of Greece and Nikolai Peshalov of Croatia, as well as Turkey's "
Pocket Hercules" Naim Suleymanoglu, who cameback from three years
retirement for his consecutive fourth Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for Le to win the gold," Yang said. "Though
Le's form is good but his opponents are much better than I had
thought. However, as long as there is a hope, we will try our best.
The medal for the gold is better, the silver or bronze is also
nice." Zhan Xuegang, gold medalist in the 70-kg class four year's
ago in Atlanta, is another China's hopeful to take a gold. Zhan,
however, will compete in the 77-kg class this time and it seems
more hard to succeed.
</P>
<P>
"He had suffered a injury on his back and just recovered a few
months, I am not sure of his victory," said Yang, who himself
coached Zhan for the gold in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zhan placed world fourth with a total of 365
kilograms in the 77-kg class. "His opponents became more
stronger after last year's world championships. So Zhan will have
a hard-fought competition next week," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 77-kg category, Zlajan Vanev of Bulgaria is one of
the favorites, followed by Badr Saelem of Qatar, Victor Mitrou of
Greece and Khalatur Kyapanaktshyan of Armenia.  China also sent
four other men's lifters in Sydney, without any hope for the gold.
Zhang Xiangxiang and Wu Wenxiong will be in the 56-kg category
while Zhang Guozheng and Wan Jianhui in 59-kg.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) --South China's Guangdong
Province set a new record by exporting 8.56 billion U.S. dollars
worth of commodities in August.
</P>
<P>
Local customs statistics show that the province did 108.92
billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign trade from January to August,
up 26.6 percent from the same period last year or accounting for
36.1 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
In a breakdown, exports over the past eight months brought in
59.35 billion U.S. dollars, up 26.4 percent, while imports were 49.
57 billion U.S. dollars, up 26.8 percent. Import and export in
August alone stood at 15.66 billion U.S. dollars, up 21.5 percent
from August of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of the province's exports and imports were done through
the processing trade. Though the province completed 65.9 percent
of its pre-set export goal for this year in eight months, the
increasing export rate is lower than the national average growing
export rate and has continued to fall.

<HEADLINE> Ducks Ready to Fight Locusts in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to transport
more ducks by air to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to eat
locusts that have been threatening the farmland there.
</P>
<P>
"If it is not cold in Xinjiang, my second group of 'duck
soldiers' will go to the region by plane to fight crop-eating
locusts this month," said Yang Dayuan, a farmer in the Tianping
village, east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
In June, 30,000 ducks raised by Yang were shipped by air to
Xinjiang and ate up millions of locusts in one of the region's
worst plagues in decades. A duck is able to eat half a kilogram of
locusts a day.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.6 million hectares of grassland in northwestern China
region were attacked by locusts this year.
</P>
<P>
Finding that Yang's ducks have great fighting capability,
Xinjiang wants more assistance from Yang.
</P>
<P>
A researcher at the Zhejiang Academy of Agriculture Science, Lu
Lizhi, said that using planes that spray pesticides to kill the
locusts is very expensive and can cause pollution.
</P>
<P>
Using ducks, however, is environmentally friendly. Plus, along
with the ducks eating the locusts they can also eat their eggs.
</P>
<P>
Since the ducks' main diet consists of high-protein locusts,
they will grow healthy and fast and will get a higher price on the
market after they retire from pest-control duty.
</P>
<P>
Yang revealed that he plans to sell another 300,000 ducks to
Xinjiang next year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Send Special Envoy to UN for Atambua Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will soon send a special envoy to the United Nations headquarters
in New York to discuss settlement of the Atambua incident, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy will leave for New York on September 16,
Antara News Agency Friday quoted Cabinet Secretary Marsillam
Simanjontak as saying. But he did not disclose the envoy's name.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from New York quoted Indonesian Foreign
Minister Alwi Shihab as saying President Abdurrahman Wahid would
assign Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security
Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to go to New York to talk with
the U.N. Security Council about the settlement of the Atambua
incident.
</P>
<P>
In the incident on September 6, a mob of pro-Jakarta East
Timorese militia attacked and burned the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua, a city in East Nusa Tenggara
Province of Indonesia, killing three of the U.N. agency's relief
workers.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the U.N. Security Council has agreed to
drop its plan to send a special mission to investigate the Atambua
incident and instead assign a team consisting of foreign diplomats
posted in Jakarta to do the job, Marsillam Simanjontak told the
press Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council has agreed it is not necessary to
send a special mission to Atambua as the job can as well be done
by the diplomatic representatives of several countries in Jakarta,
" he said after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government would invite the foreign envoys to go
to Atambua, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Atambua incident ignited strong international criticism and
on September 8, the U.N. Security Council decided to send a
special mission to Indonesia to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
After East Timor got independence in August last year from
Indonesia, more than 200,000 refugees came to Indonesia to avoid
the violence there.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 130,000 East Timorese refugees are still living
in camps in parts of East Nusa Tenggara near the border with East
Timor.

</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh made the remarks in reply to a

<P>
In the process, Thanh noted, U.S. President Clinton has made
significant contributions to promoting the two countries'

<HEADLINE> Over 5 Million Child Laborers in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 5 million children
and teen-agers in Mexico work for 5 to 8 dollars a day, an
official report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A study of the National System for Complete Family Development
(DIF) stated that 64 percent of Mexican children work in farming,
fishing and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, entitled "Prevention, Attention,
Discouragement and Eradication of Childhood Labor," about 28
percent of child laborers work in northern Mexico, where they are
engaged in agricultural work. They work, on average, 9 or 13 hours
a day in the countryside for less than 8 dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, over 10,000 children aged 6 to 14 work on the
streets. About 45 percent of them work in big cities, especially
in Mexico City, the capital of the country, and in tourist sites
and border areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 percent of the children survive by begging, 24 percent
by selling goods, and others by doing subcontracting work.
</P>
<P>
About 8 out of every 10 kids begin working before they are 14
years old, and their average daily income, in cities, is barely
over 5 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The phenomenon of child labor is linked to poverty, social
inequality and the absence of the possibility to go to school,"
the report said.

<P>
LISBON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Spanish King Juan Carlos I,
ending his 4-day visit to Portugal, said Thursday in an address to
the Portuguese Congress that his country must be firm in the fight
against the Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
No one should be weak before assassinations and violence and no
one should hesitate in the fight against terrorism, said Juan
Carlos.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said he stands
firmly behind Spain in its fight against terrorism, according to
media reports here.
</P>
<P>
ETA has been held responsible for the deaths of 781 people in
its 32 years of armed struggle for self-determination in northern
Spain and southern France, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Its summer offensive of bombings and assassinations has been
the bloodiest in a decade.
</P>
<P>
ETA's official political wing said Thursday that King Juan
Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar "would not be welcome"
in Hernani, a Basque separatist stronghold where they were
expected to visit Saturday with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, Spanish police arrested 20 members of EKIN,
ETA's underground leadership unit, in a series of raids across the
country.

SAN JOSE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Arenal volcano,
considered one of the most dangerous in Costa Rica, has been
active since last month, experts at the Costa Rican Volcanology
and Seismology Observatory said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The volcano, about 190 kilometers northeast of San Jose, keeps
on spewing out gases and lava. But volcanologist Rodolfo Van der
Laat told Xinhua that the activity is "normal."
</P>
<P>
He said lava began to spew out of the volcano after an
avalanche took place on August 23.
</P>
<P>
The Arenal volcano area has become a major tourist site in the
past few years, but volcanology experts said that at least two of
the tourist areas are located in high-risk parts.

Since August 23 the five-kilometer radius around the volcano

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate to Vote on China Trade Bill Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on
Thursday rejected the last six proposed amendments to a bill
granting a permanent normal trade relations status (PNTR) to China,
and is scheduled to vote on the legislation next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since it began debates on the legislation on September 5, the
Senate have defeated a total of 19 amendments trying to link the
PNTR bill with human rights, prison labor, abortion, weapons
proliferation and other issues.
</P>
<P>
One of the six amendments defeated on Thursday was a measure
proposed by Senator Ernest Hollings on trade deficits with China.
</P>
<P>
The biggest hurdle to the passage of an amendment-free PNTR
bill was cleared on Wednesday when the Senate defeated by a vote
of 65-32 an amendment proposed by Senator Fred Thompson and
Senator Robert Torricelli on weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Senators have agreed to hold a six-hour closing debate before
Tuesday's historic vote on the legislation, which would bring an
end to the annual review of China's trade status if signed into
law.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives 237-197 in
May this year, is strongly supported by most senators, the Clinton
administration and the business community eager to do business
with China.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill are now more confident that it would
carry the Senate by a large margin on September 19.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Jake Siewert said that about 70 of the
100 Senators have publicly expressed their support to the bill.
</P>
<P>
"It's a done deal," said Myron Brilliant, managing director for
Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton will visit Vietnam in November, the first of its kind
since the end of the Vietnam War 25 years ago, the White House
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart said the trip, which will
take place after Clinton attends the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) summit in mid-November in Brunei, would both be
substantive and symbolic.
</P>
<P>
"The president believes that ... consensus has developed in
this country over the last few years that the time was right to
move forward with this relationship," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton "will address the range of issues we hope to
advance with the people and government of Vietnam following the
normalization of our ties with their country."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman listed several issues Washington hoped to deal
with during Clinton's visit to Vietnam, which is expected to last
a few days.
</P>
<P>
"Trade is one of them; accounting for U.S. servicemen; and we
have a joint cooperative effort on looking at the impact of Agent
Orange," Lockhart said, referring to a defoliant used by the U.S.
forces during the War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Vietnam have signed a landmark deal this year,
paving the way for normal trade relations between the two
countries. The agreement is yet to be ratified by the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Chile Gears Up for World Cup Qualifier against Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chile's national soccer team,
coached by Nelson Acosta, is taking every measures for their next
match in the regional qualification for the 2002 World Cup finals
to be hosted by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
And things are being done to minimize the effect of the high
altitude -- 2,850 meters above sea level -- in Quito, where they
will take on Ecuador October 8, Chilean newspaper "la Segunda"
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Chile face off in Olimpico Atahualpa stadium in the
Ecuadorian capital, in a ninth-round South American qualifying
game for the 2002 World Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
Italo Traverso, the physical trainer for the Chilean team, told
the local press that the Chilean squad will arrive five or six
days before the game to get accustomed to the difference in
altitude.
</P>
<P>
Traverso is currently in Quito along with the administrator of
the Chilean Soccer Federation (FCHF), Pablo Hoffman, to set the
schedule for the team's pre-game training.
</P>
<P>
The Chileans had arrived in high-altitude cities on the day of
the game and the sudden change of altitude usually caused problems
to the players. "We had a bad experience in La Paz of Bolivia,
where four or five of our players were almost unable to play
because they couldn't adjust to the change," Traverso explained.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said that the team had always been treated cordially in
Ecuador and so he didn't foresee any type of problems.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a good stay and, especially, a good game.
Regardless of who wins, whether we do or they do, because both
team are after the same thing: a win," Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
"Chile will arrive in Quito on Tuesday, October 3, and we have
yet to decide if we will leave the city on the same day after the
game, or the next morning," the Chilean coach said.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- As Australia are sure to grab
the first Olympic gold medal in the women's triathlon, the world's
best are cornered to stop the hosts from sweeping the top three in
the curtain-raiser of the Millennium Olympics on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Australian women filled the first five places in last year's
World Championships and have won eight of the last nine world
titles, and the final three quotas for the hosts were alloted to
Michellie Jones, Nicole Hackett and Loretta Harrop.
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Jones, 31, has piled her titles over the last 10
years, including back-to-back world titles in 1992-93, and has
been honored as the queen of the sport.
</P>
<P>
Hackett, 21, and Harrop, 25, are the reigning and former
winners of the World Championships. Being fearsome swimmers, both
are expected to line up side by side to open up a sustainable lead
going into the run.
</P>
<P>
"We all know how many people watch the Olympics and it's
fantastic for our sport to open up the Games," said Jones.
</P>
<P>
Challenging the sure bets from the hosts are another 45 world-
class athletes, paced by the American triple Jennifer Gutierrez,
Sheila Taormina and Joanna Zeiger as Taormina is the member of the
U.S. swimming champion team in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Swiss pair Magali Messmer and Brigitte McMahon and Canada's
Sharon Donnelly are likely to challenge the hosts on the bikes,
while Carol Montgomery of Canada, runner-up in the world
championship, is surely the best runner in the field.
</P>
<P>
Montgomery is confident of outracing the Australians if she can
stay reasonably in touch, saying that "if I'm in touch then I hope
I can reel them in."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Officials Link Blast to Soeharto Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Speculation mounted here that
supporters of Indonesia's former President Soeharto might be
behind the car bombing and fire at the Jakarta Stock Exchange
Wednesday which killed 15 people on site.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid Thursday demanded quick arrests of
those responsible for the incident, even if it meant hauling in
high-profile individuals and military personnel, The Indonesian
Observer daily Friday reported.
</P>
<P>
"I want the police chief and the attorney general not to
hesitate to act against suspects regardless of their position or
status,"Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak quoted Wahid as
saying during a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There are no sacred cows in this country," the president
reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said Wahid ordered the
military commander to join the police investigation. He complained
that investigators were being frustrated by certain members of the
Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI).
</P>
<P>
Bombings have coincided with every major stage of the
investigation of Soeharto, but no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded in a bus just before Soeharto's case went
before the court two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Police said a military-type explosive, similar to that used in
another car bombing at the Philippine ambassador's house in
Jakarta on August 1, had caused Wednesday's blast. But no positive
linking has been found between the two fatal attacks.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's blast rocked the capital's downtown financial
district just a day before a court resumed hearings on corruption
charges against Soeharto, who ruled Indonesia with military
support for 32 years until violent demonstrations forced him out
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It may be linked to the trial of Soeharto," said Coordinating
Minister for Economy Rizal Ramli.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the cabinet on Thursday, National Police chief
Gen.Rusdihardjo described the attack as the work of "professionals.
" He downplayed suggestions that international terrorists were
involved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several office buildings in Jakarta and the second
biggest city of Surabaya received bomb threats Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bagach to be Outsiders of Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandr Bagach of Ukraine
could be excluded from the Sydney Olympic Games due to drugs
offence.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old shot putter, bronze medalist at the Atlanta
Olympics four years ago, was cleared by his national federation
after being tested positive this year for anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) spokesman
Giorgio Reineri said on Friday the federation's doping committee
had recommended the case be sent to arbitration. He said the
council would consider the recommendation at a meeting next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The council invariably accepts the decisions of its own
committee and under IAAF rules Bagach would then be suspended
pending the arbitration panel's decision. Arbitration hearings
take several weeks to convene.
</P>
<P>
Bagach was disqualified after testing positive for the male
hormone testosterone at the 1989 European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Eight years later he was again disqualified for a positive test
for the stimulant ephedrine after winning the gold medal at the
Athens world championships.

SYDNEY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Michael Lohberg, a German-born
trainer and psychologist who is now coach of the Brazilian
swimming team, said "clean swimmers" would not win any medals in
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"Either the athlete is claean or they fight for a medal," said
Lohberg, who now trains three Brazilian swimmers including
freestyle sensation Fernando Scherer.
</P>
<P>
"The test is a farce. It serves literally as an alibi for the
International Olympic Committee. The fact that nobody has been
caught in the past few months doesn't mean a thing." Lohberg said.
</P>
<P>
Lohberg said: "Nobody trains in another way. The Brazilians
train like the Americans, like the Russians. An athlete has to
choose whether he is clean or he wins a medal."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday urged all the parties concerned in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to observe one-day ceasefire
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Games began today in Australia when a worldwide
ceasefire is observed.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said he
made the appeal so that the third and final polio vaccination
round can be carried out in the country.
</P>
<P>
Annan trusted that a peaceful and secure environment will be
provided to allow the World Health Organization and the United
Nations Children's Fund to give all Congolese children under the
age of five protection from the crippling disease of polio.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in DRC broke out in August 1998 when rebels, backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, accused DRC President Laurent Kabila of
corruption and harboring Hutu militiamen who fled Rwanda after
committing genocide there in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached by Italian Government, Truckers Averts Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deal, agreed with the Transport Ministry and the fuel
companies after long talks will give truckers new fuel discounts
and prevent the kind of chaos that has plagued Britain, France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In those countries truckers have blockaded refineries and other
major industrial hubs in protest at high fuel costs caused by the
soaring U.S. dollar and the recent surge in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The deal, said Italian Transport Minister Pierluigi Bersani, is
"first of all reasonable and satisfies everyone's demands."
</P>
<P>
The deal will enable Bersani to go to a European Union
transport ministers' meeting in Brussels next Wednesday with an
example of how such disputes can be settled.
</P>
<P>
The accord is in four points, namely, 1) immediate monitoring
and prompt resolution of bureaucratic problems holding back the
rationalization of the Italian fuel distribution system; 2) a cut
in the duty on diesel fuel for haulier using trucks heavier than 3.
5 tons, backdated to September 1 and lasting until the end of the
year, and equal to 120 lire per liter; 3) starting talks to see
whether tax breaks lined up under a carbon-tax law can be speeded
up and; 4) a further tax break on the income of truckers with
vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tons.
</P>
<P>
Bersani also invited the fuel companies to see how fast they
can start bringing down the price of diesel. The first assessment
of this will take place on October 2.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the minister said he was ready to take further
measures, depending on how the markets go.
</P>
<P>
The Italian truckers' association Cuna on Friday said it had
called a meeting of all European Union hauliers to advertise what
they see as a ground-breaking deal reached with the Italian
government.
</P>
<P>
The truckers' summit will take place in Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cuna said the meeting would examine the crisis that has hit the
trucking sector because of the high cost of diesel.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Supplies Returning to UK Petrol Stations. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government said on
Friday that some 25 percent of the country's 13,000 petrol
stations should have fuel by the end of Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the number of designated fuel stations
was increased from 2,500 to 3,300 -- 298 of which were for
essential users only .
</P>
<P>
But motorists were still being warned they could still face a
wait of up to two weeks for petrol, despite the lifting of nearly
all the blockades at UK refineries on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police were urging motorists to fill up only if the need is
urgent, as lengthy queues develop outside petrol stations.
</P>
<P>
Scottish motorists were still waiting for fuel supplies to get
back to normal, with queues outside many filling stations.
</P>
<P>
There was a patchy picture across the country as oil bosses
predicted 1,200 tankers would leave the Grangemouth oil refinery
by midnight, with 2,500 expected to have made deliveries by Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
In Edinburgh, Glasgow, Tayside and the north-east, many pumps
remained dry and queues were still long on many forecourts,
although several councils were ending their emergency procedures.
</P>
<P>
Despite the end of the crisis, police in Dumfries and Galloway
warned farmers and hauliers were planning a protest on the A75
route Saturday between Castle Douglas and Dumfries.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of slow-moving vehicles was expected to move along the
road, which links Irish ferry ports to England on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Scottish Executive said the crisis should
be over by Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Normality of fuel distribution in Scotland should be close to
being achieved at the beginning of the week," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Regrets Tokyo's Decision to Postpone Military Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Moscow on Friday expressed
regret and bewilderment over Tokyo's decision to postpone the
planned exchange of visits by Russian and Japanese military
delegations.
</P>
<P>
Such a move by the Japanese side "causes particular regret on
the background of Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit
to Japan, which became an important step forward in the
development of bilateral relations," Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Losyukov said in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
"On such a favorable background, Japan's actions in relation to
our employee in Tokyo (whom Japan has accused of espionage) and
the decision to postpone the visits of the two countries' military
delegations are remarkable and inexplicable," Losyukov stressed.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the intentions of Moscow and Tokyo to develop
bilateral contacts, including those between defense ministries,
were confirmed at the recent Russian- Japanese summit in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, the deputy minister said, the Russian side
"regrets and is bewildered by continuing actions aimed at limiting
Russian-Japanese relations."
</P>
<P>
A senior Russian Defense Ministry official also regretted the
Japanese cabinet's decision to delay military contacts with Russia,
noting that it will slow the expansion of bilateral cooperation in
the defense field.
</P>
<P>
Initially, it was planned that Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev will visit Japan in November. Trips by a 30-man Japanese
self-defense agency delegation and by a Russian delegation headed
by Col. Gen. Yuri Bukreyev were scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
But Japan has put all these visits off because of alleged
intelligence activities by the Russian military attache in Japan,
according to Japan's National Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said he would wait and
see how this incident will be resolved, describing reports of
Russian spying activities in Japan as "groundless."
</P>
<P>
He said the incident "may be a tactical but by no means
strategic error on the part of Japan."

<HEADLINE> "Big Three" Handset Manufacturers Dominate Mobile Phone Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide mobile
phone market, increasingly reaping the benefits of the
proliferation of the wireless Web, remains on pace to exceed 420
million units by the end of this year, a U.S. market research firm
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest estimated that worldwide shipments of cellular phones
reached 98 million handsets in the second quarter. The "Big Three"
handset manufacturers, Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson, had a
dominant combined market share of 53 percent in cell phone sales
during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to some industry estimates, mobile phone makers sold
about 270 million handsets worldwide last year. Early forecasts
from chip customers place cell phone shipments in 2001 at 600 to
650 million units.
</P>
<P>
"Comprehensive changes are taking place in key global markets
that comprise much of the annual and quarterly volume, from second
generation voice-centric handsets to data-enabled devices of
varying flavors," Dataquest said. Mainstream market stability
should return early in 2001, the firm said, after the changeover
to wireless application protocol (WAP) and next generation
products gain momentum.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Makes Great Progress in Health Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
made great strides in the health sector since the country attained
independence in 1980, with at least 85 percent of the population
now living within eight kilometers of health facilities.
</P>
<P>
At independence Zimbabwe inherited a health system
characterized by gross inequalities in the distribution of
resources according to race, said the country's Health and Child
Welfare Ministry in its quarterly magazine "Lifelines" released
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But with its new policies of equitable distribution, the
government has constructed and rehabilitated about 250 rural
centers, with hospitals increased from 43 to 60 and bed capacity
from 12,603 to 18,845, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said 25 new district hospitals have been constructed making
it possible for the majority of the people to have a health
facility within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
"In 1990/91, Zimbabwe spent more capital on health than any
other sub-Saharan country except Botswana," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Zimbabwe has been one of the most
successful countries in the world in combating malnutrition among
children and one of the first countries in the world to establish
an effective transfusion blood safety surveillance.

<HEADLINE> Thomson Announces Another Multimedia Alliance in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is a merger with a tremendous partner in which the sum of
the parts is going to be vastly larger than the parts," said Ken
Thomson, chairman of the Toronto-based Thomson Corp., which has
owned one of the country's leading newspapers, the Globe and Mail,
for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Jean Monty, chairman of BCE Inc., said that the alliance will
be able to provide Canadian consumers more quickly with more
information and more variety on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"The journalistic depth of Canada's national newspaper, the
Globe and Mail, coupled with Canada's leading television network,
CTV, and the leading Internet sites like sympatico.ca and
globeandmail.com, give us all the elements to create made-in-
Canada multimedia services that are second to none," said the BCE
chairman.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will be 70.1 percent owned by BCE, which will
contribute properties including CTV and its 71 percent interest in
Internet site Sympatico-Lycos.
</P>
<P>
Thomson will possess 20 percent of the new company by offering
its flagship newspaper the Globe and Mail and other contributions.
</P>
<P>
The other 9.9 percent will go to the Thomson family's
Woodbridge Co., which will in turn contribute 385 million Canadian
dollars (about 259 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is a third multimedia venture announced since July, when
the Winnipeg-based CanWest Global Communications offered 3.5
billion Canadian dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) to
acquire more than 200 Hollinger publications in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Montreal publisher Quebecor Inc. took over
cable TV company Group Videotron at a price of 4.9 billion
Canadian dollars (about 3.3 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
sharply Friday amid worries about corporate earnings and on profit-
taking despite a new proof of tame inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 160.47 at 10,927.
06 points. The blue chip stock index fell 94.71 Thursday and 51.05
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 78.63 at 3,835.23 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 15.06 at 1,465.81.
</P>
<P>
Stocks plunged after the wireless communications company
Anadigics warned that its earnings in the second half of the year
would not meet expectations because of the lower demand for its
products. The fresh warning added to investors' worries about
corporate profits in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The market has been hit in the past week, when a number of
companies said their earnings in the third quarter would be lower
than expectations in the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates for six times in
the past 15 months in a pre-emptive move to cool off the economy
and keep inflation under control. But higher rates and the slowing
economy would increase costs and slow demands for corporate
products, presenting a threat to companies for their earnings.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were also dragged lower as investors cashed out of some
tech stocks to lock in profits from a previous rally. Software
maker Oracle was lower a day after investors pushed its price
higher on upbeat speculation about its earnings.
</P>
<P>
A government report on the falling consumer prices did not
inspire the market. The Labor Department reported that consumer
prices fell in August for the first time in 14 years, showing a
new proof that inflation remains tame after six hikes in rates.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.00 at 669.42 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 8.33 at 530.88. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 5.37 at 971.86.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,751 down, 1,125 up and 473
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.22 billion shares from 1.00 billion
in the previous session.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore went to a traditionally black
college here on Friday to promote his education plan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 1,600 students, teachers and lawmakers at
Howard University, Vice President Gore said that he wants to hire
100,000 new public school teachers to reduce class sizes, give
bonuses to teachers and offer paid leave to teachers for
professional development.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would allow families a tax deduction and take
other measures to make college education more affordable in the
United States if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
Gore, capping a week of campaigning for education reform on
Friday, called for an education system that treats teachers as
professionals.
</P>
<P>
"Education has to be the No.1 priority for this generation,"
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gore's Republican rival George W. Bush campaigned in
California, hoping to gain some ground in the biggest state in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He pushed his education ideas by reading with schoolchildren at
an elementary school and also met with veterans at a park in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
With less than two months to go to election day, the majority
of polls show Gore slightly ahead or even with Bush.
