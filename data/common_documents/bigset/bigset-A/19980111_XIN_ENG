<HEADLINE> Drop of AIDS Deaths Coincides with New Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 9 (Xinhua) -- AIDS deaths in California
during the first half of 1997 dropped by 60 percent to 1,112 from
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The decline coincided with the widespread of protease
inhibitors, the newest anti-viral drugs. Researchers say that
California's aggressive attempts to distribute the drugs to
infected patients appear to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
California's AIDS Drug Assistance Program provides the drugs
free, or at limited cost, to those with adjusted gross incomes of
less than 50,000 U.S. dollars a year. The drug treatment could
cost as much as 12,000 dollars a year for HIV-positive people.
</P>
<P>
Amid all the optimism, researchers caution that the lifesaving
effect of protease drugs may not last and the virus may return.

MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A Russian governmental

Grozny Saturday on how to restore the economy of the breakaway
republic, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies US Claims of Executing Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today dismissed as
unfounded U.S. claims that it had received confirmed reports
about Iraq's execution of a group of political prisoners, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The INA quoted a government spokesman as saying that the
U.S. government had been shedding crocodile tears for human rights
in Iraq, though it is responsible for the death of hundreds of
thousands of Iraqis and for denying 22 million people the most
basic rights to subsistence.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to a Voice of America (VOA)
report representing views of the U.S. government, which listed
5,000 Iranian POWs, 600 Kuwaiti POWs and 200,000 Kurds as
unaccounted-for.
</P>
<P>
The VOA report was intended to mar the image of Iraq for its
defiance of U.S. aggression, arrogance and disregard of
international law, said the spokesman, adding that neither Iran
nor the Iraqi Kurds had asked for U.S. intervention.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the spokesman said, the figures mentioned in the
VOA report are unreal and unsubstantiated by any neutral
international party.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that such repeated allegations were
expressive of a sense of bitterness and disappointment at the
White House due to its utter failure of a campaign to rally Arab,
Western and international support for its military action against
Iraq and prolonged sanctions against its people.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Gum to Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- There may be a direct casual
link between gum disease and heart disease, British researchers
said today.
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the link appears to be strongest in men aged 40 to
50, according to a study published in the British Dental Journal.
</P>
<P>
Poor oral health may be as a significant heart disease risk
factor alongside smoking and a fatty diet, the study suggested.
</P>
<P>
The most likely explanation for the link is that bacteria
produced as a result of gum disease have an effect on clotting
mechanisms in the blood which increase the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
People who have an over-reactive natural body defense system
could be more sensitive to the effects of the bacteria,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
However, they stressed that it still needs further confirmation
although evidence of the link is mounting.

<P>
Vietnamese Defense Minister Pham Van Tra and his Japanese guest

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Russia's Early WTO Membership Impossible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
held little hope about Russia's joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO) at an early date, saying it could take years.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive body noted that Russia had
submitted no offers to the WTO, the Geneva-based trade watchdog,
since 1993 when it sent its application to WTO's predecessor, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, says the European Report,
a EU newsletter published here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This has been a great disappointment for WTO members, who had
themselves intensified work over the past years in response to a
Russian request to accelerate the work program, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems with Russia's application was that Moscow
was not prepared to make any "standstill" commitment on tariffs,
the European Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin last July assured
President of the European Commission Jacques Santer that there
would not be an increase in tariffs overall, a gesture aimed at
improving Russia's negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
However, Moscow later decided that the tariff-cut plan for 1998
would not be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Other issues affecting Russia's application include
intransparent customs legislation, a range of non-tariff barriers,
poor intellectual property protection, and reluctance to join
WTO's Government Procurement Agreement.

<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine will begin Sunday a visit to three Middle East countries
in an effort to help relaunch the peace process, blocked since the
Israeli conservative government came to power in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine will visit Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, all of them very
close with France, after he visited Israel, the Palestinian
territories and Egypt in December.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio RMC Moyen Orient today, Vedrine said
that although the situation in the Middle East is not good at the
moment, France is "in a position" to help relaunch the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"France feels to be in a position, taking into account the
particularly close relations it has with almost all the
protagonists, to make move the things in a good direction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that one cannot "live with" the present situation of
relations between Israel and Palestinians and those of Israel with
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"One should not give up, one should untiringly try to rebuild
the base of the peace process, of searching for a solution,
re-awakening the process which was once engaged, precisely because
the present situation is dangerous," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that contacts have been regularly made between
President Jacques Chirac and U.S. President Bill Clinton, between
himself and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the
situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We compare our views, they are not exactly the same, but one
should precisely make converge what is common, in any way to
re-awaken the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that there exist differences between France and
Lebanon over how to implement United Nations Security Council
Resolution 425 adopted 20 years ago after the first invasion of
Lebanon by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls on Israel to immediately withdraw its
forces from southern Lebanon it has been occupying.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Agrees to Compensate for Eastern European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The German government has agreed
to compensate for eastern European Holocaust survivors, said a
German press report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Berliner Tagesspiegal reported that Bonn
would, from 1999 to 2002, provide 50 million marks (28 million
U.S. dollars) per year for a special foundation run by Jewish
organizations to help survivors.
</P>
<P>
The agreement and its details would be officially announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tagesspiegal, Friedrich Bohl, head of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office, worked out the concrete terms
last week with Jewish Claims Conference, a New York-based body
founded in 1951 to represent Jewish claimants living outside
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the about 18,000 Holocaust survivors in
eastern Europe, who had so far not yet received any personal
compensation from Germany, would each be paid about 250 marks per
month.
</P>
<P>
However, the recipients should be poor, and should also have
been detained for a certain period in either a concentration camp
or in a ghetto sealed off by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that most Holocaust survivors living in eastern
Europe have never been individually compensated by Bonn as those
in the West. Bonn paid lump-sum compensation to eastern European
nations after the end of the Cold War, but most of the money did
not reach individuals.

<HEADLINE> Angola Trains More National Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Petroleum
Albina Assis said here today that the country will attach great
importance to training national professionals on the petroleum
front to ensure a sustainable development in the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks during a meeting with officials from the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Angola's petroleum industry has witnessed
rapid development in the recent years. But the lack of national
professionals has affected the industry's long-term advancement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has stipulated that foreign oil companies
operating in Angola has the obligation for personnel training
in the profession.
</P>
<P>
Albina revealed that the training of national professionals
has always been a priority in the ministry's objective. In 1997,
a total of 2,683 Angolans were training in foreign companies,
which accounted for 62.7 percent of all Angolans in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry in Angola has made great stride in
recent years, with daily oil output increasing from 600,000
barrels two years ago to the present 750,000 barrels. It is
estimated that by early next century, the output will reach one
million barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Finds Possible Link Between CJD, Hormone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A French bodybuilder who died of
new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) might have been
infected by injections of a growth hormone, a French doctor said
today.
</P>
<P>
The patient developed CJD, the human form of mad cow disease,
in 1994 and died two years later, Dr Jacques Verdrager from
Meylan, France, wrote in a research letter to the British journal
Lancet.
</P>
<P>
It is "surprising" that the French bodybuilder contracted the
disease so early in the outbreak of the mad cow disease, Verdrager
said.
</P>
<P>
At that time only one person in the UK had developed nvCJD,
despite the fact that France is one of the biggest importers of
British beef.
</P>
<P>
It is possible, Verdrager said, that the bodybuilder's death
might be a result of the injection of a growth hormone, known in
France as somatotrophine and used to be prescribed for "tissue
repairs."
</P>
<P>
The development of CJD in the patient in 1994 was consistent
with the drug's use in France in the late 1980s, Verdrager said.
</P>
<P>
Somatotrophine, which was popular among French bodybuilders,
has been banned in France since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Ross's Trip Ends Without Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today said that the
just-concluded trip to the region by U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross ended without results.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the reamrks during his telephone conversation
with King Hussein of Jordan, the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) said.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, the two leaders exchanged views on
the latest development in the peace process in light of Ross's
visit to the region, according to the JMCC.
</P>
<P>
Other PNA officials also expressed their dissatisfaction over
Ross's visit. PNA Higher Education Minister Hannan Ashrawi Friday
night said that Ross's visit achieved nothing.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi accused the U.S. administration of siding too much
with Israel, saying that during his four-day shuttle diplomacy
between Israel and the PNA territories starting on Tuesday, Ross
did not do enough to force Israel to honor the signed agreements
with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Kanafani, spokesman of Arafat, said Friday night that
U.S. President Bill Clinton's scheduled separate talks later this
month in Washington with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will be the last chances for bringing the
Middle East peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
The PNA cabinet met Friday night in Ramallah and issued a
statement criticizing the Israeli government for planning to build
more new housing units for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel's plan for constructing more new housing units in the
West Bank will push the troubled peace process to a break of
disaster, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli government official said Wednesday that the
government has approved a plan for building nearly 600 new housing
units in Efrat, a Jewish settlement south of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Besides sharp criticism by the PNA toward this plan, even
Ross termed it as an obstacle for bringing the peace process back
on track.
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of action we've said is not helpful to put
the (peace) process back on track," Ross said on Thursday after
his meeting with Arafat in Ramallah.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State Helps Counter Israel: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Ambassador to the
Arab League Mohamed Sobeih said today the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state will deter Israel's hardline
government.
</P>
<P>
"A democratic, secular Palestinian state must be set up on all
the Palestinian land to face up to the Israeli Prime Minister
(Benjamin) Netanyahu's intransigence and insistence on building
and expanding settlements," Sobeih told the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said that the recent mission by U.S. Mideast peace envoy
Dennis Ross has failed "due to Netanyahu's refusal to budge an
inch on his earlier stances."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Netanyahu has announced that he will expand
the settlements, Sobeih said, referring to a decision by Israel to
build more than 600 new homes at two Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have deadlocked over Israeli
building of a new settlement in East Jerusalem since last March.
</P>
<P>
"The ideal solution to the crisis is to set up a unified
democratic Palestinian state in which the two peoples
(Palestinians and Israelis) would enjoy the same plights and have
the same duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After the failure of Ross's mission, the U.S. must defend its
credibility before the entire world, which believes in the peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ross on Thursday criticized the new Israeli decision, a move
that defied U.S. calls for a "time-out" on settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy arrived in the region on Tuesday for talks with
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat to try to pave way for separate meetings they will have
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih ruled out the possibility that a tripartite meeting
would take place in Washington among Clinton, Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian presidential envoy will inform Cairo of the
outcome of Ross's recent meetings in Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule city of Ramallah, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sudan-Egypt Ties Augur Well: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Ambassador to Egypt
Ahmed Tayeb Youssef Kordofani today expressed his conviction that
things augur well for the improvement of Cairo-Khartoum ties.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador made the remarks after a meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the occasion of ending his tour of
duty here.
</P>
<P>
"I am leaving Egypt with the hunch that Egyptian-Sudanese
relations were returning to their normal courses," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, at the end of his three-year stint in Cairo,
added that bringing back relations to normal has been his aim ever
since he came to Egypt more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Things augur well and it is only natural that the relations
return to normalcy," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the exchange of visits between the two countries' leaders,
he said that these issues are being discussed and at the right
moment, dates of such visits would be announced.
</P>
<P>
In a show of rapprochement with Khartoum accused of harboring
militants to overthrow Cairo's secular government, Egypt has said
recently that it expects the turning of "a new leaf" in its
relations with its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, President Hosni Mubarak's political advisor, on
Tuesday described the Cairo-Khartoum ties as "time-honored and
highly special" and referred to the recent statements by some
Sudanese officials calling for plastering over their differences.
</P>
<P>
Amid signs of improved Cairo-Khartoum ties, Egyptian Trade and
Supply Minister Ahmed Gowaili has invited Sudanese Foreign Trade
Minister Othman al Hadi to visit Egypt in mid-January for talks on
enhancing joint investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, a delegation of the Sudanese Ministry of
Transportation and Communication arrived here for talks on
resuming Nile navigation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On January 3, Sudanese First Vice President el Zubeir Mohammed
Salih confirmed that Egyptian and Sudanese efforts for restoring
bilateral relations are going in full swing and will be crowned by
a visit of President Omar al Bashir to Egypt soon.
</P>
<P>
The present thaw in relations followed assurances from Khartoum
that it will no longer provide support to Islamic militants acting
to undermine the Egyptian government.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq
Tarar has expressed deep grief and shock over the loss of innocent
lives in a terrorist attack Sunday on a religious gathering near
Mominpura, Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The president condemned this dastardly act and hoped that the
government would take all necessary measures "to apprehend the
culprits and award them exemplary punishment."
</P>
<P>
Tarar called for restraint and collective efforts to stem the
menace of sectarian terrorism which, he termed as "a conspiracy
against Pakistan and Islam."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister for Religious and Minorities Affairs
Zafarul Haq has also expressed his deep sense of grief and
resentment on the brute act of violence against the peaceful
citizens in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Sunday, the minister said that it
was not a crime connected with sectarianism but was a pre-planned
act of terrorism related to the regional security situation.
</P>
<P>
At least 24 Shiite Muslims including women and children were
killed and 30 others injured by unidentified gunmen Sunday morning
near Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Makeup of UNSCOM inspection team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today criticized the
makeup of a U.N. weapons inspection team that arrived in Baghdad
Sunday as "not balanced" and "un-evenhanded."
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman told the Iraq News Agency today that the
U.N. team, headed by Scott Ritter, an American accused by Baghdad
as a U.S. spy, is dominated by Americans and Britons.
</P>
<P>
There are nine Americans, five Britons, a Russian and an
Australian on the new team of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
in charge of overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of
mass-destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans, together with the Britons, make up the majority
of the commission and dominate the activities carried out by it
in both New York City and Iraq," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have always raised the question of the imbalance of the
composition of UNSCOM, as well as the activities carried out by
this commission in Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that so long as this imbalance in the
composition and activities of UNSCOM lasts, Iraq insists its
reservations on the statements and conclusions of the special
commission.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused American arms inspectors of
carrying out instructions of the U.S. Administration instead those
of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
It ordered the expulsion of the American inspectors on November
13. They were allowed to return, together with other inspectors
who then pulled out to protest the eviction, only after Russian
mediation a week later.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspectors have accused Baghdad of hiding
information and materials of secretive biological and chemical
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has been exerting pressure on Iraq to allow it
unrestricted access to sites it deemed suspicious, including
presidential palaces and other what Iraq declared "sensitive
sites."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad insists those presidential sites are "off-limits" to
arms inspectors because they are signs of Iraqi sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The head of UNSCOM Richard Butler is expected in Baghdad
January 19 for a three-day visit to persuade Iraq to open the
sites to weapons inspection.

<HEADLINE> Insurance System in Southern China Absorbing Shock of Change (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The auctioning off of the
Guangzhou Special-Shape Steel Plant did not send shock waves
through the workers of Guangzhou, the capital of China's Guangdong
Province, even though some of its workers were certain to lose
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The plant was sold because of poor management and bad
performance and was mired in debts that had no way of being paid
back. But, why were the workers so undisturbed?
</P>
<P>
One didn't need to look very far for the answer: the workers
all had pension insurance, and unemployed people will receive
social welfare from the local government while they're looking for
a new job.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province has established social insurance for 6.6
million people from all walks of life, from provincial leaders and
government officials, employees of state-owned enterprises and
institutions to the self-employed.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists say that the insurance has become a kind of shock
absorber in the province and helps it maintain order during the
period of transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, nearly 13 local enterprises in
Guangzhou have been sold or allowed to declare bankruptcy over the
past two years, and nearly 4,500 retirees and 6,000 jobless people
benefited from the insurance.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of people laid off from state-owned
enterprises will continue to grow in the coming years, the
officials say.

<HEADLINE> Chinese See New Form Of Entertainment In Musical Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- On a Chinese stage, a cat named
Leonie finally realizes his dream of becoming a man and sees the
warmth and the coldness, the love and hatred, and the kindness and
wickedness of a small town, and people on the stage are dancing
and singing and asking Leonie to come to live with them.
</P>
<P>
The audience are in a festive mood and join the actors on the
stage in singing the theme song, and after the performance, go to
the stage to offer flowers.
</P>
<P>
This scene took place a couple of days ago at a local Beijing
theater where "The Cat Who Wants to be A Man" was performed by the
Central Academy of Drama's Musical Theater Troupe.
</P>
<P>
The play was written by a Japanese author who based it on the
work of an American playwright.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yinzi, who manages public relations for the troupe, says
that musical drama is a mixture of dance, song, and dialog that has
been performed in western countries for decades but is new to
Chinese. But, even though musicals are somewhat unfamiliar,
audiences are becoming more familiar with them. She says the
troupe will perform the American musical "West Side Story" soon.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the academy opened a musical drama section to
train musical actors and the troupe was recently set up by using
the first music drama grads. The main purpose of the troupe is to
keep these first graduates useful, Zhang says.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts say that musicals in fact are quite similar
to various Chinese operas, although dancing is rare in a Chinese
opera or is quite different from European-style or American-style
dance routines.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese artists are trying to introduce musicals to
China. Wang Gang and Cheng Fangyuan, a husband and wife team of
well-known artists, are preparing a musical based on the Oscar
winning "Song of Music", and say they are confident Chinese
audiences will like musicals in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture's China Culture and Arts Corp. also
plans to invite a number of foreign musical theater troupes to
perform in China this year, and some local artists are even
predicting that 1998 will be the Year of the Musical for China's
stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the computer screens of the Guangzhou Municipal Social
Insurance Administration Bureau, pension accounts can be seen,
opened by people from top provincial officials to the
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
The administration bureau is the province's only administrator
of government-supported social insurance services. And every
social insurance service has experienced a trial period before
being put into full operation.
</P>
<P>
However, in many other Chinese provinces, people working in
non-state economic sectors have not taken part in the local social
insurance system.
</P>
<P>
Besides social insurance, about 7.3 million people in Guangdong
have been insured against industrial injury; 4.6 million people,
against unemployment risks; and 1.8 million female workers, insured
against child-bearing risks.
</P>
<P>
Medical insurance, aimed at reforming the former medi-care
system set up under the planned economy, has also been in trial
operation with 350,000 insured.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guangdong had accumulated a total of 6.8 billion
yuan in social insurance funds, and the balance of social
insurance funds increased to eight billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong had as many laid-off workers from the state economic
sectors as other provinces at the beginning of the 1980s, when the
country was tuning to a market economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong Province has woven a 'safety net' with social
insurance to support its economic growth, while keeping a stable
public order," local officials point out.
</P>
<P>
That is why most reform policies taken by the local government
did not arouse anxieties among local people, they say.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC), the
country's largest foreign exchange bank, had at least 6.03 billion
yuan (about 726 million US dollars) in profits last year, the
largest amount for Chinese financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 2.42 billion yuan came from inside China,
according to a senior bank official.
</P>
<P>
If such unfavorable factors as tax increases, increased amount
of bad loan funds, and drop in interest rates are taken into
consideration, the efficiency of the BOC last year was generally
experiencing an upward trend, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The BOC had 591.2 billion yuan in deposits and 564.4 billion
yuan in outstanding loans at the end of 1997, and year-end foreign
exchange holdings of 35.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BOC did 139.8 billion US dollars in international trade
business last year. It also issued 7.8 million credit cards, and
did 12 billion yuan in credit card business, 66 percent and 17.6
percent increases over the previous year, respectively.

Zimbabwe Ali Halimeh has described the recent visit by the
American Middle East Mediator as having ended without any

Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Israeli authorities to pursue its activities
of building more settlements in the Palestinian land of the West
Bank, and the continued policies of confiscating Palestinian land
would lead to the collapse of the entire peace process and
encourage more violence in the area, he warned.

"We view this decision as a very dangerous move and it may
bring down the American efforts to put the peace process into the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Warns Over Price Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of
Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen Chimutengwende has
warned that the government could soon impose price controls on
basic commodities to curb the price hikes.
</P>
<P>
This follows recent unrealistic increases in the prices of
goods and services amid allegations that some white businessmen
were bent on causing problems to ordinary people by hiking prices
of basic goods.
</P>
<P>
The minister was reacting to reports that some businessmen had
hatched a plot to hike the prices to unrealistic levels so that
the lives of the ordinary people would become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
"The government is aware of the plot by some white
businessmen. I would like to warn them that they will not succeed
in making the lives of the masses unbearable. If they carry on
with their ploys we might be forced to control the prices again,"
Chimutengwende said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had agreed to some of the conditions
imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
which stipulated that prices of goods and services must be
determined by market forces.
</P>
<P>
"If we control the prices we will be in a difficult situation
with the IMF and the World Bank. Western donor countries will
also not want to deal with us. They will boycott us for following
such policies," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, some sections of the business community were taking
advantage of the situation by coordinating their efforts to
ensure that the prices are pushed to unrealistic levels so that
the government could be blamed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government was aware that some whites
were bitter about the land redistribution exercise and were
trying to use every possible means to discredit the government.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to assure them that they will not win. The land
distribution process is part of the liberation process. I have to
reach its logical conclusion. If the government does not take the
land, then the people will," he said.

HARARE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe and Democratic

Saturday in Harare to promote social, economic and cultural links

<P>
Launching the association at the DRC Embassy here, Zimbabwean

<HEADLINE> Chinese Summer Resort Still Active in Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Even after the 2.2
million summer tourists left the 200 sanatoriums and 300 hotels of
Beidaihe, a famous summer resort in northern China, the place was
not in a state of hibernation.
</P>
<P>
The winter's first snow turned the 70 square kilometers Beidaihe
Peninsula into a crystalline world, but Beidaihe still has ample
sunshine, a gentle sea breeze, and evergreen trees.
</P>
<P>
Tourists may have left, but birds and other animals enjoy the
natural scenery of Beidaihe. Because it's in the flight path of
migratory birds, it has bird sanctuaries that play host to 405
species of birds, a third of the country's total number. There are
also peacocks, elephants, and lions in the local zoo.
</P>
<P>
Winter is a busy planting season here. About 500 trees are
being added to a 10,000-m. green corridor, which now has 320,000
trees, and a green coverage rate of 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
The director of the regional tourism bureau says that 1998 is
Beidaihe's 100th anniversary as a summer resort. It was set up
during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and a series of activities
will be held this year.
</P>
<P>
A move is now underway to build Beidaihe into a conference
center, and recovery center.

<P>
NAGQU (Tibet), January 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 110,000 people
in snowstorm-ravaged parts of northern Tibet's Nagqu Prefecture
have received food, clothing and other disaster-relief materials
from various provinces and the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Most victims have received help, and rescue workers have
removed snow accumulation from most roads leading to 110 snow-hit
towns more than 5,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the government has been concerned about
people in snowstorm-hit parts of Tibet, and the PLA has sent
vehicles and soldiers to assist the victims, while military
aircraft have airlifted large quantities of relief materials to
these areas.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has also played an important role by
dispatching eight rescue teams to join the effort. Several dozen
bulldozers and 30 tractors have been working day and night to
re-open mountain roads.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 heavy snowfalls have hit Nagqu since September,
dumping 40 centimeters of snow in many villages and 80 centimeters
on mountainous areas and cutting herdsmen's connections with the
outside world.

<HEADLINE> Cleaning Up One of China's Most Polluted Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Water quality in the Huaihe
River, one of China's most seriously polluted, has improved after
three years of treatment by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Water quality in the main stream is now stable, according to
Wei Fusheng, member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and is
clearly better than in 1994. A recent sample of the water showed
it at the level of Class Three Ground Water, meaning it can be
used as a drinking water source.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the country listed the Huaihe as one of the key big
rivers and lakes that need help, and the State Environmental
Protection Agency began monitoring the main polluters along the
river in 1997, and monitored the entire river valley seven times.
</P>
<P>
Local government regulations meant the closing down of 50
enterprises that did not stop discharging pollutants into the
river.
</P>
<P>
Although pollution in the main stream is under control, Wei
says, the problem is that the branches still have various levels
of pollution, and the goal of cleaning the Huaihe up by the year
2000 will require considerable effort on the part of the
government.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Warns Against Failure of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian spokesman
warned today the failure of the talks to be hosted by U.S.
President Bill Clinton with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and PNA leader Yasser Arafat could restart Palestinian
violence.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Tayeb
Abdel Rahim was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that if the
Washington talks fail, the Palestinian people would renew their
popular struggle.
</P>
<P>
Rahim reiterated that the PNA regarded the just-concluded
visit to the region by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross as a
failure. He called the Washington talks as a "moment of truth" in
breaking the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on January 20 and
with Arafat on January 22 in a bid to push forward the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The PNA is expecting Clinton
to increase his pressure on Israel to carry out the long-delayed
second phase troop pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Due to inner bickering over the scope of the pullback,
Netanyahu announced last week that his government would divide
the pullback decision into two parts, one on the scope and
another on the implementation. He conditioned the implementation
on the PNA's fulfillment of commitments to the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
This move was termed as an attempt to further delay the
redeployment in order to avoid hardliners within Israel's
splintered coalition from toppling the government.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day shuttle mission between Israel and the
PNA, Ross tried but failed to narrow the wide gap between the two
sides over the scope of pullback. Israel is reportedly only
willing to redeploy troops from eight percent of the West Bank,
while the PNA demands for about 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> IMF Envoy Meets With Indonesian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) met with officials of the
Indonesian Monetary Council here Sunday, but no result of their
discussions on economic reforms pledged under an IMF-led
multibillion-dollar bailout package for Indonesia was announced.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's first deputy managing director Stanley Fisher, who
arrived here Saturday morning, had discussions with some ministers
of the Indonesian government at 2 p.m. local time at the building
of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fisher said after the three-hour meeting that their
discussions were successful till now but it will take more times
to have further negotiations in depth.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting just starts," he said. The meeting will also be
joined by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus who is expected
to arrive here next Thursday, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad, who walked out of
the building after having discussions with the IMF envoy, said,
"the discussions were constructive and satisfied."
</P>
<P>
Other ministers did not make any comments on their discussions
with Stanley Fisher.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono, who also attended the
meeting, said the IMF envoy will meet President Soeharto, but he
did not say when and where the meeting will take place.
</P>
<P>
The IMF envoy's visit was triggered by the sudden fall of the
Indonesian rupiah (national currency), which declined to a record
low of 11,000 per dollar last Thursday, promoting U.S. President
Bill Clinton to telephone President Soeharto on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also decided to send Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers to Indonesia to discuss the economic situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the IMF along with the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank agreed to provide 23 billion
US dollars financial and technical assistance to Indonesia to
overcome its monetary crisis and Indonesia committed to conduct
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the reports said the IMF has expressed its
dissatisfaction over the process of Indonesia's economic reforms
in the two months.

BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
made 510 million yuan (about 61 million US dollars) in net profits
for 1997, according to early statistics.
</P>
<P>
The amount is roughly the same as for 1996, the bank's
president, He Linxiang, said at a news briefing today, where he
reported healthy growth for last year, with internal reforms going
on smoothly.
</P>

BAGHDAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today expressed serious
reservations at any statements and findings that a new team of
U.N. arms inspectors are likely to release, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad's announcement followed the arrival of a 16-member
team of U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in Iraq on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new team is led by American Scott Ritter, called by Iraq
"father of trouble makers," with eight other Americans, five
Britons, one Australian and one Russian as members.
</P>
<P>
An official Iraqi spokesman was quoted by the news agency as
saying that Iraq has repeatedly raised the question of unbalanced
composition of UNSCOM teams on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. and British nationals constitute the majority
of the team, making it easy for them to steer the commission work.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
seven years ago can only be lifted when the UNSCOM says the
country is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But the UNSCOM teams have complained of troubles in cooperation
with Iraq, while Baghdad accuses the U.S. and Britain for blocking
the lifting of the sanctions.

ADDIS ABABA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Commercial
Bank plans to grant loans amounting to 10.6 billion Birr (about
1.54 billion U.S Dollars) during the current Ethiopian fiscal

<HEADLINE> Seismologists Predict More Quake Activity For Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Seismologists at China's State
Seismology Bureau (SSB) have analyzed data from yesterday's
earthquake and say there is a possibility of aftershocks measuring
about five on the Richter Scale in Zhangjiakou Prefecture in Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiakou was hit by an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter
Scale near noon on Saturday. The area hit, around Zhangbei and
Shangyi in the northern part of Hebei, has been included in an SSB
danger zone, which covers the northwestern part of Beijing and the
juncture of Shanxi and Hebei provinces and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Before yesterday the coal mining city of Datong in Shanxi had
been hit by two quakes measuring more than six on the Richter
Scale.
</P>
<P>
Gao Xu, deputy director of the Beijing Seismology Bureau, says
there is a good possibility of quakes measuring four or five on
the Richter Scale occurring in the danger zone in the near future,
and explains that earthquake activity parameters in the zone
recently are abnormal, with more frequent and more intense
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
China is frequently hit by earthquakes and has had four active
periods this century, and a period from the late 1980s to early
next century is a fifth. From 1988 to 1996, there were six
earthquakes measuring above seven on the Richter Scale on the
mainland and offshore areas, and scientists say that earthquakes
measuring seven or even higher are possible during this period.
</P>
<P>
Seismological predictions have long been a questionable
topic. It is difficult for seismologists to make accurate
predictions about most earthquakes, and they mainly calculate
earthquake conditions in a certain area during a certain period of
time to reduce the amount of losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri today slammed the Algerian
government for recent massacres of hundreds of Algerian people,
saying the massacre was a plot against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio quoted Nouri as saying at an open session of the
Majlis that it was the Algerian government that armed a group of
people to massacre Muslims, but the Algerian government said
that Muslim radicals were responsible for the killings of hundreds
of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Algerian government and the West had a direct
hand in the massacres of Algerian Muslims in recent weeks,
"because they could not endure the growing trend of Islamic
movement in the country."
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, over 400 Algerians have been
reportedly killed by unidentified armed groups. The massacres
caused great concern all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Nouri expressed regret to the "indifference of Islamic
countries and international community toward the massacres in
Algeria."
</P>
<P>
He also attacked the international human rights bodies for
their "silence" over the massacres.
</P>
<P>
"They (the human rights bodies) accused Iran of violating the
rights of Iranian women, who actually play an active role in the
country, but they did not talk about the issue of human rights
when they saw hundreds of women and children were tortured and
slain in Algerian," Nouri argued.
</P>
<P>
He called on the world Muslims to "learn a lesson from the
multi-standard policies and lies of the West," saying that
Muslims should remain cautious when they are developing ties with
the West.
</P>
<P>
Following the reports about Algerian massacres, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi contacted with foreign ministers of
Italy, Syria, Morocco and Greece during the past several days,
expressed Iran's deep concern over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also sent letters to secretaries general of the
United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
calling for immediate measures to end the bloody killings of
Algerian people.

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Takami Kunio, who lived
through the Osaka-Kobe earthquake, donated 60,000 Japanese yen
today to the Earthquake Headquarters of Zhangbei County in Hebei
Province, northern China.
</P>
<P>
The county was hit at 11:50 am (Beijing Time) Saturday by an
earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale, which caused many
casualties and heavy property damage.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kunio is the director of an Osaka organization and has been
involved in afforestation work in China's Shanxi Province in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
When the quake hit, he was working with local tree-planters in
Shanxi's Tianzhen County, he said, and felt the tremor and learned
about the quake on the evening TV news. So, he drove to Zhangbei this
morning and was the first foreigner to make a donation for relief
funds, 10,000 yen of which came out of his own pocket, and the
rest from his organization
</P>
<P>
"The quake has indeed caused enormous damage to the area," he
told Xinhua, "but I'm deeply impressed by the efficient rescue
activities here."
</P>
<P>
While Mr. Kunio was visiting the area, army helicopters
airlifted 25,000 kg of bread to the victims, and soldiers were
busy clearing away the rubble of damaged houses and setting up
tents for the homeless. More relief is on its way from other parts
of the country, officials say.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has promised not to seek a third term of office and urged
party members to look for someone else to succeed him, Sunday
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Saturday at the renewal of his party membership in
Lusaka, Chiluba, also leader of the ruling Movement for
Multi-party Democracy (MMD), reiterated his wish to accept the
terms of the republic constitution, saying others should take
over because the constitution allows a president to rule for two
terms only.
</P>
<P>
"When my term of office comes to an end, don't even think of
retaining me," said Chiluba, who came into power in 1991 and was
re-elected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said there is speculation that Chiluba is
trying to secure a third term of office.
</P>
<P>
There would be no democracy and good governance without the
respect of law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged all Zambians to understand and appreciate the
rule of law, failure to which they would find themselves in
trouble.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has promulgated a revised regulation to protect its
agricultural environment.
</P>
<P>
According the Provincial Agricultural Department, with the
industrial and agricultural growth in Liaoning, pollution is
affecting the agricultural environment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 41 pollution cases in Liaoning's farming
production which resulted in losses of 49.55 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To address the situation, the province recently promulgated the
regulation and handled 32 pollution cases by imposing fines of
13.82 million yuan on polluters.
</P>
<P>
The revised regulation stresses that industrial production
should not damage the agricultural environment, which prohibits
dumping poisonous matters, wastes and wastewater.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that agricultural production
should not spoil the farming environment. It encourages the
establishment of non-polluting farming bases to produce green food
and organic food, and to adopt organic pesticides and fertilizers.

said Sunday that agreement on the outline of a political
settlement in Northern Ireland is "quite close".
</P>
<P>
"I am still cautious, but optimistic, we can get a proper

agreement and so much goodwill there," Blair told the BBC's
Breakfast program.
</P>
<P>
"We need co-operation North-South and some form of devolution
in Northern Ireland for proper government there," he said.

<P>
The peace process could be moved on "very quickly" after May,
if the critical breakthrough was made, he added
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on Norther Ireland in Belfast began in September
last year and are supposed to end in May 1998.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Ties Hong Kong in Interport Tourney's 1st Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Hong Kong showed how its
soccer team had imporved under the guidance of newly-hired Brazilian
coach when the local team tied with South China's Guangdong Provincial
team 1-1 in the first leg of the two-leg Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup
interport soccer tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tie laid a sound basis for Hong Kong to reverse the tide as the
local team had lost the last four consecutive tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is now scheduled to meet Guangdong at this weekend in
Guangzhou for the second leg of the home-and-away tournament. The
team with more points from the two games wins the annual tournament.
</P>
<P>
The two goals inthe Sunday match were scored by Hong Kong's Dale
Tempest at the 32nd minute and by Guangdong's Li Zhaoyang at the 51st
minute respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong had surprisingly switched from its usual European play to
a short-passing game featuring a South American style on Sunday to
press the visiting side, especially in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The opening goal came at the 32nd minute at a goal-mouth melee.
Hong Kong's forward Anthony Foster headed a cross from a teammate but
it was blocked by Guangdong's national team goalkeeper Ou Chuliang.
Foster's teammate Dale Tempest dashed up to catch the rebound and
headed it into the goal.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong failed to equalize the score until six minutes into the
second hald, when its midfielder Li Zhaoyang found the net with a slam
shot inside the penalty zone.
</P>
<P>
Both sides failed to convert several other chances to goals in the
rest of the match.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to change, in so short a period of time, the usual
style of play of the Hong Kong players. But you can see the progress
today," said a happy but calm Sebastiao Pereira Araujo, the new Hong
Kong coach from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"I think both sides had failed to turn many chances into goals," he
said. "At least we had waisted two such chances," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic of the coming second-leg match six days away. "I
think our players could do their job better in the Guangzhou match,
before which we have at least four days for training," he predicted.
"They could feel less pressure on themselves in Guangzhou than playing
here on the home turf," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong had won 14 out of the 19 previous tournaments while
Hong Kong took only five, with the last Hong Kong victory coming
in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former President
Kenneth Kaunda, who is under house arrest, has been formally
charged with conspiracy against the government, Sunday Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's defense lawyers, according to the paper, confirmed
that Kaunda was charged with conspiring with the army and two
other opposition leaders -- Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC)
leader Dean Mung'omba and Rodger Chongwe, leader of Liberal
Progressive Front (LPF), to topple the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said that the grounds served for Kaunda's
detention indicated that Kaunda, Chongwe and Mung'omba allegedly
agreed to sponsor last October's abortive military coup.
</P>
<P>
The grounds, said the lawyers, allege that the trio pumped in
an undisclosed amount of money for the operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the grounds, the tree opposition leaders entered
into an agreement with the army to sponsor the coup and "it was
agreed that the army would run the country for three months
before finally handing over (power) to Kaunda," said Sacika
Sitwala, one of Kaunda's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers, however, could not give further details on
Kuanda's grounds of detention, insisting that they are still
studying the document. They said that "whatever they throw at us
will not discourage us."
</P>
<P>
Kuanda, who insisted that he is "innocent" and has never
resorted to violence, was detained last December and later
shifted to house arrest for alleged involvement into the military
coup.
</P>
<P>
Chongwe is reported in Australia and Mung'omba has been under
detention for more than 70 days. Over 90 coup suspects have been
arrested without charge under the country's current state of
emergency.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Promises Security in South Lebanon After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has agreed to deploy
its army in south Lebanon to impose order and stability there if
Israel accepts U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 demanding
Israeli troops' withdrawal from there.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese official relayed this message through Americans to
Israeli Labor Party Knesset (Parliament) member Yossi Beilin
Friday, the English paper the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report only identified the official as at "very senior"
level and did not give details of the Lebanon-Israel contact.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israelis implement U.N. Resolution 425, as Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai says, then Lebanon will fulfill its
part of the equation which means creating order in south Lebanon,"
the Lebanese official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese move came in apparent response to the offer by
Mordechai last week to withdraw from the security zone provided
Israel's northern security is guaranteed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim to protect its northern areas
from cross-border attacks by Muslim guerrillas. Beirut has
called on Israel to withdraw unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, dating back to 1978, calls for an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, the restoration of peace and
security and the extension of Lebanese authority over the region.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, founder of the Movement for a Peaceful Departure from
south Lebanon, has said the deployment of the Lebanese army into
areas vacated by the Israeli Defense Forces would be done with the
aid of the U.N peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials believe that Lebanon is intended to end the
guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation in the region and
resume its sovereignty over south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beilin and other members of his movement are to meet with
senior officers of the U.N. forces in Lebanon, including Commander
of the International Peace-keeping Force Maj.-Gen. J. Konrote in
Jerusalem Wednesday to discuss this matter.

<HEADLINE> India's Elections to Burden Economy: ASSOCHAM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming elections to
India's Lower House of Parliament will cast enormous burden on the
economy with substantial additional costs, Press Trust of India
(PTI) quoted a leading industry chamber as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Past experience shows that elections process is likely to slow
down investments and thus overall economic growth," the Associated
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ASSOCHAM), one of the three
major chambers in India, said in a detailed analysis of the
present economic scenario in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, a spell of uncertainty on the agricultural front,
absence of a sustained uptrend in industrial production,
inconsistent policy environment for the infrastructure sector and
less than encouraging foreign institutional investors inflows have
put a question mark over the prospects of economic recovery in the
remaining months of the current fiscal" ending on March 31, the
ASSOCHAM said.
</P>
<P>
India's Lower House of Parliament, dissolved by President K.R.
Narayanan on December 4, 1997, is expected to be formed by
mid-March.

<HEADLINE> Authenticity of Returned Thai Artifact Doubted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Some Thai archaeologists have
doubted the authenticity of a piece of artifact returned to
Thailand by a Chicago museum 10 years ago, according to a
front-page report of the Nation newspaper on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Associate Prof. Srisakara Wellibhodama, senior archaeologist at
Silpakorn University, said several archaeologists have been
debating privately whether the returned artifact was the real
lintel stolen from a gate of an 800-year-old Khmer-style temple in
Buri Ram, northeast Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said the likelihood of the returned artifact being genuine
is only 60-70 percent, adding that this kind of artifact can be
replicated easily.
</P>
<P>
Thepmontri Limpaphayom, also an archaeologist, said there is a
possibility that the returned carved article is a fake, because no
scientific tests have been make to verify its authenticity in
terms of chemical composition and age.
</P>
<P>
The returned lintel has been placed back in the original place
in the temple.
</P>
<P>
When the stone carving arrived back in Thailand after a bitter
12-year wrangle between Thailand and the American museum, Thai
fine arts department experts declared it to be the lost valuable
lintel, without making any laboratory tests on its material.
</P>
<P>
The Art Institute of Chicago returned the artifact only after
it was offered a work of art of comparative artistic value to
replace it.
</P>
<P>
Thepmontri have found several marked differences after
comparing old pictures of the lintel and the returned carving.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the genuine lintel was supposed to be carved from
sandstone, but we see a lot of pock-marks on the surface of the
returned lintel."
</P>
<P>
He added that although he was not saying that those are the
proof that the returned lintel is a fake, but it did raise doubts.
</P>
<P>
Thepmontri said he knew a counterfeiter in Ayutthaya, central
Thailand, who claimed to have made a replica of the genuine lintel
after it was stolen from the temple and kept it in Ayutthaya for
some time before being sold to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The counterfeiter made a replica using the real thing as model
by working with half-baked clay, the archaeologist said.
</P>
<P>
A scientist at the fine arts department said, on condition of
anonymity, that the department declared the returned artifact
genuine after comparing it with a sample of carved sandstone which
was used to border the lintel before the theft.
</P>
<P>
She said specialists at her department looked at them with a
microscope and found that the texture, line of cutting, moss and
crafting techniques of the two pieces were consistent.
</P>
<P>
Thepmontri urged the department to call in experts from other
agencies of the government to help verify the authenticity of any
artifacts whose origin and age are in doubt.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the truth about the lintel will emerge in time.

<HEADLINE> Velappan Offered No. 2 Post in FIFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-general of the
Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Peter Velappan was quoted
Sunday as saying two top contenders for the FIFA presidency have
offered him the No. 2 post if they win.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times quoted Velappen as saying, "I have been
offered the post of FIFA general secretary by Lennart Johansson,
as well as by current FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter, if
either of them is elected to the FIFA presidency."
</P>
<P>
Velappan, a 62-year-old Malaysian, has been the
secretary-general of the AFC since 1978. He will officiate at the
June-July World Cup's two premier venues of Paris and nearby
Saint-Denis.
</P>
<P>
At present, Johansson, the 67-year-old UEFA president, is the
only official who openly announced his candidacy as Joao
Havelange, 82, is to step down after 24 years as president of
FIFA, soccer's governing body, when the World Cup in France
concludes in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Blatter's contract as general-secretary of FIFA expires in
December. He declined to comment whether he would contend for the
presidency at last week's Football Expo 98 in Sigapore.

KAMPALA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is now in Kigali, capital of Rwandan and he will have
talks with Rwandan President Salfina Bizimungu today.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports did not reveal the subjects of their
discussions but estimated that the two sides will focus on the
situation in the Great Lakes region and border issues between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
There are some former government soldiers of Rwanda who
harassed border residents in both countries along their common
border.
</P>
<P>
The recent reports about massacre in northern Rwanda by Hutu
rebels returning from Democratic Congo also attracted attention
from the international community.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day working visit, Museveni was accompanied by
his wife Janet and Eriya Kategaya, the first Deputy Prime
Minister and the Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
He was met by Rwandan President Bizimungu and Prime Minister
Cilestine Rugyema at Katuna border post when he stepped on the

<HEADLINE> Tibet Attracts More Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite the plunge in
contractual foreign investment nationwide last year, overseas
funds flowing into Tibet increased remarkably.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November 1997, there were 86 foreign-funded
projects in Tibet, mainly in the manufacturing, processing and
tourism industries. Contractual investment in those projects added
up to 62.5 million US dollars, and actual input totaled 25 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Investors were mainly from Nepal, Japan, the United States, the
Republic of Korea and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Seven foreign-funded projects, involving a total contractual
investment of 16.74 million US dollars, were inked in 1997, a
foreign trade official of the Tibet Autonomous Region was quoted
as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The seven projects were in the fields of processing, tourism
and forestry, said Bha Dra, deputy director of the department of
foreign economic relations and trade of Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Bha Dra said Tibet will step up efforts to overcome its
disadvantageous natural conditions and catch up with the economic
growth in other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
As the geographical and natural conditions in Tibet are not as
good as those in other parts of the country, the central
government has granted Tibet a privilege -- an enterprise
registered in Tibet can locate an office or plant in any part of
the country, on condition that the enterprise pays tax to the
Tibet regional government, Bha Dra said.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan economy has gone through amazing changes over the
past four decades. However, it is largely dependent on supplies
and support from other parts of the country and cannot stand on
its own feet.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is very important for the region to speed up the
development of its own industries, " Bha Dra was quoted as
saying.

<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The coming three south Asian
nation business summit is expected to create a mechanism to "pull
resources together" for the region to unitedly face global
challenges and tap economic opportunities, Bangladeshi government
officials and business leaders said.
</P>
<P>
A task force, comprising businessmen and civil servants from
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, is likely to be launched by the
conference to carry forward the agenda, with plans for frequent
meetings among the three countries, the officials and leaders were
quoted as saying by local press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The business summit, to be attended by the prime ministers of
the three countries, is scheduled to be held here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We need to emerge as a bloc to negotiate in the global
market," said Yussuf Abdullah Harun, president of the Federation
of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we get together and pull our resources together, we
cannot face the enormous challenges from the West," he said,
portraying the key plank behind the January 15 event.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh businessmen also hoped the business summit to
continue as an annual event, which they proposed to be hosted by
the three capitals by rotation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"How to face the rest of the world in terms of protecting our
interests in areas we have advantages" would be a key question,
Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman added.
</P>
<P>
"We will devise ways how to cooperate and what areas to
cooperate," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A large number of Israeli
security forces were deployed in public places today amid
intelligence warnings about terrorist attacks by Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks were set up at the entrances to major cities,
causing serious traffic jam. Armed soldiers and policemen
patrolled shopping areas and central bus stations, which are easy
targets for terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector General Yehuda Wilk called on the public to be
vigilant against any suspicious people and objects and inform the
police immediately.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Friday night told Israeli
television Channel 2 that Israeli security forces had received
information that Islamic extremists plan to stage an attack in a
major city, but no specific location had been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he had asked U.S. peace coordinator Dennis
Ross, who ended his four-day mediation mission in the region
Friday, to urge Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to do everything
possible to prevent the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that Israeli soldiers had arrested
five members of the anti-Israeli Islamic militant group Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) near the West Bank city of Ramallah.
They were suspected of attempting to launch an attack in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has been launching suicide bombing attacks in crowded
buses and public areas in Israel and it is responsible for the
latest two suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem in late July and
early September last year.
</P>
<P>
The bombings in the Mahane Yehuda vegetable market and Ben
Yehuda pedestrian mall killed 25 people and wounded hundreds of
others, dealing serious blows to the stalled Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Private Sector Urged to Develop Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Minister for Energy
and Mineral Resources Muhammad Noor Uddin Khan has called upon the
private entrepreneurs to help promote the use of solar energy in
the country to ease the pressure on natural gas, local newspaper
Independent Daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on solar technology in Dhaka Saturday,
the minister said the government would extend all-out cooperation
if any private company came forward to promote solar technology in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka city is now experiencing a heavy gas shortage due to
excessive household consumption, he said, adding that this crisis
could be solved if solar technology was used.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Dhaka was becoming a mega city with a
population of 10 million and at least 1.5 million burners would be
needed for household use. This would create an unbearable pressure
on natural gas supply, he observed.
</P>
<P>
Solar technology must be developed not only for the economic
reasons but also for making the environment pollution-free, the
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Though Bangladesh is rich in natural gas reserves, but the
present gas production cannot meet the ever-increasing demand.

<HEADLINE> ANC Forging Closer Ties With IFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) is trying to forge closer ties
with its long-time rival, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the
Sunday Independent newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the ANC eyes a coalition government in
Kwazulu-Natal soon and a merger of the two parties in the longer
term.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal, where the IFP is based, is the only province
governed by the IFP.
</P>
<P>
ANC heavyweights, including former president Nelson Mandela,
President Thabo Mbeki, Deputy President Jacob Zuma, are
propelling the drive, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted ANC insiders as saying that a merger or
coalition proposal had been circulated at a special provincial
working committee meeting of the ANC's Kwazulu-Natal region this
week. In the proposal the ANC outlines the run-up to a possible
merger of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggests that the ANC offer IFP leader,
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a national position befitting his stature,
most likely the deputy presidency under Thabo Mbeki after the
1999 general election. It also suggests creating an ANC-IFP
coalition in the province after 1999.
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggests that either Buthelezi dissolve the IFP
and bring his followers into the ANC, or the two parties continue
to exist separately but share a single election list.
</P>
<P>
However, Dumisane Makhaye, an ANC spokesman in Kwazulu-Natal,
denied that the special provincial working committee had
discussed a merger proposal.
</P>
<P>
But Makhaye said a summit between the national and provincial
leaders of the two parties was being planned.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to take place very soon, would discuss closer
cooperation between the parties, and would be led by Mbeki and
Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
However, ANC secretary-general, Kgalema Motlanthe, said it was
premature to talk of a merger between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
"A merger between the ANC and the IFP is a very serious issue
and should be clarified with the ANC's alliance partners, the
SACP (South African Communist Party) and Cosatu (Congress of
South African Trade Unions) first. As far as I know this has not
happened," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similar views have been expressed by the IFP side as well as
the SACP and Cosatu.
</P>
<P>
Mandela asked for a merger between his party and the IFP, the
biggest black opposition, on the eve of ANC's 50th national
conference held in Mafikeng, North-West province in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The idea was opposed by white-based opposition parties, which
feared that a merger would give the already powerful ANC too much
power.

<HEADLINE> Williams To Replay U.S. Open Opponent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- American Venus Williams is set
to replay last year's US Open final against world number one
Martina Hingis after she defeated Ruxandra Dragomir in the first
round of the Sydney international tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Williams won the first set 6-4 before Romania's Dragomir was
forced to retire with a hamstring injury, giving the American the
chance to make up for the demolition she suffered at the hands of
Swiss teenager Hingis at the US Open last September.
</P>
<P>
Hingis had a bye in the first round. She beat Williams 6-0, 6-4
in just 62 minutes at the US Open final, making the youngest Grand
Slam final pairing of 17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hingis won her first WTA Tour title in Sydney and
then went on to take the Australian Open title in Melbourne two
weeks later. Those two victories helped her take over the top
ranking spot from German Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
"I did very well here last year, winning my first title and I'm
looking forward to the beginning of the tournament," Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
In other women's singles first round results on Sunday,
Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria triumphed over Sabine Appelmans of
Belgium 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 and Austria's Barbara Paulus waltzed past
Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands 6-0, 6-2.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran has decided to buy 27 new
multi-purpose cargo, container and passenger ships worth 700-800
million U.S. dollars, local English-language daily Tehran Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Iran's Shipping Company Ahmad Mohammadi

aging oceangoing ships in Iran with more than 20 years of
service.
</P>
<P>
He said that his company has signed contracts with South
Korea and China and would sign new contracts with some other

</P>
<P>
South Korea will build six 22,000-ton multi-purpose ships for
Iran and the first one will be delivered to Iran in June,

<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Alexi Akatiev on Sunday
became the first double gold medalist at the World Swimming
Championships as he added the 25km open water title to his 5km top
honor lifted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Akatiev, from Moscow, clocked five hours five
minutes and 42.1 seconds, beating Spaniard Davic Meca by less than
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
After chasing 1997 European champion Akatiev in the last five
kilometers, Meca slowed down in the final stages while the Russian
sprinted through the breakwater to reach the finish first.
</P>
<P>
Meca, hailing from Barcelona, clocked 5:07.22.9.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Chaillou won Argentina's first medal here when he timed
5:07.52.6 for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very hard race with very difficult waves. I'm very
tired but very happy and thrilled to have two gold medals,"
Akatiev said.
</P>
<P>
Chaillou said that a bronze medal was just what he aimed for.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could finish between about third and eighth place but
it wasn't until the end of the race when I saw the breakwater that
I knew the bronze medal was mine," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 25km race, American Tobie Smith timed 5:31.20.1
to win the gold medal. She was followed by Germany's Peggy Busche
and the Netherlands' Edith van Dijk, at 5:32:19.2 and 5:38:06.9
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Buchse was in the top three from the start and made a charge
toward the lead at around the 8.5km mark. Then for some time she
swapped the lead with Italian Valeria Casprini.
</P>
<P>
After the halfway mark Smith started moving ahead from fourth
place and locked the second spot at about the 13.5km mark.
</P>
<P>
In the dying stages the American surged to the lead and got to
the finish about 100 meters ahead of Buchse.

<HEADLINE> EU Ban on Kenya's Fish Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan government official
has criticized the European Commission for its decision to ban
fresh fish import from four African countries including Kenya,
the Sunday Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper quoted James Mwanza, Director of Medical
Service, as saying Saturday that the decision taken by the
commission because of the concerns over cholera was "unfortunate
and harsh".
</P>
<P>
The ban which takes immediate effect was approved by the
commission's veterinary panel which met in Brussels Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official noted that although parts of the country
had lately been facing sporadic cholera outbreaks due to the
unusually heavy rains, Kenyan health authorities had taken
measures to contain the spreading of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza said he was surprised that the commission arrived at
this "punitive decision" despite being adequately informed on the
measures being implemented by the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
Other African countries which have been affected by the ban
are Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The East African region has been suffering since last November
from unprecedented heavy rains due to the El-Nino weather
phenomenon resulting in an upsurge of water-borne diseases,
especially cholera.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Between Manila, Rebels Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Sunday hailed the agreement reached by his government and the
National Democratic Front (NDF) on the human rights issue, saying
it is "a major turn in our country's quest for a just and lasting
peace."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Ramos admitted that a final peace
accord with the NDF is still "a long way off."
</P>
<P>
But he said the agreement reached Saturday by the two sides in
their talks in the Hague, the Netherlands, shows "no obstacle is
insurmountable to brother Filipinos really committed to the ways
of peace and unity."
</P>
<P>
Ramos encouraged both sides to "seize the current momentum
toward a peace settlement as a gift to our people who have praying
for peace and deserving to have it in their country."
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement issued from the Netherlands,
government and NDF representatives said that they initialed the
draft of the first three parts of the agreement and exchanged
drafts on the provision of International Humanitarian Law Saturday
after six days of talks.
</P>
<P>
"Both panels believe that the agreement reached on the
provisions on human rights is a big step forward in our common
quest for a just and lasting peace and lays a solid foundation for
its attainment," they said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Gujral to Lead High Level Economic Team to Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua)-- Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral will lead a high level economic team to Dhaka to take part
in the trilateral summit of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan
beginning from January 15.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Ministry of External Affairs has listed
three major factors coalescing in the upcoming summit. First, all
three countries are in the process of economic restructuring and
are looking for a convergence of economic policies. Secondly,
there is a greater realization that the creation of a "larger
economic space" is an imperative of regional cooperation. In other
parts of the world, the trend is towards larger economic groupings
to benefit from synergy; the feeling here is that South Asia
should not get left behind. Thirdly, since all three countries are
open to foreign direct investment, foreign investors would find a
combined South Asian market comprising more than a billion people
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, there will be three working sessions: on
ways to improve trade; on improving infrastructure, particularly
transportation; and on joint ventures including energy.
</P>
<P>
Gujral will have a bilateral meeting with Bangladesh Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina on the eve of the summit and will have a
bilateral meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after
the summit, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Huge Quantity of Rubber Sheets Ruined in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 million u.s. dollars'
worth of para rubber sheets stored in a warehouse in south
Thailand were destroyed in a devastating fire, which had lasted
more than 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
The blaze near Hat Yai, the largest city in south Thailand, was
still raging late Saturday night after it broke out at about 3 PM
Friday afternoon, according to the Bangkok Post on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fire followed an order two weeks ago by Deputy Minister of
Agriculture and Cooperatives Somchai Sunthornwat to check the
quantity of the para rubber sheets stored in the warehouse for
export to China.
</P>
<P>
Official documents show that a total of 44,000 tons of rubber
sheets, purchased by the previous administration in a price
intervention scheme to help rubber growers, were kept in the
rented warehouse.
</P>
<P>
However, several local businessmen who are involved in the
rubber business said they doubted the amount of rubber sheets in
storage matches the official figure, and suspected arson to cover
up suspected irregularity.
</P>
<P>
The raging fire and foul smell had prevented police and local
officials from entering the warehouse to determined the cause of
the blaze.
</P>
<P>
When Somchai inspected the warehouse, he already noticed that
the sheets were not stored in proper order and remarked that
should a fire break out, it would cause extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local health and rescue officials have been put on
alert in case the emissions pose a hazard to the people living in
close proximity to the warehouse, which is only about 10
kilometers from Hat Yai.

SOFIA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Russia still have

Kiril Gegov, deputy chief of the Bulgarian Energy Committee, said

issues of transit of Russian gas through his country and the
expansion of the transiting facilities.

They agreed to continue working on the transit rates of Russian

</P>
<P>
However, Gegov stressed that nothing threatens the supply of
Russian natural gas to Bulgaria and the gas transits to the Balkan

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for Cooperation in ASEAN Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Sunday called on members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) to cooperate in tapping potentials of tourism in
order to overcome the region's currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Opening the ASEAN Tourism Forum in the Southern Philippine City
of Cebu, Ramos said that the meeting is being held "at a time when
we and other countries in Asia are experiencing a severe currency
crisis."
</P>
<P>
"Your presence tells me that you have every confidence tourism
will substantially help overcome Asia's present crisis and return
to the path of economic recovery and eventually vigorous growth,"
Ramos told representatives of ASEAN member countries at the
meeting, which will end on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that tourism in Asia will continue to grow even if, in
the short term, there will be a serious slowdown for some
economies due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If ASEAN were to get even a 10 percent share of the world
travel and tourism market, this could mean the injection of 38
billion U.S. dollars into the economy of the region," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He said that one positive results of the present crisis is that
the ASEAN leaders have begun to work much more closely with each
other in order to arrive at a solution.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of finding a solution to the currency turmoil,"
he said, "the realization has grown that we are indeed
inter-dependent in ASEAN and that it is in our best interest to
further expand and strengthen our economic investment, trading and
tourism linkages."
</P>
<P>
The tourism forum is lined up with activities that will
showcase the best that the region has to offer in the field of
travel and tourism. The Most important of these is the ASEAN
Travel Exchange, a tourism marketing activity geared towards
opening opportunities for the suppliers of ASEAN travel products
and services.
</P>
<P>
Tourism revenue has accounted for 8 percent of the region's
gross national product in the past few years. But the industry has
suffered a big setback since the currency crisis hit the region
last July. ASEAN governments are encouraging their people to stay
at home to save foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Last year's forest fire in Indonesia also affected the
environment in the region and scared away would-be tourists from
other parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimmers Urged to Do Best in Perth Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese swimmers will do
their best in the championships starting on Monday despite one has
been suspended for violation of the delegation rules, a Chinese
official said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shi Tianshu, head of the Chinese swimming delegation, told
Xinhua that the Chinese swimmers were going to swim their best in
the championships which run from January 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
"Even though our training here has been interrupted by media
interviews and drug testing, we will put up the best swims as we
can and go for gold medals," he said.
</P>
<P>
World record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan are favored for
women's medley titles. Chen will also vie for a gold medal at the
200 meters freestyle, the event in which she is ranked No.1 in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ying, world No.1 in the women's 50 meters freestyle, will
have a shot at a sprint title.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation leader dismissed local media reports
that the Chinese swimmers had a plan to use drugs in Perth as
"sheer fabrication".
</P>
<P>
"You should not regard an individual case as a collective
action," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"And you can't say that someone must have used a banned drug
because he or she brought it to a friend here," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan was found having a drug in her
baggage in the Sydney Customs' routine checks on Thursday. A
laboratory in Sydney said the drug was human growth hormone, which
is used to cure children's slow growth but banned in the sports
world.
</P>
<P>
Yuan's coach Zhou Zhewen on Saturday told a hearing by the
International Swimming Federation's doping panel that he put the
drug into Yuan's bag in Beijing and it was a friend in Australia
who asked him to bring it over here.
</P>
<P>
Both Yuan and Zhou have been suspended from the Perth Worlds by
the Chinese delegation, which has a rule that no delegation member
is allowed to bring anything to anyone in outside China. The two
now face more severe penalty from the Chinese Swimming Association
(CSA).
</P>
<P>
Shi, CSA vice chairman, reiterated the Chinese swimming
governing body's stand against doping.
</P>
<P>
"We has the anti-doping policy -- clear stipulation, strict
testing and severe punishment," he said. "We have never wavered in
the fight against doping, and will never."
</P>
<P>
China had conducted 3,540 drug tests on its sportmen and women
in the year of 1997, with over 650 tests, incluing 460 flight
tests, taken against swimmers.
</P>
<P>
In November and December last year, the world swimming body
FINA had conducted 104 drug checks on Chinese swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Yuan alone had taken eight tests within these two months,
according to CSA secretary general Yuan Jiawei.
</P>
<P>
"The numbers of tests and the fact none of the Chinese swimmers
tested turned out positive show CSA's determination and results in
the battle against the performance-enhancing drugs," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation leader noted that doping was an international
problem.
</P>
<P>
"Last year swimmers in other countries had been caught using
banned drugs. That means doping is an international problem and
the fight against it is an arduous task," Shi said.

<HEADLINE> Textile Industry Faces Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's debt-laden textile
industry, focus of the nationwide drive to restructure state-owned
enterprises, has no choice but to resolve its difficulties within
three years with aid of preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The policies include that export rebates for textile products
will increase to 11 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi Wanpeng, president of the China National
Textile Council (CNTC) said that
</P>
<P>
The CNTC will eliminate 10 million spindles and lay off 1.2
million workers in three years. In 1998 alone, 4.8 million
spindles will be scrapped and 600,000 workers be laid off.
</P>
<P>
An oversupplied market plus the burden of mammoth welfare
payments for employees and retired workers have pushed the state
sector into slump.
</P>
<P>
The industry's deficit increased to 10.6 billion yuan (1.28
billion US dollars) from 1.9 billion yuan over the period of
1993-1996. Over 40 percent of the companies are on the brink of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for us to use all resources available to pull the
industry out of its slump," the CNTC president said, according to
today's China Daily.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua)-- Share prices lost ground on
the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market as the foreign funds
refrained from fresh allocations in the new year resulting in the
sensitive index shedding about 190 points last week.
</P>
<P>
The continued turmoil in Asian markets and the Moody's decision
to put India on the "watch list" also helped the downward
movement.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index moved up initially to 3739.21, but
later fell back sharply breaking two support levels to end the
week at 3530.20 as against previous weekend close of 3719.85,
netting a fall of 189.65 points. The national index shaded 80.79
points to close the week at 1533.49 from previous weekend close of
1614.28. The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index were quoted down at
343.59 and 144.06 at the weekend compared with previous weekend
close of 361.58 and 153.34 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan President Calls for National Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- President Arnoldo Aleman
presented his first government report Saturday, in which he called
on his fellow countrymen to "actively and jointly take part in the
construction of a Nicaragua for all."
</P>
<P>
Aleman, who assumed his mandate one year ago, read his speech
before Parliament amidst a disorder raised by deputies from the
opposition Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN), who
made a protest against policies of the liberal government.
</P>
<P>
Aleman's report covered domestic and foreign, social, economic
policy, and policies for the construction of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
During the first year of Aleman's administration, Nicaragua's
inflation rate dropped from 12 percent in 1996 to 7 percent in
1997. Meanwhile, the gross domestic product was up 5 percent, the
highest in Central America, Aleman said in the report.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's exports surpassed 750 million
U.S. dollars in 1997 for the first time in the past 20 years,
contributing to the creation of more jobs especially in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
After acknowledging that "the road we have ahead is long and
difficult," Aleman promised that in 1998 his government "will give
special attention and preference to the neediest social sectors in
the rural and urban areas."
</P>
<P>
"In economy, there are no miracles," Aleman said, adding that
only work, savings, investment and discipline will help surmount
the challenges that Nicaragua has to face in the 21st century.

rose by 3.6 percent over 1996, the lowest in a decade, the Vietnam

<HEADLINE> Toll Rises in North China Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGBEI (Hebei), January 11 (Xinhua) -- Forty-seven people
have died and over 9,000 people have suffered injuries, including
1,246 people with serious injuries, in the earthquake on Saturday
which struck Shangyi and Zhangbei counties in Zhangjiakou
Prefecture, north China's Hebei Province, lastest statistics
showed.
</P>
<P>
The quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale hit the area,
located some 220 kilometers northwest of Beijing, the Chinese
capital, at 11:50 a.m. (Beijing Time).
</P>
<P>
By 22:00 p.m., at least 11,246 houses had collapsed in
Zhangbei, Shangyi and neighboring Wanquan County, and another
13,400 houses become dangerous houses.
</P>
<P>
The direct economic losses are estimated at least one billion
yuan (120 million US dollars), according to preliminary
estimation.
</P>
<P>
Ge Zhizhou, deputy head of the State Seismological Bureau who
arrived at Zhangbei with a group of quake experts six hours after
the strong quake, believed that the earthquake intensity reached
around 8 degrees.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that the architectural structure of the houses
have close connections with the collapse of so many houses in the
quake hit areas.
</P>
<P>
He said, in some towns of Zhangbei, most of the collapsed
houses were built with stones. The walls are soft inside while
hard outside, which are easy to be toppled down.
</P>
<P>
The expert also attributed the shallow seismic focus to the
collapse of so many houses.
</P>
<P>
The tremors were felt by people living over a large area,
including Baotou and Hohhot in the west, Qinghuangdao and Tianjin
to the east, and Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan to the south.
</P>
<P>
Three aftershocks measuring 4.6, 4.5 and 4.2 on the Richter
Scale were recorded after 18:00 p.m. (Beijing Time) yesterday,
according to the latest report from the State Seismological Bureau
(SSB).
</P>
<P>
A provincial Party and government work team, led by Xu Yongyao,
deputy secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, arrived
at the affected area a few hours after the quake to direct relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has also allocated relief funds
totalling 500,000 yuan, and medical teams and various relief
supplies have been sent to the area. Medical teams have also
arrived at the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of officers of the provincial military
command also rushed to the affected area to direct rescue work by
some 1,500 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee and the State Council are highly
concerned about the well-being of quake victims. President Jiang
Zemin, who is also Party General Secretary, and Premier Li Peng
called on provincial leaders in Hebei to assess damage and exhibit
great concern for the victims.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Decides to Review or Postpone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
announced here Saturday night that it was shelving seven
megaprojects and put another eight under review, for the second
time in five months.
</P>
<P>
The decision was contained in a decree signed by President
Soeharto Saturday, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 projects -- eight power projects, four toll road
projects, one airport projects, one building project and one
equipment-provision project -- were among dozens originally
shelved or reviewed in September last year in a bid to save
billions of dollars of badly needed foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Moerdion said the government had earlier planned to continue
the megaprojects but a review of each of them had shown they would
be too costly and lessen the government's capability to deal with
the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The projects were reviewed November 1 last year according to a
presidential decree. When news of their resurrection came, there
were allegations of nepotism because they were projects tied to
politically well-connected business groups, local newspaper "The
Jakarta Post" said.
</P>
<P>
The sudden resurrection of the projects also raise doubts about
the government's commitment and ability to seen through tough
economic reforms, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Reports said, International Monetary Fund (IMF) First Deputy
Management Director Stanley Fisher and U.S. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers are due here on Sunday to discuss
economic reforms pledged under an IMF-led multibillion-dollar
bailout package to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The visit are triggered by the sudden fall of the Indonesia
rupiah, which declined to a historic low of 11,000 against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 200 percent of its value against
the greenback since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his discussion with Soeharto by telephone on
Friday, underscored the importance of Indonesia's commitment to an
IMF-led bailout package in exchange for some 40 billion U.S.
dollars in standby loans.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team plans to assess developments and to negotiate an
acceleration of the reform program. IMF Managing Director Michael
Camdessus is scheduled to arrive here on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Top Economist Dismisses Fears of Development Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Brisk development and stable
domestic consumption are anticipated in 1998, and will suffice to
fuel China's economic engine this year, said a chief economist
with the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, SSB chief economist, dismissed concerns about a
major slowdown in China's economic growth and speculation that the
country might devalue its currency to maintain the contribute of
exports to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly of China Daily quoted Qiu as saying
that "we do not need to do that. It will not be difficult for
China to achieve growth of around 8 percent under current
conditions."
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product increased by 8.8 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The daily noted that observers worrying about China's economic
growth momentum said the country would run into difficulties in
maintaining increases in investment, consumption and exports --
the three major forces driving economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As domestic production capacity for most products exceeds
demand, Chinese companies are generally not active in launching
new industrial projects, they said. The banks have also become
very cautious in granting new loans, which may limit industrial
growth.
</P>
<P>
Qiu emphasized, "but there is still a huge amount of room for
investment, " adding that technological renovation, high and
new-tech projects, infrastructure and farmland water conservancy
projects can all be major targets for new investment.
</P>
<P>
The SSB's chief economist believed that investment activities
will play the same or even a bigger role in propelling the economy
forward.
</P>
<P>
He said the current oversupply situation in many goods does not
indicate that the country's consumption will experience either a
standstill or decline.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people's current average living standards mean more
room for consumption growth.
</P>
<P>
The economist forecast demand for consumer goods in 1998 would
rise by 10 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for 1997.
</P>
<P>
He believed that investment and consumption may contribute a
greater share of economic growth in 1998 than they did last year
as China's exports are predicted to fall, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu stressed that a high growth rate is no longer the prime
target for China, it has been replaced by improvements in
industrial structure.

<HEADLINE> Castro Highlights Collective Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
called to improve the collective leadership mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader made the remarks in a speech delivered
Saturday morning to leaders of the eastern province of Santiago de
Cuba, who are preparing for the elections to be held on January 11.
</P>
<P>
Castro said that the role of leaders must be substituted by
other concepts and by a system of selection and mechanisms of more
perfect direction.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that despite the fact that the founders of the
Cuban revolutionary process were just a handful of men, there are
now hundreds of thousands of men with extraordinary merits and
millions of them fight a difficult battle, heroic and glorious.
</P>
<P>
"The country and the party will always need men of great
prestige and authority to perform determined functions," He said.
Great efforts were necessary in trying to find those who were the
most qualified.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, the collective experiences will be more
valuable than the individual experiences," he said referring to
the democratic concept of the Cuban electoral system.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the selection mechanisms would be improved gradually
and those of consultation more efficient.

percent at constant prices.

<HEADLINE> Santoro Reaches Final in Qatar Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- France's Fabrice Santoro reached
the final of the Qatar Open on Saturday by beating big servers
Greg Rusedski and Goran Ivanisevic in the space of a few hours.
</P>
<P>
In the final, the eighth seed Frenchman would meet Petr Korda
who booked his place by overcoming Briton Tim Henman and seventh
seed Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Santoro posted a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 quarter win over Rusedski, the
top seed and U.S. Open finalist last year before beating
Ivanisevic in straight sets 6-1, 6-4 in just one hour.
</P>
<P>
Rain on Friday forced the organisers to postpone the quarter-
and semifinals into a single day.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski's powerful serve was not in full working order in the
first set and Santoro kept the Canadian-born Briton on the
defensive with double-fisted drives.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski's sloppy volleying and careless groundstrokes lost him
the initiative in the deciding set and Santoro wrapped up the
match.
</P>
<P>
Henman, seeded five and runner-up to Jim Courier here in 1997,
lost to third seed Korda 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev defeated Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands 4-6, 6-4,
6-4 while fourth-seeded Ivanisevic defeated German wild card Bernd
Karbacher 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinal, Korda had few problems downing Medvedev 6-3,
6-4.

economic outlook in Europe continues to inspire confidence,
according to a recent survey.

The economic sentiment indicator fell from 103.5 to 103.0, but
this is mainly attributed to a decline in stock prices, European

an economic survey by the European Union (EU)'s executive body,
the European Commission, as saying.
</P>

The industrial confidence indicator for Europe remained at the

Assembly directive board, not recognized by the National
Liberation Sandinista Front (FSLN), deplored on Saturday the

Sandinista caucus.
</P>
<P>
President Arnoldo Aleman delivered his first annual
governmental report to the National Assembly Saturday morning, but
the Sandinista deputies banged on the tables and shouted slogans

<P>
The FSLN protested the "illegal" election of the directive
board of the parliament held Friday, in which the Sandinista
caucus did not have the two posts it wanted.
</P>
<P>
The directive board charges the Sandinista deputies, in a
communique, of lack of respect to the place and to the fatherland
symbols, the constitution and the national flag.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of this power of the state, we apologize to the
diplomatic corps, to the representatives of the other powers of
the state, and special guests, for this deplorable incident that
we expect will be overcome with the maturity, the high-level civic
discussion, and the patriotism for the good of the Nicaraguan
harmony," says the communique.
</P>
<P>
It adds that the president delivered his speech "despite of the
disorder lamentably introduced by FSLN deputies and people who do
not belong in the Parliament."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session, the head of the Sandinista caucus,
Victor Hugo Tinoco, announced new protests in the Parliament and
in the streets until a new election of the National Assembly
directive board is held.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly directive board added in the communique
that "it informs the Nicaraguan people that it has already started
the normal activities corresponding to the 14th Legislative
Period, and that it will continue promoting laws of national
benefit and for the modernization of the Parliament."

<HEADLINE> Afghan Women Refugees Demand for Due Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghan women refugees
residing in Quetta, provincial capital of Baluchistan, staged a
protest Saturday, urging the international community to pay
attention to the plight of Afghan women and help them secure their
rights.
</P>
<P>
The protest rally was attended by more than 200 Afghan refugee
women. They criticized both the Northern Alliance and the Taliban
for the denying of their due rights, according to the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The speakers, most of them were teachers, said that during the
former Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, Afghan women too offered
sacrifices but now they had been imprisoned in their houses.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the Afghan women be given the right to
education. They argued that a nation could not prosper by keeping
half of its population in houses.
</P>
<P>
The rally organizers said they did not belong to any faction in
Afghanistan and were making efforts for the women rights on their
own.

<HEADLINE> Rare Disease Kills 5,000 Cattle in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A rare disease has killed more
than 5,000 cattle in the province of Manabi, local reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which cattle raisers call "the inflater" was
detected last September. But the cause of the disease has not yet
been determined scientifically.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we have detected is that there is a bacterium
that reproduces rapidly because of the high humidity in the
grazing lands," said Ignacio Palacios, head of the Provincial
Agriculture and Livestock Direction.
</P>
<P>
The disease could be caused by the high humidity and the high
rate of parasitism in the herds, he added.
</P>
<P>
More deaths are expected as many cattle raisers have not
recognized the need of carrying controls.
</P>
<P>
Manabi is one of the provinces with the highest output of milk
and beef in this Andean country.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, Colombia to Reexamine Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign Minister
Maria Emma Mejia will make a three-day visit to Venezuela on
Februry 20 to promote the border demarcation in the Perija
mountain range.
</P>
<P>
Mejia will meet her counterpart Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas to
stress the importance of starting works of demarcation in the
Perija mountain range, to prevent future incidents due to lack of
knowledge of the limits of each country.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers arrived at this consensus after surmounting
the last border incident in 1997, in which Venezuelan military
trespassed by mistake into Colombian territory and captured three
Colombian citizens who later were returned to their country, with
the corresponding explanations to the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
The need of defining limits in the mountain range was
stated by the two diplomatic chiefs in reciprocal communiques last
December.
</P>
<P>
The zone of Perija is one of the most difficult point of 30
other pending matters in the process of demarcation of the 2,219
kilometer border shared by the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Worldwatch Warns Global Economy Outgrow Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The global economy is
outgrowing the earth's ecosystem and it needs to be restructured
for a new development model, the Washington-based Worldwatch
Institute said in a report issued today.
</P>
<P>
"If the world economy as it is now structured continues to
expand, it will eventually destroy its natural support systems and
decline," said Lester Brown, president of the institute, at a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
In a 250-page report, the State of the World 1998, the
institute said the key environment indicators are increasingly
negative while all the global economic indicators are positive.
</P>
<P>
Between 1950 and 1997, the global economy expanded from an
annual output of 5 trillion U.S. dollars to 29 trillion U.S.
dollars, an increase of nearly six-fold.
</P>
<P>
Growth during the seven years since 1990 exceeds that during
the 10,000 years from the beginning of agriculture until 1950,
according to the report, which was published annually since 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
With the speedy economic growth, consumption of natural
resources has also increased unprecedentedly in the last half
century with the use of wood more than doubled, that of paper
nearly six fold, fish consumption increased five-fold and water
use tripled.
</P>
<P>
"The economy continues to expand, but the ecosystem on which it
depends does not, leading to an increasingly stressed relationship
between the two," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The signs of stress can be seen in shrinking forests, falling
water tables, eroding soils, disappearing wetlands, collapsing
fisheries, deteriorating rangelands, rivers running dry, rising
temperature.
</P>
<P>
"These environmental indicators make it clear that the Western
fossil fuel-based, automobile-centered economy is not a viable
model for the world," said Brown.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that nowhere are "the ultimate limits of
the Western economic model more visible than in China."
</P>
<P>
"Because China is growing at such an extraordinary rate, it is
in effect telescoping history," said Brown.
</P>
<P>
"China is teaching us that the Western industrial development
model will not work for China because there are not enough land,
water, and energy resources for everyone in China to consume at
U.S. levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
The report underlined the urgency of restructuring the
economies, not just of China and other developing countries, but
also of the industrial world.
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing the limits of natural system is often attacked as
a call for no growth... the issue is what kind of growth, and
where," Brown added.
</P>
<P>
The report demonstrated that the human kind already have the
technologies to meet the challenge of building an economy that is
ecologically sustainable.
</P>
<P>
"A sustainable economy is one that reuses and recycles
materials, is powered by renewable energy sources, and that has a
stable population," a press release by the institute said.
</P>
<P>
"Stabilizing population as soon as possible -- and well before
it reaches 9.4 billion -- is the first step to building a
sustainable economy," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Flavin, one of the authors of the State of the
World, noted, "Just as challenge is unprecedented, so too are the
economic opportunities for the countries and companies that
pioneer the technologies needed to get us there."
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the global wind power business, already valued at
2 billion U.S. dollars annually and expanding at 25 percent per
year, as one of several new growth sectors now emerging.
</P>
<P>
The institute urged the U.S. to lead in restructuring economy.
"If the United States does not lead, the world economy will suffer
as its ecological base deteriorates," it stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Law to Ban Cloning of Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged Congress to make laws to ban cloning of humans and
described a Chicago physicist's intention to clone humans as
"unsafe and morally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"It's now clearer than ever the legislation is exactly what is
needed," the president said in his weekly radio address to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Independent scientist Richard Seed announced last Wednesday
that he would soon begin work on human cloning.
</P>
<P>
The news has brought public concerns. Clinton said it was
"profoundly troubling."
</P>
<P>
After Scottish scientists cloned the adult sheep Dolly last
winter, Clinton sent Congress a bill to ban the use of similar
procedures to clone human beings.
</P>
<P>
Last March, the president issued an executive order banning use
of federal money for any such project.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I believe that human cloning raises deep concerns
given our cherished concepts of faith and humanity," Clinton said
today. "Scientific advancement does not occur in a moral
vacuum.... We must move with caution, care and deep concern about
the impact of our actions."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "I call on Congress to act now to make it illegal,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Falls to Seven-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate
dropped in December to 8.6 percent for the first time in more than
seven years, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The drop ended a string of 86 months in which the rate was 9
percent or higher, the longest such stretch since Statistics
Canada began recording monthly job data 51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In December, Canada's economy created 62,000 new jobs, more
than double the average monthly gains in the first 11 months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The December job gains brought Canada's total employment to
14.12 million on a seasonly adjusted basis, up 363,000 jobs from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest annual increase since 1994, which was the
best year of the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Norwegian FMs See Dim Hope for Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that he agreed with Norwegian Foreign Minister
Knut Vollebaek who has just concluded a tour of Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas that the Mideast peace process has dim
hope.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he received a phone call from the Norwegian foreign
minister who "wanted to express his view that he saw no hope for
the future of the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
"I share this view, too," said the Egyptian top diplomat,
adding that matters are not proceeding in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek, when in Israel, urged the Jewish state to take
measures to move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Norway had been actively involved in formulating the Oslo
Accords between the Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organization
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat will visit Egypt on January 19 to exchange
viewpoints on the current Mideast situation.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming meetings U.S. President Bill Clinton will hold
with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister, Moussa said the Washington
meetings were still standing.
</P>
<P>
"They represent the only remaining opportunity before reaching
a state of utter frustration," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all parties concerned to consult on future plans
if the situation collapsed due to Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that Israel has adopted a certain ideological stance,
namely no to return of land, no to Madrid peace conference and no
to UN resolutions, which are all matters that we reject," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked since
last March when Israel began building a new settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The 15 member nations of the
European Union (EU) have agreed to send a mission to Algeria very
soon to consider how to help the country put an end to recent
massacres of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the Maghreb reached the agreement recently at a
meeting of the European Council of Ministers in Brussels, said
European Report, a twice-weekly newsletter published here today.
</P>
<P>
The council's political directors are scheduled to meet on
January 13 and will take the final decision as to whether to send
a European troika, composed by representatives of the current,
previous and upcoming EU presidencies.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the goal of the mission was not to investigate, but
simply to gather information.
</P>
<P>
Algiers, which described all foreign bids for investigation or
mediation as "unacceptable interference," has agreed to the
European experts' visit on the condition that they are limited to
discussing "cooperation in the fight against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmed Attaf said in
Algiers Thursday that the troika's visit, which had been initiated
by Germany, was "welcome." Its purpose was to "step up the fight
against terrorism and Euro-Algerian cooperation in this area," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Attaf said the state was fighting terrorism by legitimate
means. "There is no confusion or doubt necessitating an
investigation," he said.

AMMAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali today pledged maximum efforts by his government to
push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting former U.S. Secretary of State

increased in the past years, especially after Jordan signed its
peace treaty with Israel in 1994.

<HEADLINE> European Economic Outlook Remains Good: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the crisis on the
Asian markets, the economic outlook in Europe continues to inspire
confidence, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The economic sentiment indicator fell from 103.5 to 103.0, but
this is mainly attributed to a decline in stock prices, European
Report, a twice-weekly newsletter published here today, quoted an
economic survey by the European Union (EU)'s executive body, the
European Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The industrial confidence indicator for Europe remained at the
same high level in November as in October though stock markets
reported a decline in all EU member states between the two months.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that while confidence among consumers
remained unchanged, confidence in the retail trade sector improved
and remained above its 10-year average.
</P>
<P>
The positive climate reflected in the economic sentiment
indicator in the EU is also apparent in the leading indicator for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Questioned in October about the most serious problems affecting
their domestic economies, European economic experts again placed
unemployment at the top of the list, with budget deficits coming
second, which is also the case for the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Lack of confidence in government policy and weak demand ranked
third and fourth at world level, while they were given equal
importance at EU level.
</P>
<P>
The ranking of the problems has reportedly barely altered since
the April survey, the exception being that in Europe inflation is
now being considered a more important problem than foreign
indebtedness.

<HEADLINE> Republican Senator Rejects Clinton's Child Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Republican Senator Larry
Craig today criticized U.S. President Bill Clinton's plan to
expand federally funded child care programs, saying parents want
choices and "don't want the federal government telling them what
they need."
</P>
<P>
In the Republicans' weekly radio address today, Craig said the
government "should not discriminate against parents who decide to
stay home." He suggested that mothers or fathers who take care of
their own families should also be given benefits from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Clinton unveiled a 21.7 billion-dollar,
five-year child care initiative. The proposal would double to more
than 2 million the number of children receiving care subsidies and
increase tax credits for 3 million working families.
</P>
<P>
Craig said he was disappointed by the proposal and it would be
in addition to about 14 billion dollars the federal government is
already spending on child care.
</P>
<P>
Craig said, "What every family does not need is the government
telling them what is best or giving them a one-size-fits-all
solution. Congressional Republicans believe the best way to help
American families care for their children is to provide as many
options as possible and leave more money in their pockets, not
launder it through countless federal programs that shrink every
dollar they earn."
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised to discuss his child care initiative further
in his State of the Union address later this month.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reactions to Khatami's Message to American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian mass media today cast
mixed reactions toward the first address by Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to the American people.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's statement of no need for diplomatic ties with the
United States is praised while his regret over the issue of American
hostages is blamed.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Iran News said today that Khatami proved he had
nothing new to say on the issue of establishing relations with the
U.S., although the Western media said Khatami's statement was a
sign of Iran's willingness to establish ties with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the American people Thursday, Khatami said
that "we feel no need for ties with the U.S." in a diverse and
plural modern world. He called for cultural dialogue instead of
political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Even if Khatami has any penchant for establishment of
relations with U.S. Administration, he will not, logically, accept
such a high risk without obtaining any political concessions from
the U.S. in advance," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
At present, anyone who takes the first step to establish ties
with the U.S. without obtaining concessions from Washington would
be committing political suicide, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Confirming some positive points in Khatami's message, the
daily Jomhuri Elslami (Islamic Republic) expressed dissatisfaction
with his regret over the issue of American hostages captured by
Iranian students in 1979 following the occupation of the
U.S. embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Iran, Khatami expressed his regret over
the hostage issue, saying that it was an incident occurred at the
days full of revolutionary fervor.
</P>
<P>
The daily also expressed dissatisfaction with Khatami's remarks
on the slogan "Death with the U.S.." Khatami stressed that the
slogan was not aimed at hurting the American people but opposing
the hostile policy of the U.S. administration against Iran.
</P>
<P>
His remarks also aroused a sharp attack from the evening daily
Kayhan, which said that the Iranian president should let the
American people know the crimes committed by their government
against the Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted the mixed reactions to Khatami's message
indicated that there were still many hurdles on the way for the
two governments to open dialogue, particularly the strong
opposition inside the two countries against a possible
Tehran-Washington rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
"For normalcy to replace hostility, and suspicion to be
replaced by trust in American-Iranian ties, there is a long way to
go," Iran Daily said today, adding that the issue is a complex
bond of principles, truth and exigencies which need to be handled
with care and a lot of patience.
