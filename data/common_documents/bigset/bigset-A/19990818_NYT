WHY CAN'T COLUMNISTS HAVE SPONSORS TOO?

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The announcement Tuesday in New York that the
Heisman Trophy is taking on American Suzuki as its first-ever
corporate sponsor raises a few questions.
</P>
<P>
   1. If it has to be an automotive sponsor, wouldn't the Ford
Bronco be more appropriate?
</P>
<P>
   2. What next _ the Nobel Peace Prize, presented by Pizza Hut?
</P>
<P>
   3. How can I get a sponsor?
</P>
<P>
   Sports have reached a point where a commercial logo on your
stadium, your jersey or your good name is no longer considered a
sign of irreverence, desperation or greed.
</P>
<P>
   These days you can hardly be considered major league unless your
golf tournament is the John Deere Classic, your ballpark is the
Network Associates Coliseum and your bullpen ace takes home the
Rolaids Relief Pitcher of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it, there's good money in selling out to a
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena raked in seven figures last football season by renaming
its New Year's Day game ``the Rose Bowl, presented by AT&AMP;T.'' While
that didn't exactly conjure images of tailgate parties, brass bands
and pompons, it did strike the traditionalists as more dignified
than the Federal Express Orange Bowl, the Micron/PC Bowl and the
Poulan Weed-Eater Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's development, New York's Downtown Athletic Club,
bankrupt earlier this year, has worked a $1.5 million deal allowing
Suzuki to call itself the chief sponsor of the award that has
ranked as college football's greatest individual honor since 1935.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be known as ``the Suzuki Heisman Trophy.'' Or even
``the Heisman Trophy, presented by Suzuki.'' In fact, it's unclear
exactly what Suzuki gets for its money, other than the right to
change the subject when anybody mentions O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   If we're bombarded with Suzuki commercials every Saturday
afternoon for the next four months, that might have more to do with
another contract the company signed this week, a $35 million
marketing partnership with Time Warner to promote the Heisman in TV
and magazine ads.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that deal calls for Suzuki to sponsor fan balloting that
will result in the public jointly casting a single Heisman vote _
to be counted along with the 992 votes from sports journalists,
coaches and former winners.
</P>
<P>
   A Downtown Athletic Club official promised this is not a step
toward reducing the Heisman race to a popularity contest. ``We're
not going to do anything to compromise the integrity of the
award,'' club president Bill Dockery told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Curmudgeons will say the Heisman is already tarnished
by the very thought of a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Not me. My main worry is how to get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   This column aims to become an institution in the world of
sports, and as mentioned earlier, nowadays it's hard to achieve
that stature without a sponsor's name to confer importance.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, applications are being accepted for title sponsorship
(something like ``the Crayola Kevin Modesti Column'') or presenting
sponsorship (possibly ``the Kevin Modesti column, presented by
Helix Erasers''). It won't cost a million dollars, either.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, if I ran a sports franchise (or awards show,
tournament, racetrack, etc.), I'd have a hard time saying no to a
boatload of money if all I had to give up was the sanctity of my
name. Dodger Stadium? Fox Field? Melrose Place? Why would you care?
</P>
<P>
   People shake their heads at sports' many corporate tie-ins _
Monistat sponsoring ABC-TV's Women's World Cup scorebox, four PGA
tournaments called ``the Buick,'' an L.A. horse track changing its
marquee event to the Sempra Energy Hollywood Gold Cup _ and put it
down to some recent surge in crass American commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   In fact it's neither a recent development nor a particularly
American one.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a photo of Fenway Park's Green Monster covered with a
razor-blades ad during the 1946 World Series. The same ad is
visible behind Lou Gehrig during his farewell speech at Yankee
Stadium in 1939. ``Today I consider myself the smoothest-faced man
on the face of the earth''?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a cigarette ad above the center-field wall at the Polo
Grounds, out where Willie Mays hauled in Vic Wertz's drive in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The blank walls of ballparks in the '60s, '70s and '80s was an
aberration, not tradition. If you ask me, the ads painted on Dodger
Stadium since Fox bought the baseball team actually dress up what
had been a plain interior.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the international scene, the most popular sports
franchise of all is recognized by the large Sharp Electronics logo
across its jerseys _ not by the tiny Manchester United crest in the
corner. Soccer teams look as if they represent corporations, not
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese baseball teams do represent corporations, not towns. If
you don't think so, try to find Yomiuri (as in ``Yomiuri Giants'')
on a map.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's easy to decry the Heisman's fall from grace,
providing you think there was something sacred about it to begin
with. It would be harder to complain if Suzuki were waving $1.5
million in your face.

   BUSH-CRIME (Austin, Texas) _ Law and order has always been part
of George W. Bush's politics. He ran for governor of Texas in 1994
with a series of commercials depicting a man abducting a woman at
gunpoint in a parking garage, and a moment later, a police officer
draping a blanket over the woman's body. Bush promised to get
tougher with criminals, and that stand helped him win. An
examination of his record for the five years he has been governor
shows he has been consistent in pressing a law-and-order agenda.
But how Bush's record on criminal justice will appeal to voters in
other regions remains to be tested as he campaigns for the
Republican nomination for president. By Fox Butterfield.

   ANIMAL-RIGHTS-LAW (Undated) _ More than a generation after civil
rights and environmental lawyers took their battles to the courts,
there are now lawyers who say they are following in those footsteps
on behalf of clients with names like Freckles and Rainbow. Fighting
for creatures like performing orangutans and dogs used in
experimentation, the lawyers are creating a new field of animal law
with far more ambitious goals than traditionally weak anti-cruelty
laws. They are filing novel lawsuits and producing new legal
scholarship to try to chip away at a fundamental principle of
American law that animals are property and have no rights. By

humbled by bad publicity and weak profits, he seems determined to

U.S.-Russian joint fishing venture and transfer its ships and catch
quotas to a debt-ridden Russian rival has roiled the
multibillion-dollar fishing industry and raised the possibility
that foreign creditors will seize the ships. By Russell Working.

prizes in small Tuscan towns better known for their thermal baths.
But then it isn't often that medieval towns do become maverick

a form of escape _ from reservations, from a cramped city kitchen,

You could grab a cup of coffee at a little tent on Long Wharf,
where three Croatian immigrants set up shop in the very first year
of the gold rush, 1849, the year before California joined the
union. Landfill projects, earthquakes and commercial exigency have
forced repeated moves since, but the business has prospered under a
succession of Croatian-American owners. It still does. It is now
called the Tadich Grill, after a former proprietor who went to work
there in 1876. It is one of the state's oldest businesses, still a

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The pressure could have overwhelmed someone trying to replace a
teammate ravaged by cancer of the brain and lungs. And when she
joined the Comets before the season began, Sonja Henning recognized
she couldn't be the point guard Kim Perrot was for two years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I didn't come in with the idea that I'd replace Kim,'' Henning
said after Tuesday's practice at Westside Tennis Club. ``She's a
great player who has done great things. She was obviously
instrumental in the team winning two championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot buzzed around the basketball court in a frenetic hustle
accentuated by her 5-5 size. Henning, 5-7, brought a less
spontaneous, more measured approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's smarter than her coach,'' Van Chancellor said of
Henning, ``and that doesn't bother me. She's very analytical, like
a lawyer. Which she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Henning, 29, excels in courts of law as well as the
basketball kind. She has a law degree from Duke, obtained after a
bachelor's degree from Stanford, which followed a high school
grade-point average of 4.3 on a 4.0 scale.
</P>
<P>
   But being smart is a mixed blessing in most sports, including
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think Sonja is too analytical,'' Chancellor said.
``I'd like her to be more emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   He is careful not to add: ``the way Kim was.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Comets were slightly better when Perrot was calling
their shots, they are grateful for Henning's smooth floor direction
as the team works a pendulum offense _ back and forth between
Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   Entering tonight's game against Phoenix at Compaq Center, the
Comets are 24-5. They were 26-3 at this point last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, wins and losses seem sadly irrelevant as the Comets
ponder the helplessness of Perrot, breathing through a respirator
at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor visited Perrot after Monday's nine-point win over
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was lying there sleeping,'' he said. ``I just told her how
much I cared about her. She's still on this team, very much part of
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's practice, Henning said: ``I can't begin to
describe how much Kim affects the team. But the players understand
we have to be professionals and do our job. That's the way Kim
would like it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that two hours, we have to focus and refocus more than
usual. But the second we walk off the court, basketball is done and
over with. I think it will be that way through the rest of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she felt special pressures as the stand-in for Perrot,
Henning said: ``Not really, only because the entire team has been
so welcoming to the new players coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Henning has hesitated to mix too much of herself into the team's
chemistry, which may explain her understated style of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, I didn't want to shake up anything,'' she said. ``I
just wanted to ease in and go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team with strong personalities already,'' she said,
chuckling. ``And that's not a bad thing. Actually, it's a great
thing. But as a newcomer, you try to read and get accustomed to
other people instead of trying to be outgoing and outspoken.''
</P>
<P>
   The outspokenness she can save for her law practice, which has
waged a tug-of-war with basketball for her attention. After
graduating from Stanford in 1991, Henning played professional
basketball in Sweden for a year. Then she entered law school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she practiced labor and employment law in Los Angeles
for a large firm, Littler-Mendelson, which has a branch office in
Houston. When the American Basketball League first sought her
services as a player in the spring of 1996, Henning declined. She
changed her mind, however, when she talked with her new law
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They encouraged me to play,'' she said. ``They pointed out
there's only a small window of opportunity, that I should give it a
try and practice law later.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she intends to do that in the offseason when she
returns to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But first there is a third consecutive WNBA championship to be
won. As Henning and the other Comets are saying, ``Kim wants us to
win.'' The way they see it, that is is the least _ and perhaps the
most _ they can do.

VICTORIA, B.C., GETS FLUNKING GRADE FOR SEWAGE TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study calls the discharge of raw sewage into Canadian
waterways a ``national disgrace'' and cites Victoria as the worst
offender, flunking British Columbia's capital with an ``F minus''
grade for continued dumping into the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   The National Sewage Report Card to be released on Wednesday is a
successor to a 1994 study and finds that treatment has improved in
eight Canadian cities out of 21 surveyed. One is Vancouver, which
has upgraded two plants on the Fraser River from primary to
secondary treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Its lowest grades are reserved for Victoria as well as St.
John's, Newfoundland, and Dawson City in the Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by the Sierra Legal Defense Fund, a
Vancouver-based environmental group, on behalf of the United
Fishermen and Allied Workers Union and Georgia Strait Alliance. All
are critics of Victoria's sewage discharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sewage problems are comprehensive and countrywide, from
sea to stinking sea,'' concluded the report, which looked at
communities ranging from Toronto, with a population of 2.4 million,
to tiny Dawson City with only 1,700 year-round residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halifax and St. John's on the east coast, and Victoria on the
west coast, have no sewage treatment at all,'' it reported.
``Together, they discharge about 122 billion litres (about 35
billion gallons) of raw sewage into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Halifax, Nova Scotia's capital, escaped an ``F'' because it is
developing plans for treatment plants and diverting toxic
substances out of its sewage system.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria dumps more than 20 million gallons of untreated waste
each day into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, an international waterway
shared by the United States and Canada. It does screen large solids
out of its sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The sewage comes from 322,000 people in the British Columbia
capital and nearby suburbs, which constitute one of the
fastest-growing areas in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although no toxicity testing is required, Victoria-area
municipal governments have insisted that discharges from the
Macaulay Point and Clover Point outfalls cause only ``minimal''
environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment released last spring, the Capital Regional
District, an umbrella organization of local governments, said:
``Water quality at beaches in the vicinity of the outfalls is not
adversely affected by the two outfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim is vigorously disputed in the Sierra Legal Defense
Fund's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although sewage effluent is discharged into a large body of
water with strong currents and tidal movements, bacterial and metal
pollution extends from one to two kilometers (.62 to 1.25 miles)
away from the MacAulay Point outfall,'' it reported.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that ``an extensive area'' in the Strait
of Juan de Fuca has been closed to shellfish harvesting by order of
Canada's fisheries ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Capital Regional District has committed since 1986 to
acquire land for construction of a sewage treatment plant. Eleven
years ago, it began discussing land acquisition with Canada's
Department of National Defense for a treatment plant near Macauley
Point, located in Esquimalt just west of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   But the district has yet to set aside land for a sewage
treatment plant ``nor does it appear to have any intention of doing
so,'' according to the report card.
</P>
<P>
   The district has recently negotiated a deadline extension until
July 2000 for delivery of a waste management plan, designed to
include a schedule for upgrading to primary and secondary
treatment. In 1991, Canada's environment and fisheries ministries
first instructed the district to upgrade at least to primary
treatment of Victoria-area sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Cost estimates for treating Victoria's sewage have ranged from
$90 million to $600 million (Canadian), and neither the provincial
nor Canadian federal governments have shown any eagerness to pay
much of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The status quo has a powerful defender in David Anderson,
Canada's minister of the environment and Victoria's member of the
federal parliament in Ottawa. In a recent interview, Anderson
argued that cold, fast-moving waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
effectively disperse and oxygenate the sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sewage is treated naturally,'' Anderson said. ``Within
meters of the discharge outfalls, you have sailboarders. Within 400
meters, the sewage is barely detectable. It is one of the few
places in the world where this occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a discussion with Seattle Post-Intelligencer
editors, Anderson added: ``The best wind surfing we have in
Victoria is off Dallas Road, right between the two outfalls. They
don't glow as they walk down Government Street. They don't drop
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1983, however, the fisheries ministry closed down
shellfish harvesting in waters near the discharge outfalls in
Victoria and Esquimalt. The closure area now totals more than 30
square miles of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Sierra Legal Defense Fund sought to bring a
private prosecution _ which is legal under Canadian law _ against
the Capital Regional District for violating federal fisheries law
as well as British Columbia's waste management act.
</P>
<P>
   The sewage report card gives a ``C minus'' grade to Vancouver.
It notes upgrading of the two Fraser River treatment plants, and a
sharp reduction in sewage overflows.
</P>
<P>
   But Vancouver's largest treatment plant, at Iona Island, offers
only primary treatment and ``is the single biggest source of
pollution in Georgia Strait,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sewage is not just human waste,'' added the report. ``Studies
show that typical municipal sewage contains some 200 synthetic
chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary sewage treatment, a process adopted by U.S. cities on
Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, kills bacteria and
removes both solids and nutrients from sewage. It requires
construction of a treatment plant, which holds ponds in which
solids are settled. The remaining liquid sewage is treated with
micro-organisms, which remove objectional materials.
</P>
<P>
   Across the strait from Victoria, Port Angeles, Wash., has spent
more than $31 million on a secondary sewage treatment system. Port
Townsend, Wash., has estimated its costs at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria is looking at several options for treatment. One is
simple screening, in which sewage is chopped up. Another is sand
filtering. A third is treatment with chemicals.

ABBOTT'S AWESOME FOR M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Passing through customs today, they'll ask him if he
brought anything back from Canada that he didn't take in.
</P>
<P>
   For Paul Abbott, the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   A career-high nine strikeouts, a career-best fourth victory in a
big-league season, even greater job security.
</P>
<P>
   The well-traveled Abbott, playing just about everywhere but
north of the border in a 15-year pro career, Tuesday night
continued to do whatever the Mariners ask of him. Against the
Toronto Blue Jays, the former starter-turned reliever-turned
starter again gave them 61/3 innings in an 8-5 victory at SkyDome,
overcoming the occasional slip-up with determined stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 4-and-0 is really big for me,'' Abbott said. ``I want to
stay here for awhile. A fast start is something I felt I needed to
show people to prove I belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was the third consecutive for the Mariners (59-60),
flirting once more with the .500 mark, a place they haven't been in
two weeks. They polish off a six-game road swing through the East
today with a 10 a.m. getaway game against the Blue Jays, now losers
of six straight.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott wasn't sharp at the outset, but teammates Edgar Martinez
and Ken Griffey Jr. were. Martinez unloaded two home runs in the
first three innings, his 17th and 18th, while Griffey cranked his
American League-leading 37th in the third, helping build a 6-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' starting pitcher nearly didn't stick around long
enough to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the third inning, Abbott was face to face with
manager Lou Piniella and a possible hook after giving up a pair of
runs and going six-deep in the Toronto batting order. But the
right-hander remained cool under the inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me how I felt, and I said, `Fine,''' Abbott said.
``He said, `Well, I'm not.' So I tried to accommodate him and make
him feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   With two runners on and two outs, the pitcher found the proper
remedy. He got the next hitter, Darrin Fletcher, to ground back to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   For the 31-year-old Abbott, it has been a long, grinding journey
to reach this point. He didn't join the Mariners until June 25,
recovering from offseason knee surgery. He has bounced between the
rotation and the bullpen since. For that matter, he has bounced all
over baseball, unable to make a breakthrough until going 3-1 for
the Mariners in a September callup last season _ matching the
number of wins he had for Minnesota in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Blue Jays and in just his third start this season,
Abbott was convinced he lacked velocity and tried to compensate.
That made him wild. Then his patience and changeup took over. He
retired 11 batters in a row, striking out five of them.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was pulled when Toronto's Homer Bush ended his string
with one out in the seventh. Homer hit a homer over the
center-field fence, pulling the Blue Jays within 7-4. Normally
unflappable, Abbott was shown slapping the bench hard several times
with his glove by a TV camera, action that made him turn sheepish
later when told that it had been captured on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, my kids are going to see that,'' he said. ``I wanted
to get through the seventh inning and help the bullpen out. That's
why I was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Once over the initial frustration, Abbott was informed he had
surpassed a personal big-league best in strikeouts by two.
Satisfaction set in.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates have come to expect just about anything from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what he has to do,'' said Griffey, supporting his
pitcher with his 99th and 100th RBIs. ``He's been around. He's
overcome arm and knee surgery. He knows what it takes to be in a
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Said left fielder Brian Hunter, ``I think he's here for good and
making a name for himself at an important time for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had to use four relievers to finish the job, which
is never easy with this club. Jeff Fassero ended the seventh, using
one pitch to draw a double-play grounder with two on. An inning
later in a similar situation, Jose Paniagua needed just two pitches
for another double-play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa, pitching for the fourth consecutive day and facing
four batters, closed out the ninth for his 27th save in 30 tries,
six off the club record.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents will want to know what Abbott was doing in
Canada. Considering his wayward background, he might need to show
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The box score should work.

SEATTLE SHOULD SING PRAISES OF HAWKS' SINCLAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY _ Given what happened with Randy Johnson and Shawn Kemp,
what happened with Michael Sinclair should have been a bigger deal.
</P>
<P>
   But what's happening with his teammate, Joey Stay-away, is the
latest local hoo-hah over money in pro sports. So the good news
rarely makes the front page.
</P>
<P>
   Against all conventional wisdom and advice of friends, Sinclair,
30, recently signed a seven-year contract extension worth $35
million, including a $6 million signing bonus, to finish his career
with the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, nothing but the bonq! is guaranteed. But the NFL sack
leader last season, and for the past three seasons combined, had
enough career achievements that at any recent time he could have
complained of insult, lamented about the team direction, demanded a
trade to a bigger media market, and generally held the franchise
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   You know. What Johnson did. What Kemp did.
</P>
<P>
   It's what many star athletes do, which is why some of them said
what they said to Sinclair, a sixth-round pick out of Division II
Eastern New Mexico _ who, it could be argued, is the best
dollar-for-dollar defensive investment in Seahawks history, ahead
of high first-round picks Kenny Easley, Jacob Green and Cortez
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys told me I was crazy for staying in Seattle, a team that
wasn't going anywhere,'' he said after practice this week. ``They
said you need to be in a large television market because nobody
knows about you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wasn't interested. That doesn't make me a better
player because people know about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the Texas native interested in uprooting his family,
leaving his adopted hometown or quitting on his often-lamentable
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Then he really pinned the needle the wrong way on the Pro
Athlete Indulgence Meter.
</P>
<P>

FOSTER READY TO RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After enduring the past two seasons with a couple of
rim-rattling, air-balling centers, the Sonics decided Tuesday to
hire one who could fill the lane as well as the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal might not be trembling with the news that the
Sonics signed Greg Foster to a three-year contract, but the free
agent from Utah should provide more firepower than his
predecessors, Jim McIlvaine and Olden Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings us experience, versatility and depth,'' said coach
Paul Westphal. ``He's gone against the best guys in the West and
his team has come out all right. We're comfortable with him as
another piece up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Added team president Wally Walker: ``He's a skilled big guy. Our
emphasis is with the big men shooting the ball. ... He's a perfect
fit for the way we hope to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics want to run this season. Foster is eager to get in
the starting blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about getting up and down the floor,'' he said.
``At Utah, we were half-court oriented. We'll be playing an
exciting brand of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-11, 250-pound Foster arrives with career averages of
4.3 points and 2.8 rebounds. Seattle is his seventh stop in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a teammate of Gary Payton's at Skyline High in Oakland,
will start or back up Horace Grant, whose more natural position is
power forward. But Grant is known for his low-post defense on
larger opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's addition is the final one of note for the Sonics. The
team is out of cap room and will bolster its training camp roster
with lesser-known players signing minimum contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The only major move remaining is the signing of free agent Vin
Baker in a deal that could be announced later this week. Last
season an overweight Baker floundered. Westphal anticipates that
Baker will find his All-Star form from two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be shockingly disappointed if I don't see that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sonics dumped 10 players who were on last year's
roster and added six new ones, Walker believes they will be able to
contend with Pacific Division champion Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``It's going to be a very competitive
team. It's a playoff team.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal realizes the enormity of the challenge but thinks the
Sonics, who were 25-25 last year, have made enough offseason
acquisitions to factor into the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team got old,'' he said. ``People have to come to grips
with that. We're trying to reshuffle and get younger and still
compete at a high level. We'll go to war and see how good we are.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics enter training camp Oct. 4, their biggest hole
will be at small forward, where Detlef Schrempf manned the position
for the past six seasons until defecting to Portland earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year players Vladimir Stepania, Rashard Lewis and Ruben
Patterson will lodge a battle for the majority of playing time.
Westphal said Brent Barry, Vernon Maxwell and Grant could play
small forward, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any one dominant guy,'' Westphal said. ``At the
same time, we can match up a lot of different ways.''

<P>
   TORONTO _ Let the Mariners roster shuffle begin.
</P>
<P>
   American League officials Tuesday upheld Frankie Rodriguez's
seven-day suspension, effective immediately, and shortened Jay
Buhner's four-day penalty to three, beginning Aug. 25, for their
roles in two separate fights.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes one day after appeals hearings were conducted
in SkyDome. Counting reliever Jose Paniagua's recently concluded
five-game punishment, the Mariners will have to play short-handed
for 15 of 16 contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it amounts to is we're going to have to juggle for the
next 10 days,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella foresees having to send out a pitcher and recall a
position player when Buhner sits down. Even when all the
suspensions have been served, the Mariners must play a doubleheader
in Chicago on Aug. 30, and PinielH!$says he will send out a

JAIL'S BAN ON SEX MAGAZINES UPHELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER AND JIM WALSH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rare move, a federal appeals court reversed another
appellate ruling Tuesday, upholding a ban on ``Playboy'' and other
sexually explicit materials at Maricopa County jails.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-4 vote by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the
regulation, imposed in 1993 by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, reasonably
ensures jail safety without violating inmates' First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge appellate panel ruled last year that the ban was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio, who received complaints from female guards that ``girlie
magazines'' were used to harass them, hailed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sets a standard,'' he said. ``I always said I'd go
to jail before I'd give back those ``Playboys.''''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Nicholas Hentoff, who argued in court against the ban,
called the decision ``extremely bad case law that is going to have
a devastating impact throughout the 9th Circuit,'' which covers
nine Western states.
</P>
<P>
   ``No court has ever upheld a policy that infringes upon inmates'
rights as severely as this does,'' said Hentoff, who may ask the
U.S. Supreme Court to review Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit said the
regulation, which bans photographs and drawings that show frontal
nudity, was too sweeping. The panel said the ban could be applied
to publications such as ``National Geographic'' or books containing
well-known works of art.
</P>
<P>
   But late last year, at the county's request, the full 9th
Circuit withdrew that decision without explanation, scheduling the
case for review by a special 11-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``en banc'' reviews are rare and generally indicate a
concern to clarify a significant point of law.
</P>
<P>
   The initial decision in the case, issued in 1998 by U.S.
District Judge Robert Broomfield, also upheld the ban. Broomfield
said there was a ``logical connection'' between banning sexually
explicit materials and preventing problems in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Appellate Judge Thomas Nelson, author of Tuesday's ruling,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between the possession of sexually explicit
materials and the problems sought to be addressed by the policy _
sexual harassment of female officers, jail security and
rehabilitation of inmates is clear,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Betty Fletcher noted that many
jail inmates are pretrial detainees, not yet convicted of any
crimes. She said the ban was ``an imposition . . . totally out of
proportion to the problem at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority apparently concludes that the First Amendment
does not protect the right of, for example, a non-violent,
non-harassing pretrial detainee to pursue his general equivalency
diploma by reading a Western Civilization textbook containing a
chapter on the art of the Renaissance,'' Fletcher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates at the Madison Street Jail were outspoken Tuesday in
their disappointment over the court's ruling, arguing that sexually
explicit magazines reduce violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that was fair. Looks don't create problems,''
said Darrin Casey, 35, who is awaiting trial an a charge of
aggravated assault on a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Casey said inmates would only use the magazines for sexual
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (a sexually explicit publication) stops a lot of
the violences in the jails. I think it helps more than it creates
problems,'' he said. ``A lot of these guys are sexually active.
These books keep the tension down and brings down the stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Othoniel Echavarria, 18, said allowing the magazines could
reduce the contraband problem at the jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would cause guards less trouble, searching through the
mail,'' said Echavarria, who is awaiting trial on a charge of armed
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   But he also considered how sexually explicit magazines could
have an undesirable effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get (sexually excited) or something and want to
sexually assault women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton White, 33, who is in jail for marijuana possession, said
he does not understand why the court would allow his First
Amendment rights to be violated by the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our constitutional right to look at magazines,'' White
said. ``It's a human body. There's nothing wrong with looking at a
human figure, and it relieves stress that could be put on other
inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nelson wrote that the court should apply ``a deferential
standard of review'' to the regulation ``and uphold it if it is
reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.'' He said
harassment incidents were reduced sharply after imposition of the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   But in another dissenting opinion, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld said a
trial should be held to test, among other things, whether the ban
was intended to punish inmates. Kleinfeld noted that a press report
about Arpaio's defense of the ban quoted him as saying, ``Jail
means punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona has to convict these people before it is entitled to
punish and rehabilitate them,'' Kleinfeld wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to ``Alice in Wonderland,'' he wrote, ``We must
not follow the Red Queen's injunction, `Sentence first - verdict
afterward.' '' &QL;

   ``I guess a major earthquake happened here,'' she told Ertemalp,
a software development manager. ``I just want you to know it was
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the line went dead a few minutes later as circuits
overloaded, Ertemalp felt relief, an emotion shared by several
other local residents who heard Tuesday from family and friends in
Turkey by phone or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But for Jamil Razzak, spokesman for Idriss Mosque in Seattle's
Northgate area, every passing moment is filled with uncertainty
about his sister and her family in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how they are,'' he said softly. ``I can't get
through _ the telephone network is jammed. It's terrible. ... I
don't know what to say. I have to hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gokcen, a Boeing engineer who leads a local Turkish
cultural group, is collecting relief items that he wants shipped in
a new Boeing 737 that's coincidentally scheduled for delivery
Thursday to Turkish Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch disasters on the other side of the world, you
(feel like you) can't do anything,'' said Gokcen, a Kirkland
resident and vice president of the Turkish American Cultural
Association, which has about 1,000 members. ``So it would be a
great help to get donations and send them to people.''
</P>
<P>
   No formal plans for the relief shipment have been approved at
the corporate level, but ``we're going to work with (Gokcen) to
make it possible,'' said Craig Martin, a Boeing spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gokcen and his wife, Feral, have not strayed far from their
television, watching Turkish news coverage of the 7.8-magnitude
quake via satellite. The Anatolia news agency in Turkey sets the
death toll at 2,138 and the number of injured at 13,179.
</P>
<P>
   Although both of their families survived the quake in Istanbul,
``you don't know what will happen next,'' Feral Gokcen said. ``It's
so hard to hear about all those people who were hurt badly. A lot
of people are under the buildings. They cannot reach them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband said Turkish TV showed five-story buildings that
``collapsed like a playing-card tower,'' with hospitals seeking
help from residents with even a minor medical background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to school there. All our relatives are there _
parents, sisters, brothers, siblings, plus our classmates,'' John
Gokcen said. ``It's very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond research engineer Hakan Urey said that when he called
his brother in Istanbul, ``he was shaking very badly. He tried to
get out of bed three times and couldn't. A wardrobe was falling on
top of him. Once the quake stopped, he got up and spent the night
in the street, like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Washington in Seattle, the Jackson School
of International Studies heard Tuesday via e-mail from Associate
Professor Resat Kasaba, who taught earlier this summer in an
exchange program at the University of Botacizi in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent most of the night awake because of the earthquake,''
Kasaba wrote. ``All is well where I am, but large parts of
(Istanbul's) surrounding regions and several large cities in
western Turkey are damaged quite extensively.''
</P>
<P>
   After the initial call from his mother, Ertemalp, the Microsoft
manager, could not reach her again by phone for 12 hours. He sent
e-mail to friends in Turkey and was surprised that they were able
to respond so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were fine and happy that I checked on them,''
he said. ``They're scared and are listening to the radio and
watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Since much of Turkey rests on a fault line, minor earthquakes
with a magnitude of 4.0 _ the kind that sets Seattle news crews
scrambling _ cause hardly a stir. Even when a 5.6-magnitude quake
would strike, ``people just look at each other and say, `Oh, an
earthquake just hit,''' Ertemalp said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey sits on ``an earthquake valve,'' said Istanbul native
Sevgi Baran, a computer support technician at Seattle Central
Community College. ``Shakes happen once in a while. But this is a
major one.''
</P>
<P>
   Baran tried 45 minutes Monday (Seattle time) before getting a
phone call through to relatives. All were safe except for an uncle
in the nearby town of Golguk, whom no one has been able to reach.
Two cousins searched for him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baran is a member of the Turkish American Cultural Association,
many of whom came to Washington to work at Boeing, Microsoft or in
the medical field, John Gokcen said.
</P>
<P>
   Feral Gokcen said she is moved by the relief efforts under way
from people worldwide, as well as by those in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the hurt people, we see from TV, are trying to help
others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Editor's note: Those wishing to donate clothing, canned food or
blankets should contact the Gokcens at 425-739-6722 or Hakan Urey
at 206-794-2973.

CONTRACT FOR NEW HUSKY COACH A REAL TAIL-WAGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seven months after he became the University of
Washington's head football coach, Rick Neuheisel signed a contract
that will make him the wealthiest coach in the Pac-10 and among the
highest paid in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year deal announced Tuesday could pay Neuheisel up to
$997,000 annually if he achieves academic and performance
incentives written into the contract, which includes a provision
for a two-year extension.
</P>
<P>
   The school also will pay off in three installments an $800,000
home loan Neuheisel secured when he was Colorado's head coach. This
pushes his annual compensation to $1.157 million over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Barbara Hedges rejected the notion that paying
a football coach such a hefty salary betrays the mission of an
educational institution, where the university president and top
professors earn far less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a totally different arena,'' Hedges said. ``The
reality is that you have to be in the market place. This is a very
visible position. It has a lot of responsibility. We do generate a
substantial amount of money in our football program, which places a
certain amount of pressure on the coach. As a result, we
compensated the coach for that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's salary at Colorado was $650,000. Florida coach Steve
Spurrier is the nation's highest-paid coach with a $2 million
annual package. Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, Tennessee's
Phillip Fulmer, Ohio State's John Cooper, Penn State's Joe Paterno,
Kansas State's Bill Snyder and Texas' Mack Brown also make $1
million or more per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited that the university feels about me in such a way
to merit this kind of salary,'' Neuheisel said. ``I'll try to prove
over the next several years that I'm worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay in finishing Neuheisel's deal developed because of a
new state ethics law that restricted how state employees may obtain
outside income. That forced money Neuheisel will receive from KOMO
($125,000) and Fox Sports Northwest ($100,000) to be paid through
the university.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's only outside income will come from Nike ($60,000)
and a guaranteed $25,000 from ``other corporate opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's base salary will be $225,000.
</P>
<P>
   The contract contains two incentives: one based on the Huskies'
graduation rate and a lump payment of $40,000 if the team plays in
a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   If the team graduation rate is 75 percent, he will receive
$60,000. If the rate is between 70-74 percent, he earns $40,000. He
gets $20,000 if the rate is 65-69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The team's most recent graduation rate was 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel is free to pursue personal endorsements as long as he
doesn't use the university's name or logo. He can make additional
income from summer football camps.
</P>
<P>
   If the university fires Neuheisel, it must buy out his contract.
Neuheisel will get $560,000 for the first year. If he has
additional years remaining on his contract, he will get $420,000
the second year and $280,000 the third year.
</P>
<P>
   The university is not responsible for these payments if it
terminates Neuheisel with cause, such as NCAA violations or a
serious act of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   If Neuheisel leaves before his contract is over, he must pay the
university $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other contract details:
</P>
<P>
   --A $160,000 annual housing allowance.
</P>
<P>
   --Two courtesy cars and $2,000 a year for mileage.
</P>
<P>
   --The school will pay for Neuheisel's wife, Susan, to attend all
away football games, all postseason events and two additional
business-related trips. The Neuheisels also will get $25,000
annually for family travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   --Membership at the Broadmoor Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Though the raise from his days at Colorado is significant,
Neuheisel insisted it wasn't the only reason he decided to leave
Boulder for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money was not the deciding issue,'' he said. ``Money gave me
cause to really investigate and learn as much as I could about the
University of Washington. When I looked into my own personal
crystal ball, I thought this was the place to be.''

A'S HOMERS OVERPOWER RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-ATHLETICS-REDSOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for the Red Sox basking in the afterglow of Brian
Daubach, mythmaker.
</P>
<P>
   That notion was snuffed out like a sidewalk cigarette butt
Tuesday night, as the Sox were exposed to the double horror of Bret
Saberhagen breaking down and John Wasdin melting down in the course
of the same evening.
</P>
<P>
   With Saberhagen gone after just two innings and conceding that
he may be headed back to the disabled list for a third time, the
Oakland Athletics cruised to a 12-1 win over the Sox, who offered
Wasdin as a human sacrifice in the seventh inning, when the
visitors sent 12 men to the plate and scored eight times.
</P>
<P>
   The win pulled the pesky A's within a game of the Sox in the
wild-card race, as they put on the same show of power they used to
sweep three games in Toronto over the weekend while scoring 31
runs, or just over 10 a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point, `Am I going to be helping myself or
hurting the team?' '' said Saberhagen after his shortest outing in
18 starts, which he left down, 4-0. ``Obviously, tonight was a
situation that didn't help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the muscles in his shoulder are so weak, Saberhagen
said, they're not holding his rotator cuff in place and
inflammation has resulted. He has backed off his weightlifting
program, hoping he would feel less pain between starts, but that
has not been the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times he has come into the clubhouse and
wanted to cry, but he's a brave man,'' said Pedro Martinez, who
caused a brief stir after the game when he said he'd been alerted
he might pitch Wednesday night because Pat Rapp was attending to a
family matter, though club spokesman Kevin Shea later said Rapp
will take his turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My choice is to miss a start, go on the DL, or change my
workout program and try not to miss any starts,'' Saberhagen said.
``I need to come in tomorrow and talk to a few people. No sense in
jumping in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that he even would utter the words suggests that
Saberhagen likely is headed to the DL. If that happens, expect to
see Tim Wakefield back in the rotation. Jimy Williams tipped his
hand by sending his closer to the bullpen in the first inning
Tuesday night and bringing him in at the start of the third to
throw 85 pitches, though Williams insisted he did so only because
Wakefield was the freshest arm in the pen.
</P>
<P>
   With just 43 games left, this is no time for the Sox to be
losing Saberhagen. They're 13-5 in games he has started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be here one way or the other,'' he said.
``Whether I'm shutting it down, getting it right, or working
through it, I'm just one player of 25,'' he said. ``With or without
me, we're going to carry on and do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go down a player is not going to make or break this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's, who have homered in 18 straight games and 36 of their
last 37, went deep three times Tuesday night, as shortstop Miguel
Tejada and first baseman Scott Spiezio hit three-run blasts and
left fielder Ben Grieve hit a two-run shot. That was plenty for Gil
Heredia, the righthander who lost to the Sox, 7-2, on May Day but
now has won seven straight decisions after his 10-hit complete
game.
</P>
<P>
   The only Boston run came on Mike Stanley's 16th home run in the
fifth, when the Sox still had a chance to be in it, but John
Valentin grounded into a double play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   By the time this lost cause was over, Butch Huskey was the new
third baseman, Scott Hatteberg was catching, and Martinez's double,
Bryce Florie, was back to his customary role of mopping up somebody
else's mess.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen knew he was a beaten man early, as he went single,
single, home run, single to the first four batters in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen gave up a bloop RBI single to Randy Velarde and hit
Grieve with a pitch before finally getting out of the inning, but
not before the A's had an early 4-0 lead for the second straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield actually gave a good accounting of himself, holding
the A's to two singles over four scoreless innings. But that all
evaporated in the seventh, when Velarde hit a one-out single and
Grieve hit a 3-and-1 knuckler over the bullpen wall.
</P>
<P>
   When Wakefield walked John Jaha and Matt Stairs doubled,
Williams beckoned for Wasdin. Spiezio greeted him with a three-run
home run to make it 9-1, and there was no reason for Williams to
burn another pitcher in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   So Wasdin was left to absorb three more runs on three hits and a
walk, as the crowd of 31,246 left jeers with their beers as they
departed in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Florie, Saturday's substitute starter for a tardy Martinez,
worked the last two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heredia pitched a strong game for them,'' Williams said. ``And
of course, their bats speak for themselves.''

PRIVATE SEATTLE U. LAW SCHOOL FILLS THE GAP IN DIVERSITY AFTER
LAW'S PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This summer, a classroom on the Seattle University
campus was the scene of something that no longer exists at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Students studying criminal law created a strikingly diverse
portrait: 10 African Americans, 10 whites, six Asians, three
Hispanics and two Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   All came into the SU Law School through an admissions program
that gives special consideration to minority applicants.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington voters approved Initiative 200 last November,
they banned the UW and other public universities from using
affirmative action to bring in minority students. Indirectly, that
vote also challenged private institutions, not bound by I-200, to
keep the door open to more minority students.
</P>
<P>
   But with relatively high tuitions, it's not certain private
institutions can do the job _ particularly in a field like law. In
attracting minority students, the SU Law School has to contend with
a tuition of $19,110 a year, compared with the UW's in-state
tuition of $6,009 and out-of-state cost of $14,802.
</P>
<P>
   SU has a $1.3 million scholarship fund for law students and
doles out awards of between $2,500 and $11,000 annually, said Carol
Cochran, SU's acting director of law admissions. But that's not
enough for most students _ even adding in federal loans of up to
$18,500 a year _ to cover tuition and living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran is also concerned that I-200 is having a chilling effect
on applications to Seattle University, particularly when
out-of-state students who may perceive the state as unfriendly to
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a great job with what we have, but I would have
liked to have seen more applicants of color,'' Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, SU and the UW will enroll about the same proportion
of minorities in their entering law classes: 23 percent for SU, 22
percent for UW.
</P>
<P>
   For the UW this represents a sizable drop. The percentage of
incoming minority students is at its lowest since 1989. SU, on the
other hand, is holding steady.
</P>
<P>
   To Roland Hjorth, dean of the UW Law School, the prospect of SU
becoming the more diverse school is the ultimate irony. Hjorth has
long maintained that a diverse student body adds not only to the
the classroom, but also to society's trust in the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital that everybody has faith in the legal system, and
it's difficult for people to have faith in the legal system if
they're not in it,'' Hjorth said.
</P>
<P>
   The UW leadership has said the school will look for ways to
maintain racial diversity within the bounds of the law. This year's
numbers, however, are not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   SU, too, has long emphasized the need for lawyers from diverse
racial and economic backgrounds _ a philosophy in keeping with the
Jesuit ideals of service and justice that guide the school.
</P>
<P>
   The special admission program took effect in 1987. In its first
six years, it helped the law school recruit two-thirds of its
African American and Native American law students and half of the
Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always seen that as part of what a law school ought to
be about and what a university ought to be about _ to meet the
needs of society,'' said David Boerner, an SU law professor who
teaches in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond race, however, SU's program searches for those students
who are long on potential but short on academic preparation _
people from impoverished backgrounds or those who have been away
from college for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people could not get into the University of Washington
Law School,'' said the Rev. William Sullivan, SU's president for 20
years and current chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Without SU's special program, they may not make it into law
school and, thus, into the legal profession at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just a matter of get out and do anything you can to
get your percentages up,'' Sullivan added. ``It seems to me more of
a case of: here are some population groups who are not going to be
well-represented in the legal profession in the future unless some
special educational efforts are made to bring them in and support
them academically.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, law schools around the country have been a
focal point in the national debate over affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The first successful reverse discrimination case to hit the
courts this decade was filed by three white applicants to the
University of Texas School of Law, who said they were rejected
because of admissions practices that favored blacks and
Mexican-Americans. In a major victory for affirmative action foes,
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1996 ruled that UT's
admissions policies were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Similar cases are pending against the University of Washington
and University of Michigan law schools.
</P>
<P>
   To defend against those lawsuits, institutions are increasingly
searching out studies that demonstrate the value of diversity to
every law student's education and to bolster contentions that
standardized tests such as the LSAT are biased.
</P>
<P>
   One analysis that examined applicants to 173 law schools in
1990-91, showed that if decisions were made entirely based on
grade-point averages and test scores, only 687 of the 3,435 black
applicants who were accepted to law school would have made it in.
The analysis, by Professor Linda Wightman, appeared in the New York
University Law Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, researchers at Harvard commissioned Gallup to
survey 1,820 law students at Harvard and the University of Michigan
about how racial diversity affected their educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the students surveyed said the racial
diversity of their law school classes enhanced or moderately
enhanced how they and their peers thought about problems and
solutions in class. Nearly three-quarters said having students of a
different race in class was a ``clearly positive'' element of their
educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   SU's Alternative Admissions program admits about 10 percent of
every class based on factors beyond grades and test scores.
Students must attend a summer course that combines criminal law,
legal writing and study strategies. Extra academic support is
available through the first year from the school's Academic
Resource Center. The support is critical to helping these students
graduate and pass the bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think we do anyone a favor just by letting them in
and letting them crash,'' Boerner said. ``It wouldn't make any
sense just to admit people if you don't make any attempt to make
sure they succeed. We want to produce lawyers, not just students.''
</P>
<P>
   The law school is very protective of the students admitted
through the alternative program, promising them anonymity as they
go into the highly competitive first year of law school.
Administrators fear that students would face a bias that they
aren't qualified or resentment from other students who don't get
the additional academic support.
</P>
<P>
   Blanca Rodriguez, a 1997 graduate who came in through the
alternative admissions program, said she was the first in her
Spanish-speaking family to go to college. She graduated from
Pacific Lutheran University with a decent grade point average and
so-so LSAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   Her application to SU explained that she wanted to take her
legal expertise back to the Yakima Valley, where her parents toiled
as farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come back to this community, the farm worker
community, and I wanted to help this community gain access to the
things they are lacking _ working conditions, collective bargaining
contracts, things like that,'' said Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Being Hispanic was far from the only factor that qualified her
application for special consideration _ a point that SU
administrators make strongly. Students come into the program for a
number of different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Wiley, a 1994 graduate, entered law school after a 12-year
hiatus from higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It promotes a richness and diversity that's defined in so many
other ways than the way me may traditionally think of diversity as
along the lines of race and gender,'' Wiley said of the program.
</P>
<P>
   SU doesn't have a recent analysis of how well students admitted
through the special program do, but a 1990 comparison of
alternative admissions students to the closest 10 percent of
regular students showed that their academic performances were
essentially the same, said Paul Lustbader, director of the Academic
Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Ojeda, who graduated from SU's law school this spring,
was an undergraduate at the UW. While there, he was active in the
community of Hispanic students. He, for one, hopes that SU will
provide even greater opportunities for poor and minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did respect the UW's efforts in recruiting minorities, and
I'm sure they'll do what they can, but they definitely have one
hand tied behind their back,'' Ojeda said. ``I hope in this area
Seattle U. can pick up the slack.''

   Seated in the clubhouse Tuesday with his right foot propped
against his locker stall, the rookie quietly engaged reporters with
stories from his baseball past. Daubach does not shy away from
retelling the now-familiar tale. A Midwestern upbringing and nine
years in the minor leagues have made him too polite to turn down
interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   He candidly recounts his long conversion into a power hitter,
who at 27 leads American League rookies in extra-base hits,
doubles, and home runs and ranks near the top of the freshman class
in hits, RBIs, and multihit games. In his last 12 games, Daubach
has batted .460, with eight home runs, seven doubles, one triple,
and 24 RBIs. He mentions with all modesty that when he started as a
professional in 1990 with the New York Mets organization, he was
unable to hit or run well. And the rookie claims he still can't
run.
</P>
<P>
   But the reigning American League Player of the Week stops short
of saying he enjoys all the attention recently heaped upon him. His
three-run, game-winning double Monday against Oakland and his
heroics against Seattle over the weekend changed the rookie's world
without giving him much time to take measure of his growing
popularity or celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether people on the streets recognize him, Daubach
said, ``I think a little bit more, especially when I'm leaving the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I don't really care about any of that. I just enjoy
being here a lot. I like the fans here. They've been great to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new. In the minor leagues, there's not that much
coverage. Here, especially us being in a wild-card race, it's a new
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go along and enjoy it. Actually, during the games I
don't notice it that much. It's easier to relax during the games.
It's a bit overwhelming, for sure. I've come a long way and the
fans here love the players so much. They're behind us so much. It's
definitely an experience that I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Being new to the hero role, Daubach did not hold a special
celebration Monday night. He did not call home to Belleville, Ill.,
and relive his latest highlight with his parents, who watch most of
his games on satellite television. And he had no trouble falling
asleep or reporting for designated hitter duties Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed the same,'' said Daubach. ``Nothing was different.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the rookie assessed his new situation correctly.
The Fenway autograph-seekers still clamor for Nomar Garciaparra.
Parents have to point out the man shagging ground balls and list
his recent accomplishments before a glimmer of recognition crosses
their children's faces.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday night's game, however, Daubach was greeted with a
standing ovation before his first two plate appearances. The same
fan enthusiasm accompanied his six-minute at-bat Monday night. For
many recently converted Daubach admirers, the attraction lies in
his low salary ($230,000), his long road to the major leagues, and
the element of surprise he has provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep myself in my seat and stop myself from
going over there to get an autograph,'' said Karen Hart of West
Boylston, who made her first trip to Fenway Tuesday night in large
part to see Daubach. ``I saw an interview with Brian on one of the
local channels when he first came up. He was so humble and shy. I
was just taken with him right away because he did his time in the
minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent feats by the rookie had even general manager Dan Duquette
sounding downright giddy. He likened Daubach's Monday night hit _
on a full count, in the ninth, with two outs, the bases loaded, _
to the stuff of Little League dreams, the ultimate childhood
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very rarely do you see a ballplayer compose himself the way
Daubach did after he hit a ball (foul) out of the park,'' said
Duquette. ``He composed himself and went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The GM sees little reason to send the AL Rookie of the Year
candidate back to winter ball. A break from the game will be a
change for Daubach, who has spent past offseasons selling shoes and
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he'd have to work on,'' said Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   That compliment comes a year after Boston considered picking up
Daubach from Florida. Originally, the Red Sox thought they could
sell the lefthanded hitter to a Japanese team. Instead, the Marlins
released the career minor leaguer in the fall with an early-morning
phone call. The news woke up Daubach. As he remembers, he fell back
asleep, only to have the reality of his situation set in later.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach can insist that nothing is different after the last
week, but no doubt his dreams are sweeter.

BAN URGED ON CUTTING OLD PINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona and New Mexico environmentalists are urging a halt to
the cutting of large, old ponderosa pines north of the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   And they are calling for the firing of John Bedell, supervisor
of eastern Arizona's Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, alleging
failure to protect wildlife and coziness with the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts follow one environmentalist group's victory
already this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe-based Forest Guardians challenged a plan to cut up to
90 percent of the trees surrounding Flagstaff in order to stop
fires, starting with an experimental grove below the San Francisco
Peaks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service in Albuquerque upheld the group's
appeal, ruling Aug. 3 that Coconino National Forest officials
failed to consider the project's impact on potential archaeological
sites and places considered sacred by Arizona tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The regional office also ruled that the project _ planned over
10 years to cover up to 100,000 acres _ may produce results
requiring more extensive review and hearings. It ordered Coconino
officials to further investigate the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagstaff victory was followed Friday by an appeal by a
consortium of Southwest environmental groups to block a proposed
timber sale on the Kaibab National Forest, north of the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal said the estimated 1,800 truckloads of logs that
would be cut across 6,000 acres in the proposed Dry Park timber
sale would decimate some of Arizona's last good stands of
old-growth ponderosa pines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Kaibab Ranger District is an ecological treasure as
well as the gateway to the Grand Canyon National Park,'' said Brian
Segee, forest defense coordinator for the Center for Biological
Diversity, which filed the appeal with the Sierra Club and the
Southwest Forest Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People visit the area to see one of the natural wonders of the
world, not a bunch of stumps,'' Segee said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the proposal ``nothing more than a desperate attempt
to keep a dying timber industry alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Kaibab National Forest could not be reached for
comment. Pat Jackson, appeals review officer for the Southwest
office of the U.S. Forest Service, said he could not comment on a
pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Forest Service policy in Arizona and New Mexico is
to keep at least 20 percent of the forests in an old-growth
condition, meaning there is a variety of age, size and condition of
trees. Biologists and environmentalists contend that old-growth
forests provide the best habitat for wildlife, especially for many
species in danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Johnson, the Forest Service regional director of forest
health, said the forests north of the Grand Canyon have enough
old-growth trees to allow some to be harvested by the timber
industry. Thinning some of the older trees, he said, could enable
other trees to get bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Johnson said, ``some of our sites would never become
old growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Martos Hoffman, executive director of the Southwest Forest
Alliance, said that with nearly 95 percent of Arizona's original
old-growth forests already cut, now is the time for a moratorium on
cutting all large trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the Forest Service to realize that the logging
of big, old-growth trees is not compatible with saving our forest
eco-systems,'' said Hoffman, whose group represents 70,000
environmentalists in Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said the move is toward saving all trees 16 inches in
diameter and bigger, and to log only the smaller, fire-prone trees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Washington, D.C., group of environmentalists who
work for the Forest Service and other federal agencies is calling
for the firing of John Bedell, who since 1990 has been supervisor
of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, in a letter
dated Aug. 5 to Forest Service Chief Michael Dombeck, claimed
Bedell has:
</P>
<P>
   Consistently made decisions ``with an emphasis on commodity
production over balanced and scientifically based resource
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Created a hostile work environment for Forest Service employees
and hostility toward members of the environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   Fostered a hostile political climate in commodity-dependent
small towns, including a radio program in which Bedell blamed
recent drops in timber production on efforts to save Mexican
spotted owls, which since 1993 have been threatened with
extinction. Environmentalists contend that the drop was caused by
overcutting the forests in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dyson, spokesman for the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest,
said that Bedell was sent a copy of the firing demand, but that no
action has been taken and that neither he nor Bedell would comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inappropriate for us to respond to that. It's not
addressed to us,'' Dyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Zabinski, spokeswoman for the regional office of the Forest
Service in Albuquerque, said her office had not seen the letter and
could not comment. &QL;

LAWMAKERS CONSIDER MOVE TO ELIMINATE KANSAS BOARD OF EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON and JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ When state Sen. Rich Becker of Lenexa was vacationing
in London last week, he picked up a copy of the Evening Standard
and was shocked at what jumped out at him.
</P>
<P>
   In the London newspaper was a story about the Kansas Board of
Education voting to leave evolution out of the state standards for
teaching science in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed it to a couple of people and they said, `Boy, Kansas
really is the laughingstock of the world now,' &UR; '' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4 vote touched off renewed interest among some lawmakers
in eliminating the elected 10-member board, making it appointive or
stripping it of its power to act without legislative direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a strong breach of good sense,'' Rep. Ralph
Tanner, a Baldwin City Republican who heads the House Education
Committee, said of the board's action.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner, Rep. Tom Sloan of Lawrence and Sen. Barbara Lawrence of
Wichita, who heads the Senate Education Committee, are scheduled to
meet this afternoon with Gov. Bill Graves. The state board's future
is on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this issue will galvanize a number of people to do
something,'' said Tanner, who requested the meeting with the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Those on both sides of the issue freely acknowledge that it will
not be easy to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's going to be one of the biggest issues we face
in the year 2000,'' said Rep. Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican who
does not like the idea of eliminating the elected board.
</P>
<P>
   Any revision would require a constitutional amendment. Before an
amendment could be placed on the ballot, two-thirds of the House
and Senate members would have to agree, and such majorities are
hard to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway of Shawnee, who heads the state education board,
doesn't expect any move toward abolishing the board or
restructuring it to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd be surprised if there is a big change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas voters, she said, do not like the idea of losing their
opportunity to vote for a state board member. In 1990 they rejected
a constitutional proposal to allow the Legislature to decide how
the board would be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who voted with the majority on the science standards,
said: ``Here are elected officials going to the public and saying,
`You don't have enough sense to vote for an elected board of
education, but vote for me.' That's kind of a schizophrenic
message.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Jim Garner, a Coffeyville Democrat, also
said he was reluctant to eliminate an elected board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the solution is electing better people to the state
Board of Education. Maybe this incident will heighten interest and
increase the awareness of the importance of this office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is support among leaders in the Senate and House for
moving away from the elected board.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park Republican, is
among those who would like to make the board appointive.
</P>
<P>
   By sparking undesirable publicity, members of the education
board increased chances the Legislature would try to abolish their
group, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should send the state board a `thank you,''' he said.
``Sometimes it takes some pain to get a cure.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Robin Jennison, a Healy Republican, would like to
abolish the board or make it appointive. In any event, he believes
the governor should appoint the state's education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people go to the ballot box and vote for their board
member having no idea what their board member wants to do with
education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the arguments sure to be forwarded by those who want to
change the board is what they consider a blemish on the state's
image caused by the evolution vs. creation debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are promoting your state for new business, or for
tourism, when you're working at the national level to bring
opportunities into the state, this kind of publicity is damaging,''
said Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer, who heads the state's economic
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Companies study a variety of factors when they make decisions
about locating in Kansas. Sherrer and his aides work constantly to
portray Kansas as a good place to live and work.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers and others begin to campaign for change, the
governor is stepping back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is we elect professionals to the state Board of
Education who in turn rely on the advice and opinion of Kansas
education professionals and make and set public policy,'' Graves
said.

RANGERS BURY INDIANS UNDER 19-HIT ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Rangers looked sluggish against the Chicago
White Sox last week and positively comatose against the Toronto
Blue Jays on the last homestand.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when they face the All-Star-laden Cleveland
Indians before nightly sellout crowds at Jacobs Field?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers transform themselves into the 1927 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers flogged Indians pitching for the second consecutive
night with 19 hits, including home runs from Juan Gonzalez, Rafael
Palmeiro and Luis Alicea, and muscled their way to a 15-4 victory.
The Rangers remain 5 1/2 games ahead of Oakland in the American
League West and closed to within two games behind the Indians in
the home-field advantage competition.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that tediously espouses the one-at-a-time adage, the
Rangers seem to be playing with a little more fire against the
Indians than the Blue Jays or White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team gets a little more fired up here,'' third
baseman Todd Zeile said. ``You hear so much about Cleveland,
especially the fact they're an offensive team and have a reputation
for being such good sluggers. That's one of the reasons we match up
so well with them, when it comes to slugging, we can hang in there
with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The beating started early with six runs in the first inning off
Indians starter Mark Langston and six more in the next two innings
off reliever Tom Martin.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third, the Rangers were up 12-1, starter Aaron
Sele was well on his way to his 13th victory and some of those same
Indians fans who perhaps stuffed the All-Star ballot box earlier in
the season were now lustily booing their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were a little motivated coming in here,'' shortstop
Royce Clayton said. ``Anytime you come up against the caliber of
team they have over there, you have to raise your game. We did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have scored 28 runs on 35 hits in two nights against
the Indians. Combine the final four innings of Monday's game and
the first three innings yesterday and the Rangers scored 23 runs on
24 hits in a seven-inning stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in their 10-0 victory over the White Sox on Sunday, their
only victory in Chicago, and the Rangers have scored 38 runs on 51
hits in three games.
</P>
<P>
   They've been doing it with some serious muscle, hitting 12 home
runs in three games. The Rangers have also hit 50 home runs in
their last 26 games after hitting just two in their first seven
games after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Rangers are clobbering the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain because this team is better than the
White Sox,'' Palmeiro said. ``You just have to play hard every day.
Sometimes you win big, sometimes you run into something like
Chicago, where things don't go right.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important hitting was done in the first inning against
Langston. The Rangers loaded the bases with one out on singles by
Rodriguez and Rusty Greer and a walk to Gonzalez. Langston then
struck out Palmeiro, giving the lefty a chance to get out the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Zeile, revived after a case of food poisoning, came through
with a two-run double to left-center, his 11th hit in 18 at-bats
with the bases loaded this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Zeile had the big at-bat of the night,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Bases loaded and he \RLangston\S struck out
Raffy; he's got a chance to get out of the inning without giving up
any runs. But Todd's hit got us going, and we were able to add
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers followed that with a run-scoring infield hit by
Roberto Kelly and a two-run double by Clayton. When Langston,
thoroughly frustrated, totally misplayed Tom Goodwin's infield
roller and allowed Clayton to race home from second, the Rangers
were leading 6-0.

SUPERVISORS WANT TO BAN GUN SHOWS ON COUNTRY PROPERTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- One week after the shooting rampage in the San
Fernando Valley, two county supervisors said that they want to ban
gun shows at the county fairgrounds and other Los Angeles
County-owned locations.
</P>
<P>
   A third member of the five-person Board of Supervisors said he's
willing to consider the ban on gun shows at the Fairplex in Pomona
east of Los Angeles, while a fourth was out of town but considered
likely to support a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun violence, especially gun violence perpetrated with illegal
automatic and semiautomatic weapons, has torn at the heart of this
county,'' said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who called for the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Gun shows like the one in Pomona, he said Tuesday, are ``the
great commons of America when it comes to the distribution of
illegal weapons. Everybody knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the operations manager of the Pomona gun shows, Chad Seger
of Great Western Shows, said security has been tightened in the
past few months to prevent illegal sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we even suspect someone of criminal activity, we'll kick
them out,'' Seger said. Buyers face a 10-day waiting period, so
they cannot walk out of the shows with guns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., a white supremacist who FBI officers
said admitted killing letter carrier Joseph Santos Ileto in
Chatsworth and wounding five people at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center in Granada Hills on Aug. 10, evidently bought one
or more firearms at gun shows, Yaroslavsky said, speaking at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky also said the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms found that the gunmen in a ferocious 1997 shootout at the
Bank of America in North Hollywood obtained weapons from vendors
they met at gun shows, including the Pomona show.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she supports a ban.
Supervisor Don Knabe made no commitment but said he is ready to
consider a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich wants to see the language of
the proposed ordinance but opposes a ban on constitutional grounds,
said spokesman Cam Currier.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gloria Molina was on vacation Tuesday, but sources
close to her said she is likely to support Yaroslavsky's motion.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky formally asked on Tuesday for a report from the
county's in-house lawyers to be made at the Board of Supervisors
meeting next week on the options available to the county, including
an ordinance banning sales or possession of firearms and ammunition
on county property. The ban would exclude those who carry weapons
in the line of duty, such as law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   Great Western Shows pays rent to hold four gun shows a year at
the county-owned Fairplex.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Lee Baca favors a ban on gun shows at the Fairplex,
Deputy Steve Sciacca said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Association, which leases the Fairplex from the county,
says a ban would take away almost one-third of its yearly revenues.
Gun shows generated $600,000 for it last year.

RANGERS MANAGER THROWS SUPPORT TO RODRIGUEZ FOR MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates made his endorsement
official yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said catcher Ivan Rodriguez should win the American
League's Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, with all due respect to the other guys, I've seen him
every day and I know how valuable he is,'' Oates said. ``I can be
prejudiced, but it would be tough for me to vote for any other
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing surprising about a manager endorsing his own
player. Oates actively campaigned for Juan Gonzalez in 1996 when he
believed his right-fielder wasn't getting enough attention.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez was the Rangers' only MVP candidate that season.
They have two this year: Rodriguez and designated hitter/first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Raffy's numbers are deserving,'' Oates said. ``But you
look at Pudge's offense, what he's done for our ballclub, the way
he shuts down other teams' running game, playing every day, the
possibility he could have 100 runs scored and 100 RBI, I think
Pudge is deserving of being most valuable player.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez entered yesterday's game hitting .331 with 85 runs
scored, 28 home runs and 85 runs batted in. He had also thrown out
55.5 percent (30-of-54) of base runners attempting to steal, the
highest percentage in the majors, and he had picked off seven
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MVP would be nice,'' Rodriguez said. ``It would be great,
but I'm trying not to think about that. I just need to keep doing
what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro entered yesterday's game hitting .335 with 31 homers
and 103 RBI. But knee surgeries in February and March have limited
him to designated-hitter duty for much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Oates admitted it would be tough for a DH to win the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we have both of them on the ballclub,'' Oates said.
``But with everything else being equal, the two most demanding
positions are catcher and shortstop. For someone who has been
basically a DH, he would have to have overwhelming numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The last catcher to win the American League MVP was Thurman
Munson of the New York Yankees in 1976. Don Baylor of California
won the award in 1979 while playing 65 games at designated hitter
and 97 in the outfield. That's the most games at DH by an MVP
winner. Palmeiro has started 98 games at DH.
</P>
<P>
   Other top MVP candidates include Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra and Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who are 1-2 in the
American League in hitting; Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr.,
who leads the league in home runs; and Cleveland Indians outfielder
Manny Ramirez, who is way ahead in RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, offense gets more recognition,'' Oates said.
``But Pudge could score 100 runs and drive in 110 and save another
30 runs with his defense. You've got to add that in.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Ken Caminiti wants to take things one step at a time. But he's
clearly making strides.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caminiti hit a go-ahead two-run single in his second game since
coming off the disabled list Tuesday night as the Astros held on
for an 8-6 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers before a crowd of
20,558 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely baby steps right now,'' said Caminiti, who had
returned to the lineup Monday for the first time since May 21. ``I
got a little better timing, but I'm still trying to see like a
hitter, think like a hitter. I'm just going up there hacking. You
always wish you could do more than what you did, but I'll take what
I did. It could have been a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   With their second straight win over the Brewers, the Astros kept
pace with the Cincinnati Reds in the National League Central. The
Reds, who remain percentage points ahead of the Astros, beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates 7-4 in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have won six of eight meetings with the Brewers this
season. Scott Elarton (7-3), pitching on 10 days' rest Tuesday,
allowed four runs and eight hits and struck out seven in six
innings. The righthander also added his first major-league RBI in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio hit a two-run homer in the eighth that proved to be
the difference as the Brewers rallied for two runs in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   When Jay Powell couldn't nail things down in the ninth for the
Astros, Billy Wagner entered with runners at second and third and
two out and struck out pinch hitter Alex Ochoa for his 29th save in
31 chances this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of this series, Wagner has a pair of
saves. He has struck out all four batters he has faced, needing
only 14 pitches to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wagner is on, he's unhittable,'' Milwaukee manager Jim
Lefebvre said. ``I think they have the best staff in the National
League. Atlanta's got great starters, but their bullpen is
susceptible.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, 0-for-3 Monday in his return from a strained right
calf, sparked a three-run third inning with a bases-loaded single
to center off Cal Eldred (1-6) that gave the Astros a 4-3 lead.
Lance Berkman added a sacrifice fly in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who said his timing isn't where he wants it, played
nine innings for the second straight game. He will not be in the
starting lineup tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the second and third weeks (of spring training). My
body is pretty achy,'' said Caminiti, who has played in only 38 of
the Astros' 121 games this season. ``I'm just trying to go out and
do the best I can and not try and hit the ball out of the park. The
pressure is not on me to win every game by myself. That's not my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like Caminiti, Elarton was pleased to be back on the field.
Days off in the schedule and lingering stiffness in his right
shoulder had kept Elarton out of the rotation since Aug. 7. The
rustiness showed early as he allowed four hits, three runs and a
walk through two innings. Two of the runs came on a double to the
center-field wall by Eldred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit tentative,'' Elarton said. ``I never let it
go in the bullpen (during pre-game warm-ups), and I paid for it
early. I don't know if I was scared or what. I got back into a
rhythm and started letting it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who is 2-1 since moving into the starting rotation July
3, helped his cause with a run-scoring single down the right-field
line in the second, the third hit of his career and his first RBI
in 17 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got lucky,'' Elarton said.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee broke a 21-inning scoreless drought in the first
inning when Mark Loretta's double-play grounder scored Ron Belliard
from third. Jeff Bagwell, who had his second straight two-hit game,
tied the score at 1 with a ground-rule double to right-center field
in the bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who allowed five runs, five hits and five walks in five
innings, hit his two-run double in the second as the Brewers
regained the lead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros bounced back with three runs in the third, two coming
off the bat of Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's the biggest hit of the game,'' Biggio said.
``That gave us a little confidence and momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Milwaukee got singles from Belliard, Rich Becker
and Dave Nilsson, the last driving in a run that sliced the Astros'
lead to 5-4. The Brewers threatened in the seventh inning with a
runner at first base, but Carl Everett caught a fly ball to right
and doubled up Brian Banks heading back to first.
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit a sacrifice fly off Dave Weathers in the sixth, and
Biggio hit a two-run homer to left-center field in the eighth off
Rocky Coppinger to make the score 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee pulled within 8-6 in the ninth on a two-run single by
Belliard, who was 3-for-5, off Powell.

FAULT IN TURKEY SIMILAR TO L.A.'s 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Big One _ an earthquake on the magnitude that
caused the catastrophe in Turkey _ would cause massive damage in
the Los Angeles area, but tougher building codes here could keep
the death toll lower, seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   There are notable similarities between the North Anatolian Fault
in Turkey and the San Andreas Fault in California.
</P>
<P>
   Both are strike slip faults nearly 1,000 miles long, storing
tremendous energy generated at the confluence of tectonic plates.
Both are located relatively close to millions of people. Both have
produced deadly quakes.
</P>
<P>
   There is one main difference that gives scientists reason to
pause. While the North Anatolian has a track record in this
century, producing a domino effect of seven earthquakes between the
first in 1939 and the latest Monday, the San Andreas hasn't let
loose in nearly a century, and its southern half hasn't shaken the
earth in more than 300 years.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have warned for years that the San Andreas' southern
half is in the ``window'' of probability for a temblor potentially
on the scale of the great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 that hit
7.9 or 8.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like bending a stick, and if you keep bending and
bending, you've stored up more energy than the strength of the
fault. Bingo,'' said James Dolan, an earthquake geologist with the
Southern California Earthquake Center at the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a large earthquake potentially much larger
than this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is a frightening prospect given the toll in Turkey: More
than 2,000 people were killed, 10,000 injured and thousands more
were missing following 45 seconds of shaking felt as far as 200
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Geophysicists at the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center
described the quake as one of the most powerful recorded in the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said the toll in Los Angeles and neighboring areas
from an earthquake on a similar magnitude could be different given
building and safety codes tightened in the wake of Southland
earthquakes _ the most devastating being the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake that hit 6.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we're the great innovators. It's because we
have more earthquakes,'' said Bob Steinbach, principal building
inspector for the city of Los Angeles Department of Building and
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take every opportunity to learn. Hopefully we will be in a
position to learn from what happened in Turkey as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Northridge, the city has required structural engineering
inspections of steel-frame high-rises given concerns over cracked
welding. The city also adopted an ordinance for concrete
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   An existing city ordinance that required retrofitting of
unreinforced masonry buildings proved critical when the Northridge
Earthquake hit. All but 200 of the 8,500 buildings covered by the
ordinance had been retrofitted and none fell. Owners leveled 52
that suffered damage, Steinbach said.
</P>
<P>
   The Big One on the San Andreas, however, would put building and
safety standards to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Major earthquakes on any of the Southland's major fault systems
would create strong, violent shaking. These faults under urban
areas include the major blind-thrust fault systems like the
Oakridge system that triggered the Northridge event and the Puente
Hills Fault, south of downtown, that was discovered this year
through oil and gas data.
</P>
<P>
   The Big One on the San Andreas, however, would generate longer,
stronger waves that lose energy more slowly, said Ned Field, a
seismologist for the earthquake center at USC.
</P>
<P>
   The ground movement could last 40 seconds to more than a minute.
Wood frame homes could withstand the impact better than high-rise
buildings and freeway bridges, Field said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A home will be like a little boat in a sea of huge waves. A
bridge would be like a tanker and could be broken down the middle
because one side might be going up while the other side is going
down,'' Field explained.
</P>
<P>
   When the ground will move with such destructive force is the one
question scientists can't answer.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, a team of scientists calculated there was a 60
percent to 70 percent chance of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the
San Andreas within 30 years. Three years ago, one of those same
scientists said such a Big One could be larger, in the range of
magnitude 8.5 or greater, but might not come in anyone's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Most in the field, however, contend the San Andreas isn't
capable of generating any magnitude beyond an 8.0 because the Big
One likely will hit on the southern half and the entire fault would
be needed to generate a more powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, though, indicates how the seismic science continues
to evolve. Turkey's latest earthquake provides another laboratory
for learning more about their locations, size and frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big earthquakes are about the best chance we have to watch
these faults in action,'' said Susan Hough, a seismologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey office in Pasadena. ``There's not a lot of
them this big that produce earthquakes this large.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, with the USC Earthquake Center, was preparing to return
to Turkey soon after learning of the earthquake. He completed an
annual research trip to study the North Anatolian Fault less than
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those rare instances where if you ask any
seismologist where the next big earthquake will be in Turkey, this
was the next most likely place,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physics of that fault is similar to the San Andreas. We
know that we could have it here,'' he said. ``It's ripe, it's
mature.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ More than 2,100 people have been reported
killed by the powerful earthquake that struck northwest Turkey
before dawn on Tuesday, destroying thousands of buildings and
giving rise to a vast archipelago of tent-cities erected by people
afraid to sleep indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, which struck at 3:02 am. local time on Tuesday,
ripped through villages and cities while most people were asleep.
Thousands were shaken out of their slumber to find walls
collapsing, windows shattering and roofs tumbling down on top of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that more than 13,000 people were
injured by the earthquake and that they expected the death toll to
rise. Countless bodies remained trapped under pulverized buildings
early Wednesday morning. The most passionate plea from Turkish
government officials to neighboring countries has been for more
digging equipment and more dogs to help locate victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many living people who still have not been saved
from beneath collapsing buildings,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
said on Turkish television Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter was near the industrial city of Izmit, about 55
miles east of Istanbul, where as many as 1,000 people were killed,
most of them trapped inside huge apartment buildings that crumbled
within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, site of a naval base on the southern coast of the
Izmit Gulf, more than 248 sailors and naval officers were trapped
under collapsed buildings, with scores of people still unaccounted
for by late Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was by far the strongest on record in this area,
although the exact magnitude has not been determined. Turkish
seismologists said the quake registered a magnitude of 6.7, while
U.S. scientists first reported a magnitude of 7.8 but said
additional measurements of the quake's intensity could lower that
number.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, hundreds of buildings collapsed to dusty piles of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic, endless and exhausting race to dig out bodies from
beneath the wreckage, rescue crews used bulldozers, tower cranes,
front-end loaders and jackhammers to dig into piles of debris 20
feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenarios played out across a wide swath of Turkey,
which included highly populated regions like Istanbul, with 12
million people, and Izmit, with nearly 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary destruction, most of Istanbul's
stunning mosques and their minarets survived the disruption and
appeared to remain in fairly good condition. Even while the vast
majority of apartment buildings were dark, both because of power
failures and residents' widespread fear of staying indoors, the
mosques remained well lighted and eerily serene against the late
summer sky.
</P>
<P>
   The treasured landmarks of the city, including the Blue Mosque,
Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia, were spared any visible damage.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul on Tuesday night became transformed into a city of
tents and lean-to shelters as hundreds of thousands of people,
afraid of aftershocks, camped out across the city along highways,
in parks and in parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is too afraid to stay indoors,'' said Aydin Ayaydin,
a member of Parliament who represents the Avcilar district of
Istanbul, an area where as many as 70 buildings collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Jusuf Sever, a 54-year-old high-school teacher in Avcilar,
watched in shell-shocked dismay Tuesday evening as soldiers and
about 100 construction workers tried to dig through the mountain of
concrete that had been his apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fast asleep, along with my wife and my daughter, when we
woke up and the whole building was swaying back and forth,'' he
recalled, pointing to what remained of his bed on the fringes of
the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, the ceiling was gone and we were looking at the
stars in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Sever's apartment was on the fourth floor of a six-story
building. The two floors above him were simply ripped off the top
of the building, which allowed the family to escape without injury
before the rest of the building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many areas were without electricity or water late on Tuesday. A
large oil refinery not far from Izmit exploded and burned
uncontrollably for hours, pouring black smoke over the area.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. energy secretary, Bill Richardson, was in Istanbul at
the time of the quake and was unhurt. Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was also visiting Turkey and
offered help such as helicopters, tents and blankets from U.S.
bases there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many people were already raising questions about whether
slip-shod construction practices had made a bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In areas that were badly hit by the quake, many buildings with
little visible damage stood beside others that were utterly
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of buildings along the main road through the
Avcilar section were still standing, interspersed every few blocks
by apartment buildings that were heaps of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively new five-story apartment building with balconies
and satellite dishes looked as if it been pulled out of the ground
and tilted on its side. Each floor, from the front balconies to the
rear windows, remained parallel to the one above it but now sloped
at a 45-degree angle toward the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ozgur Oztopcu, a chemical engineer, stood watch over the
diagonally shifted balconies of his friend's apartment. The friend
had a wife and two daughters and one was still missing. ``I don't
think she is still alive,'' Oztopcu said.
</P>

<P>
   Telephone service within Turkey was disrupted in many areas but
seemed to be functioning normally by the end of the day. But people
trying to telephone from abroad found it almost impossible to reach
anybody in Turkey for most of the day. In part, that was because
countless thousands of callers with relatives and friends in Turkey
were jamming the international phone links into the country. But at
least part of the problem appeared to be due to the limits of the
telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the earthquake raced around the world Tuesday,
governments from Europe, the United States, Israel and Iran pledged
to send medical supplies, equipment, rescue workers and other forms
of support.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greece, which has squabbled with Turkey for decades, sent
condolences and indicated it would send an airplane to help out.
</P>
<P>
   But as dust-caked soldiers and medical workers heaved slabs of
rubble under the glare of spotlights throughout the night,
thousands of people kept a weary vigil in the hopes of finding
friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the biggest natural disaster I have ever witnessed,''
Ecevit told the Turkish people. ``May God help our state and our
people.''

5-YEAR-OLD UPGRADED TO FAIR CONDITION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A week after being critically injured by a hail
of bullets, 5-year-old Benjamin Kadish was upgraded to fair
condition at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, where his father
issued a statement thanking all those involved in the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This heinous act of violence, born of hate, has gone full
circle to become a birth of compassion and tolerance,'' hospital
spokesman Steve Rutledge read from a statement by Charles Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin was wounded along with two other young boys, a
16-year-old counselor and a receptionist at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center in Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday marked the first day Benjamin was able to sit up and
move around the hospital in a wheelchair, said Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., who has been linked to white
supremacist groups, allegedly fired some 70 rounds from a
semiautomatic weapon at the center before going on to kill postal
worker Joseph Ileto in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   He then traveled to Las Vegas, where he turned himself in and
confessed to the shootings the next day, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shootings, government officials and human rights
groups have vowed to step up the fight against hate crimes with new
legislation and educational efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin received the most serious injuries in the shooting at
the center and was still shaken up after a week in intensive care,
hospital personnel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kadish family has been reluctant to speak publicly in the
aftermath of the shooting, but Tuesday's statement was full of
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No child or family of any religion or ethnicity should ever
have to experience the trauma that we have,'' Charles Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked public safety officers and hospital staffers for
their ``tenacious determination'' to save Benjamin, who is
undergoing therapy and is due to leave the hospital by next week.

INFLATING THE COST OF 'FREE AIR' 
</HEADLINE>
 COL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After decades in critical condition, customer service in America
officially died last Friday. That's when I stopped at Circle K,
shiny quarter in hand, desperate to inflate my right front tire,
and instead made a horrific find.
</P>
<P>
   The price of air had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I didn't believe it, either. But there it was, written
large on the Air-Serv tire inflation machine.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty cents.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to repeat after me, fellow consumers: ``Why, those
lousy, price-gouging, two-quarter-wanting (at)$)(s!''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what I thought upon paying Circle K's 100 percent price
hike for a few measly seconds of air, and what I was still thinking
later, when I phoned the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary
Sciences, I found Dr. Ronald G. Prinn, who heads the Advanced
Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment. Prinn is an author and a NASA
consultant. His resume requires its own glossary. His expert
opinion? &QL; 
THE EXPERT SPEAKS &QL; 
``I think I can say with some authority that I know of no
scientific reason why the air in Arizona has doubled in price.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so science is out. This leaves . . .
</P>
<P>
   PURE CORPORATE GREED!
</P>
<P>
   While on hold with Tosco, Circle K's corporate parent, I spent a
minute reliving the good old days in America: when a motorist could
pull into a gas station and be met by a large, toothless man in a
John Deere cap and greasy uniform. Not only did this man pump your
gas, he would also check to make sure your tires were properly
inflated. If they weren't, he would give you as much air as needed,
an unlimited amount of air, absolutely gratis.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I wasn't alive to see that, but the story has been
passed down from generation to generation in my family.
</P>
<P>
   As for the story at Circle K, it was predictably complex.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Julie Igo said Tosco doesn't actually own the air
machines, but merely rents the space to vendors. Recently, the
management firm overseeing the air contractors OK'd the price hike,
said Igo. Tosco Corporate had no clue. &QL; 
CHANGE IS COMING &QL; 
``When we found out about it,'' she said, ``the very first thing
was, `No way, not gonna happen.' We forced them to change it. It's
just going to take about two weeks. It's an error, but we're
definitely going to change them back to 25 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sounds good to you, maybe, but not to me. It's time for a
stand.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I've loyally shopped Circle K, paying a premium for
the ``convenience'' of a quick buy. Not any more, thanks to an
inspiration provided by California Assemblywoman Nell Soto.
</P>
<P>
   Soto has sponsored a bill declaring air and water essential to
the safe operation of motor vehicles and ``therefore public safety
requires that free air and water be accessible at all service
stations.''
</P>
<P>
   AB531 has passed the California Assembly, despite loud
opposition from lobbyists for the petroleum industry, and next week
moves to the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be service stations, and they had to give you
service,'' said Soto. ``Now, if you're lucky, you get a human being
to take your money.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until they figure out how to replace humans with
coin-operated robots. I'm not waiting around for that, though.
</P>
<P>
   While I'll still buy air at Circle K, I'm going to pass on my
$30 a week in gas. Although many big chains also charge for air,
I'm not resting until I've found a gas station where air is free.
</P>
<P>
   As the Good Lord intended air to be.
</P>
<P>
   Losing my $1,500 a year in business surely won't bother Tosco,
but I figure why concede the point?
</P>
<P>
   First it's 25 cents for air. Next, the toilet stall gets a
coin-operated lock. After that, they turn the store into a vacuum
chamber and rent you scuba tanks to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: Leibowitz, calm down, take a deep
breath. And I may, soon.
</P>
<P>
   While a deep breath is still free of charge. &QL;

CLOCK TICKING ON L.A.'S NFL BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All is eerily quiet in Los Angeles' fleeting bid
to land the NFL's 32nd franchise, offering yet another signal that
the expansion team appears poised to slip away.
</P>
<P>
   After a raucous first week of August, during which the state
withdrew from the expansion process when the league asked for
public funding and the NFL announced it would no longer focus on
the Coliseum _ opening the door for Houston to land the new team _
there has been little 11th-hour activity to save the Los Angeles
bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have calmed down, but not in a way that's good,'' said
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has made perfunctory contact with the city of Carson and
Hollywood Park, two previously discussed Los Angeles area expansion
sites, but Aiello said there has been no significant development.
</P>
<P>
   With the league's Sept. 15 deadline now only four weeks away,
Carson and Hollywood Park are viewed as almost ridiculous
longshots. The Coliseum effort came to a sudden halt when the NFL
requested the public funding to support the bid, and it has been
unable to gather itself since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to re-engage them, but it's not looking that
great right now,'' said Ed Roski Jr., one of the would-be team
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he is drafting a letter to send to the NFL he hopes
will reopen negotiations, emphasizing that there really is no need
for the two parking structures estimated to cost more than $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing turned around on this parking,'' Roski said.
``We have over 12,000 existing spaces around the Coliseum once the
Sports Arena is eliminated. If we build a parking garage, no one is
going to want to park in it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stalled when we asked for public funds for parking
structures we do not need. This isn't like other places. We don't
have inclement weather to worry about when walking to our cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's unspoken concern, however, is the safety of the
neighborhood surrounding the Coliseum. The league wants ample
parking that is both close and secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with the neighborhood?'' Roski asked. ``For the
whole year, 72 perent of the crimes reported in the neighborhood
were during the 10 games the Raiders played. It's nothing to do
with the neighborhood. USC plays at the Coliseum and it's never a
problem. The neighborhood ... that makes me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, about the lone
remaining optimist in the L.A. bid, called a press conference to
try and instigate a ``45-day action plan'' to save the waning
Coliseum expansion bid.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas called a meeting of the New Coliseum Partnership
Executive Council Tuesday night, still trying to solidify the
expansion bid and focus efforts over the next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The councilman remains upbeat that the Coliseum deal is not dead
and the NFL still wants to come to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NFL is still very interested in making this deal
happen, and I've had no indication to the contrary,'' Ridley-Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas said he remains in constant contact with NFL
representatives and doesn't believe they are simply honoring the
Sept. 15 deadline before awarding the franchise to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said. ``I look these people in the eye,
and they want to do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is just not going to walk away from one of the most
promising sites they could have in their foreseeable future. That's
just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, time grows scarce. Aiello said the league wasn't
about to give odds on any of the proposed sites in Los Angeles in
the final month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll leave it to others to handicap,'' he said, ``but time is
running out, that's for sure.''

POLICE OFFERS AT JEWISH CENTER HAILED AS HEROES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- From a 14-year veteran to a 4-month rookie, the
Los Angeles police officers who came to the aid of the victims in
the North Valley Jewish Community Center shootings were honored as
heroes by the Los Angeles Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are true heroes who speak modestly of their actions in
performing their duties,'' Commission President Gerald Chaleff said
Tuesday of the officers who were among the first to arrive on the
scene at the facility in the Granada Hills community of Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Even eight days after the rampage, Sgt. Timothy Surrette said he
remains traumatized over what he encountered when he ran into the
building and saw 16-year-old Mindy Finklestein lying wounded on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had a major incident,'' Surrette said. ``I could see
and smell and taste the gunpowder. I'm still not over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrette, who arrived four minutes after the first call came in,
was credited with organizing officers at the scene and bringing in
more help from around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some 200 officers _ as well as agents from the FBI
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms _ would be on the
scene looking for the suspected killer, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Dean Thompson, a member of the force for 11 years, said
his first thought was of his 5-year-old son, Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in on the west side where we were told the suspect was
last seen headed,'' Thompson said. ``When we didn't find anyone, we
went into the building and saw (Mindy) with leg wounds. A paramedic
was right on our tail, and he took care of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in the other rooms, and I saw the 5-year-old (Benjamin
Kadish) bleeding badly. I went out and got another paramedic, who
asked me if the area was clear. I told him, `No. If I go down,
duck.' Then we took care of the little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Bill Bamattre said such actions probably saved
Kadish's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about the golden hour of getting care for someone in
critical condition,'' Bamattre said. ``We were able to get that
little boy to a hospital in 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Thompson and his partner, Officer Misty Goodnight, who has
been on the job four months, returned to the Jewish Community
Center on Monday when it reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helped,'' Thompson said. ``It was like a closure
seeing how strong everyone was. They were scared, but they were
prepared to fight and take steps to take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight said she still was processing the experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if it all has hit me,'' she said. ``But it was
good to see all the kids and families and see how thankful they
were. That helped a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Raquelle de la Rocha said the actions of the
officers were an example of how well the department responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were heroes on the scene, but there were so many other
actions to calm the parents and get information to them,'' De la
Rocha said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, she cited the work of officers in locating the
brother of Kadish, who was on a tour of the Simon Wiesenthal Center
at the time, and bringing him to the hospital so he could be with
his parents.

DODGERS FALL TO MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There have been times this season when Kevin Brown
didn't want to talk to reporters because frustration might cause
him to say something he didn't want to say.
</P>
<P>
   Other times he didn't pitch well, was the recipient of breaks he
thought were unfavorable or, as of late, has pitched a whale of a
game but has been less than flamboyant afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on an overhyped team with outlandish expectations, the
losing hasn't sat well with Brown. The Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-1
loss to Florida at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday was just a sidelight
to the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how desolate this season has become, Brown holds
the belief that this straying ship will find its course in time for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it happen in the past, so there's no reason it can't
happen here,'' Brown said. ``If you don't think you're going to win
... why would I be here?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who signed a $105 million contract as a free agent, isn't
used to the losing. He won the World Series two years ago with the
Marlins and helped rejuvenate the city of San Diego last year by
leading them to the NL pennant.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to do the same for the Dodgers. Instead, his
14-6 mark and 3.14 ERA are easily overlooked on a team that's spent
the better part of two months bouncing between fourth and last
place in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really easy to get used to winning,'' Brown said.
``Obviously, pitching well and getting good results is great. It
would be much better and mean much more if it was in the backdrop
of a team that was winning.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been no easy chore to turn around the Dodgers, but Brown,
when he ponders that issue, says he knew it wasn't going to be
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing worth doing ever is,'' Brown said. ``There's lessons
to be learned from this kind of season. Sometimes the lessons
learned ... sometimes it's very subtle. Sometimes it's something
you don't realize right away. You don't always know.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brown signed the mega-deal, he spoke of reasons why he
wanted to pitch on the other side of the country instead of near
his Georgia home. The jet to cart Brown's family to and fro were
pretty high on Brown's list.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also mentioned the history of the new hierarchy and its
ability to build a minor-league system that could complement a
robust major-league team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have the understanding for how things work, how a
farm system works, in conjunction with having the ability to sign
free agent, to build a team,'' Brown said. ``You can't have a great
team without an understanding of how each part works.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' minor-league system is nearly barren. Some call it
a disaster. And the rebuilding will take years and go deep into
Brown's seven-year contract. But interspersed between now and the
end of the season will be hints or glimpses of how the minor-league
system can aid the Dodgers in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of that was on display Tuesday night against the Marlins
in starting pitcher Mike Judd. He was supposed to make one start
for the Dodgers but impressed manager Davey Johnson enough last
week in Montreal that Johnson wanted to take another look at him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson saw six-plus innings from Judd, who allowed four runs on
eight hits. Maybe the most impressive thing about Judd was his
pitch efficiency
</P>
<P>
   The way it's gone this season, six innings usually translates
into 105 or so pitches and a forced call to the bullpen. Judd threw
89 pitches but fell behind early. He allowed a two-run homer by
Bruce Aven with one out in the first and gave up an RBI single to
Mike Redmond in the fourth as the Dodgers fell behind 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marlins starter A.J. Burnett allowed one run in 52/3
innings in his major-league debut and left with a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins added a run off Judd in the seventh and Jamie Arnold
allowed an RBI double to Preston Wilson in the eighth as Florida
built a 5-1 lead.

PADRES DEFEAT METS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Al Leiter's control was like the picture on an old
television set, fading in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter walked a season-high eight batters, and when he finally
located his rhythm, the New York Mets' usually high-powered offense
could only scratch out five hits. The result was a 3-2 loss on
Tuesday night to the San Diego Padres at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Atlanta Braves remained tied atop the National
League East with identical 73-48 records.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Mets scratched their way back into the game, the
Padres scored an insurance run. After the Mets had pulled within
2-1 in the top of the seventh, the Padres added a run in the bottom
half on Tony Gwynn's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored once more on Rey Ordonez's run-scoring single in
the eighth but they could not score again, not even after Rickey
Henderson opened the ninth with a double off the left-field fence
against the Padres' closer, Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson stayed at second base as Edgardo Alfonzo grounded out,
and John Olerud struck out. That brought Mike Piazza to the plate.
On April 28 in New York, Piazza hit a game-winning home run off
Hoffman. On Tuesday night, Hoffman won the duel, getting Piazza to
ground out to second base for his 31st save.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Leiter's walks came consecutively at the start of the
second inning, enabling the Padres to score a run without the
benefit of a hit.
</P>
<P>
   For three-plus innings, Leiter (10-8) flirted with a no-hitter
of his own, one night after Octavio Dotel had held the Padres
without a hit for six innings in the Mets' 4-3, 10-inning victory.
</P>
<P>
   While the Padres' hitters had trouble with Dotel, they had
little difficulty with Leiter because the Mets' starter could not
find the plate. With two outs in the first, Leiter walked Tony
Gwynn and Phil Nevin. Even though he was able to extricate himself
from the jam, it was a harbinger of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old left-hander lost his control again at the start
of the second inning. Wally Joyner led off with a full-count walk,
and Leiter fell behind Ruben Rivera, 3-0, prompting a visit to the
mound from catcher Mike Piazza. The next pitch? Ball four.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter is an emotional player, and after he walked Rivera, he
went behind the mound and squatted down with the resin bag. Out
came Dave Wallace, the pitching coach, for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was Chris Gomez. Leiter walked him on a
full-count pitch. The bases were loaded, and there was nobody out.
And the Padres still did not have a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Woody Williams, the Padres' pitcher, who had been an
All-Region shortstop at the University of Houston. Pat Mahomes
hurriedly began to warm up in the bullpen as Williams took four
straight balls to force in a run on Leiter's fourth consecutive
walk.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Leiter had already thrown 39 pitches _ 28 of which were
balls.
</P>
<P>
   And then, all of a sudden, his control returned.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter struck out Damian Jackson on three pitches. On a 1-1
pitch to Eric Owens, Owens grounded into a third-to-first double
play. Just like that, the rally was done.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' hitters were having little luck against Williams,
who entered the game with a 5-11 record and a bloated 5.04 earned
run average. Meanwhile, Leiter tossed a perfect third. And then his
defense let him down.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the fourth, the Padres were still searching for their
first hit. Joyner nipped any thoughts of another extended no-hit
bid by leading off with a single. An out later, Gomez grounded a
ball back up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter instinctively went for it, and his glove knocked the ball
off its route. Alfonzo, who had won Monday night's game with his
10th-inning home run, fielded the ball with time to throw Gomez out
at first for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   But Alfonzo, who had gone 78 consecutive games without an error,
hurried ever so slightly and threw the ball away. Joyner scooted to
third as the ball bounced around in foul territory. The Padres had
runners on first and third with one out. And Alfonzo had committed
just his third error of the season, his first since May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Williams, who this time showed what he can do with
his bat. The pitcher ripped a 2-1 pitch over Henderson's head in
left field. After Henderson played the ball off the fence, Williams
had a run-scoring double and the Padres led, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, the inning was over after Jackson popped out
in foul territory and Owens grounded to second. But the run proved
to be much-needed insurance for Williams.

PART OF PROBLEM COULD BE THAT PARK IS POOPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park tried changing his glove because
there was a fear he was tipping off pitches. He's talked to Kevin
Brown during all hours of the night about what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said Park's too cerebral and needs to
relax more, and he was suspended for seven games after going
ballistic on Anaheim's Tim Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long season for Park, the Los Angeles Dodgers'
right-hander with all the promise, and he admits he's mentally
fatigued. Not only from the happenings of the season but also from
pitching for eight straight months.
</P>
<P>
   Park said part of his weariness comes from pitching for his
native Korea in the Asian Games in January. From there, he went to
spring training and then opened the season. And he hasn't had a
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that and maybe I'm tired because of that,'' Park
said Tuesday. ``But I don't feel like it with my body. Not
physically but mentally, because I can't get a win. I don't really
know. I'm just a little tired. I'm not going to give up. I still
run, still exercise, still through my bullpen, still think about
the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed two earned runs in seven innings of the Dodgers'
7-5 loss Monday to Florida. He dropped to 0-6 with a 5.86 ERA in 12
starts this season at Chavez Ravine. He was 19-10 with a 2.74 ERA
at home before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely an enigma for me,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``I like the heck out of him. Great work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's also been the source of the Dodgers' biggest frustration
by following up a 15-9 season by going 6-10 with a 5.77 ERA this
year. He's also given up 26 homers, including four grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be like this forever,'' Park said. ``I going
to show them a lot of wins in the future. I promise.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: X-rays on pitcher Ismael Valdes' back were negative and he
said he will make his Saturday start against Philadelphia. ``Not a
chance I'll miss it, especially since it's my birthday,'' said
Valdes, who will turn 26. Valdes left his last start with tightness
in his lower back.... Utility infielder Tripp Cromer, on the
disabled list since July 6 with an irregular heartbeat, said he
will begin a five-game rehab stint with Single-A San Bernardino on
Aug. 27 and the plan is to activate him when rosters are expanded
Sept. 1.... Injured pitcher Robinson Checo (groin) threw a bullpen
session and is slated to rehab with San Bernardino during the
weekend....
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Antonio Osuna, who has shunned ``Tommy John''
surgery, continues to throw bullpen sessions and if all goes well
hopes to begin a rehab assignment with San Bernardino on Aug. 29
and rejoin the Dodgers after the rosters are expanded. However,
he's ticked off the Dodgers with his refusal to have the surgery.
``He's done real good (in the bullpen), but right when he starts
putting the finishing touches on it, that's where he has trouble,''
Johnson said.... Dodgers Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese's funeral will
be held today in Louisville. Expected to attend are former
teammates Sandy Koufax, Duke Snider, Carl Erskine, Ralph Branca,
Joe Black, Clyde King and Tom Lasorda, plus Rachel Robinson, the
widow of Jackie Robinson, and former Dodgers president Peter
O'Malley.

L.A. QUAKE VETERANS RIDE OUT TURKEY TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Two hours before a massive earthquake hit Turkey,
a Bible study group from the Granada Hills community of Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley arrived in Istanbul, but its members
remained calm through the fierce shaking that brought back memories
of the 1994 Northridge temblor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in our group is fine,'' Bill Creasy, a professor at
the University of California, Los Angeles, who is leading the
44-member group, said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot like the '94 Northridge Earthquake, with a lot of
bumping and thumping for about 45 seconds, but most of us here are
earthquake veterans from Southern California and we weren't shaken
up too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible study group went back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the hotel guests who weren't used to earthquakes were
more shaken up and spent the night at a park across the street,''
said Creasy.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor struck as members of the group were settling into
the Hotel Mercure in downtown Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were without electricity and water for nearly a day, but
the hotel was not seriously damaged and we were able to go with the
flow and continue our itinerary without problems,'' Creasy said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is on a 12-day trip through Turkey and Greece to study
the biblical journeys of St. Paul. The section of Istanbul where
the group was staying was relatively untouched compared with other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Creasy said the group visited the Hagia Sophia and the Blue
Mosque on Tuesday, and were about to go to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   He said many Turks were busy recovering from the quake, and that
even the famous Grand Bazaar in Istanbul was closed.

FOR MATADORS, A LOT DEPENDS ON CORNERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeremy Golden, the team's leading tackler, is out
for the season. Mel Miller, a starting cornerback, is fighting to
stay academically eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge's football season opener is 17 days away,
and who will start in the Matadors' secondary has become a primary
concern. If Miller, a senior who starts opposite Chazz Moore, a Big
Sky Conference Honorable Mention performer last year, can't become
eligible...
</P>
<P>
   ``(Miller) is in summer school,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``He's taking an independent study course. If he
finishes that, he'll be with us. He is the master of his own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been to all the Matadors' practices and he's
scheduled to start in Saturday's team scrimmage. If one asks
Miller, it sounds as if he's already determined his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be eligible,'' he said. ``That's all I have to
say. There's nothing to talk about. I'll be the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster Andersen, CSUN's defensive coordinator, said transfers
Shawn Watson (Saddleback College) and Jermaine Hunsicker
(Washington State) have played well in practice and are potential
future starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both good,'' Andersen said, ``but they both have to
learn our system. Steve Forte is playing safety and he is... a good
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Wounded: Hassan Abdul-Malik, a sophomore listed at No. 1 on the
depth chart at strong safety, didn't practice Tuesday because of a
sore left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik wasn't alone on the sideline. Aaron Arnold, who
became the fourth CSUN receiver to break the 1,000-yard mark
(1,020) last year, dislocated a finger on his left hand Monday and
was held out of some drills.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Brignac, a freshman running back, has a bruised knee and
didn't practice for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard, `This isn't high school anymore Brignac,' '' said
Brignac, about the ribbing he took from the defense the day he got
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcon Majdid, a 300-pound freshman offensive lineman from L.A.
Baptist, has a bad hip and hasn't been cleared to practice.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting game: Barret Woods, a freshman linebacker from Esperanza
High, hasn't been admitted to school yet and didn't practice
Wednesday afternoon. Kearin said Woods' eligibility to play this
season is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Auditioning: With the impending transfer of Anthony Ramos to
Washington State, the Matadors are looking for a kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Jones, a senior transfer from Fresno State, returned
punts and kickoffs Wednesday. Jones (5-foot-11, 180 pounds) had 17
receptions for 265 yards and three touchdowns for the Bulldogs in
1997 before sitting out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Full contact: The players get to wear pads today and Kearin is
going to allow tackling in some team drills.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors' defense didn't wait to throw some guys down,
though. Fullback Jaumal Bradley was hit hard twice Wednesday,
including a hit by linebacker Cos Abercrombie that had the entire
defense yelling and exchanging high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin was upset when Bradley was hit hard again 20 minutes
later. He ended practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting a little spunky out there,'' Kearin said.
``I want us to practice like a big-time college program.''

JUDD'S NO DUD, BUT DODGERS GO THUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: New lead, adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Back in the fall of 1997, the Los Angeles Dodgers
left Eric Karros, Eric Young and Todd Zeile unprotected in the
expansion and decided to protect a young pitcher whom very few
people knew.
</P>
<P>
   That was right-hander Mike Judd, who's biggest claim was being
coveted by the Dodgers and then getting pounded when he finally
made it to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, partially by default and partially by performance, he's
piqued the interest of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago he got his first major-league win in his first start.
Tuesday against the Florida Marlins, he made his second start and
lost for the first time, a 6-1 setback at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Judd (1-1) did enough in his six-plus innings to keep the
respirator going and earn another start. In turn, it will provide
the Dodgers another chance to evaluate the 24-year-old, and maybe
further map out how he will be used in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the arm to be a starter,'' Dodgers pitching coach
Claude Osteen said. ``He needs to polish a few things.''
</P>
<P>
   First on that list is his breaking pitches. When he accelerated
through the Dodgers' minor-league system in 1997, going from
Single-A to the Dodgers in a matter of months, his breaking pitches
lagged in development.
</P>
<P>
   He also doesn't hold runners on well, as the Marlins' four
stolen bases attest. With a catcher who has struggled throwing the
ball throughout the season, the last thing needed was a pitcher who
was methodically slow to the plate. Judd was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I've seen, but he's got to learn to hold runners
on better,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``Young pitchers,
they'll make a few mistakes. It's part of the learning of a young
player.''
</P>
<P>
   But that Judd will last for a third start is also a testament to
his ability.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Dodgers lack other options at the minor-league level
to fill the void left when Carlos Perez was shipped to Triple-A
Albuquerque. But when Judd arrived in Montreal for his first
major-league start last Thursday (his ninth appearance), he was
there to pitch one day and return to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Though he gave up four runs in 61/3 innings, he allowed only one
run through the first six. It earned him the start against Florida.
And the potential in him has brought him another opportunity on the
upcoming road trip. He'll pitch in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good pitcher right now, not afraid to come inside to
the right-handers,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said. ``He has a
great change-up, great splitter. He has to learn to throw them for
strikes. That's part of the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really impressed with him. Once he gets to know all the
hitters in the league better, he's going to be a quality pitcher.
His change-up is the best I've seen out of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding when and how to use his pitches will be Judd's
key. While his change-up is strong, it was his change-up that Bruce
Aven hammered over the left-field fence in the first inning to give
the Marlins a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact Judd has pitched well enough to hang around is
stunning. In his previous two stints with the Dodgers he pitched to
a 12.21 ERA. Before being recalled from Albuquerque, he was an
unimpressive 8-7 with a 6.67 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month and a half, two months, they found him a
slot (over the top) where we thought he can be effective throwing
the ball,'' Osteen said. ``He's up top and driving down on the
ball. Now, he just has to iron a few things out. One thing he
didn't have when I was there (earlier in the season) is he bulked
up a lot. He's stronger. His legs are bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Judd's first loss came at the expense of Florida's A.J.
Burnett, who allowed one run in 52/3 innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big adrenaline rush for me,'' said Burnett, who gave
up a Todd Hollandsworth homer in the sixth. ``I pitched a calm,
good game. It was great to come out here to play and I'm
disappointed that I'm going back (to Double-A). Hopefully, I'll
come back in September.''

DON'T MESS WITH BOMBARDIER BEETLE _ EXPLODING REAR A
POTENT  DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beware the bombardier beetle, whose rear end can explode a nasty
spray powerful enough to put predatory enemies to flight in a
hurry.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of experiments with those ground-dwelling beetles,
famed naturalist Thomas Eisner and his colleagues at Cornell
University have photographed one species of the African carabids,
known scientifically as Stenaptinus insignis, showing that they can
send out their noxious spray in any direction _ from side to side,
from top to bottom, and even behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, a pioneer in the study of chemicals that living
organisms either use for their health or emit for their defense,
has found thousands of such examples of ``chemical ecology.'' As a
result, he is a leading and militant advocate of preserving the
Earth's biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, Eisner and Daniel J. Aneshansley, an
electrical engineer, reveal the technology of the bombardier
beetle's remarkable defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beetles have a problem,'' Eisner and Aneshansley note, because
unlike flies or butterflies it takes them a good deal of valuable
time to unfurl their wings for flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delays are unaffordable in emergencies, and it should come as
no surprise that many beetles have evolved means for buying time
when under attack,'' the scientists write.
</P>
<P>
   Because ground beetles live at soil level, they are in constant
danger of being attacked by ants, and so evolution has given them
just the right weapons for defense: dischargeable glands that can
spray out acids and other noxious chemicals _ often at high
concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   The best marksmen in the defensive game are the bombardiers,
Eisner says. In a series of experiments, he and Aneshansley were
able to photograph the bombardier beetle's spray at the precise
instant of a feigned attack, using forceps manipulated in the hands
of the researchers rather than living ants.
</P>
<P>
   The spray of the bombardiers comes from a mixture of two
chemicals, each carried like storage chambers in two separate
glands, Eisner explained. The larger gland holds irritants called
hydroquinones, plus a supply of hydrogen peroxide, while the
smaller gland contains the enzymes needed to make the defensive
spray explode.
</P>
<P>
   Then when tiny hairs all over the the beetle's body sense an
enemy _ whether it's a scientist's forceps or a hungry ant _ the
beetle emits the two chemicals in an explosive burst of spray with
a loud popping sound. The chemicals combine instantly to become a
powerful irritant, spurting out as hot as boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   For their experiments the two Cornell scientists devised a flash
camera triggered by the noise of the explosive chemicals shooting
out of the beetle's body. They discovered that a bombardier beetle
could fire its defenses 20 times in a row before emptying its
chemical supply.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Eisner said he has been fascinated by
insect defense systems ever since he first handled a bombardier
beetle 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasty chemical sprays are a prime form of defense among many
insects that can't take flight with speed when enemies attack,'' he
said. ``The beetles are incredibly well built for defense, and
that's probably why evolution has enabled them to succeed so well
for millions of years.'' The insect world is filled with creatures
that can put their enemies to flight or even poison them, Eisner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The whip scorpion, for example, sprays a liquid from its tail
that is 84 percent acetic acid and can sting a predator that dares
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that out the hard way,'' Eisner said, ``when I was
looking at one too closely and got a dose in my face.''
</P>
<P>
   But that highly toxic and irritating spray is what has enabled
whip scorpions to thrive in a hostile world, Eisner noted, for they
are one of nature's oldest creatures _ at least 300 million years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Millipedes, beetle larvae and many moths defend themselves with
an even more toxic chemical, Eisner said. When attacked they spray
out a mixture of two chemicals that produces cyanide gas, which can
kill virtually any enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing thing that they don't poison themselves,''
Eisner said. ``That's something we still have to discover.'' &LR;

HUNT FOR LIFE IN OUTER SPACE DRAWS MILLION VOLUNTEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  No one has yet captured a signal from any alien beings in the
cosmos, but more than a million people around the world are now
tuned in for a message on their computers every day.
<P>
   The Berkeley-based global project called SETI &LR; home has already
enlisted that many computer users in 233 countries who have
volunteered the idle downtime of their desktop machines in the
search for extraterrestrial intelligent life, according to the
Berkeley scientists running the quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created the largest supercomputer in the whole world
with all those volunteers,'' said Dan Werthimer, a researcher at
the University of California's Space Sciences Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Werthimer and project director David Anderson began recruiting
computer users for their worldwide effort at ``distributed
computing'' only three months ago, and the response has been
phenomenal, Anderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With a million computer volunteers, the central computers at
Berkeley are now crunching unprecedented numbers in search of
unexpected signals from space.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one day, we're getting a thousand years of computing
time,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   To join the project, computer users can log on to
setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu and download a free screen saver that
serves as an automatic signal processor whenever the computer is
idle.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the free SETI &LR; home software are available for
Windows, Macintosh and virtually every Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a million volunteers, this is also the most sensitive sky
survey ever conducted,'' said Werthimer. ``SETI &LR; home is so powerful
because we're using the world's largest telescope, and we are able
to use it continuously, 24 hours a day, by piggybacking on other
observations.''
</P>
<P>
   The original signals come to the SETI seekers from the powerful
1,000-foot radio telescope at Arecibo in Puerto Rico, and one of
these days _ just maybe _ a strange, anomalous signal may _ just
possibly _ reveal that an intelligent civilization on some distant
unknown planet is sending out a message that says, ``We're here.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the Berkeley computers will automatically know
just which prosaic desktop computer, somewhere on Earth, picked up
the message with its software, and that computer's owner will go
down in history.  &LR;

IT ONLY HEARST WHEN I LAUGH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  I don't know anything.
<P>
   People keep asking what's up with this newspaper merger, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea, but we're all keeping an eye out for the Turk.
</P>
<P>
   The Turk is the generic title for the front-office flunkie on
every NFL team whose job in preseason training camp is to knock on
the door of players who are being cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Turk knocks and says, ``Coach wants to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he delivers the verbal coup de grace: ``And bring your
playbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at The Chronicle, the Turk will probably stand at the stack
of the day's fresh newspapers, under the sign ``Free for
employees,'' and say, ``Uh, that will be 50 cents, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Then: ``And bring your stylebook.''
</P>
<P>
   (Is ``stylebook'' two words? I told you I know nothing.)
</P>
<P>
   But these are nervous times all over. Maybe it's the coffee
finally kicking in.
</P>
<P>
   That pesky FBI investigation of the Housing Authority, for
instance, has many folks on edge. There are rumors in high places
that indictments are on the way. Does the FBI have a Turk?
</P>
<P>
   And then there are rumors that two male staff members at an
important city government agency have charged the agency boss with
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office says, essentially: Nope, not that we know of.
</P>
<P>
   So relax, everyone. We're all going to be fine.
</P>
<P>
   KULTURE NEWZ: He tried to make an artistic and political
statement by being sodomized with a Jack Daniel's bottle, and now
it's coming back to bite him in the butt.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the city's power elite flocked to a birthday
party for political campaign genius Jack Davis. Steven Leyba stole
the show with the old bottle sodomy trick, and that was the tame
part of his performance. It made national headlines and threatened
to undermine the mayor's drive for voter approval of a 49ers'
stadium/mall.
</P>
<P>
   Leyba, an ordained priest in the Church of Satan, was recently
commissioned to paint a ceiling mural in a Lower Haight bar,
Chances. The 50-foot-long mural, ``Flying in the Bay of San
Francisco's Sin,'' featured various birds with bodies depicted as
booze bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The mural was three days old when one of the bar's three owners
reportedly ordered it painted over, and it was, and the Rev is mad.
He heard that the partner nixed the work after learning who painted
it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the owner thought a mural created by a devil-worshipper
would cast a pall over happy hour. Maybe he just said, ``The hell
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   OVERHEARD ... somewhere. They were scrambling at the Ramada
Plaza Civic Center on Market recently. The hotel's owner,
84-year-old Dr. Ho of Macao, was on his way to town with his young
wife and their infant child.
</P>
<P>
   The wife, it is said, preferred to stay at a ritzier hotel _ not
that the Ramada is in any way shabby _ but every hotel in town was
booked. So Ramada management spent a week frantically converting
seven rooms into a lavish suite fit for royalty.
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER hotel news, the Fairmont's major overhaul could benefit
you if you're a Dorothy Draper fan, and who isn't?
</P>
<P>
   Draper was, of course, the famed designer and innovator who
redecorated the Fairmont in '45. Her lavish creation worked well
for half a century, but a new century looms, so Draper's lobby
furniture is outta there, trucked to Los Angeles to be auctioned
Sept. 15. at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what artistic mind is in charge of the Fairmont
re-do, but it's probably not the Rev. Leyba.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE HAVE all the Doggie Diner heads gone, long time passing?
</P>
<P>
   Alert motorist Dan Guerra spotted not one but  &UR; two  &LR; Doggie Diner
heads! He saw the revered San Francisco commercial relics in Sonoma
County, near Jack London State Park. There's a house on a large
piece of property, and on the house are mounted two of the
cartoonish pooch heads.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the dog head mounted on a pole at The Burger
Stand Formerly Known as Doggie Diner on Sloat Blvd., around which
is swirling a storm of preservation-vs.-progress controversy, is
not the world's last existing Doggie head.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of this discovery boggle the mind, especially
if the mind has a very low threshold of boggle.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WOULD BE an only-in-San Francisco item, except that it's in
Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   They pack 'em in two nights a week at the Daybreak, a lesbian
bar, for ``Karaoke with Abe.'' The emcee is a man dressed in full
Lincoln regalia, including stovepipe hat.
</P>
<P>
   One night last week, reports Daryl Glen, there wasn't a dry eye
or undamaged ear in the place when a transvestite in full drag
belted out ``Don't Cry for Me, Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   OVERHEARD at a lost-luggage desk at SFO: ``If you can fly 2,000
miles in the dark and find San Francisco, you can find my bags.''

 BUSH CAMP DENIES EX-CALIFORNIA GOV. WILSON IS ON BOARD JUST YET  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ As Texas Governor George W. Bush prepares a trip to
California for the express purpose of appealing to Latinos, his
state organization has distanced itself from reports that former
Governor Pete Wilson will definitely play a formal role in the
campaign.
<P>
   Gerald Parsky, chairman of the California campaign for GOP
front-runner Bush, has denied published reports suggesting that
Wilson's role is a ``done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly no decision that has been made about any sort
of role at all. ... We have a campaign structure that is in place.
We're building it with a lot of different people,'' Parsky told The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly welcome the support of a lot of people,
including Pete Wilson, if he proposed to support (Bush),'' Parsky
said. ``But any reference to a `done deal' is not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to appear September 2 at the Latin Business
Association's 1999 Business Expo in Los Angeles, which is expected
to draw 3,000 Latino entrepreneurs, the organization confirmed
Tuesday. One association staffer said demand for tickets has been
``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans a heavy California presence in the coming weeks, with
additional trips tentatively planned for September and October,
according to campaign sources.
</P>
<P>
   His outreach to Latino voters here comes at a time when Bush has
been the focus of sharp criticism. The Texas governor riled Latino
leaders recently by declining to address the National Council of La
Raza, a Latino advocacy group, and passed on an invitation to speak
to minority journalists at the Unity journalism conference in
Seattle in July despite being there at the same time for a
fund-raising visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Perez, a board member on the Latin Business
Association, called Bush's appearance next month a ``very
positive'' move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome him because we want to get to know him,'' said
Perez, principal partner in the Pasadena-based public relations
agency Valencia Perez &AMP; Echeveste. ``He's going right to the
business sector. ... He's going to his strength.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush appearing to try to make amends, California political
insiders suggest that the key question now regarding any successful
Latino outreach is the role of Wilson _ the leading proponent of
Proposition 187, the controversial anti-illegal immigration
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Walsh, Wilson's longtime spokesman, declined to comment
this week on a role for Wilson in the Bush campaign. But Democrats
have promised that should Wilson surface in Bush's campaign,
they'll use it to their own advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big mistake by Bush. We'll wrap that around his neck in the
Latino community,'' Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the state
Democratic Party, told the Associated Press. Some Republicans
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a disaster,'' said one leading GOP strategist, who
complained that Wilson's ties to Proposition 187 have alienated
Latino voters from the Republican Party. ``I don't know what
they're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But others suggest that the twice-elected former governor could
be tapped not only to endorse Bush, but to raise funds, use his
organizing prowess and draw attention to issues crucial to the
GOP's fortunes in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, now a fellow at the Hoover Institution, also heads the
Bear Flag Forum, a nonprofit foundation whose goals include
promoting job growth, educational issues and debating illegal
immigration and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks forget ... that at the time 187 passed, without my
support, Republican registration was 40 percent ... and it got 59
percent of the vote,'' notes state Assemblyman Rod Pacheco, a
Republican from Riverside. ``Folks across the board supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Wilson winds up playing a high-profile role,
Democrats have made it an issue already because they know Wilson
``is a popular governor,'' said Walsh. ``He left office tied in
popularity with Ronald Reagan. ... He still has a very strong
rating, both from a personal perspective as well as on his
(issues).''

 ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY 440 - August 18, 1999 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. PIERCE BROSNAN'S LATEST 'AFFAIR' Now that Pierce Brosnan has
revitalized the James Bond film series as the most money-making
Bond ever, he says he feels at the top of his game. His latest film
is ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' a remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen
crime thriller. Brosnan explains how he made sure his suave, heroic
art thief hero was neither an imitation of McQueen or Agent 007.
What is really provocative about the screen romance in this film is
that it takes place between an actor who is 46 and an actress (Rene
Russo) who is 45, and not a 60-year-old male star with an actress
barely in her 20s. Brosnan thought it was high time to show a movie
romance with a little more age parity. ``I wanted a woman for the
role,'' he says, ``I didn't want a girl. I wanted someone who could
be my equal.'' By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
CITIZEN HURT With more than 20 major films to his credit, Academy
Award-winning actor William Hurt has long been viewed as a thinking
person's movie star with a track record of intellectually
challenging films. Hurt, 49, has demonstrated a winning combination
of substance and sex appeal. His latest film, ``The Big Brass
Ring,'' based on a screenplay co-written by Orson Welles is a
political drama about a man's quest to become governor of Missouri
in the year 2000. Co-starring with Hurt are Nigel Hawthorne,
Miranda Richardson and Irene Jacob. ``One thing the film does, is
it assumes that people are human, that they have weaknesses and
that they're doing their best,'' says Hurt. By Tamara Conniff. BPI.
1,000 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
SENSE OF A WOMAN The perks of being a rising star for Olivia
Williams are the premieres, the pampering, the opportunities to
work with such megastars as Kevin Costner and Bruce Willis. But she
has just discovered a new advantage : free photocopying at her
agent's office. In the two years since Kevin Costner plucked her
from relative obscurity to appear in his ill-fated movie, ``The
Postman,'' her film career has taken off. Williams, 30, is still
exuberant about her rapid rise, especially because she almost gave
up on acting. Now she's being noticed for her beauty, her talent -
and her nude scenes. She doesn't see it as a big deal. ``There's a
</P>
<P>
   confusion in a lot of people's minds between nudity and sex,''
she says, adding that she won't do any scenes that involve sex and
violence. By James Fallon. From Women's Wear Daily. 800 words +
photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
HALLE BERRY'S ROAD TO 'DOROTHY DANDRIDGE' They are from different
generations - indeed, from different worlds - but Halle Berry says
she has no difficulty identifying with the trials and tribulations
of the late star Dorothy Dandridge. Both actresses have the face of
angels and both embody a smoldering sexiness that captivated
Hollywood in their respective eras. (Dandridge made film history in
1954 when her performance in ``Carmen Jones'' led her to become the
first black ever nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress.) Halle
Berry talks about her performance in ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge.'' By Ivor Davis. 1,300 words + photos. (N/A Great
Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
JAMES CAAN : MIRRORED TO THE MOB Once upon a time he was Sonny
Corleone in ``The Godfather'' (1972,) and one of Hollywood's most
respected actors. But then James Caan lost his way, letting a drug
problem drag him down and virtually end his career. After being
absent from the screen for most of the 1980s, Caan has made a
comeback and earned new respect. Now he co-stars with Hugh Grant in
the mob comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' Caan talks about the film, his
odd-couple pairing with the dapper, self-deprecating Grant, why he
doesn't mind if he is sometimes typecast as a mobster after ``The
Godfather,'' and how cocaine almost ruined his life before his son,
actor Scott Caan, saved him. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________6.
MICHELLE WILLIAMS IN 'DICK' ``Dick,'' one of the funniest comedies
of the summer, is set in the 1970s and deals in madcap, surreal
fashion with the Nixon White House. Though slapstick, it is also a
sophisticated satire of a bygone era. Columbia Pictures is aiming
this film squarely at the teenage market - at kids who weren't
alive during any part of the '70s. They are counting on the appeal
of the film's two teenage stars, Kirsten Dunst and Michelle
Williams, who accidentally stumble into the inner workings of the
Nixon White House. (They walk Nixon's dog, accidentally feed pot
brownies to major political figures and manage to bring down the
president and his crooked staff.) By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,100
words + photo.

operations, he took a settlement of $40,000. As it turned out,
though, while the woman was issued another ticket for unsafe
backing, nobody arrested her. Why not? By DAN LYNCH.

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An outfit called Jupiter Communications, which
is holding a forum in New York this week for the on-line
advertising industry, reports that 64 percent of on-line consumers
don't trust sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intense media coverage of the on-line privacy issue is
fueling consumers' fears,'' said Michele Slack, an analyst for
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, but there's more to it than that. And let me add my
5,595 cents' worth to the intense media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, my Visa bill had a strange $55.95 charge from
something identified by a string of seemingly meaningless lowercase
letters ending in ``.com.''
</P>
<P>
   I almost downloaded lunch, so strong was the sinking feeling.
I'd never used a credit card for an on-line purchase in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in Internet-land was pretending to be me.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is perhaps worse than the one that comes with having
your credit card physically stolen. When somebody steals your
plastic, you cancel it. When somebody has your card number out in
cyberspace, you don't know what else they have on you.
</P>
<P>
   It's the technophobe's ultimate technological phobia. Someone
might be out there accessing your cards to their limits. Someone
could be hacking a hole in your bank accounts and retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   You could have a stalker out there, far beyond the reach of
restraining orders, Mace or small arms fire.
</P>
<P>
   There are things you can do, though. First, I called up the
string of seemingly meaningless letters ending in ``.com'' (well,
actually, I had my non-technophobic wife do it). The charge was
from an Internet billing company with a completely unhelpful Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder people don't trust Web sites. This one just had a
company name and logo, and no telephone number for all the
complaints the company probably gets.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me who wants to send a complaint by e-mail. You can't get
an immediate response or use a stern voice. What do you do, end
with a frowny face?
</P>
<P>
   I never thought I'd utter these words in my life, but thank God
for the Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   I looked up a number for credit card inquiries at Bank of
America (you won't find it on the back of your Visa bill) and got a
pleasant woman who immediately gave me the Internet billing
company's 800 number. The woman told me to send a letter to the
bank if I didn't get satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bad news. When I asked the guy at the Internet billing
company what the $55.95 bill was for, I learned that I was being
billed for porn somebody else was ogling.
</P>
<P>
   I was too weirded-out at the moment to write down the name of
the porn site, but it sounded like he said the bill was from some
Web site with ``sexhaven'' in the name, dot something or other.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I cared more about making sure I got my $55.95 refund,
and the man at the billing company said he'd process it
immediately, as well as block my credit card number from further
use.
</P>
<P>
   I thanked him, but since I'd only heard the Webby-sounding name
of his company for the first time five minutes before, I wasn't
exactly confident.
</P>
<P>
   If on-line commerce is going to flourish, they're going to have
to change some of the names of those companies. When I get a bill
from an outfit called Williams-Sonoma or L.L. Bean I may feel
poorer, but I feel like I'm doing business with real people _ say,
Chuck Williams and the descendants of Leon L. Bean.
</P>
<P>
   When I get a bill from a seemingly meaningless string of
lowercase letters ending in .com, I start feeling e-paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one thing left to do: Check out the porn I'd
supposedly been consuming as an on-line consumer.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked up the porn site, I found out there are five
variations of ``sexhaven'' available on the Internet, with post
office boxes or street addresses in Brooklyn, Ohio; North Easton,
Mass.; Highland Beach, Fla.; Beaverton, Ore.; and Chester, England.
</P>
<P>
   What these places seem to have in common is that they all have
garages large enough to hold desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   If there are five on-line outfits with ``sexhaven'' in their
names, imagine how many other Web sites there are with variations
on the word ``sex.'' E-commerce is badly named. It should be called
X-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   I left it all to the imagination and didn't call up any of the
sex havens. The last thing I wanted was to become further ensnared
in the Web sites that were costing me money with no sight of skin
in return, and making me distrust my cute little iMac.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not sure I want my cute little iMac looking at stuff
like that. I'm canceling its credit card.

TOO FEW BLACKS IN THE BLUE UNIFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jeff Tolbert was on the job, scouting for
illegally parked cars downtown. He saw this car in what appeared to
be a handicapped space. So, Tolbert did what the City of Albany
pays him for. He wrote a parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months later, Tolbert has a smashed up knee and a
profoundly suspicious attitude toward his bosses. His bosses, in
turn, seem to have decided that this guy is a malcontent.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert is 26. He's black, which becomes relevant to this story.
On Jan. 29, 1998, he was writing the parking ticket when the car's
owner, a white woman, came out a nearby doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert told me, ``She crumpled it up in front of my face. She
didn't throw it at me, but she crumpled it up. She said a lot of
stuff to me. OK, so I was walking away, and right when I got behind
the car _ 'cause I was walking down the hill toward Lodge Street _
she hit me with her car twice and said, `Take that, (very bad word
here). Go bother some black people.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And she backed her car right into you?'' I demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice,'' Tolbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman drove away and parked in front of City Hall, a half
block away. Tolbert called for help. Some cops showed up. The woman
was severely agitated. She and one of the senior cops on the scene
got into a serious shouting match. Tolbert was sent off to Albany
Medical Center to have his knee checked out. He asked that the
woman be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert ended up suing this woman. After several knee
operations, he took a settlement of $40,000. As it turned out,
though, while the woman was issued another ticket for unsafe
backing, nobody arrested her. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, that's not at all clear to me, despite lengthy
conversations with police brass on this issue. Tolbert's bosses in
the Albany Police Department told me that they just didn't believe
his story. Well, why doubt him? Had he been a bad employee? No, not
at that time, the cops say. They've had some problems with him
since, though. They refused to be specific about that, even after I
had Tolbert give them a waiver so they could talk to me about his
employment record and even after I nagged them repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tolbert conceded that he has been late for work a
few times, but he has the impression that he's being singled out
for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The woman involved in this incident could have political
connections. Hey, this is Albany, after all. If so, though, I
couldn't run them down. But here you have a parking officer with a
knee seriously injured by a car during the course of his official
duties. You have a woman clearly furious at him _ and with some
reason, it turns out, since she hadn't really been parked in a
handicapped space.
</P>
<P>
   And you have the parking officer saying that she'd purposely run
into him.
</P>
<P>
   That seems precisely the sort of case where cops press charges
and let a judge sort it out. The Albany cops just wouldn't do that,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Some months later, another parking officer was punched by an
angry citizen. The citizen was promptly busted. In that incident,
the officer was white and the assailant was black _ precisely the
reverse of Tolbert's situation. He draws conclusions from that.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where one in four citizens and two in three arrestees
are minorities, the Police Department's membership remains 95
percent white. Believe me, I'm not a quota kind of guy. But here's
the bitter truth, whether anybody likes it or not:
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert could have felt just a bit better about this whole
business. All it would have taken would have been for at least one
of the cops involved in deciding not to arrest this woman to have
been a member of his race.
</P>
<P>
   And not hers.
</P>

CABLE OFFERS A RESPITE FROM NETWORK RERUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thank God for cable in the summer, when the
networks ignore viewers almost entirely and finding something other
than a rerun _ or please, not another ``Dateline'' _ is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   All through the summer, cable and, to be fair, PBS, have been
giving viewers something new. Often these shows are small, ignored,
ultimately inconsequential. But the point is this: At least they're
new. And those shows, whether ``Random Play'' on VH1 or ``GvsE'' on
USA, often turn out to be fun. A major network probably wouldn't
air them, they may never topple ``ER,'' but they are welcome
options.
</P>
<P>
   Cable is precisely the reason some of these shows turn out to be
gems. Cable is more aggressively original and daring than the
networks. Thank God, then, that Comedy Central thought enough of a
quirky little show called ``Frank Leaves for the Orient'' (Thursday
nights) to give us all a glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a distant cousin feel to the kinds of oddball flashbacks
that initially distinguished ``Ally McBeal,'' no network would air
what Comedy Central is calling ``television's first
stream-of-consciousness'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by a two-man creative partnership called LaFong _
multimedia writer-designer Michael Kaplan and Berkeley-based video
artist John Sanborn _ ``Frank Leaves for the Orient'' is like
nothing you've seen on TV before (unless there was something on
cable).
</P>
<P>
   Frank (Stan Cahill) is bored with his job. He's bored with his
life, basically. After coasting most of that life and not really
living it, Frank decides to go to Japan. On Friday. The series _
eight episodes _ is built around Frank trying to cross items off
the necessary lists, thus allowing him a clean break and the
do-over he so eagerly wants in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The hook of this show is that Kaplan and Sanborn have created a
visual stew that incorporates everything from flashbacks, cartoons,
re-enactments, special effects and text. ``Frank Leaves for the
Orient'' tells a story in fits and starts but never manages to lose
you because the graphic elements are half the fun.
</P>
<P>
   For Frank to go to Japan, he first needs to split with his
girlfriend, Gwen (Rebecca Chambers). His friends, Laura (Peggy Jo
Jacobs) and Ed (Chris Tallman), also must be dealt with. That's
episode one. He has to quit his job in episode two, but his boss
freaks out. In episode three, Ed can't deal with being left behind.
Then there's the lure of the sexy ex (episode four), telling the
folks (episode five), selling his stuff (episode six), dealing
still with his current girlfriend (episode seven) and training his
replacement (episode eight).
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, it may be hard to sympathize with Frank. But he
grows much more likeable as a loser in each episode. The theme song
to the show says ``he's a lot like you'' and if you've ever been a
slacker who has let life happen to you, then this is your life.
</P>
<P>
   Although the writing on ``Frank'' is funny and the sight gags
(including a chorus of cave men) are amusing, it's the visual work
of Kaplan and Sanborn that keeps the viewer hooked, that makes the
show seem indescribable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank'' veers wildly from style to style, with Kaplan and
Sanborn displaying a kind of confident swagger that says they can
pull it off. This isn't easy on a show in which five seconds don't
go by without some kind of inner-thought of Frank being spun into a
visual pun.
</P>
<P>
   His co-workers sing ``We're your fake family'' to him. When Gwen
says she would like to go to Japan with him, a chorus screams ``Run
away! Run far!'' When Ed realizes that he's basically Frank-lite,
the two morph into one. Frank's boss has the air _ literally _
taken out of him when Frank says he's quitting. Ed momentarily gets
his own theme song, just like Frank, but the lyrics suggest that
he's a loser who likes beer and ``SportsCenter'' and will be
perpetually alone, never going anywhere close to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas these diversions may seem, in the first episode, to
replace a plot or be a crutch that props up a flagging joke, pretty
soon you realize that the montages are the show, and you adapt to a
new way of watching a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan and Sanborn are the creative duo behind ``Dysson,'' an
e-mail hoax, ``Paul Is Dead,'' an interactive rock mystery, and
``Psychic Detective,'' an interactive movie/game.
</P>
<P>
   Sanborn's video art has been exhibited in museums throughout the
world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Centre
Pompidou in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And now, of course, on cable. ``Frank Leaves for the Orient'' is
a small, eccentric, original piece of work that arrives just before
the fall-season onslaught from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Seek it out and give thanks to cable for saving us from rerun
boredom.

MICROSOFT AND MEDIA COMPANIES TO BACK WEB SERVICE FOR BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of big media and technology companies has agreed to back
BET Holdings, which operates several black-oriented cable
television stations, in establishing an elaborate Internet service
aimed at African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   BET has raised $35 million for the project from Microsoft Corp.,
USA Networks, News Corp., and AT&AMP;T's Liberty Media unit, which is a
minority owner of BET. The service, which is known as BET.Com, is
scheduled to be introduced on Nov. 1 and will replace the company's
existing joint venture with Microsoft, MSBET.
</P>
<P>
   While the earlier site mainly focused on links to programming on
BET's Black Entertainment Television network, the new site will
have a broader range of offerings including news, electronic mail,
shopping and, most important, chat rooms and other features to
build a community within the site.
</P>
<P>
   So far, African-Americans have been less active on the Internet
than the population overall. Forrester Research estimates that 23
percent of the 12 million black households are online, compared to
34 percent of white households. But online usage by blacks is
increasing faster, Forrester notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, African-Americans have found the Internet hard to
use, expensive and at the end of the day they said ``there's
nothing here for me,'' said Robert L. Johnson, the chairman and
majority owner of BET. ``We're going to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the audience is poised to increase now that the
price of computers and Internet access has fallen sharply and in
some cases can be had for free.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to make money by selling advertising and by
selling merchandise including urban apparel, black oriented music
and collectable items.
</P>
<P>
   The BET venture will compete with several existing sites aimed
at African-Americans, all of which are backed by major media
companies. The largest is BlackVoices.Com, an offering of Tribune
Co., which claims to serve 500,000 users a month who look at a
total of 14 million pages. A close second is NetNoir.com, 20
percent owned by America Online. Cox Communications also operates
BlackFamilies.Com.
</P>
<P>
   E. David Ellington, the chairman of Net Noir, said he isn't
worried about the BET venture, despite the company's well known
name and the promotional power of its television network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new medium and it needs new brands,'' he said.
``Name a big media company that has done well on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellington said Net Noir is raising $10 million to $15 million
from venture capital funds and is about to add new features to its
site.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Cooper, the president of Black Voices, said that Tribune
is considering selling a portion of Black Voices in order to raise
money to compete with BET.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes $35 million to stay at the top, we'll raise $35
million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said Black Voices had found limited success trying to
sell advertising and merchandise online.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans are new to the Internet, and to expect them
to give their credit cards online is a bit of a stretch,'' he said.
The company has found a profitable niche selling job listings from
large companies that want to attract a diverse work force. This
need works well with the largest group of African-Americans online:
Office workers who surf at their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, said that BET expects that its consumers will
ultimately shop online and that the service can help enable a new
group of black entrepreneurs who will find ways to sell their
products online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous wealth being created in the Internet
economy that African-Americans should be a part of,'' he said.
``The Internet can give us the opportunity to control our own
destiny by cutting out the middle man.''

   Pokemon Snap, Nintendo for Nintendo 64, $54.99, all ages
</P>
<P>
   Like we didn't see this coming. After a supersuccessful run on
Nintendo's GameBoy system, the kiddie cartoon invades the Nintendo
64 _ with some pretty darn cool results.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda echoing ``Out of Africa'' and Duran Duran's ``Hungry Like
the Wolf'' video, players go on a guided safari through seven
Pokemon island environments.
</P>
<P>
   The object: Photograph the animals that roam and run around the
island. You're doing this, apparently, to impress Professor Oak,
who will later critique your photos. The better the shot, the
higher your points.
</P>
<P>
   It gets a little tricky: Some animals refuse to be shot and
high-tail it away as if they've been messing around with Harrison
Ford and you're the paparazzi. In these cases, you must get them to
pose or perform special tasks to calm 'em down.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are much like the Mario 64 games: bright, colorful,
harmless and fun. Scoring the Pokemon name was a huge coup for
Nintendo, and the company could have spat out a lame action game
and still made a bundle. Fortunately, this is a different kind of
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we're just gonna do a whole column on Pokemon, so I won't
have to deal with it ever, ever again.
</P>
<P>
   The official site is Pokemon.com. It features cartoons, games,
comics, trading cards and instructions on how to do the Pokemon
rap. Don't laugh; it's kinda neat.
</P>
<P>
   The site also houses coveted info on the Pokemon League Summer
Training Tour, a Pokemon GameBoy competition. Check out the site
for more details.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? Plenty. Aside from the two GameBoy Pokemon titles
(Red and Blue versions, both $30) and the accompanying strategy
guide ($13), we've got the new Pokemon Pinball title for GameBoy
Color ($35), multicolored Pokemon Talking Watches (Trendmaster,
$25) and four new $15 Pokemon cartoon vids from Pioneer. All this
stuff is available at any area Babbage's, or through
www.thegamestop.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you have absolutely no idea what Pokemon is all
about, you can take a crash course in it at
http://destroyerx.cjb.net/. Here, you'll find relatively
easy-to-understand breakdowns and explanations of the cartoon and
games. Let us know when you figure the stuff out. We're still
scratching our heads.

   Linus Torvalds strides to the podium, his benign gaze untroubled
by dozens of flashing camera strobes. He's late to the press
conference. He had to take his kids to see the penguins, symbols of
the software that made Torvalds famous.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds is the Godfather of Code, the man from Finland who led
the way in developing Linux, the operating system that bears his
name. With the Linux penguin logo popping up all over the Internet,
and major computer firms investing millions in Linux, Torvalds is
everybody's favorite software wizard.
</P>

   Meanwhile, on the LinuxWorld show floor, Jordan Hubbard sits at
a booth populated by CD-ROM disks, books and stuffed toys shaped
like happy devils, but not too many reporters. There are a fair
number of visitors to the show who recognize the cheerful demon
logo and what it stands for. Hubbard's company, FreeBSD Inc., has a
strong reputation among people in the know. Still, most of the
glory and glamor of LinuxWorld pass him by.
</P>
<P>
   Without bitterness, Hubbard concedes the obvious. ``We lost the
PR war.''
</P>
<P>
   You might call FreeBSD the other Linux. Like Linux, FreeBSD is
an operating system modeled after Unix, the powerful, sophisticated
system developed by AT&AMP;T Corp. in the 1970s. As the name implies,
FreeBSD can be gotten for free, by download over the Internet, just
like Linux. And as with Linux, the ``source code,'' the actual
instructions written by programmers, is available, so people can
modify the software as they see fit. Major Internet services like
Yahoo run their network on FreeBSD. So does the FAST search engine
in Waltham, the world's biggest with 200 million Web pages indexed.
</P>
<P>
   BSD stands for Berkeley System Distribution, a version of Unix
developed at the University of California at Berkeley, and based on
Unix. In 1991, some of the Berkeley developers decided to sell a
version of their product that would run on desktop computers. They
started a firm called BSDI and acquired a toll-free phone number _
1-800-ITS-UNIX. ``That really set AT&AMP;T's shorts on fire,'' says
Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T sued; development of BSD languished. In the midst of it
all, Hubbard and some others began work on a version of BSD that
would be given away, source code and all, to anybody who wanted it.
FreeBSD first appeared in late 1993, about the same time Linux was
getting off the ground. But there was no hint of legal trouble in
the Linux camp, while programmers around the world hesitated to
embrace an open-software project that might be sued out of
existence. Even after the case was settled in 1994, FreeBSD
couldn't regain the lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   There was another, subtler problem that grew out of the
worldview of the BSDers. They were hypersmart technology titans
based at one of the world's great universities. They knew they
could write code better than some ragtag band of volunteers
scattered about the planet. And so the FreeBSD people froze out
most contributions from interested outsiders. ``We were the
snobs,'' Hubbard says. ``We were the ones that didn't let just
anyone come in and hack to their hearts' content.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard insists that the result is cleaner, tighter code. He may
even be right, as if it matters. Eric Raymond, a patron saint of
the open software movement, says that the Linux development model
created a worldwide legion of users and fans. It may be a sloppy
way to build an operating system, but it guaranteed a ready market
for the finished product. By isolating itself from this community
of coders, FreeBSD gravely damaged itself. ``The BSD people had a
lot of advantages,'' Raymond said, but ``they got one thing wrong
that completely overcame all their advantages. They got their
sociology wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Future historians may forget that Torvalds wrote part of Linux.
Instead, they'll recall that he coordinated the work of an
international community of part-time programmers, transforming
their efforts into a product that, for all its residual crudity, is
a marvel of power and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hubbard says times are good for FreeBSD. The success
of Linux is attracting a steady flow of new users. Hubbard says
FreeBSD is content to be a follower, while Linux breaks the trail
for free software. ``We're letting them walk through eight feet of
snow first,'' Hubbard says. Penguins, it seems, are better at that
sort of thing than demons.

FIGHT OVER ACCESS TO INTERNET CABLE SERVICE TAKES ON ENORMOUS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unimaginable as it might have seemed a year ago,
President Clinton's top private lawyer and the former senior aide
to Kenneth Starr in the impeachment battle recently joined to argue
on the same side of one of the biggest legal fights in years.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, David Kendall and Brett Kavanaugh, are but one
example of the unusual alliances being forged in the dispute over
which companies will end up dominating high-speed Internet service
delivered through cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, representing America Online, and Kavanaugh, whose firm
represents GTE, are among a legion of advisers who are quickly
finding business in the dispute, which has turned into the latest
full employment act for lawyers and lobbyists here and in many
cities around the nation. (When Kendall and Kavanaugh found
themselves in a room together, meeting with the Federal
Communications Commission's general counsel on the issue, ``their
eyes were like saucers,'' recalled William Barr, the general
counsel at GTE and former U.S. attorney general, who also was at
the meeting.)
</P>
<P>
   Their common adversary in the fight is AT&AMP;T, which is rapidly
acquiring cable systems and offers high-speed Internet access over
those lines exclusively through a company, Excite(at)Home, in which
it owns a major stake. Led by America Online and GTE, a coalition
of Internet service providers and other telephone companies have
mounted a nationwide campaign to force AT&AMP;T to let cable customers
use Internet providers other than Excite(at)Home without additional
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T opponents have several business interests with billions
of dollars in future revenues at stake. GTE is developing a rival
high-speed Internet service, and many smaller providers believe
that if AT&AMP;T's system proves popular, they will be doomed if they
are shut out. Some of the other telephone companies in the fray are
either competitors of AT&AMP;T or are using the issue to press for
greater deregulation and the ability to compete with the company's
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T contends it would have little incentive to upgrade its
cable systems to provide high-speed Internet service if it must
serve as a carrier for all providers, and that in any case,
comparable telephone- and satellite-based services will insure
competition.
</P>
<P>
   While a precise figure on spending on the lawyers and lobbyists
and for campaign contributions is not available, executives and
lawyers involved in the case estimate that it is already in the
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a field where exaggeration is common, it is fair to say
that this issue is regarded as the most important public policy
question in telecommunications for the decade,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of Media Access Project, which promotes
consumer rights and diversity on the airwaves and has taken sides
against AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term,'' Schwartzman said, ``there's billions of
dollars in revenue at stake. Over the longer term, the outcome of
this fight will play a large role in determining who will be the
dominant telecommunications and Internet players for the next
decade. As a consequence, the bedfellows are stranger than
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, for example, have joined the anti-AT&AMP;T side but
acknowledge they are in an awkward position, allied with telephone
companies that they have sharply criticized in the past. The
consumer advocates have also criticized William Kennard, the
chairman of the FCC, after lobbying fiercely to get him appointed
two years ago. Kennard has in essence sided with AT&AMP;T by
formulating a policy that only the federal government, and not
local authorities, has jurisdiction, but ruling out intervention
for now.
</P>
<P>
   There have been high-stakes struggles over telecommunications
policy in the past, but perhaps never one fought on so many fronts,
including a number of localities where approval is needed _ and
conditions on the Internet issue can be attached _ if AT&AMP;T is to
assume the franchises of the cable companies it is acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   One reason cable has become a focus of the Internet battle is
that it is expected to be a dominant source of high-speed service,
at least in the near term. Today fewer than 1 million homes have
such connections, offering speeds 10 to 80 times those of
conventional phone lines. But by 2002 the number of high-speed
customers is expected to reach 10 million to 16 million, industry
analysts say, with 60 percent to 85 percent using cable
connections.
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute is also notable because it involves a
convergence of technology that has far outpaced laws, court
opinions and regulatory decisions, all of which treat cable and
telephones differently and for better or worse, have said little
explicitly about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one front where AT&AMP;T's opponents have scored their biggest
gains, the issue is heading to a federal appeals court. It will
hear oral arguments in October over a decision by local authorities
in Portland, Ore., to require AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines there to
any Internet company on the same terms as Excite(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also is moving to a new group of cities that are
considering whether to permit AT&AMP;T to acquire the cable franchises
controlled by Media One. Among other places, new skirmishing is
expected in the suburbs of Boston and in other parts of
Massachusetts, where a drive to get the issue on a statewide ballot
in 2000 began this week, as well as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Richmond
and major parts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and cities around the nation, both sides have
retained battalions of advocates. This week, for instance, the
anti-AT&AMP;T forces announced that in addition to Kendall, they had
retained Lloyd Cutler, the former White House counsel, and Bruce
Ennis, a leading Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T and the cable industry have retained many of
Washington's lobbyists, including Vin Weber, the former Republican
representative from Minnesota, and the lobbying firm founded by the
late Dan Dutko, a major Democratic fund-raiser who died in an
accident two weeks ago. More than 50 lobbyists for AT&AMP;T and the
cable companies showed up at an organizational meeting last
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have told me that they owe me thank-you
notes,'' said Gregory Simon, a former top aide to Gore, who is
collaborating with Richard Bond, a former chairman of the
Republican National Committee, in directing the anti-AT&AMP;T
coalition. ``They were retained just so I couldn't hire them. In
Washington it took weeks to find somebody who was not lobbying for
AT&AMP;T I could not find three firms that had not been retained on
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the regional Bell telephone companies have managed
to retain some well-known Washington figures for the fight,
including Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican
National Committee; Mike McCurry, the former White House press
secretary, and Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman
from Staten Island, N.Y. They maintain that Congress and federal
regulators should eliminate restrictions on their clients to make
it easier to offer high-speed Internet services to compete against
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The experience in Florida alone is illustrative of the magnitude
and fervor of the struggle. According to local records, AT&AMP;T and
the cable companies have retained more than 40 lobbyists in the
state. GTE responded by persuading officials in Broward County to
adopt an ordinance requiring AT&AMP;T to open its cable system to other
Internet service providers _ and by agreeing to pay the county's
legal costs if AT&AMP;T sued over the issue. AT&AMP;T lawyers say they are
preparing to challenge GTE's legal assistance to the county.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been Potemkin-like attempts at local organizing,
a process known by some consumer advocates as Astroturf campaigns,
in contrast to grass roots. Contrived rallies were staged in front
of San Francisco's City Hall, for instance, and both sides have
made extensive use of telephone banks to gin up support by asking
loaded questions and making alarmist predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and lobbyists from all sides are pouring campaign
contributions into the coffers of the major presidential
contenders, though none of the candidates have stated a clear
preference. (The issues have transcended party politics, although
some of the major players have been identified with particular
candidates. For instance, James Cicconi, general counsel of AT&AMP;T
and a former aide to President George Bush, was recently a
co-chairman of a fund-raiser in Washington for George W. Bush.
George Vradenberg, the general counsel of America Online, is a top
adviser and fund-raiser for John McCain. And Simon has been raising
money for his former boss, Vice President Gore.)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides say that the candidates are not likely to
take a position that could jeopardize more donations.
</P>
<P>
   While competing legislation over the issue has been introduced
in recent weeks in Congress, both sides acknowledge that there is
nothing that the lawmakers will likely do any time soon. As a
result, the anti-AT&AMP;T forces have embarked on a strategy of trying
to find support in states and municipalities, hoping the issue may
then begin to resonate with more force in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensity of the fight, there is widespread
assumption that it will be settled either at the corporate
bargaining table or by a Supreme Court decision, which could be
years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a business motivation here and everybody likes
cloaking their arguments in terms like open access, but what's
really going on here is AOL has a business plan and wants the
government to put its thumb on the scale to tip the balance in its
favor,'' said Cicconi, general counsel and head of government
relations at AT&AMP;T. He said the opposition has been ``going in at
the local level and hiring as many people as possible who have
connections with city commissioners and local officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and AT&AMP;T's corporate rivals say the battle
is as much over principle as it is over business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe of the magnitude and money involved,'' said Donna
N. Lampert, who had to leave her law firm, which represents major
cable companies, to continue her work for America Online. ``But at
its core this is really about an important principle. This involves
a lot more than whose garage the Mercedes will be parked in, as the
saying goes about big money cases. It involves who will control the
Internet.''

GETTING THE PHONE ALL LINED UP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am a newcomer to the Net and have only one
phone line. Are there any ways of receiving my phone calls while
I'm on the Net?
</P>
<P>
   _ Busy Signal
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUSY: Who needs a phone? When I'm surfing, I just listen to
the voices I hear in my head and do whatever they say. At least,
that's what my attorney has advised me to say.
</P>
<P>
   One of those voices belongs to Al Gore. Maybe you've heard Al
babbling about the lack of ``infrastructure'' when he's not taking
credit for inventing the Internet, cold fusion and string cheese.
What he's trying to say in his own adorably English-impaired way is
``wires.'' And most of us just don't have enough wires for all we
want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't count on seeing the country completely rewired any
time soon. Our government can barely decide how big congressional
pay raises should be without coming to a complete standstill. And
if they get any more involved in this project, we'll wind up with
an over-spec'd network built from substandard hardware installed by
the lowest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we make do with the wires we have and count on
industry to come up with new ways to squeeze the most out of them.
The easiest path for you, Busy, is to get a second phone line. The
good news is that most existing residential phone wiring can
already accommodate one. Sure, a phone guy will come out to pretend
he's still got an important job. He'll tighten a few screws, and
then he'll have the guys downtown open the circuit. You can buy
some dual phone jacks and take care of the inside wiring yourself.
The four-conductor cable carries one line on the green and red
wires and the second on the yellow and black. It's really hard to
mess it up.
</P>
<P>
   The next step up is DSL, which is geek-ese for a digital phone
line. The existing copper wiring in your house carries both a
high-speed, continuous Internet connection (as fast as 1.5 megabits
per second vs. a top speed of 53K on a modem) and regular voice
calls for as little as 40 bucks a month, depending on your area.
The downside is you'll have to lay out a couple of hundred for
hardware, and you have to live within a prescribed distance from
the phone company office.
</P>
<P>
   If they offer you ISDN _ another form of digital line _ instead,
take a pass. More expensive, more complicated and slower. See about
a cable modem if they have them in your town. Still expensive, but
under the right conditions it can be faster than DSL. They'll
probably give you a break on HBO, too.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Epson ink-jet cartridges cost $25 at Wal-Mart.
Hewlett-Packard sells ink in bottles. Epson cautions against
refilling cartridges. Is there really a reason not to refill?
</P>
<P>
   _Ink-A-Dinka-Doo
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DINKA: Definitely! You'd cut into Epson's profit margin.
Let's face it, though. Most people are just too klutzy to try
refilling. Ink winds up all over your hands and the new upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, if you do things wrong, you could wind up gumming up the
printer beyond all hope the night before you're supposed to have
that quarterly report ready. Are a few extra bucks worth taking
that chance? Buy your cartridges.
</P>

MCI OUTAGE COULD DRIVE NET PROVIDERS OUT OF BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 10-day partial outage of MCI Worldcom's high-speed data
network took a cataclysmic toll on dozens and possibly hundreds of
small Internet service providers who were forced to shut down
altogether last week. Some say they may go out of business as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   These mom-and-pop players, along with more than a quarter of all
Internet service providers nationally, rely on MCI to route
subscribers onto the Internet. The network outage also took its
toll on regional and national Internet service providers, including
America Online, which said Monday that 2 million subscribers from
its combined America Online and Compuserve services may have been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   But small service providers felt the biggest impact because
unlike their larger counterparts they typically cannot afford a
backup _ that is, a contract with a second major network company.
So when MCI went down, they went down with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our industry, this is a killer _ a company killer,'' said
A.K. Jordan, president of Intellitech, a service provider in
Highland Park, N.J., with about 500 dial-up customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said that starting on Aug. 7, the company's subscribers
were no longer able to access the World Wide Web and were able to
get e-mail only from other Intellitech customers. He said he was
told MCI was assuring customers that the problem was due to
congestion and would be up and running in two hours _ a message he
passed along to subscribers who called to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out looking like liars and incompetents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the situation did not improve, Jordan and his business
partners took the extraordinary step of telephoning roughly
one-quarter of their subscribers to explain the situation and to
ask them not to quit the service. He said he now planned to give
his customers a free month of access.
</P>
<P>
   His situation is not unique, according to DataXchange, a
Washington-based company that buys Internet access wholesale from
MCI and sells it to small providers, like Jordan's Intellitech.
Mark Stutz, a spokesman for RMI.Net, the Denver parent of
DataXchange, said that of the 150 small service providers to which
it re-sells MCI services, 66 ``lost their networks completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Stutz estimated that due to those failures alone, some 250,000
subscribers lost Net access. He said that some of the providers
said they had seen so many subscriber cancellations they might go
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any worse than this,'' Stutz said. ``It's hard
to imagine a worse case scenario for our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   An MCI Worldcom spokeswoman, Linda Laughlin, said the company
would offer customers two free days of Internet access for each day
they had been unable to use MCI's network to access the Net. Ms.
Laughlin characterized the partial outage as an ``unsatisfactory''
performance and said MCI Worldcom expected it would take ``several
weeks'' to regain the trust of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts said MCI might be underestimating the
public relations toll.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne M. Schaff, senior analyst with Forrester Research, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based market research firm, speculated that
``most'' of the stranded Internet service providers would look to
one of the other major Network providers for access to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, MCI is the biggest player. According to a
survey released in July from Cahners In-Stat, a San Jose, Calif.,
market research firm, MCI Worldcom provides national backbone
access to 40.9 percent of national service providers and to 23.6
percent of small and regional providers _ defined as those serving
fewer than 25 area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, larger and regional providers rely on more
than one company for backbone Net access. For example, Earthlink
Network, a Pasadena, Calif.-based service with 1.4 million
subscribers, employs MCI and six other backbone providers,
including AT&AMP;T, IBM and Sprint, and thus experienced only minor
headaches last week, said Steve Dougherty, director of technology
acquisition for Earthlink. He said the company simply rerouted
traffic that would have gone over the MCI network to another
provider.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online and its subsidiary Compuserve about 2 million
of 20 million subscribers were vulnerable to the network failure
over the weekend because the primary access numbers they use to
dial into the Internet rely on the MCI backbone. In most of those
instances, America Online urged customers to try a different access
number; however, in the case of 50 communities, representing
roughly 500,000 subscribers, there was no second access number
available, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   For those customers, America Online created a toll-free number.
However, some subscribers might not have been apprised of the
change since they were unable to sign onto the Internet in the
first place to receive an update.

 &HT;    These kids deserve a break today
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The kid sitting next to me with the Rugrats
lunch box got busted for smashing his cookie on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to do that,'' Shannon Sellstrom, assistant
principal at Mollie Dawson Elementary, told him. ``What would
happen if everybody did that to the table?'' Nobody can take a joke
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' said a little girl, probably 5, sitting across
the table from me. She was showing me how you can blow up an empty
aluminum bag of Capri-Sun wild cherry drink like a balloon by
blowing on the straw that goes through the little hole into the
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as teachers are concerned, not the best invention on
the market,'' said substitute teacher Tami Lewis. ``Those things
squirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Since school is back in session in Austin, on Friday I dined
with the kindergartners and second-graders during lunch at the
Dawson cafeteria. This is my review of the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: The food must be pretty good because there
is always a line to get in.
</P>
<P>
   The school has about 500 students ages 3 through 12, so there's
always plenty of interesting table talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has a lot of boyfriends,'' said a little girl
sitting at the table next to Lewis. I don't know what brought that
up.
</P>
<P>
   Friday at Dawson was, as is usual on Friday in the Austin
Independent School District, ``hamburger day.'' You got your choice
of a hamburger or a chicken patty sandwich (or, gag, the yogurt
plate), carrots or french fries, apple chunks and low-fat chocolate
or low-fat regular milk. Snack offerings included vanilla pudding
or blue Jell-O (food isn't supposed to be blue), a bag of Chester's
Popcorn, Bighorn Beef 'N Chicken Jerky (I'll bet the kids don't get
jerky in Hoboken, N.J.), and Blue Bell Mooo ice cream bars.
</P>
<P>
   For my entree, I selected the hamburger with the fries, regular
low-fat milk, apple chunks and the jerky. I forgot to eat the
jerky.
</P>
<P>
   The milk and the apple were standard fare, but the burger and
fries were a disappointment. They were what I refer to as luke
cold.
</P>
<P>
   I thought the children should have sent the hamburgers and fries
back to the kitchen and demanded that they be reheated. But nobody
did.
</P>
<P>
   Diners are seated at long tables, and you never know who's going
to sit next to you. So you're bound to find yourself engaged in
some interesting chitchat with your dining companions.
</P>
<P>
   One boy sitting across from me, probably 5 years old, had a
Band-Aid on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister was pulling my shirt, and then she let me go, and
then I hit my head on the headboard,'' he explained. He was eating
a bag of H-E-B thin sour cream and onion potato chips. ``Where'd
you get those?'' I asked him. I hadn't seen the chips offered when
I went through the line. Turns out the boy had brought the chips
from home. I was a little jealous because my hamburger bun was dry
and could have used some grease.
</P>
<P>
   The service in here is impeccable, and I was it once. ``Hey,
mister, can you open this for me?'' a boy asked, handing me his
jerky.
</P>
<P>
   The decor was a little thin. Hanging art consisted of a bulletin
board decorated with Goofy and a hippo holding a pencil, and a sign
that tells you not to share your food.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, I reached over and ate a chunk of apple off a
kid's plate. ``You ate the seed,'' said a boy sitting across from
me, looking surprised. Yeah, well, so what? I said. ``You like the
seed?'' the kid said, giggling.
</P>
<P>
   This kid had a lot of business laughing at me for eating the
seed. Shoot, he was eating the blue Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   I would dine again at Mollie Dawson. But I would recommend
returning on a Monday, when they have pizza.

TRAVELING THE WEB WITHOUT LEAVING FOOTPRINTS  
 AIMING A LITTLE PERSUASION AT MAKERS OF TV RECORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Privada Inc. of San Jose, Calif., is betting that when typical
consumers become aware of how exposed they are to invasions of
privacy on the Internet, they will part with $5 a month for a cloak
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on a user's computer setup and Internet service
provider, a single visit to a Web site, for instance, can often
reveal the Internet address assigned to the visitor's computer, the
visitor's e-mail address, the browser and operating system being
used, and what plug-ins or Active-X controls have been installed.
It can give away even more information if the user has not removed
the unique serial numbers embedded in Microsoft's Windows 98
operating system and Intel's Pentium III microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that a recent Harris poll for Business Week found
that fears of losing privacy were the top reason people decided not
to go online and that among those who do, only three out of 10 give
valid information when asked to register at a site.
</P>
<P>
   Privada plans to unveil a new service Monday, called Web
Incognito, that lets users make all of their Internet activities _
e-mail, online chats, Web browsing and even purchases _ completely
anonymous. The service works by encrypting the data flowing out of
a subscriber's computer and redirecting it to the Privada service
after it leaves the Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Web Incognito masks the data's origins and sends it on to its
intended destination. Responses, like those from Web sites or
e-mail recipients, flow back to Privada, which passes them back to
the subscriber. The service, which can be switched on and off, also
stores the subscriber's ``cookies,'' files that identify the user
to Web sites, so it does not interfere with standard Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Web Incognito differs from other anonymity software in two
important ways. It covers all Internet activity, not just Web
browsing or e-mail, for instance. And the identity it protects can
be shared with police officers who have appropriate warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our service is for protecting the privacy of consumers, not
for hiding criminals or criminal activities,'' said Barbara
Bellissimo, Privada's chief executive. While she said the company
expected to take some heat from privacy rights groups, she added,
``We felt it would be irresponsible not to give law enforcement
agencies the information if they have valid warrants.''
</P>
<P>
   The free software and information about the subscription service
are available at http://www.privada.net/.

   Speaking Up Early on Copyright Infringement
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like saber rattling when a consortium of television
networks and programming companies decided last week to issue a
public threat against the makers of personal video recorders _
devices that some believe will revolutionize the way people watch
television. But the reaction was neither fear nor anger _ and
certainly not one of quaking in corporate boots.
</P>
<P>
   A little nod and a smile were more like it.
</P>
<P>
   That was because the consortium making the threats is made up
mostly of companies already in business with one of the two
entities being threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is copyright infringement, and the consortium wants
mainly to establish that any new company getting into the business
of marketing the recorders, known as PVRs, must agree to enter into
licensing agreements with program suppliers before it re-uses the
material for its own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, ReplayTV and Tivo Inc., are already marketing
PVRs, digital devices that make it much easier for home viewers to
create their own programming lineups and potentially to eliminate
commercials. Both companies have actively courted deals with the
big program suppliers. Tivo has already sold minority interests to
four of the companies involved in the consortium: Walt Disney, CBS,
News Corp. and Discovery Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Carp, a Washington-based lawyer who represents the
consortium, the Advanced Television Copyright Coalition, and Turner
Broadcasting, whose parent, Time Warner, is in the consortium, said
the purpose of last week's action, reported first in The Wall
Street Journal, was not to file suit against the two PVR companies,
though such a threat was specified in its press release.
</P>
<P>
   What the consortium is doing, he said, is putting on the record
its expectation that PVR companies must adhere to existing
copyright laws. The consortium is concerned about what happened to
Hollywood studios in the 1970s when they sought to stop Sony Corp.
from selling videocassette recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against the studios, in part because
the studios were late in asserting their rights, waiting until long
after the machines were in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wait until you're actually hurt,'' Carp said, ``you
might be making a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that other companies are expected to enter the PVR
market, and that some of them might not be as ready to become the
partners of the program suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to choke off the technology,'' Carp said.
``We've just learned that in some cases you need to speak up early
to protect your position.''

 &HT;    You have to be a flyweight to fly in a 17-inch seat
 &HT;    By Emily C. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bad news, ladies and gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines _ those good folks who delay your flight when the
plane's not full and then leave your luggage behind _ have been
fiddling around with your derriere.
</P>
<P>
   What I mean, specifically, is that if you have to fly somewhere
_ say to a convention in Topeka next May or your class reunion in
the year 2010 _ you might want to start slimming down. Now.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you could start by having pretzels for dinner tonight
instead of peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Because, from what I can gather, that feeling you get when
you're on an airplane? Like you're in a cage? Like the stupid
seat's not as big as it used to be?
</P>
<P>
   It's for real.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the skinny:
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, in the 1960s when flying meant white gloves for the
ladies and jackets for the men, airline seats were 18 inches wide.
That was considered the smallest seat acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Today? Chances are that seat you're sitting in is just 17 inches
wide. And your leg room? The space set aside for one row of seats?
It's called ``seat pitch'' and, says the Wall Street Journal, has
gone from 34 inches to 32 inches this decade alone. This is done so
that the airlines can fit more people on their planes.
</P>
<P>
   See, we're not nuts. We're not even fat. We're simply the
victims of yet another corporate conspiracy. We lose the weight,
they make the money.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear the check-in questions now:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you bring your driver's license?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you pack your own bags?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you eat those two cold chicken nuggets off your kid's
plate last night instead of throwing them in the trash like you
should have?''
</P>
<P>
   I swear, if a sky cap ever whips out a yardstick _ a ruler won't
do _ and tries to measure my backside, I'm taking the train.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mixon knows of what I speak. Mixon, 53, who lives outside
Atlanta, flies a lot, always coach. Maybe once or twice a week he's
on a plane. A computer specialist who helps travel agents install
their software programs, he's got this whole traveling thing down.
He gets to the airport early. He checks his luggage instead of
trying to cram it into the overhead bin.
</P>
<P>
   And he always asks for the aisle seat. At 6-feet-1 and 205
pounds, Mixon needs that little bit of extra space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying,'' says Mixon, ``is not what it used to be, and praise
be to God if someone could bring it back.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mixon's able to get an aisle seat, that's ``livable.'' The
window seat's ``kind of livable.''
</P>
<P>
   But the middle seat? That tiny claustrophobic spot between the
stinky old lady and the jittery kid?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way that's comfortable,'' Mixon says.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sheppard, 24, has to be even more of a soldier when he
flies. Sheppard is 6-feet-4 and weighs 280 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter at this point,'' said Sheppard, also from
Atlanta. He says his knees practically touch his chin. If the
person in front of him reclines the seat, ``it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   And he can't put his tray table down. But I figure that last
thing's just another part of the airline industry's big corporate
plan. Has been all along.
</P>
<P>
   They don't want any of us to eat ever again.
</P>

 &HT;    Digital touch-ups a real Trompe L'Oeil
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once upon a simpler time, Henry VIII
fell in love when he beheld a portrait in oil of his betrothed,
Anne of Cleves.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, when Anne showed up for the wedding, Henry _ who had never
met her _ took one look and underwent an immediate and total change
of heart. Anne was ugly. Henry was royally ticked off. Anne was
sent packing and her embellished portrait consigned to the royal
attic.
</P>
<P>
   She was pretty as a picture, but pictures can lie.
</P>
<P>
   Photos do not. Well, they're not supposed to. A photo supposedly
captures an image of what is, not what might be.
</P>
<P>
   But with the coming of the digital age, a sweep of a computer
mouse can turn the objective reality of the camera's eye into
subjective unreality. Where the artist employs a brush and paint to
reduce the curvature of a nose, the digital technician employs his
mouse to add hair, delete frowns, straighten a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Or clean up a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Or make a missile silo disappear from the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Or accidentally ``cure'' a ruptured spleen in a CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no way to detect the manipulation. Reality is at the
mercy of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson's skin was digitally darkened for a Time cover.
Prince William's sourpussed face was expunged from a royal wedding
photo, replaced by a smiling Willie. Dustin Hoffman won a lawsuit
after Los Angeles Magazine ran a doctored photo of him in drag. The
magazine claimed Hoffman was a public figure, known for his
cross-dressing role in ``Tootsie,'' and therefore open to humorous
portrayal. The court said false is false, judgment to Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of a Connecticut high school student didn't like his
yearbook picture _ he had shaved his head _ so they had a photo lab
add digital hair.
</P>
<P>
   JC Penney ran a photo program where guest photographers snapped
portraits, then worked with customers to eliminate blemishes, lose
weight and add sparkle to eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The new _ virtually _ you.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, air-brushing of photos has been around for almost as long
as photography, and artists have added color to black and white
photos since the days of glass negatives. But a colorized print can
be detected from afar, and an airbrushed print can be compared with
the original film negative in order to detect manipulation,
according to Pete Cross, photo director at The Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives, says Cross, cannot be doctored without changing the
physical characteristics of the negative. Original negatives never
lie.
</P>
<P>
   But digital images are just collections of electronic signals,
bits of information. The original photo image is converted to
signals, then reformatted into an image. During the reformatting
process, the signals can be changed to produce different images.
And if done without an electronic audit trail, nobody can tell the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   So, unless a photo is accompanied by the original negative, you
can't be sure it hasn't been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   That raises some questions.
</P>
<P>
   Can a digital image be used in a courtroom?
</P>
<P>
   Are high school yearbooks of the future going to be flights of
fashion fancy rather than accurate pictorial representations of
students, zits and all?
</P>
<P>
   Where does a photo editor at a magazine or newspaper draw the
line at redrawing the lines?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not change a news photo,'' says Cross. ``We'll select
a photo from among many, the one that best conveys the scene, but
we won't doctor it.''
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic magazine has a two-page photo policy, the
gist of which is: no tricks. The policy evolved after Geographic
rearranged the Great Pyramids of Giza in a photo in order to fit
their image onto a cover. Now, except for adjustment to shading and
light, and to protect identities, content alteration of Geographic
photos ``is unacceptable, using any form of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press photo policy is simple: ``The content of a
photograph will never be manipulated or changed in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are not under such tight constraints and are preparing
for courtroom changes. ``We haven't seen a lot of digital
photographs,'' said a lawyer in the office of the State Attorney.
``But we can anticipate the changes. Crime scene photos have
traditionally been of poor quality, not so much because of the
photography, but because crime scenes are such a mess, dark,
confusing. Any attempt to `clean up' crime scene photos by digital
retouching would raise eyebrows. Digital imaging is a new
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see significant questions,'' says Stuart lawyer Willie Gary.
``From now on, I want to see the electronic trail that produces a
photograph used in evidence. Even two or three years ago, I
wouldn't have thought this way. But things have changed big time.
Bodily injuries or property damage can be made to simply disappear
in digital photos. You could lose a case if you tried to use
doctored photos. For that matter, you could lose if the other guy
got away with using doctored photos. So you have to know: Where did
the image come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Without an electronic watermark, that's impossible, says Elmo
Sapwater, resident technical genius and managing editor of PEI,
Photo Electronic Imaging magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several software companies are coming out with watermarks,''
says Sapwater. ``Each time an image is altered a new watermark will
overlay the old, leaving an audit trail. If the image is passed
along without change, it will retain the original mark. This will
make life easier for lawyers, technicians, doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors?
</P>
<P>
   ``Say your doctor sends a digital image over the phone to a
doctor in Hong Kong, for diagnosis. And the image gets reformatted,
changes. So the broken arm looks healed, or the tumor looks like it
is smaller than it really is. That would be a nightmare,'' says
Sapwater. ``But an electronic watermark would tip off the receiving
doctor that something happened to the image.''
</P>
<P>
   When the digital image comes from outer space, all sorts of
possibilities exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has used a dual format for years with digital
photography. When NASA photos are beamed down from space, they come
in pairs. One set of digital information cannot be altered. Raw
formatting. The other, identical image, can be altered by
scientists on the ground, for clarity or color, whatever they want.
But one set cannot be touched. That protects the integrity of the
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a spy satellite photographing enemy troop movements or
a missile silo. And the enemy can hack into the transmission and
make their soldiers `disappear.' You need to know your information
is pure. If it isn't, you need to know it's been fooled with,''
Sapwater says.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds logical enough to be a national security matter.
</P>
<P>
   It is, says Sapwater.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak, Nikon and Sony have offered such technology to government
scientists for years, he says. Now, the big camera-makers are
working on products for general use that will include raw format
features and watermarks.
</P>
<P>
   The days of leaving no fingerprints on an altered digital image
may be numbered. But the price of truth is high.
</P>
<P>
   A top-of-the-line digital camera can cost more than $20,000.
Computers and processing equipment can run another $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach portrait photographer Mike Moya keeps his Sony
digital camera locked up in a five-ton safe.
</P>
<P>
   The digital age has changed Moya's profession _ and his outlook
on human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always airbrushed,'' says Moya. ``Take away gray hair,
tuck in a shirt, remove a mole. But digital photography can create
new worlds. One of my clients was an older lady who had caught a
big marlin on a fishing trip. She had only one photograph of her
trophy. In it she was holding the fishing rod while her guide stood
next to the fish. Nobody believed she had caught the fish. So we
curved her arm, moved the fish over to her side of the picture, put
the rod in the guide's hands. Now, people believe she caught the
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya has added a healthy eyeball where the original was damaged.
He has shot families in the studio and placed them in a field of
flowers or on a pure white beach. He has put heads on bodies
dressed in tuxedos, removed unwanted guests from wedding photos,
made kids gone bonkers look saintly by switching torsos or faces.
He has created family portraits of families that didn't actually
sit for the portrait and then put the families in places they've
never been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this is vanity,'' he says. ``But some is simply a way
to capture a client's mental image, maybe their idea of peace or
beauty. Their dream. Think of it as a very technical form of
artistic expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Or think of it as the painless nose job.
</P>
<P>
   Digital wizardry still wouldn't have helped Anne of Cleves. A
rose is a rose and ugly is ugly. We wear truth on our faces.
</P>
<P>
   Even digital mirrors won't change that.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: CONVENTIONAL RETAILERS USE WEB TO IMPROVE
SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditional retailers have spent the last two years watching the
Internet play havoc with their businesses. To divine the secrets of
the new medium, they have been forced to study their virtual
counterparts for clues on how to compete in this radically
different arena. Many have sought the counsel of Internet
consultants, while others have felt compelled to wade through
stacks of dot-com and E-business books _ bought, no doubt, at
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now that some of the faster readers have finished studying, they
seem poised to turn the tables on their Internet brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers of the so-called bricks-and-mortar variety are
plotting their revenge not simply by creating Web sites of their
own, but by integrating their Internet operations into their
physical stores. Executives say that by mingling the virtual and
physical retail environments, they can better serve customers in
both. There is, of course, a newly minted buzz phrase associated
with this trend _ ``clicks and mortar'' _ but those in the industry
say the transformation has been brewing for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been dealing with a lot of companies almost paralyzed
with fear about the Internet,'' said Melissa Bane, an E-commerce
analyst with the Yankee Group, an Internet consulting firm. ``Some
of the smarter ones are starting to realize that it's their game to
lose. They already have the customers, and now they can use the
Internet in their stores as a tool to expand their share of
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Activmedia Inc., an Internet research firm, 54
percent of companies with online and off-line sales operations now
report substantial two-way interaction between the two divisions.
Analysts and executives say most of that interaction focuses on
such things as marketing campaigns, but the strategy is starting to
move beyond simply printing the address of the company's Web site
on its receipts and shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Recreational Equipment Inc., an outdoor goods
retailer, has placed Internet kiosks in 52 of its 53 stores and has
integrated Web access into its cash registers, said Matt Hyde, vice
president for online sales. The kiosks allow shoppers to look up
detailed information on every product that Recreational Equipment
carries, regardless of whether that particular item is available in
the store. Blocking software bars users from going to sites other
than the retailer's (www.rei.com) and its outlet site
(www.rei-outlet.com). Meanwhile, cashiers can look up items on line
through the Web-enabled registers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a quantum leap in terms of customer service,'' Hyde
said. ``Say I'm in our Wisconsin store, and I'm looking for a haul
bag for a rock-climbing trip to Yosemite. I'm not going to find
that in that store. Before, I'd stand in line at customer service,
a rep would look it up, and I'd have to know exactly what I wanted
for them to be able to help me because chances are they wouldn't be
familiar with haul bags. Now, I can look that up with or without a
salesperson, I can see pictures with all the product info, and I
can buy it at the checkout counter and have it delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence suggests that Recreational Equipment was the
first major retailer to put kiosks into its stores, starting in
Seattle, in 1996. Such kiosks are quickly becoming standard fare,
however. Companies like Sears, Gap, Compaq Computer and Borders
Books, among others, have begun major efforts to give customers a
virtual shopping option even as they browse the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that 10 years from now, every major retail company
will have an Internet-enabled device in the store,'' said Rick
Vanzura, president of Borders Online, who began the bookseller's
campaign to install Internet kiosks in each of the company's 270
superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzura, who recently left Borders to join a start-up company,
said the Internet effort would cost Borders ``in the eight
figures,'' given the technology infrastructure it requires. In the
coming months, he said, the store kiosks will allow customers to
order not only any of the 700,000 titles in the Borders warehouses,
but also out-of-print books, which will be printed and shipped to
the customer's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an expensive proposition,'' Vanzura said. ``But
I'm confident we'll see a return on that investment _ and it won't
take decades.''
</P>
<P>
   David S. Pottruck, co-chief executive of Charles Schwab, said
the cost of integrating his company's Internet strategy with its
off-line strategy had gone far beyond the price of Internet kiosks.
Pottruck, who said he coined the phrase clicks and mortar in a
recent speech, noted that when the company merged its on- and
off-line divisions last year and lowered the charge for off-line
clients from roughly $65 a trade to $30 (to match the online fee),
it cost the company between $125 million and $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, Schwab had to integrate online trading
kiosks more fully into its 300 offices, train its advisers to serve
customers both on line and off and bolster the company's customer
service systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the move has clearly paid off, he said, given the company's
leading position in the online trading category and its customer
growth this year. And more changes will be in order, as customers
become technically savvier, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't need people to provide some of what's needed today,
but it will open the door for people to provide new services that
we don't have today,'' Pottruck said. ``You might click on an icon
on your computer and have someone appear immediately to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the realm of finance, he said, ``traditional stores
will need to use the Internet to create a richer shopping
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarkets will have to provide a range of experiences _
cooking tips, recipes you can get at a kiosk _ instead of simply
being places to pick up merchandise,'' he said. ``Those days are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bane, of the Yankee Group, said that once companies
integrated the Internet into their point-of-sale systems, cashiers
could conceivably access a customer's previous buying history
during checkout and suggest other items to buy. Or, once shoppers
returned home, they might find a coupon in their e-mail from a
store they recently visited. The store's knowledge of the
customer's on- and off-line purchasing history is potent marketing
material, she said, adding, ``They can leverage the technology
investments they've already made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gap, for one, has no immediate plans for such a
comprehensive integration of its on- and off-line stores, Rebecca
Weill, a company spokeswoman, said. But the company has created
``Web lounges'' at eight of its flagship stores, featuring black
leather couches, chairs and computers framed with brushed metal
casings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always crowded,'' Ms. Weill said of the lounges.
``Sometimes people even buy items from the kiosk instead of going
through the store for them.''

BRING BACK THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT 007 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TERRY NORTON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANSELMO, Calif. _ The sense and sensibilities of American
life, as if they aren't under enough attack by our infamous
politicos, have suffered another blow at the hands of Hollywood's
power mongers.
</P>
<P>
   The political correctness police think they've hit pay dirt, but
all I see is a horny feminist's nightmare. I'm suddenly longing for
the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've already heard. James Bond has quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   As a life-long advocate for women's equality, I'd like to go on
record as reclaiming our God-given right to drool over nasty hunks
in our little dark, anonymous, creaky, loge-seat corner of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   By the light of day, sure, we want equal pay, hands off,
respect, promotions and a shot at the presidency. But by night,
there's a bit of Barbarella in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   We may be headed for the top of the ladder, but we still like
bad boys. We don't want their hands down our blouses, we don't want
them near the Oval Office (too late), but on celluloid, what can
they hurt?
</P>
<P>
   Where's the harm in lusting for an insensitive gorgeous
super-hero once in a while as long as he's a caricature? We want
manly old-fashioned movie heroes. The retro guy. Pouting,
trash-talking and obtuse, so we can snicker about him afterwards.
We want him to ride untamed horses while lustily drawing on an
unfiltered cigarette, chasing busty Italian women named Sophia, so
we can tsk-tsk into our popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   We want bad boys who paint naked women gold and make plans to
blow up the world while sipping martinis served by scantily clad
beauties. We want women who purr for men so we can slap our thighs
and say thank God we've come a long way, baby. We want hot sex,
half-naked men and wantonness with a capital ``W.'' And we're
willing to pay $7.50.
</P>
<P>
   You know who we're going to get now? James Bond, the sissy. A
drip who's worried about his cholesterol, ordering Caesar salad
with his dressing on the side. A dork who's in bed by 10. Alone.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing we know, he'll be quoting Kahlil Gibran. He'll be
moisturizing when he should be womanizing and meditating when he
should be dancing the midnight grind. What next, celibacy?
</P>
<P>
   A church-going James Bond just isn't going to excite us.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood might as well forget Pierce Brosnan and cast George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to hear, ``May I introduce myself? The name's Bond
and I'm a member of NOW. Can I offer you a cranberry Calistoga?''
</P>
<P>
   We want straight shots and hot pants. We want gorgeous, smart,
seductive women pitted against testosterone-laden, scotch-slamming,
breast-hungry heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are where we go to escape the idiocy of life as we not
only know it, but live it every day. We desperately need a fantasy
life where everything isn't kosher pickles.
</P>
<P>
   We crave exaggeration and superlatives. We require them to get
past all the '90s rules and mores we so ardently follow 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   When we go to the show, we want Thunderpussies _ not wimps.
</P>
<P>
   I say let James Bond wend his way to lung cancer while his
former co-star Pussy Galore chokes on secondhand smoke. Leave the
obnoxious purity to the audience. We'll handle it on our end.
</P>
<P>
   God knows we're not allowed to do anything else these days.

 &HT;    Digital touch-ups a real Trompe L'Oeil
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once upon a simpler time, Henry VIII
fell in love when he beheld a portrait in oil of his betrothed,
Anne of Cleves.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, when Anne showed up for the wedding, Henry _ who had never
met her _ took one look and underwent an immediate and total change
of heart. Anne was ugly. Henry was royally ticked off. Anne was
sent packing and her embellished portrait consigned to the royal
attic.
</P>
<P>
   She was pretty as a picture, but pictures can lie.
</P>
<P>
   Photos do not. Well, they're not supposed to. A photo supposedly
captures an image of what is, not what might be.
</P>
<P>
   But with the coming of the digital age, a sweep of a computer
mouse can turn the objective reality of the camera's eye into
subjective unreality. Where the artist employs a brush and paint to
reduce the curvature of a nose, the digital technician employs his
mouse to add hair, delete frowns, straighten a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Or clean up a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Or make a missile silo disappear from the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Or accidentally ``cure'' a ruptured spleen in a CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no way to detect the manipulation. Reality is at the
mercy of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson's skin was digitally darkened for a Time cover.
Prince William's sourpussed face was expunged from a royal wedding
photo, replaced by a smiling Willie. Dustin Hoffman won a lawsuit
after Los Angeles Magazine ran a doctored photo of him in drag. The
magazine claimed Hoffman was a public figure, known for his
cross-dressing role in ``Tootsie,'' and therefore open to humorous
portrayal. The court said false is false, judgment to Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of a Connecticut high school student didn't like his
yearbook picture _ he had shaved his head _ so they had a photo lab
add digital hair.
</P>
<P>
   JC Penney ran a photo program where guest photographers snapped
portraits, then worked with customers to eliminate blemishes, lose
weight and add sparkle to eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The new _ virtually _ you.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, air-brushing of photos has been around for almost as long
as photography, and artists have added color to black and white
photos since the days of glass negatives. But a colorized print can
be detected from afar, and an airbrushed print can be compared with
the original film negative in order to detect manipulation,
according to Pete Cross, photo director at The Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives, says Cross, cannot be doctored without changing the
physical characteristics of the negative. Original negatives never
lie.
</P>
<P>
   But digital images are just collections of electronic signals,
bits of information. The original photo image is converted to
signals, then reformatted into an image. During the reformatting
process, the signals can be changed to produce different images.
And if done without an electronic audit trail, nobody can tell the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   So, unless a photo is accompanied by the original negative, you
can't be sure it hasn't been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   That raises some questions.
</P>
<P>
   Can a digital image be used in a courtroom?
</P>
<P>
   Are high school yearbooks of the future going to be flights of
fashion fancy rather than accurate pictorial representations of
students, zits and all?
</P>
<P>
   Where does a photo editor at a magazine or newspaper draw the
line at redrawing the lines?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not change a news photo,'' says Cross. ``We'll select
a photo from among many, the one that best conveys the scene, but
we won't doctor it.''
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic magazine has a two-page photo policy, the
gist of which is: no tricks. The policy evolved after Geographic
rearranged the Great Pyramids of Giza in a photo in order to fit
their image onto a cover. Now, except for adjustment to shading and
light, and to protect identities, content alteration of Geographic
photos ``is unacceptable, using any form of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press photo policy is simple: ``The content of a
photograph will never be manipulated or changed in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are not under such tight constraints and are preparing
for courtroom changes. ``We haven't seen a lot of digital
photographs,'' said a lawyer in the office of the State Attorney.
``But we can anticipate the changes. Crime scene photos have
traditionally been of poor quality, not so much because of the
photography, but because crime scenes are such a mess, dark,
confusing. Any attempt to `clean up' crime scene photos by digital
retouching would raise eyebrows. Digital imaging is a new
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see significant questions,'' says Stuart lawyer Willie Gary.
``From now on, I want to see the electronic trail that produces a
photograph used in evidence. Even two or three years ago, I
wouldn't have thought this way. But things have changed big time.
Bodily injuries or property damage can be made to simply disappear
in digital photos. You could lose a case if you tried to use
doctored photos. For that matter, you could lose if the other guy
got away with using doctored photos. So you have to know: Where did
the image come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Without an electronic watermark, that's impossible, says Elmo
Sapwater, resident technical genius and managing editor of PEI,
Photo Electronic Imaging magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several software companies are coming out with watermarks,''
says Sapwater. ``Each time an image is altered a new watermark will
overlay the old, leaving an audit trail. If the image is passed
along without change, it will retain the original mark. This will
make life easier for lawyers, technicians, doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors?
</P>
<P>
   ``Say your doctor sends a digital image over the phone to a
doctor in Hong Kong, for diagnosis. And the image gets reformatted,
changes. So the broken arm looks healed, or the tumor looks like it
is smaller than it really is. That would be a nightmare,'' says
Sapwater. ``But an electronic watermark would tip off the receiving
doctor that something happened to the image.''
</P>
<P>
   When the digital image comes from outer space, all sorts of
possibilities exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has used a dual format for years with digital
photography. When NASA photos are beamed down from space, they come
in pairs. One set of digital information cannot be altered. Raw
formatting. The other, identical image, can be altered by
scientists on the ground, for clarity or color, whatever they want.
But one set cannot be touched. That protects the integrity of the
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a spy satellite photographing enemy troop movements or
a missile silo. And the enemy can hack into the transmission and
make their soldiers `disappear.' You need to know your information
is pure. If it isn't, you need to know it's been fooled with,''
Sapwater says.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds logical enough to be a national security matter.
</P>
<P>
   It is, says Sapwater.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak, Nikon and Sony have offered such technology to government
scientists for years, he says. Now, the big camera-makers are
working on products for general use that will include raw format
features and watermarks.
</P>
<P>
   The days of leaving no fingerprints on an altered digital image
may be numbered. But the price of truth is high.
</P>
<P>
   A top-of-the-line digital camera can cost more than $20,000.
Computers and processing equipment can run another $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach portrait photographer Mike Moya keeps his Sony
digital camera locked up in a five-ton safe.
</P>
<P>
   The digital age has changed Moya's profession _ and his outlook
on human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always airbrushed,'' says Moya. ``Take away gray hair,
tuck in a shirt, remove a mole. But digital photography can create
new worlds. One of my clients was an older lady who had caught a
big marlin on a fishing trip. She had only one photograph of her
trophy. In it she was holding the fishing rod while her guide stood
next to the fish. Nobody believed she had caught the fish. So we
curved her arm, moved the fish over to her side of the picture, put
the rod in the guide's hands. Now, people believe she caught the
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya has added a healthy eyeball where the original was damaged.
He has shot families in the studio and placed them in a field of
flowers or on a pure white beach. He has put heads on bodies
dressed in tuxedos, removed unwanted guests from wedding photos,
made kids gone bonkers look saintly by switching torsos or faces.
He has created family portraits of families that didn't actually
sit for the portrait and then put the families in places they've
never been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this is vanity,'' he says. ``But some is simply a way
to capture a client's mental image, maybe their idea of peace or
beauty. Their dream. Think of it as a very technical form of
artistic expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Or think of it as the painless nose job.
</P>
<P>
   Digital wizardry still wouldn't have helped Anne of Cleves. A
rose is a rose and ugly is ugly. We wear truth on our faces.
</P>
<P>
   Even digital mirrors won't change that.

 &HT;    Viking writing in Oklahoma rains on Columbus' parade
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTEAU MOUNTAIN, Okla. _ I am standing in this mountain valley
before this huge rock in the exact same spot where a Norse Viking
named Glome stood nearly 1,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Glome painstakingly etched an inscription on this billboard-size
rock in Old Norse runes, which are alphabet characters formerly
used by ancient Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   The eight runes gradually increase in size from 6 1/2 inches on
the left to 9 1/2 inches on the right. The eight runes, according
to Dr. Richard Nielsen, a runologist who received his doctorate at
the University of Denmark, spell GLOME DAL.
</P>
<P>
   The carving was painstakingly punched into the exceptionally
hard, fine-grained Savanna sandstone rock that is 12 feet high, 10
feet wide and 16 inches thick. The inscribed stone slab is aligned
north and south and stands in a vertical position where geologists
speculate that it landed after falling eons ago from the 40-foot
cliffs that surround the stele on three sides.
</P>
<P>
   In the language of early Viking explorers, GLOME DAL means
``Valley owned by Glome.''
</P>
<P>
   A Norseman named Glome pounded out this boundary marker on land
he claimed as his own a half century or so before Christopher
Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492 in search of India and
became known as the first European discoverer of America.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus, who never set foot in North America, has parades in
his honor in American cities while Glome and his pre-Columbian
Norsemen buddies were carving ``No trespassing'' signs on rocks in
eastern Oklahoma hundreds of years before Columbus was born. Some
people can't catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   The Glome marker now is the centerpiece of Heavener Runestone
State Park on Poteau Mountain on the outskirts of Heavener, Okla.,
population about 2,800 and about 10 miles from the Arkansas border.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Vikings exploring and even temporarily settling
along North America's eastern seaboard hundreds of years before
Columbus' birth is easier to accept than the thought of Norsemen
explorer-warriors establishing land claims in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Early Viking exploration spread westward from Europe to Iceland,
on to Greenland and finally to North America. Speculation pushes
Norsemen down the eastern seaboard, around Florida, into the Gulf
of Mexico and finally up the mouth of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the Mississippi River and its tributaries, the Vikings
supposedly ascended the Arkansas River and then proceeded up the
Poteau River to a point merely three miles from Glome's boundary
marker here on Poteau Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Other runestones that indicate boundaries and burial markers
were found within 10 miles of the Heavener Runestone. They also
were written in the same Old Norse alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   While I can easily imagine a prankster hillbilly carving these
rocks while sucking on a jug of moonshine, no one can imagine any
hillbilly or pioneer settler who happened to be runologist versed
in Old Norse Futhark and Scandinavian Futhork runes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a Choctaw hunting party is reported to have first
discovered the runestone in the 1830s. It was long called ``Indian
Rock'' until experts at the Smithsonian Institution identified the
characters as runic. The first white settlers came into the area in
the 1870s. Two bear hunters reported seeing the stone about that
time.
</P>
<P>
   If some backwoods scholar-prankster pulled this off as a hoax
more than a century ago, my hat's off to him.
</P>
<P>
   If a Viking named Glome stood here and chipped his land claim
into this rock centuries before Y1K, I'm even more impressed.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: TOO MANY HANGERS-ON CREATES BUMPY RIDE FOR 
INTERNET STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the market for technology stocks continues its lurching
slide, some of us with memories that predate Internet Time are
thinking about infinite loops.
</P>
<P>
   An infinite loop, for those not versed in software lingo, is a
type of computer program that runs the same instructions
continuously until it is either stopped or interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The infinite loop also seems an appropriate metaphor for the
loaves-and-fishes, endless multiplication of Internet
``businesses'' and the inevitable indigestion; consolidations and
bankruptcies and shakeouts and layoffs have become the expected and
ritual machinations of the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   The instruction set for this industry's infinite loop _ a kind
of Full Employment Act for everyone from entrepreneurs and
investors to the news media _ goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Some kid in a dorm room (previous incarnation: some guy in a
garage) invents _ or appropriates or whatever _ some technology or
designs a new gadget or, nowadays, patents some new software-driven
``method of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly minted ``visionary'' asserts he has found the
equivalent of the Holy Grail _ if not in terms of the actual
technology or concept, at least in terms of his ability to induce
religious ecstasy in investors.
</P>
<P>
   He gets his first round of venture financing. He hires a public
relations firm, which trots him around to the market researchers,
the monthlies (i.e., business and trade magazines) and eventually
to the national business press to peddle the story of this latest
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits go wild. Venture capitalists start financing
imitators' wannabe business plans with abandon. Wall Street bestows
upon them enormous valuations based on ``potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Visionary and wannabes alike take their companies to the public
market. The venture capitalists and founders sell off a pile of
stock as soon as possible. The folks they sell it to lose their
shirts when the stock begins hemorrhaging, as it almost inevitably
does.
</P>
<P>
   The news media started a backlash to the mania, which they were
complicit in creating.
</P>
<P>
   Then the next-generation visionary comes along and starts the
cycle again.
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it. Infinite loopiness. Sound familiar? After
the last couple of weeks of stock shock, it should. What is
happening today is a manifestation of infinite loopiness, plain and
simple.
</P>
<P>
   This particular loop _ oversell, overkill, regroup, do it again
_ has been running since the first visionary had to talk his way
into the hearts and minds of investors who knew a lot more about
money than they knew about technology.
</P>
<P>
   Remember artificial intelligence? Pen computing? Both were the
Next Big Thing _ hot investment targets that became big losers _ in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   How about CD-ROM's? In 1984 (and every year for more than 10
years after), they were destined to save the educational system and
revolutionize entertainment. Ditto for interactive television in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's E-commerce and the Internet and the Web. Obviously
the commercial Internet has been exponentially more successful than
artificial intelligence or CD-ROM's, but with the exception of a
few remarkable companies, products and services that have actually
changed the world, it has followed the same general course.
</P>
<P>
   And now the stocks are sliding and panic is spreading throughout
the sector.
</P>
<P>
   And whom do we have to thank? The omnipresent carpetbaggers we
know today as the dot-coms. The me-too companies _ and the venture
firms and investment banks who finance them and take them public.
They don't even pretend to be the next Netscape or Yahoo or Amazon,
most of them. They are just slip-streaming.
</P>
<P>
   E-tailing. E-trading. E-dating. E-pets. E-drugs. Streaming
media. Broadband applications, also known as dot-coms on steroids.
Cable modems. Interactive TV redux.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the carpetbaggers stick around long enough to ship a
product (if there even is one). Sometimes they don't.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few months or a year, when the company hasn't turned
profitable on a dime, they either sell it off or fold up their
tents and go home with whatever golden parachutes they have managed
to finagle for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving, of course, a pile of investors on the sidewalk with
empty pockets and bad attitudes about technology stocks. And
because today's investors are still so naive about technology
investing, the crash of the carpetbaggers paints the entire
industry with the broad brush of uncertainty and hucksterism.
</P>
<P>
   This has been true in every infinite loop of the volatile
technology industry. But the broad reach of the Internet, which
puts the industry's health at the itchy trigger finger of anyone
with a computer, a modem and an online trading account, magnifies
the effect of every shaky company and stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   As one prominent venture capitalist, Ann Winblad of Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners, says: ``We have to be so careful about
every single investment we make. One bad move, and all the rest of
them follow us down the rat hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all venture capitalists or investment bankers are so
circumspect or behave so responsibly. One prominent technology
executive who prefers to remain anonymous compares the venture pack
to narcotics dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have every incentive to keep shoveling new companies and
new shares out there as fast as the investors will buy them up, and
they have no incentive to try to talk investors down,'' the
executive said. ``I think they're mostly in the mode of raking in
the bucks as fast as possible while the getting is good and
assuming that it won't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, until the next time.

 &HT;    The guns next door
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Matt Alexander's 9-year-old daughter was playing
at a friend's house. When he went to pick her up, he noticed an
antique gun mounted on the living-room wall.
</P>
<P>
   After they went home, Alexander sat down with his daughter and
talked with her about gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you notice they had a gun?'' he asked her. She said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what to do if you find a gun in someone's house?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not touch it,'' his daughter answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right. Don't play with it,'' he told her. ``Stay away.
Don't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time, Alexander says, he'll probably have her friend over
at their home instead, or he and his wife might ask the other
parents some questions about gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   It's an awkward subject to bring up, he admits, because the
other parents might become ``embarrassed or defensive, and then if
you were in a conflict with them, you wouldn't want your kid over
there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With school shootings seemingly in the headlines every month,
and a growing awareness of the dangers of children and guns, more
parents are adding gun safety to their list of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   There are a multitude of worries parents can have when their
children are playing at someone else's home, but this one is
particularly scary. Every two hours, a child is killed with a gun,
according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, and gunshot wounds
cause one of every five admissions to pediatric trauma centers.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by images from thousands of movies, television shows and
video games, guns hold a fascination for children that other
dangerous items, such as kitchen knives or lawn equipment, don't
have. Pediatric experts warn parents to tell their children,
repeatedly if necessary, that in real life, children are killed and
hurt badly by guns.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, it is illegal to leave a loaded gun where someone
under 17 can find it if you haven't locked it up or otherwise
rendered it inoperable. Still, many parents find gun safety a
touchy subject to broach with other families.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pickhardt, a psychologist in private practice in Austin and
the author of several parenting books, suggests putting the
emphasis on yourself when asking other parents about guns in their
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say, `I'm probably being oversensitive, but it would
ease my mind to be able to clear this with you,' '' Pickhardt
advises. ``Say, `I know this may sound a little out of bounds, but
with all the stuff that's been happening, I want to know if you
have guns and what kind of security they are kept under.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Gun safety is ``not a hard hazard to ask about,'' Pickhardt
says. ``It's not like asking if they abuse alcohol or drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are not comfortable with their answers _ if the other
adult says, ``We own guns but the kids don't know where they are,
so they're not locked,'' or something else that makes you nervous _
simply thank them for their time and let your child know that he
can have his friend over at your home, but you are not comfortable
having him play over there.
</P>
<P>
   It's also crucial, Pickhardt says, to educate your child about
gun safety and other issues. A whole host of hazards could reside
in a home your child visits, from drugs and alcohol to
inappropriate movies and games. Tell your children that if they
encounter something hazardous or dangerous, they need to avoid it
while they're there, and let you know about it when they come home,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents feel that the most crucial element in keeping your
children safe around guns is educating them. A child who knows how
to use a gun, who realizes how dangerous it is, who has been
schooled by his or her parents in gun safety will keep themselves
safe, these parents say. And their children agree.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Henry, 18, recently graduated from high school and will be
a freshman at St. Edward's University this fall. She and her
siblings, Katie, 11, and James, 9, were taught how to use, take
apart and assemble a gun as young children. Erin says she can't
remember not knowing about gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents showed her ``how to use one, the consequences of
having one, what happens when you fire that gun,'' Erin says. ``I
grew up around a lot of police officers. I wish every parent would
teach their child the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, she remembers ``that if I pointed a fake orange gun
at someone,'' her father would take the toy away. ``We don't play
toy shooting at each other,'' he would tell her.
</P>
<P>
   Erin clearly remembers one of her family's police-officer
friends telling her and her siblings the dangers of toy guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was dark and you pointed a toy gun at me, and I didn't
know it was a toy, you could get hurt,'' the officer told them.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Swanson, Erin's mother, learned how to use a gun from her
own father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in my family hunts, but we had five guns in the
house,'' she says of her childhood. ``We knew what they were, what
they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson keeps a gun at home; her ex-husband also keeps guns in
his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had an incident,'' she says of her children and
firearms. ``It's not something they are ever allowed to touch. Our
children were appropriately taught, and they are very respectful of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for their friends, ``I'm sure my kids would feel
uncomfortable playing with someone who didn't respect guns, and
they would tell me about it,'' Swanson says.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, one of her younger children got into an argument at
school, and the other child said he was going to ``get a gun and
shoot'' Swanson's child. Swanson told the other child's parents, as
well as the police. Now that some time has passed, her child and
the boy are friends again, but ``I would not have that child over
to play,'' she says. ``I'm disappointed in how many children are
being raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Every six to eight weeks, Todd Maxson, a pediatric trauma
surgeon at the Children's Hospital of Austin, finds himself in the
sad situation of treating a child under 14 who is injured with a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard parents say the same thing over and over: ``I
didn't think the kids knew where the gun was,'' or ``I didn't think
it was loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children have an amazing amount of curiosity and
resourcefulness,'' Maxson says. ``They will be able to
circumnavigate halfhearted attempts at storage.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxson has discussed gun safety with adults in other households
where his children are playing _ including his wife's family
members, who are avid hunters and sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `This is an important safety issue for us,' '' Maxson
says. ``We'd like to be sure guns are stored properly.''
</P>
<P>
   He advises parents to think about gun safety the same way they
would any other product.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would ask families to be sure that your child wears a life
preserver if they were in their boat, that a dog was leashed around
small children or that electrical outlets were covered for
toddlers,'' he says. ``It's the same thing.''

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: A few months ago, it was reported that an Alabama jury
awarded a couple an enormous amount of money for the overcharging
of a satellite dish. What was the amount awarded? And what's the
status of the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: The amount awarded in May by a jury in Hale County, Ala., was
$581 million, of which $580 million was punitive damages. The
judgment is expected to be reduced drastically on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved door-to-door sale of $1,100 satellite dishes
which sold for $199 at stores. The plaintiffs claimed the scheme
preyed on the elderly and illiterate, and that the defendants used
credit card financing to conceal the number of payments due.
</P>
<P>
   But the jaw-dropping award raised the issue of whether huge
punitive damage awards should be restricted. It's a particularly
heated issue in Alabama, where critics say juries commonly dispense
``jackpot justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the $581 million award, the Alabama
Legislature has passed new tort reform laws which were signed by
Gov. Don Siegelman. Under the new laws, punitive damages in
non-bodily injury cases are limited to $500,000 or three times
compensatory damages, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   And suits may be filed only in the county where the injury took
place, where the plaintiff lived at the time of the injury, or
where the defendant has its main place of business. Formerly,
injured plaintiffs could move and file suit in what they considered
more ``friendly'' counties known for large verdicts and hostility
to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like thousands of others, I mourn the passing of Atlanta
Journal-Constitution columnist Celestine Sibley. Articles point out
that she was only the second woman to receive the Lifetime
Achievement Award from the National Society of Newspaper
Columnists. Who was the other?
</P>
<P>
   A: Molly Ivins, Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. These are all
the organization's winners: 1993, Herb Caen, San Francisco
Chronicle; 1994, Ivins; 1995, William Raspberry, Washington Post;
1996, Art Hoppe, San Francisco Chronicle; 1997, David Broder,
Washington Post; 1998, Richard Reeves, Universal Press; and 1999,
Celestine Sibley.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm distressed about the death of my favorite columnist,
Celestine Sibley of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. I have 15 of
her books and am always looking for others. Can you list all her
titles?
</P>
<P>
   A: Years published, titles and publishers:
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: A tourist attraction in Chattanooga, Tenn., uses the slogan
``See Seven States From Rock City.'' I can understand being able to
see Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and maybe North Carolina, but what
are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The other three are South Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky.
It's not just ``tourist hype'' that visitors can see all seven,
said Rock City Gardens spokeswoman Lydia Thompson, but she added
that conditions have to be right: clear skies, and knowing exactly
where to look, especially for the sometimes hard-to-see mountain
peaks in Kentucky and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that it's possible to have a star named for
someone. What is the procedure?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's simple. It can be done online at www.starregistry.com or
by calling 1-800-282-3333. The registry, a commercial venture based
in Illinois, was founded in 1979 by an astonomer in Canada. The
company emphasizes that people aren't buying stars, as some think;
they're simply buying a certificate saying a star has been named
for someone. Many people do it as a birthday or other gift, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``star kit'' includes a certificate bearing the chosen name
and telescopic coordinates for locating the star; a sky chart with
the chosen star circled for identification; and a booklet on
astronomy. The cost is $48 with an unframed certificate, $91
framed, plus shipping charges.
</P>
<P>
   Q : Being one of Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation''
prompts me to ask: How is the World War II Memorial in Washington
coming along?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still in the fund-raising stage. As specified in Public
Law 103-32, it will be funded almost entirely by private
contributions. The capital goal for donations is $100 million. As
of June, about $60 million had been raised from individual donors,
corporations and foundations, veterans' groups and associations.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will be on the Mall at the Rainbow Pool site at the
east end of the Reflecting Pool between the Lincoln Memorial and
Washington Monument. The site was dedicated on Veterans Day, Nov.
11, 1995. Groundbreaking is projected for Veterans Day, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 1-800-639-4992. Donations can be mailed to World
War II Memorial, P.O. Box 96766, Washington, DC 20090-6766, or can
be made online at www.wwiimemorial.com or www.WWIImemorial.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who makes the decision about recipients of the Presidential
Medal of Freedom? When was this medal established?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's entirely up to the president to decide who gets the
lustrous red, white and blue enameled medal, the nation's highest
award for civilian achievement.
</P>
<P>
   It was created by President Kennedy in 1963. According to
Congressional Quarterly's Guide to the Presidency, Kennedy wanted
to create an award for civilian achievement soon after he took
office in 1961. After considerable study, the White House decided
to revamp the existing, but little-used, Medal of Freedom, which
had been created by President Truman in 1945 to recognize
contributions to America's national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was assassinated before the first awards ceremony on
Dec. 6, 1963, but President Johnson and Kennedy's widow,
Jacqueline, decided that going ahead with the ceremony as scheduled
would help the nation begin the process of healing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's been a lot of publicity about a Toyota reaching the 1
million-mile mark. Does a Toyota's odometer really register that
high?
</P>
<P>
   A: Odometers on Toyota vehicles don't show 1 million miles, but
they indeed do go up to 999,999, said company spokesman Sam Butto
in Torrance, Calif. Then the odometers turn over to all zeros _ the
millionth mile. Butto said his company frequently gets letters from
people whose vehicles have registered 300,000 or more miles ``and
still are running great.''
</P>
<P>
   In the million-miler case, it was Douglasville, Ga., resident
Jim Jeter's 1982 Toyota Starlet reaching the milestone. He appeared
on ``The Late Show With David Letterman'' on Aug. 2. Earlier that
day, Jeter's car hit the magic number with a TV camera focused on
the odometer when it read 000,000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the Red Cross test for hepatitis B, thalassemia minor
and HIV before or after taking blood from a donor? How long does it
take to get the blood to patients?
</P>
<P>
   A: No blood center, including the American Red Cross, performs
tests for inherited blood disorders such as thalassemia major and
thalassemia minor, according to Red Cross spokeswoman Karen Eisele.
These tests can be performed easily by one's primary physician, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Red Cross does test blood for Hepatitis B, in
addition to a number of other potentially infectious viruses, such
as HIV. These tests are done on a sample from the blood after it
has been donated and are completed within 24 hours. With other
preparation, labeling and ``quality steps to ensure the safest
blood products,'' the majority of blood is available within 48
hours, Eisele said.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We haven't seen anything reported about the funeral of Mark
Barton, the Atlanta mass killer, or the disposition of his body. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Funeral arrangements were handled by his family at a private
service, according to the Cobb County (Ga.) medical examiner's
office. The burial site has not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When people don't pay their income taxes, I end up paying
more, so they are stealing from me. Is there a way to report
someone to the Internal Revenue Service?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. IRS spokesman Eric Roberts advises you to call the
agency's tax fraud hotline at 1-800-829-0433. The IRS, by the way,
pays the whistleblower up to 10 percent of the additional amount
it's able to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know you've printed information on this subject before, but
it's back. My daughter saw something on the Internet claiming that
a Procter &AMP; Gamble official, appearing on ``The Sally Jessy Raphael
Show,'' said the company is somehow involved with Satanism. The
Internet item said anyone who didn't believe it could send $3 to an
address and a transcript of the program would be sent to them. Do
you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't send any money to anyone. Rumors linking Procter &AMP;
Gamble and its moon and stars trademark with Satanism have been
circulating since 1980-81. A few years ago, it was said that the
president of P&AMP;G admitted on ``The Phil Donahue Show'' that the
story was true. The Donahue program quickly branded the tale a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wrinkle on the story involves Raphael. Her executive
producer, Maurice Tunick, has responded with this statement, dated
July 27: ``It seems impossible that the rumor of an appearance by
the president of Procter &AMP; Gamble on `The Sally Jessy Raphael Show'
is still circulating after more than a decade. There is absolutely
nothing to this rumor. The president of P&AMP;G has never appeared on
`The Sally Jessy Raphael Show,' nor has any other P&AMP;G executive.
Anyone who claims to have seen such a broadcast is either mistaken
or lying. It never happened!''
</P>
<P>
   Similiar denials of the rumor, in all its variations, have been
issued by Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP; Gamble itself; the General
Council of the Assemblies of God; the office of the archbishop of
the Archdiocese of Cincinnati; Liberty University and Jerry
Falwell; Phil Donahue; the Southern Baptist Convention; the
Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio; and the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association. Signed statements by all of them can be
viewed online at www.pg.com/rumor/ Procter &AMP; Gamble, by the way,
says it has filed 15 lawsuits, six against Amway distributors
accused of spreading the Satanism rumors. All were concluded in the
company's favor, according to P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports are warning of bean sprouts contaminated with
disease-causing bacteria. Would they be safe to eat if cooked? How
much nutritional value would they lose if stir-fried or steamed,
for instance?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bacteria doesn't seem to be destroyed by heat, so cooking
doesn't make contaminated sprouts safe, said Chris Rosenbloom,
Georgia State University nutritionist and a spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association. The people most at risk are those
with weakened immunity, such as those taking chemotherapy, the very
old and very young, and anyone with HIV, she added. Healthy people
wouldn't have a huge risk using small amounts of bean sprouts, for
example, on a sandwich or in stir-fry recipes.
</P>
<P>
   So far as nutritional values, any method of cooking would not
alter the nutrient content significantly. But sprouts aren't a
powerhouse of vitamins and minerals under any circumstance,
Rosenbloom said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Bruce Lindsey left the White House? We used to see him on
TV constantly with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A: Lindsey is still there. And he's still in the same position,
serving as deputy counsel to the president, said White House
spokeswoman Elizabeth Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the passenger ship United States. I
believe it was built as the luxury liner United States before World
War II, then was recommissioned as the West Point and converted
into a troop carrier. I crossed the Atlantic on it in 1944. Am I
correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, but the confusion is understandable. The blueprints for
the SS United States were developed by the naval architects Gibbs &AMP;
Cox in July 1945. The superliner's keel was laid in February 1950
and it first set sail in July 1952. It operated for 17 years,
making 800 crossings, before being retired. As reported, it's now
docked in Philadelphia, with an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   The ship that was renamed West Point _ the one you're referring
to _ originally was the America, and was owned by the same company
that later built the United States, said Ray Mann of the Navy
Historical Center. The United States replaced the America as the
company's flagship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At least several times a year, I find small, brown scorpions
in my house. What can you tell me about them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The scorpion found in the southeastern United States is the
common striped scorpion (Centruroides vittatus), said Beverly
Sparks, entomologist with the University of Georgia Cooperative
Extension Service. Its sting causes only temporary local pain,
tingling and itching, and some localized swelling or tenderness.
For most people the feeling is comparable to a bee sting. But,
Sparks added, an allergic response can result in some people and it
could be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Three baseball players were in the news recently for their
milestones: Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs for reaching the 3,000-hit
plateau, and Mark McGwire for hitting his 500th home run. These
feats bring Ted Williams to mind. I know he had 521 career home
runs. How close was he to getting 3,000 hits? What was his career
batting average? How much playing time did he miss serving his
country in World War II and Korea?
</P>
<P>
   A: Williams had 2,654 hits in 2,292 games in his 19 seasons with
the Boston Red Sox. His lifetime batting average: .344. His career
was interrupted twice by military service as a Marine Corps pilot.
He missed the 1943, 1944 and 1945 seasons during World War II, and
most of the 1952 and 1953 seasons during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article reported on the inaugural rally of the Southern
Party, a new political party proclaiming itself to be the
philosophical heir to the Confederate States of America. How can
someone contact it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several ways. Letters can be addressed to: Southern
Party, P.O. Box 2582, Chesterfield, VA 23832, or P.O. Box 8546,
Woodland, TX 77387. Or you can call Jerry Baxley, the party's first
vice chairman, at 804-675-7717. Online information can be found at
this Web site: www.southernparty.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son said he had heard of a comedian who made his living
reciting the poem ``Casey at the Bat'' while touring the country.
Do you know who that comedian was? And can you print the text of
the poem?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poem, by Ernest L. Thayer, first appeared in the June 3,
1888, San Francisco Examiner. It attracted little attention until
it was recited later that year by William DeWolf Hopper, a
Shakespearean actor, singer and comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper, the person your son is thinking about, went on to recite
the poem more than 10,000 times during his lifetime _ immortalizing
it to such an extent, in fact, that an early pamphlet version of
the poem had Hopper's photo on the cover, but didn't mention Thayer
at all. And Hopper's bust _ not Thayer's _ is at the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The poem, which over the years has appeared in many variations,
deals with a batter named Casey who strikes out at a crucial moment
in the game. ``Doing a Casey'' or ``pulling a Casey'' has become a
common term for one who fails in the manner of Casey.
</P>
<P>
   The poem is too long to reprint in its entirety, but here's the
last stanza, which is frequently quoted:
</P>
<P>
   Oh! Somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
</P>
<P>
   The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
</P>
<P>
   But there is no joy in Mudville _ mighty Casey had struck out.
</P>

<P>
   Q: A few months ago, it was reported that an Alabama jury
awarded a couple an enormous amount of money for the overcharging
of a satellite dish. What was the amount awarded? And what's the
status of the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: The amount awarded in May by a jury in Hale County, Ala., was
$581 million, of which $580 million was punitive damages. The
judgment is expected to be reduced drastically on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved door-to-door sale of $1,100 satellite dishes
which sold for $199 at stores. The plaintiffs claimed the scheme
preyed on the elderly and illiterate, and that the defendants used
credit card financing to conceal the number of payments due.
</P>
<P>
   But the jaw-dropping award raised the issue of whether huge
punitive damage awards should be restricted. It's a particularly
heated issue in Alabama, where critics say juries commonly dispense
``jackpot justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the $581 million award, the Alabama
Legislature has passed new tort reform laws which were signed by
Gov. Don Siegelman. Under the new laws, punitive damages in
non-bodily injury cases are limited to $500,000 or three times
compensatory damages, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   And suits may be filed only in the county where the injury took
place, where the plaintiff lived at the time of the injury, or
where the defendant has its main place of business. Formerly,
injured plaintiffs could move and file suit in what they considered
more ``friendly'' counties known for large verdicts and hostility
to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like thousands of others, I mourn the passing of Atlanta
Journal-Constitution columnist Celestine Sibley. Articles point out
that she was only the second woman to receive the Lifetime
Achievement Award from the National Society of Newspaper
Columnists. Who was the other?
</P>
<P>
   A: Molly Ivins, Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. These are all
the organization's winners: 1993, Herb Caen, San Francisco
Chronicle; 1994, Ivins; 1995, William Raspberry, Washington Post;
1996, Art Hoppe, San Francisco Chronicle; 1997, David Broder,
Washington Post; 1998, Richard Reeves, Universal Press; and 1999,
Celestine Sibley.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm distressed about the death of my favorite columnist,
Celestine Sibley of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. I have 15 of
her books and am always looking for others. Can you list all her
titles?
</P>
<P>
   A: Years published, titles and publishers:

</P>
<P>
   Q: A tourist attraction in Chattanooga, Tenn., uses the slogan
``See Seven States From Rock City.'' I can understand being able to
see Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and maybe North Carolina, but what
are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The other three are South Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky.
It's not just ``tourist hype'' that visitors can see all seven,
said Rock City Gardens spokeswoman Lydia Thompson, but she added
that conditions have to be right: clear skies, and knowing exactly
where to look, especially for the sometimes hard-to-see mountain
peaks in Kentucky and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that it's possible to have a star named for
someone. What is the procedure?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's simple. It can be done online at www.starregistry.com or
by calling 1-800-282-3333. The registry, a commercial venture based
in Illinois, was founded in 1979 by an astonomer in Canada. The
company emphasizes that people aren't buying stars, as some think;
they're simply buying a certificate saying a star has been named
for someone. Many people do it as a birthday or other gift, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``star kit'' includes a certificate bearing the chosen name
and telescopic coordinates for locating the star; a sky chart with
the chosen star circled for identification; and a booklet on
astronomy. The cost is $48 with an unframed certificate, $91
framed, plus shipping charges.
</P>
<P>
   Q : Being one of Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation''
prompts me to ask: How is the World War II Memorial in Washington
coming along?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still in the fund-raising stage. As specified in Public
Law 103-32, it will be funded almost entirely by private
contributions. The capital goal for donations is $100 million. As
of June, about $60 million had been raised from individual donors,
corporations and foundations, veterans' groups and associations.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will be on the Mall at the Rainbow Pool site at the
east end of the Reflecting Pool between the Lincoln Memorial and
Washington Monument. The site was dedicated on Veterans Day, Nov.
11, 1995. Groundbreaking is projected for Veterans Day, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 1-800-639-4992. Donations can be mailed to World
War II Memorial, P.O. Box 96766, Washington, DC 20090-6766, or can
be made online at www.wwiimemorial.com or www.WWIImemorial.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who makes the decision about recipients of the Presidential
Medal of Freedom? When was this medal established?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's entirely up to the president to decide who gets the
lustrous red, white and blue enameled medal, the nation's highest
award for civilian achievement.
</P>
<P>
   It was created by President Kennedy in 1963. According to
Congressional Quarterly's Guide to the Presidency, Kennedy wanted
to create an award for civilian achievement soon after he took
office in 1961. After considerable study, the White House decided
to revamp the existing, but little-used, Medal of Freedom, which
had been created by President Truman in 1945 to recognize
contributions to America's national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was assassinated before the first awards ceremony on
Dec. 6, 1963, but President Johnson and Kennedy's widow,
Jacqueline, decided that going ahead with the ceremony as scheduled
would help the nation begin the process of healing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's been a lot of publicity about a Toyota reaching the 1
million-mile mark. Does a Toyota's odometer really register that
high?
</P>
<P>
   A: Odometers on Toyota vehicles don't show 1 million miles, but
they indeed do go up to 999,999, said company spokesman Sam Butto
in Torrance, Calif. Then the odometers turn over to all zeros _ the
millionth mile. Butto said his company frequently gets letters from
people whose vehicles have registered 300,000 or more miles ``and
still are running great.''
</P>
<P>
   In the million-miler case, it was Douglasville, Ga., resident
Jim Jeter's 1982 Toyota Starlet reaching the milestone. He appeared
on ``The Late Show With David Letterman'' on Aug. 2. Earlier that
day, Jeter's car hit the magic number with a TV camera focused on
the odometer when it read 000,000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the Red Cross test for hepatitis B, thalassemia minor
and HIV before or after taking blood from a donor? How long does it
take to get the blood to patients?
</P>
<P>
   A: No blood center, including the American Red Cross, performs
tests for inherited blood disorders such as thalassemia major and
thalassemia minor, according to Red Cross spokeswoman Karen Eisele.
These tests can be performed easily by one's primary physician, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Red Cross does test blood for Hepatitis B, in
addition to a number of other potentially infectious viruses, such
as HIV. These tests are done on a sample from the blood after it
has been donated and are completed within 24 hours. With other
preparation, labeling and ``quality steps to ensure the safest
blood products,'' the majority of blood is available within 48
hours, Eisele said.

COMPUTING POWER PUTS VIDEO GAMES IN TELEVISION'S LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNABY, British Columbia _ Liam Neeson, meet Eddie Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, a player for Major League Soccer's D.C. United team, may
not be as well known as Neeson. But both men are stars in
blockbuster high-technology features that have each earned well
over $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Pope's case, though, the feature is not a big summer film
like ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' but a
best-selling video game: FIFA Soccer, currently the most popular
title from Electronic Arts Inc., the world's largest maker of video
games. Pope spent a day here in the company's new $3.2-million
motion-capture studio in early August, going through his moves for
the next version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to technologies like motion capture, video games
are expanding beyond their male teen-age stronghold into an
increasingly mainstream form of entertainment. In fact, the
$6.3-billion North American computer and video game industry is
closing in on Hollywood box-office revenues, which reached $6.95
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment is the 6,000-pound gorilla in the American
home,'' said Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a San
Francisco market research firm. ``Motion capture is important
because it adds more interesting experiences that will broaden the
reach of the game industry.''
</P>
<P>
   To improve the reality in virtual reality, producers of popular
video games _ whether sports titles like FIFA Soccer and
Activision's Jack Nicklaus game or fantasy shooter games like Eidos
Interactive's Tomb Raider series _ have turned to human actors like
Pope. Last year, for example, Westwood Studios used motion capture
sequences from more than 100 actors for its video-game version of
the movie ``Blade Runner,'' including many of the film's original
cast members.
</P>
<P>
   And among the game makers, access to increasing computing power
for both video games and PC's is touching off a new race toward
realism. In this latest version of FIFA Soccer, for instance, the
producers were able to increase the video speed to 26 frames a
second for the Sony Playstation from 21. In comparison,
conventional television runs at 30 frames a second, while most
movies are shown at 24 frames a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where the visual resolution of our products
will soon surpass television,'' said Don Mattrick, a software game
pioneer who is now head of the Electronic Arts production studios.
``That will take our products into mainstream culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Arts, which uses motion capture for more than a dozen
sports titles and many of its other games, is seen as the leader in
this field _ in aesthetics as well as in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put motion capture in a larger context,'' said
Steve Eshkenazi, a veteran video game analyst who is now a partner
at Walden Media and Information, a technology and media investment
fund in San Francisco. ``Electronic Arts understands that it won't
replace great game play, but they have developed the ability to
create digital actors to enhance the game brands they have
created.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Electronic Arts is a Silicon Valley company, with
headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., its production studio is in this
suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, which is also home to a
thriving film industry. It was here, in the early 1980s, that
Mattrick founded Distinctive Software, one of the first PC game
companies, which was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the company's production talent was already
based here, Electronic Arts built its new studio in Burnaby last
year rather than ask its programmers and artists to move to San
Mateo. Already, the company says, the Burnaby studio is the most
productive and profitable of the dozen development studios the
company has scattered among five countries.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the raw material of FIFA Soccer resembles shooting a
scene for an action film. Garbed in a black body suit dotted with
silver reflective spheres the size of table tennis balls, Pope
looks like an alien. On a 40-square-foot patch of real grass that
has been laid in the studio for the day's shoot, he goes through
his moves, performing headers and deeks (soccer jargon for feints
or fakes). Strobe lights pulse 240 times a second as 10 specially
designed high-resolution cameras break Pope's fluid moves into
digital snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   While he kicks soccer balls into a net, two programmers watch
through the large window separating the studio from their control
room as Pope's motion data stream into a row of Silicon Graphics
work stations and other machines.
</P>
<P>
   On one monitor a small cluster of lights moves like a balletic
constellation of stars, tracking the player's movements as an
assistant tosses him a ball. Pope performs a slashing header, then
falls and rolls on a cushioned mat. Next, imagining a winning goal
scored, he springs up and bounds away in a celebratory run, arms
spread like an airplane, as if ready to hug an unseen teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the work station has translated this
sequence into movements depicted by a three-dimensional stick
figure that repeats the header, roll and victory dance _ the
kinetic architectural framework on which computer graphics artists
will build a video animation mimicking Pope's athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes from no more than 20 points of light on the
screen, which have extracted the essence of his motion and given
the stick figure dance a remarkably lifelike fluidity. The digital
motion-capture files will now become the raw material for game
designers whose job it is to extend the illusion by enhancing the
skeletal renderings with flesh, clothing and facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eye is remarkably sensitive to motion,'' said David
Pierce, a special effects engineer who manages the studio. ``It
creates a powerful illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although motion capture technology was invented in the 1970s, it
was not until the early '90s that the processing power of video
game consoles began making it worth the cost and effort of
recording human movements for games. Current consoles from Sony,
Nintendo and Sega use 32-bit processors, and all three companies
have faster 64-bit consoles in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Arts FIFA team is eagerly awaiting this next
generation of machines, like the Sony Playstation II, which will be
introduced in Japan later this year. On that machine, the number of
polygons _ elements in the basic wire mesh used to create
three-dimensional human figures available to programmers _ will
exceed 10,000 for an individual figure, compared with 250 polygons
a player on current consoles. With that level of resolution,
programmers would be able to depict movement in a soccer player's
hair as he or she runs.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the current generation of game consoles,
Electronic Arts programmers are finding new ways to enhance the
illusory effects. FIFA 2000, to be released in November, relies
heavily on Pope's on-field movements, for example, but it also
exploits the more subliminal component of sound in an effort to
make game players feel that they are actually in a stadium watching
a game in progress.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it is ready for release this fall, the new version
will use the recorded words of 27 different announcers in nine
languages speaking 85,000 scripted words. Different disks will be
sold in different countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three programmers responsible for sound and music are
seeking a leap in realism by using only complete prerecorded
phrases; in the past, the game's announcers have sounded robotic as
certain phrases are patched together from a library of words.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the game will add predictive speech by the announcers
_ phrases like ``waiting in the middle cross'' that anticipate the
action _ as well as sentences indicating an awareness of earlier
developments in the game. The number of goals a player has already
scored, for example, might prompt the programmed announcer to say,
``Ah! He's made his hat trick!'' when the player scores a third
one.
</P>
<P>
   The sound designers have also programmed in more crowd chants
and various spectator sounds that will be more responsive to the
game in progress. As Kerry Whalen, one of the FIFA producers,
observed, ``If you just scored your 19th goal against Lichtenstein,
the crowd isn't going to be very excited.''

<P>
   Q: We haven't seen anything reported about the funeral of Mark
Barton, the Atlanta mass killer, or the disposition of his body. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Funeral arrangements were handled by his family at a private
service, according to the Cobb County (Ga.) medical examiner's
office. The burial site has not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When people don't pay their income taxes, I end up paying
more, so they are stealing from me. Is there a way to report
someone to the Internal Revenue Service?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. IRS spokesman Eric Roberts advises you to call the
agency's tax fraud hotline at 1-800-829-0433. The IRS, by the way,
pays the whistleblower up to 10 percent of the additional amount
it's able to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know you've printed information on this subject before, but
it's back. My daughter saw something on the Internet claiming that
a Procter &AMP; Gamble official, appearing on ``The Sally Jessy Raphael
Show,'' said the company is somehow involved with Satanism. The
Internet item said anyone who didn't believe it could send $3 to an
address and a transcript of the program would be sent to them. Do
you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't send any money to anyone. Rumors linking Procter &AMP;
Gamble and its moon and stars trademark with Satanism have been
circulating since 1980-81. A few years ago, it was said that the
president of P&AMP;G admitted on ``The Phil Donahue Show'' that the
story was true. The Donahue program quickly branded the tale a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wrinkle on the story involves Raphael. Her executive
producer, Maurice Tunick, has responded with this statement, dated
July 27: ``It seems impossible that the rumor of an appearance by
the president of Procter &AMP; Gamble on `The Sally Jessy Raphael Show'
is still circulating after more than a decade. There is absolutely
nothing to this rumor. The president of P&AMP;G has never appeared on
`The Sally Jessy Raphael Show,' nor has any other P&AMP;G executive.
Anyone who claims to have seen such a broadcast is either mistaken
or lying. It never happened!''
</P>
<P>
   Similiar denials of the rumor, in all its variations, have been
issued by Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP; Gamble itself; the General
Council of the Assemblies of God; the office of the archbishop of
the Archdiocese of Cincinnati; Liberty University and Jerry
Falwell; Phil Donahue; the Southern Baptist Convention; the
Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio; and the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association. Signed statements by all of them can be
viewed online at www.pg.com/rumor/ Procter &AMP; Gamble, by the way,
says it has filed 15 lawsuits, six against Amway distributors
accused of spreading the Satanism rumors. All were concluded in the
company's favor, according to P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports are warning of bean sprouts contaminated with
disease-causing bacteria. Would they be safe to eat if cooked? How
much nutritional value would they lose if stir-fried or steamed,
for instance?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bacteria doesn't seem to be destroyed by heat, so cooking
doesn't make contaminated sprouts safe, said Chris Rosenbloom,
Georgia State University nutritionist and a spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association. The people most at risk are those
with weakened immunity, such as those taking chemotherapy, the very
old and very young, and anyone with HIV, she added. Healthy people
wouldn't have a huge risk using small amounts of bean sprouts, for
example, on a sandwich or in stir-fry recipes.
</P>
<P>
   So far as nutritional values, any method of cooking would not
alter the nutrient content significantly. But sprouts aren't a
powerhouse of vitamins and minerals under any circumstance,
Rosenbloom said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Bruce Lindsey left the White House? We used to see him on
TV constantly with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A: Lindsey is still there. And he's still in the same position,
serving as deputy counsel to the president, said White House
spokeswoman Elizabeth Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the passenger ship United States. I
believe it was built as the luxury liner United States before World
War II, then was recommissioned as the West Point and converted
into a troop carrier. I crossed the Atlantic on it in 1944. Am I
correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, but the confusion is understandable. The blueprints for
the SS United States were developed by the naval architects Gibbs &AMP;
Cox in July 1945. The superliner's keel was laid in February 1950
and it first set sail in July 1952. It operated for 17 years,
making 800 crossings, before being retired. As reported, it's now
docked in Philadelphia, with an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   The ship that was renamed West Point _ the one you're referring
to _ originally was the America, and was owned by the same company
that later built the United States, said Ray Mann of the Navy
Historical Center. The United States replaced the America as the
company's flagship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At least several times a year, I find small, brown scorpions
in my house. What can you tell me about them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The scorpion found in the southeastern United States is the
common striped scorpion (Centruroides vittatus), said Beverly
Sparks, entomologist with the University of Georgia Cooperative
Extension Service. Its sting causes only temporary local pain,
tingling and itching, and some localized swelling or tenderness.
For most people the feeling is comparable to a bee sting. But,
Sparks added, an allergic response can result in some people and it
could be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Three baseball players were in the news recently for their
milestones: Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs for reaching the 3,000-hit
plateau, and Mark McGwire for hitting his 500th home run. These
feats bring Ted Williams to mind. I know he had 521 career home
runs. How close was he to getting 3,000 hits? What was his career
batting average? How much playing time did he miss serving his
country in World War II and Korea?
</P>
<P>
   A: Williams had 2,654 hits in 2,292 games in his 19 seasons with
the Boston Red Sox. His lifetime batting average: .344. His career
was interrupted twice by military service as a Marine Corps pilot.
He missed the 1943, 1944 and 1945 seasons during World War II, and
most of the 1952 and 1953 seasons during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article reported on the inaugural rally of the Southern
Party, a new political party proclaiming itself to be the
philosophical heir to the Confederate States of America. How can
someone contact it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several ways. Letters can be addressed to: Southern
Party, P.O. Box 2582, Chesterfield, VA 23832, or P.O. Box 8546,
Woodland, TX 77387. Or you can call Jerry Baxley, the party's first
vice chairman, at 804-675-7717. Online information can be found at
this Web site: www.southernparty.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son said he had heard of a comedian who made his living
reciting the poem ``Casey at the Bat'' while touring the country.
Do you know who that comedian was? And can you print the text of
the poem?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poem, by Ernest L. Thayer, first appeared in the June 3,
1888, San Francisco Examiner. It attracted little attention until
it was recited later that year by William DeWolf Hopper, a
Shakespearean actor, singer and comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper, the person your son is thinking about, went on to recite
the poem more than 10,000 times during his lifetime _ immortalizing
it to such an extent, in fact, that an early pamphlet version of
the poem had Hopper's photo on the cover, but didn't mention Thayer
at all. And Hopper's bust _ not Thayer's _ is at the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The poem, which over the years has appeared in many variations,
deals with a batter named Casey who strikes out at a crucial moment
in the game. ``Doing a Casey'' or ``pulling a Casey'' has become a
common term for one who fails in the manner of Casey.
</P>
<P>
   The poem is too long to reprint in its entirety, but here's the
last stanza, which is frequently quoted:
</P>
<P>
   Oh! Somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
</P>
<P>
   The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
</P>
<P>
   But there is no joy in Mudville _ mighty Casey had struck out.

 &HT;    Hall turning heads at Bengals camp
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ The kids leaning over the railing in the
bleachers at Georgetown College's Rawlings Stadium scream his name:
``Cor-eee! Cor-eee! Can I have your autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   Bengals safety Cory Hall signs everything shoved his way . . .
including Corey Dillon and Corey Sawyer football cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' he said, laughing at the mistaken I.D.
``Hopefully, one day, they'll know I'm Cory Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 210-pound rookie third-round draft pick from Fresno
State is turning heads at training camp with his explosive speed
and smooth moves _ just like he did at the NFL Combine in February.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts picked him to be a seventh rounder or as a
non-drafted free agent because they doubted he could make a quick
transition from the Western Athletic Conference to the NFL. Now
it's payback time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're going to see from Cory Hall is better play than
what a lot of people expected,'' he said. ``I've got a lot of
people to prove wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a lack of name recognition. When you toil for Fresno
State, you have to kick, fight, scratch and claw for national
attention. Hall didn't get much respect until the pro scouts
visited. What did they see?
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy that's aggressive to the ball and a flat-out
playmaker,'' he said. ``You're getting a guy that's 210 pounds
running just as good as the cornerbacks out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengals head coach Bruce Coslet said, ``We were criticized when
we took him because there were some bigger name safeties still
there. But that's why we go out scouting. We liked him. He's fast,
and a good tackler. He's a tough guy. He'll hit you.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's helped him is that he was in a similar defense in
college. I'm sure the calls are different. But the principals (of
the 3-4) are the same with the zone blitzes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengals director of pro/college personnel Jim Lippincott raves
about Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's decisive, diagnoses things well and reacts correctly,''
he said. ``He's been everything we expected and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is second string behind Greg Myers, but a starting job
isn't that far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process you have to go through,'' he said. ``I
understand that. I'm not the kind of guy that's revengeful and
hateful. I'll sit back and wait my turn. But eventually . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Hall didn't finish the thought. He was too busy signing Corey
Dillon and Corey Sawyer football cards.

 &HT;    Peaches are ripe for the picking
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peel, pit and eat. It's the best part of summer.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking peaches, and that means juicy peaches. If you're
still buying California peaches at the supermarket, you're missing
the point. Local fruit is truly tree-ripened.
</P>
<P>
   When the peaches are this good, you don't have to do much to
them. Just make sure they're perfectly ripe by putting them in a
paper bag for a day or two. After eating some out of hand,
preferably over the kitchen sink, it's time to gild the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Here are four peachy ideas to gussy up the harvest with a
minimum investment of time. The only thing that takes a bit of work
is peeling the peaches. To make that easy as can be, drop them in a
pan of boiling water for just 10 seconds. Then the peel can be
slipped off with a flick of the knife.
</P>
<P>
   It only takes a couple minutes to slice or chop the peaches.
Taste and add a bit of sugar if they're not quite sweet enough to
suit you. And, if it's going to be a while until dinner, squeeze a
little lemon juice over them so they don't turn brown.
</P>
<P>
   All you need for a fine finale is some ice cream or pound cake,
or a pint of blackberries as a partner. Or pick up a split of
inexpensive (translate that as not-too-dry champagne). Pop the cork
and pour over the peaches and celebrate summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fill a champagne glass with sliced peaches. Pour champagne,
Asti Spumante or any other sparkling wine over and serve while it's
bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Layer blackberries, diced peaches and freshly whipped cream in
a wine goblet. Sprinkle with toasted almonds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spoon sliced or diced peaches over scoops of top quality
vanilla or peach ice cream. Pour a shot of hazelnut liquor
(Frangelico) over the top and scatter chopped toasted hazelnuts on
top.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drape sliced, sweetened peaches over slices of pound cake or
angle food cake. Drizzle with warm caramel sauce.

AMERICA ONLINE REMAINS NO. 1 BUT GROWTH SLOWS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online is the undisputed king of Internet service
providers, having added 5.1 million members in the last year alone,
for a total of more than 17 million subscribers. But its growth
rate masks a remarkable trend: The company's share of the Internet
access market is no longer growing as it once was; it may in fact
be declining.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet service providers, or ISPs, rather than
consolidating around America Online, Microsoft and telephone
companies like AT&AMP;T as many industry observers had predicted,
remains a diverse industry with wide-open possibilities for
competitors, including mom-and-pop operations.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's monthly subscription plan, meanwhile, is now
just one of many business models for Internet access, and new
models seem to pop up weekly. Free access, often supported by
advertising, has taken root in Europe and is spreading to the
United States. And hardware manufacturers are teaming up with ISPs
to offer a range of discounted plans.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that America Online remains the leader of the
pack. The nearest competitors, Worldnet from AT&AMP;T and MSN from
Microsoft, have fewer than 2 million members each. But research
firms generally agree that America Online's market share is not
growing the way it has in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the wide-open nature of the Internet access market
is the beleaguered state of MSN. Its membership numbers are flat
and Microsoft admits that it is losing market share, although it
declined to release exact numbers. The company plans to beef up its
marketing budget and make a run at big growth later this summer,
said William Diefenbach, group product manager for MSN Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent _ and, in some circles, unexpected _ growth of
small local ISPs continues to make for a complex market.
</P>
<P>
   Boardwatch Magazine, a widely circulated trade journal, reports
that its directory of ISPs in Canada, the United States and the
Caribbean grew 36 percent between last October and July, to 6,511
from 4,800. Greg Tally, editor of the directory, said the increase
was partly the result of existing service providers' registering
with the directory for the first time, but he added that many were
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are plenty of up-and-coming ISPs,'' he said.
``It's still exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   Most service providers are relatively small, serving several
hundred dial-up customers, Tally said. Boardwatch reports that of
the ISPs in its directory today, fully 5,895 offer local access
numbers in fewer than 25 area codes, whereas only 616 are available
in more than 25 area codes, meaning they are accessible to users on
a regional or national basis.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers may be misleading, because some small service
providers primarily serve local businesses rather than dial-up
customers like the average Web surfer. But both Tally and MSN's
Diefenbach said the small ISPs remained a powerful force in the
dial-up market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen, in aggregate, the smaller and local and regional
ISPs gaining share,'' Diefenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Access Internet Communications Inc., a small service provider
with several thousand customers in Cupertino, Calif., says it has
seen its dial-up subscriber base grow by 25 percent a year. James
Thomatos, the company's vice president of sales and marketing, said
the demand for access was so great that there were plenty of new
customers to be shared among ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   But he said small service providers were also attracting
customers because they offered more personalized service than the
big services. ``When you call here, someone answers the phone,'' he
said. ``Have you ever tried to do business with the phone company?
It's not the easiest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the market are efforts to offer free
Internet access, a concept already popular in Europe and making its
first major wave in the United States with a company called Netzero
Inc. In the last six months, Netzero, based in West Lake Village,
Calif., has grown faster than any other service provider in the
country, with the exception of America Online. Last October it had
100,000 subscribers. It now claims 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We add one every 13 seconds,'' said Mark Goldston, the
company's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Netzero plans to make money by showing targeted advertisements
in a box that is always present on its subscribers' screens.
Netzero filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July
14 for an initial public offering of stock, which is likely to take
place before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista, a search engine and portal owned by Compaq Computer,
last Thursday began offering free, ad-supported Internet service.
The company will use the service to drive traffic to its Web sites,
increasing advertising income. Even Microsoft has recently talked
about offering cheap or free access, but it has not disclosed solid
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, some of whom have expressed skepticism about
the idea of free access in the past, say the idea's time may have
come. ``The price is going toward zero,'' said Drew Ianni, an
analyst for Jupiter Communications, a New York-based market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of businesses are offering free computers as an
enticement to sign subscribers up for Internet service, but this
model is unproven. In a variation on this theme, Microworkz.com
Corp. is selling a computer for $299 with a year of free Internet
access included. After its partnership with Earthlink Network Inc.
fell apart amid an exchange of lawsuits earlier this month,
Microworkz teamed up with AT&AMP;T to provide the Internet-access part
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ianni says that consolidation is imminent and that AT&AMP;T, America
Online or MSN will begin to snap up large ISPs like Earthlink and
Mindspring Enterprises Inc. ``We're in the lull before a firestorm
of acquisitions,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Market research firms cannot agree on whether the market share
of industry leaders is dipping, rising slightly or holding steady.
One firm, Cahners In-Stat Group, reported this month that America
Online's market share dipped over the last year to 21.5 percent
from 24.3 percent. It estimated the total number of Internet
accounts in the United States at 66 million.
</P>
<P>
   IDC, another market research firm, estimates that America
Online's market share has dropped to 39.3 percent from 42.1 percent
in the last year, and that MSN dropped to 4 percent from 5.9
percent. It puts the size of the Internet access market at just 37
million accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schuler, president of America Online's interactive
services group, said its ``market share has been steady.'' He
argued that it was a testimony to the online service's strength
that no other major ISP had broken out of the pack to claim even a
strong second place.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler added that America Online, which charges $22 a month for
unlimited access, does not feel threatened by the free services. He
said he did not believe they could attract enough advertising to
make the business profitable. ``It's not a business model,'' he
said.

a Norse Viking named Glome stood nearly 1,400 years ago. Glome
painstakingly etched an inscription on this billboard-size rock in
Old Norse runes, which are alphabet characters formerly used by
ancient Europeans. Columbus, who never set foot in North America,

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Gizmos 98 may have a useful one for you 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gizmos 98 is another one of those packages which, we are led to
believe, contain all the good stuff that Microsoft forgot to put
into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. Depends upon what you want out of life, what you
want out of your computer, and whether you, like Play Inc., which
published this program, are chiefly interested in graphics. But to
take Microsoft's view, you've got to stop somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, there is one thing, or group of things, in this
package which Microsoft might well have put into the Windows
accessory package, and that's a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Gizmos gives us a bunch of calendars _ weekly, monthly, yearly
and a single day. (Why a single day? Well, because that's how you
make and save your appointments.) My problem with the calendars is
my main problem with the whole thing _ they're ugly. But then, what
do I know?
</P>
<P>
   All right, let's enumerate all the things that Play Inc. thinks
Microsoft cheated us out of with Windows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Picture Explorer, which displays in thumbnail form all the
pictures in your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   _ A programmable CD music player.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four different clocks, each fancier and uglier than the last.
</P>
<P>
   _ All those calendars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six different card games, including ``Freecell'' and
solitaire. I prefer Windows' versions. I never heard of the other
four.
</P>
<P>
   _ A stupid jigsaw puzzle game. All jigsaw puzzle games are
stupid, by definition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four calculators, each more complicated than the last. Not too
ugly, though.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program called Performer, which you can use to turn all
those pictures in your computer into a slide show, with fancy
effects and sound. Neat if you like that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ An incredibly annoying screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   _ A much-less-annoying screen saver that sends 360-degree
scenics scrolling across your screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ A color organ screen saver that adapts its incredibly annoying
pulsations to whatever music your programmable CD player is
playing.
</P>
<P>
   _ A video cube screen saver which will rotate a cube covered
with photographs of a young lady who is billed as the co-founder of
Play Inc.
</P>
<P>
   _ A security device called a Vault, into which you may drop
files and then password-lock the vault. Could be useful.
</P>
<P>
   _ A file shredder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you think all that might be worth $50, go to
www.play.com and check it out further.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail: jwarner(at)ajc.com

   We want to hear from you but can't acknowledge every message.

<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bad news, ladies and
gentlemen. The airlines _ those good folks who delay your flight
when the plane's not full and then leave your luggage behind _ have
been fiddling around with your derriere. What I mean, specifically,
is that if you have to fly somewhere _ say to a convention in
Topeka next May or your class reunion in the year 2010 _ you might
want to start slimming down. Now. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ POTEAU MOUNTAIN, Okla. _ I am standing in this
mountain valley before this huge rock in the exact same spot where
a Norse Viking named Glome stood nearly 1,400 years ago. Glome
painstakingly etched an inscription on this billboard-size rock in
Old Norse runes, which are alphabet characters formerly used by
ancient Europeans. Columbus, who never set foot in North America,
has parades in his honor in American cities while Glome and his
pre-Columbian Norsemen buddies were carving ``No trespassing''
signs on rocks in eastern Oklahoma hundreds of years before
Columbus was born. Some people can't catch a break. (Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Precautions can keep hackers out of your hard drive 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had a sure way of knowing when it was vacation time when I
lived in Oregon. My best friends _ Marcus and Betsy _ would start
looking for the keys to their house.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily they didn't lock the doors. It was that kind of a
town, a small place nestled in a little valley that ought to have
been on a postcard. It was if ``Leave It to Beaver'' were real.
Folks didn't need to lock their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet used to be that way. But it has grown from a little
electronic community of people who either knew each other, or at
least had a lot in common, into a busy world that mirrors the
world, complete with saints, crooks and average folks. Nowadays
it's the sort of place where a person should lock the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Progress _ as it sometimes does _ has made things worse. More
and more of us, me included, are using connections like cable
modems that stay online 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the downside to that progress, you need to
understand how an Internet connection works. When you are logged on
to the Net through your provider, your computer is assigned an
address. Like addresses in the world of ``Leave It to Beaver,'' it
is a way for others to find you.
</P>
<P>
   My sermon for today is: There are some people out there who you
don't want to find you.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of addresses on the Net. One is called
dynamic _ it changes each time you log on. If you connect with a
regular analog modem over telephone lines, chances are that you
have a dynamic address.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a static address. For people who connect over cable
modems or other full-time connections, that's often the kind you
get. That address never changes.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care?
</P>
<P>
   To break into your computer, a person needs to know your
address. Without it, there's no way. If you have an address that
changes each time you log on, a would-be cracker has only a limited
amount of time to figure a way into your computer. By the time he
does, you're offline. Next time you log on, you have a different
address.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer stays at the same address day and night, that
makes things easier. There are crackers who collect these permanent
addresses and _ sometimes just for the heck of it _ try to figure a
way into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of someone breaking into your computer are still
slim, but the odds of break-ins are going up.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, there are a lot of ``cookbook crackers'' who find
step-by-step directions for breaking into computers on the Net and
blindly follow them. The odds of a break-in have increased from
roughly the chances of winning the lottery to about the same as
having someone break into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to prevent a break-in is to create a fire wall by
using a program designed for computer networks that provides a
security barrier against break-ins. As more and more of us go
online full time, increasing the chances of computer break-ins,
home fire walls are going to become more important.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of good networking programs are out there; one that seems
popular is called Wingate 3.0. It's also affordable _ about $40 for
three users.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this program _ and others like it _ are really
intended to be used on a network of home computers, they can be
used on a single machine, and have a built-in fire wall that will
help provide protection from invasion.
</P>
<P>
   You can read more about it on the Web at www.wingate
</P>
<P>
   .com/.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, if you decide to use it, it'll add another layer of
complexity to your computing. I wish we could just ignore that
stuff. But then, I also wish that I didn't need to lock my doors at
home.

at CNN/U.S., he has changed the corporate culture and the network's
on-air look, although not its ratings as much as he would like. Not
everyone at CNN likes the changes, but having survived Tailwind and
bested Lou Dobbs, it appears that Kaplan will continue to mold the

afternoons by 5 p.m. EDT. Keying to the Monday wrestling events,
It's good for publication any day through Sunday. Here are the
elements on the page, which are also moving on the entertainment
wire:
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING-SLAM _ Look ahead to WWF Summerslam PPV and Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura's role. Should he be doing this, reports on net
that he is receiving more than the $100,000 he's giving to charity.
How will this effect his run for presidency? w/chart on predicted
outcomes
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING-ROADWILD _ Look back at WCW's Road Wild PPV. Hogan is
in a 'career' match, if he loses his wrestling 'career' is over. It
looks like he may lose because he is struggling with a
hyperextended knee injury and needs the time off a loss would give
him. But will this happen? We'll know Sat. night. Also, WCW doesn't
travel well to Sturgis, many wrestlers took motorcycles and had
accidents and incidents on the way, so which could effect who
actually wrestles. This will probably be the last free (for the
fans in attendance) Road Wild for WCW. Combo with Bret Hart's
return to wrestling on Monday night nitro (to followup on our
should he stay, should he go story). (Allen, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING-GETREAL _ Test, former Motley Crew body guard turned
wrestler and boyfriend of WWF owner's daughter. (Atlanta

   WRESTLING-LOOKALIKE _ Kane, a.k.a. Diesel and Isaac Yankem.

   WRESTLING-TOP10 _ We'll give an update and ask for more
responses. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   WRESTLING-GRAPEVINE _ The British Bulldog is back in the WWF,
Taz inks 3-year deal with ECW and Raven may return to roost with

   The weekly CoxNet wrestling page is available Wednesday
afternoons by 5 p.m. EDT. Keying to the Monday wrestling events,
It's good for publication any day through Sunday. Here are the
elements on the page, which are also moving on the entertainment
wire:
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING-SLAM _ Look ahead to WWF Summerslam PPV and Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura's role. Should he be doing this, reports on net
that he is receiving more than the $100,000 he's giving to charity.
How will this effect his run for presidency? w/chart on predicted

</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING-ROADWILD _ Look back at WCW's Road Wild PPV. Hogan is
in a 'career' match, if he loses his wrestling 'career' is over. It
looks like he may lose because he is struggling with a
hyperextended knee injury and needs the time off a loss would give
him. But will this happen? We'll know Sat. night. Also, WCW doesn't
travel well to Sturgis, many wrestlers took motorcycles and had
accidents and incidents on the way, so which could effect who
actually wrestles. This will probably be the last free (for the
fans in attendance) Road Wild for WCW. Combo with Bret Hart's
return to wrestling on Monday night nitro (to followup on our

Poll: Computers positive for kids 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe all those hours glued to the computer monitor are a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   A poll sponsored by FamilyPC magazine, the results of which were
published in the September issue, asked 615 families about the
effects of PC use on their kids. Most of those polled, 68 percent,
felt PC use made their kids smarter, but 13 percent said they
didn't think so. About 19 percent weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents polled, 61 percent, said they thought computers
made their kids more creative as well. And 79 percent of the
parents polled said PCs helped their kids develop problem-solving
skills.
</P>
<P>
   One expert cited in the story thinks parents are doing their
kids a disservice by not teaching them how to understand the
intellectual culture computers carry and how to navigate the
digital divide between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the story are available at FamilyPC's Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .zdnet.com/familypc/.
</P>
<P>
   Music on the Web has its own awards
</P>
<P>
   TV, CDs and magazines still dominate the music industry. But the
Internet might change all that.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life magazine stays a step ahead by conducting an
annual poll looking at the best the music industry has to offer the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 version of the magazine's Online Music Awards, the
guy who used to call himself Prince won for Best Net Single. The
former Prince used the Internet to distribute ``The War,'' a
20-minute single that was available from his Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .love4oneanother.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah McLachlan won Best Net Album for adding ``to the glow of
online commerce to her reflective pop by distributing her live
album `Mirrorball' through an exclusive deal with Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Prince was among six musicians honored for having the
best official sites. The Beastie Boys' site, www.beastieboys.com,
won the category, followed by Tori Amos, www.tori
</P>
<P>
   .com; David Bowie, www.davidbowie.com; Marilyn Manson,
www.marilynmanson.net; and Public Enemy, www.public-enemy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites were noted for their excellence as reference
sources. Ultimate Band List, www.ubl.com, was voted the best for
music news, online radio and links to record labels. All-Music
Guide, www.allmusic.com, is one of the largest online music
reference books, including artist biographies, record reviews and
daily music news updates. International Lyrics Server,
www.lyrics.ch/index.htm, was also included.
</P>
<P>
   The August issue also lists a group of Incredibly Useful Sites.
This month's collection includes a nutrition analysis tool, www.ag
</P>
<P>
   .uiuc.edu/(tilde)food-lab/nat

<P>
   Dissecting those cell phone pricing plans
</P>
<P>
   Have cellular phone prices dropped enough for you yet? Are the
inexpensive phones and even-less-expensive calling plans starting
to make you think about buying one?
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.point.com, is a way to cut through the details
of a multitude of calling plans out there and find one that suits
you.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets visitors sort plans by phone and by calling plan.
It searches both categories based on your ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Point.com, formerly Wireless Dimension, searches 200 phone

   New radar detector has its own compass
</P>
<P>
   Radar detectors are not quite as popular as they were in their
1980s prime, but the product keeps evolving. Precision Navigation
has developed what it claims to be the first radar/laser detector
with a built-in compass.
</P>
<P>
   The RX5000, which sells for about $200, weighs 6 ounces. The
device alerts drivers to all forms of radar. It has 360 degrees of
laser protection and warns drivers of road hazards, including
approaching emergency vehicles, roadwork and upcoming train
crossings, using a eight-digit text display.
</P>
<P>
   The compass displays direction with digits and cardinal points.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Slimmed-down, lighter PowerBook is a big step in the right
direction 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to speed and processing power, Apple's laptops are
the equal of any PC counterpart. But one important area where
PowerBooks have lagged is in size and weight.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, bigger is not better. The typical PowerBook weighs
8 pounds _too bulky to comfortably lug through airports.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has started to correct this problem with its latest
PowerBook. The laptop is about a third of an inch thinner than its
predecessors. That not only makes this PowerBook easier to grip but
reduces the weight. This slimmer PowerBook weighs 5.9 pounds with
the battery and CD-ROM drive loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the reduction in weight, the PowerBook is not the
lightest laptop on the market. Not by a long shot. But the new G3
PowerBook does represent a big step in the right direction for
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   While slimmed down, the new PowerBook hasn't surrendered
anything in terms of power and speed. It comes in two souped-up
models, a 333-megahertz G3 microprocessor and a 400-MHz G3
microprocessor. Either is among the fastest laptops out there.
</P>
<P>
   Both models also include a 14.1-inch active matrix color screen
and a 56k modem. They also support the new DVD portable drives.
</P>
<P>
   Another important advance with this PowerBook is longer battery
life. Apple claims the battery will last five hours. Testing by
MacWorld magazine showed the battery lasted three hours under
normal working conditions. That's still an improvement over
previous batteries.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing from the new PowerBook is any kind of portable
storage device such as a floppy or Zip drive. That has become true
even for many of Apple's desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're already a PowerBook user, don't think you can use
your old portable drives with the new G3. They won't work in the
new, slimmer body. You'll have to buy new drives, available for
around $230.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the slim PowerBook is the lack of adequate
RAM, or internal memory. You get 64 megabytes, but that is barely
sufficient these days. That figure is about half of what is
standard with most PC laptops.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new problem. Apple has always included insufficient
RAM with its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, the new, slimmer G3 PowerBooks are smart
computers that pack a lot of power. They're selling in the catalogs
for between $2,500 and $3,500.

PETS ON DISPLAY AT PUPPYCAM WEB SITE

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't go wrong writing about puppies and kittens, especially
on your first day back from vacation during the dog days of August.
</P>
<P>
   That's not something they teach at journalism school, but it
seems like sound advice, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   So I spent some time Monday morning watching Fonzi, a 5-year-old
black-and-white Shih Tzu. Fonzi was hanging out online.
</P>
<P>
   Fonzi was the featured pet on the Humane Society of Greater
Kansas City's PuppyCam, the latest in pet adoption technology.
Mounted in a cage at the Humane Society's shelter in Kansas City,
Kan., the camera shoots a fresh photo every five seconds and beams
it to a worldwide audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had calls from Washington state; we've had calls from
all over,'' said Lorna Helmig, director of operations for the
Humane Society. ``They'll call and say, `That's a cute dog or cat.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society has featured about 12 animals since the
camera was plugged in last month. The results have been good. Nine
of the animals _ dogs, puppies, kittens and a cat _ found new
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Helmig said the organization picked animals with a high ``cute
value'' that were likely to stay active for the camera. The camera
is on all day. When the lights go out, the PuppyCam shows
``highlights'' from the day.
</P>
<P>
   The PuppyCam Web site _ www.thepuppycam.com _ also has general
information on pet adoption and raising a pet, a chat room, and two
experts _ a veterinarian and a Humane Society official _ who answer
questions online posed by visitors to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The PuppyCam is a program started by a Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.-based Internet company that has placed kennel cameras in
animal shelters in more than 20 cities across the country. About 25
more shelters are scheduled to go online in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Online Pet Adoption Network pays for the cameras and
provides technical support for participating animal shelters. The
company is hoping to make money by selling advertising on the site,
and plans to split profits with the animal shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Helmig said the PuppyCam had been a great deal for the Kansas
City Humane Society. The organization's only expense was a new
phone line to connect to the Adoption Network.
</P>
<P>
   As for Fonzi ... well, if he knew he was on center stage Monday
he was pretty blase about it. He wandered around the cage a bit,
occasionally jumped up on the side, and even mooned the camera a
few times.
</P>
<P>
   It beats the heck out of network reruns and midseason
replacements.

</P>
<P>
   AltaVista, one of the largest Internet search engines, is the
latest company to enter the free Internet service market.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista last week began offering local service in the Kansas
City area, Leavenworth and hundreds of other cities nationwide. The
hitch to avoid a monthly Internet charge that averages about $20
for paid Internet service? Users have to visit advertiser Web sites
on a regular basis to remain online.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available at www.altavista.com.
</P>
<P>
   Free Internet service has become big business in Europe, where
consumers often are billed per minute for telephone service. Free
Internet services there have snagged hundreds of thousands of users
who opted for free service to reduce their overall online costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several free Internet providers have popped up in the United
States. The Microsoft Network, which runs a poor second to America
Online, is said to be considering a free service.

COMPUTER BOOSTING MIMICS HUMAN INTUITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JENNIFER 8. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has been to the racetrack knows that picking a horse
is part art and part science: a gambler can pick the horse with the
best odds, pick a horse that won its last race, pick the horse that
has the best winning streak or choose on the basis of a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   It was intuition, after all, not statistics, that rewarded those
who picked Charismatic to win the Kentucky Derby last May at
32-to-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a small group of researchers say that such intuition can,
at least in part, be duplicated by computers. Rules of thumb that
are only partially accurate can be combined into precise prediction
tools using an artificial intelligence technique called boosting.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting has two qualities that distinguish it from existing
computer prediction methods. While highly accurate, it is simpler
to execute than many other programs. And it is able to make
predictions even when the programmer provides very general _ or
even conflicting _ guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it simulates, albeit in a more sophisticated and
accurate manner, human intuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophically it's an interesting result,'' said Robert
Schapire, who has done seminal work on boosting with fellow AT&AMP;T
researchers Yoav Freund and Yoram Singer. ``You can take a set of
prediction rules that is better than random guessing and combine
them into something that is very accurate. It's kind of
counterintuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Boosting is just beginning to emerge from academia into
commercial use, but researchers believe it may have a wide range of
potential applications. Companies, for example, might use it to
identify patterns in consumer behavior, a practice called
datamining.
</P>
<P>
   And the technique, which can handle not only simple yes or no
inquiries but multi-category classification and ranking, as well,
might come in handy in filtering junk e-mail, making medical
diagnoses, helping banks or other institutions identify a person's
handwriting, or allowing speculators to pick a winner in the stock
market _ or at the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, machine learning focused on developing large,
complex sets of analytical rules that the computer could use to
make predictions. But boosting shifts the emphasis to simply
finding rules that do better than chance.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies have shown that boosting is often as
accurate or even more accurate than older predictive techniques. In
addition, it can be applied to already complex methods _ like
neural networks and decision trees _ to further ``boost'' their
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting acts as a big computational blender that can combine a
wide variety of predictive techniques from rough rules of thumb
(which computer scientists consider ``weak'') to already highly
accurate algorithms (which are considered ``strong'').
</P>
<P>
   In essence, boosting works by assigning different priorities to
rules of thumb by analyzing historical data fed in by the
programmer. The technique has five steps, which it repeats until
its accuracy cannot be improved upon. Given a rule of thumb, it
tries it out, then analyzes the errors, and assigns a priority
ranking. Solving the errors made in the first round is given a
higher priority when the next rule of thumb is tried.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the results from all trials are combined and the
program ``votes'' on the final answer.
</P>
<P>
   In racetrack prediction, boosting might work as follows: A
programmer would feed the boosting algorithm historical data on the
race, the horses and their records, in addition to a number of
rules of thumb, to be executed in order.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the algorithm might first ask how often the horse
with the best odds won. Then the computer might go on to the next
rule of thumb to see how often a horse that won its previous race
won again. In a third analysis, how often a horse with the largest
winning streak continued winning might be examined, and so on. In
the end, the horse that satisfied the most conditions with the
greatest accuracy would be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting has earned fans among computational learning
researchers, in part because it provides a happy marriage of theory
and experiment. ``It's very easy to implement and understand. It's
very efficient. It yields good results. And for scientists, it has
a firm theoretical standing,'' Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   The algorithmic simplicity of boosting also provides a big bang
for the buck, which could make it attractive to many companies, he
said. ``Someone who finished a first-year programming class and
understands algorithms can implement it.'' In contrast, many other
predictive analysis techniques require sophisticated knowledge of
programming and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting is not without its flaws. One problem that faces all
predictive techniques based on historical data is that past is not
always prologue. Also, because boosting focuses on items that
produce repeated errors, it can be influenced by extreme examples
or incorrectly entered data.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the technique makes it easier to identify such
unrepresentative cases, which can then be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of boosting was first suggested by Leslie
Valiant and Michael Kearns in a 1988 paper presented at Harvard
University. The first algorithms were developed within a year or
two, and actual experiments began in 1992. A lot of the work has
come out of AT&AMP;T's research laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   At first, many were skeptical that boosting was anything more
than a theoretical concept. But since 1995, mounting experimental
evidence has fueled an interest in boosting among the researchers
in machine learning and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting research is still in its early stages. ``By analogy
with aircraft, Rob et al have demonstrated that it's possible to
fly,'' noted Ross Quinlan, an Australian researcher, referring to
Schapire's early work. ``Now we're at the stage of building bigger,
faster planes with different engines,'' Quinlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting, like other aspects of computational learning, raises
fundamental questions about the nature of artificial intelligence.
Despite the accuracy of boosting, the algorithm does not really
``know'' anything: It does not search for certainty, but merely
makes mathematically calibrated predictions based on precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be surprising outcomes when you don't look for the
truth and just go for the prediction,'' said Freund, who worked
with Schapire to create one of the first practical boosting
algorithms. One experiment called for a computer to make deductions
based on statistical analysis of newspaper text it had processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the computer, `Where is the Taj Mahal?''' Freund said.
``It answered, `Atlantic City,' because according to the text that
was where the Taj Mahal was mentioned most.''

LOTS OF POTENTIAL, LITTLE SUCCESS FOR INTERNET  ADVERTISING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advertising on the Internet, like most uses of this new medium,
is still in the early stages of a long and presumably fruitful
evolution. In other words, it is long on potential but, so far,
short on success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that although the Internet has gathered a
mainstream audience, many companies have yet to figure out how to
use it effectively for advertising. As a result, they have been
reluctant to pour money into Web ads: just 1 percent of the $200
billion spent on advertising last year was spent online.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report to be released Wednesday, however, that
figure is about to rise. Jupiter Communications, an Internet
research firm, projects $11.5 billion in spending for online
advertising in 2003, compared with $2.1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter projects that in four years the Internet will rank
fourth among advertising media in total ad spending, jumping ahead
of cable television, magazines and yellow pages and vying with
radio for the No. 3 spot behind broadcast television and
newspapers. The report follows similar projections made last week
by Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter report is based on projections of growth in both
overall advertising spending and the online audience. And the
company's research indicates that two crucial players in
traditional advertising _ car makers and consumer goods
manufacturers _ are finally warming up to the Internet. The report
predicts that in 2003, automotive companies will devote 13 percent
of their advertising budgets to the Internet, compared with 5
percent this year, and consumer goods makers like Procter &AMP;
Gamblewill spend 7 percent of their ad budgets on the Internet,
compared with 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter predicts that the online audience in 2003 will be 64
million U.S. households, compared with 38 million now. But
according to Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising
Bureau, an industry trade group, expectations for higher Web
spending also reflect fundamental shifts in the perception of the
Internet as an advertising medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995 and '96, advertisers were putting up sites for their
products, and looking at it as a sales channel,'' LeFurgy said.
``But that was confusing for advertisers who couldn't sell their
products online, like soft drink makers, so that was a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do consumer packaged goods companies lack the expertise
_ and in some cases, the desire _ to sell directly to consumers
over the Internet, but consumers would not be likely to go to
Coke's online store, for example, to buy soda, he said. ``These
companies couldn't figure out why they should be advertising
online,'' LeFurgy said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, however, companies have recognized the Web's
potential for brand advertising, as opposed to direct sales. So
instead of sending consumers to their own Web sites to buy goods,
companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble are spending money on branding
campaigns to build awareness. And through cooperative advertising
efforts, they can send consumers to, say, an online grocery store
where buyers can find their products alongside the products of the
other cooperating marketers, LeFurgy said.
</P>
<P>
   As more companies migrate toward brand-based advertising, they
are also looking less at the number of people who actually click on
a Web ad, LeFurgy said. He said that a user's propensity to click
on an ad is not necessarily the best way to gauge its effectiveness
in building brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing strategies must also change if companies are to
succeed online, said Patrick Keane, an analyst with Jupiter. The
tendency of many companies to view their Web initiatives as somehow
separate from their core businesses has helped perpetuate the
theory that Internet advertising does not work, Keane said. When
marketers do set aside money to advertise online, he said, ``their
online campaigns too often look different and feel different from
their off-line campaigns _ and that's just not an effective way to
manage a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Advertisers are going to realize that they have to
integrate their campaigns across all media,'' instead of merely
adding a Web site address to ``a TV ad or whatever else they're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Keane said, ``the fragmented nature of media
consumption means marketers will need to hit consumers at multiple
media points.''
</P>
<P>
   LeFurgy also noted that an abundance of new Internet businesses
rely on ad revenue. In recent months, Internet service providers
and PC makers have used advertising revenue as a means to lower
their prices, giving consumers the chance to get cheaper machines
and Internet access if they agree to look at advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Internet advertising builds momentum, spending on
other media may suffer, Jupiter predicts. Keane said the Internet's
anticipated cannibalism of other media is, in fact, taking place as
people spend more time online. Internet users spent an average of
7.1 hours a week online in 1998, according to Jupiter, which
predicts that will increase to 10.2 hours a week in 2003. ``And
they'll use other media less because there's only so much time in
the day,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been a little myopic about online advertising,
just looking at the fact that the dollars are smaller,'' he added.
``It's not about the numbers. It's about how the Internet is
reinventing advertising.''

EXPERTS SAY Y2K BUG WILL NOT SHUT DOWN THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Software glitches will not shut down the Internet
on Jan. 1 because the world's largest computer network is
``self-healing,'' capable of bypassing any local failures caused by
the Y2K bug, Internet experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, ``the Internet should bend and not break,''
said Donald Heath, chief executive of the Internet Society, a
non-profit group that helps set Internet infrastructure standards.
Because of the vast network's resilient and decentralized
structure, ``the sky is not even thinking about falling,'' he said
at a press conference called by the President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Internet operations could temporarily fail in some cities
because of local interruptions in telephone service or electricity,
or because a particular Internet service provider did not prepare
for the rollover to 2000, the experts said. Internet disruptions
may be greater in foreign countries where phone and power companies
are less prepared for Y2K than their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Heath and other Internet authorities were called together by the
White House to discuss Y2K's impact on the Internet. With
electronic commerce and messaging now so vital to the economy, the
Clinton administration wants to avoid problems caused by the
software programming flaw, widely known as the Y2K bug. The flaw
may cause many older computers to misunderstand dates beyond Dec.
31, 1999, leading to widespread equipment malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet is a collection of mostly independent
computer networks, operated worldwide and largely without
government supervision, information about Y2K preparations has been
difficult to gather. The President's Council convened a meeting of
Internet experts July 30 to better assess the problems. Tuesday's
press conference summarized their findings. Among the key points
were:
</P>
<P>
   -- While some elements of the Internet, such as routers and
switches, could be unprepared for the date change, the network's
key ''backbone'' components have been updated and tested.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Internet has so many thousands of local service providers
that some problems are bound to occur. That means some Internet
users who depend on the Internet for communication or commerce
should be prepared with contingency plans in case they lose service
for hours, or even days, after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   -- Y2K problems will have little impact on on-line stock trading
because major markets will be closed at midnight Jan. 1. Computer
programmers will have a full weekend to patch problems before
markets open on the first Monday of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   -- The threat from computer viruses will not be increased by Y2K
bugs. But electronic terrorists who want to cause trouble might
target Jan. 1 to get extra attention. Whether New Year's Day will
generate an epidemic of new viruses is ``more of a human question
than a technological question,'' Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mass e-mailings of New Year's greetings Jan. 1 could clog the
network, just as any huge sudden surge in messaging might do, with
or without Y2K bugs.

FACING DOWN THE THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Engineer Anita W. had every reason to be scared: A male
subordinate had threatened her for giving him a negative
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the worker's intimidating behavior
escalated. He used foul language, elbowed Anita, struck her on the
arm, and said he had thought about shooting another supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after she reported the incidents to management, Anita
resigned. Three months after that, she filed a lawsuit against her
former employer alleging, among other things, failure to ensure a
safe work environment and negligent hiring, supervision, and
retention.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, US workers are holding employers accountable for
violent acts in the workplace, and for hiring threatening or
violent employees, says Mark Braverman, author of a book about
workplace rage that discusses Anita's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been numerous cases where companies, in stumbling
over how to solve a problem and in not having the right tools,
wound up being charged by their own employees,'' Braverman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the families of two men who were killed when a
laid-off worker went on a rampage were awarded $7.9 million in
damages after a jury found that the workers' Charlotte, N.C.
employer had not protected them. Two days before the shooting, on
May 17, 1995, the gunman had been fired for a series of violent
acts.
</P>
<P>
   And seven postal employees who were held hostage on Christmas
Eve last year sued the US Postal Service, saying they had failed to
provide a safe work environment. The lawsuit alleges that the
employees had suffered emotional trauma after they were held in a
Denver post office at gunpoint for 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace violence continues to top the list of major concerns
among the country's biggest employers, acccording to Pinkerton's,
the international security firm.
</P>
<P>
   And the US Justice Department says that each year, more than 1
million employees are subjected to various forms of violence at
work, including minor assaults (615,000), aggravated assaults
(264,000), and rapes (13,000).
</P>
<P>
   Some behaviors, experts say, are critical signs that a worker is
having difficulty either at work or at home. These signs include
increased reliance on drugs or alcohol, unprovoked outbursts,
suicidal thoughts, increased debt, obsessive physical complaints,
severe mood swings, and empathy for those who commit aggressive or
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   Braverman, author of ``Preventing Workplace Violence: A Guide
for Employers and Practitioners,'' recommends that employers
consider the following steps to guarding against violence at work:
</P>
<P>
   --Get support from the top. Nothing will be accomplished without
the support of the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   --Form a team. When Air Products and Chemicals Inc. of
Allentown, Pa., developed its crisis management policy, it included
a requirement that a team be formed consisting of the heads of
security, human resources, the law department, labor relations, and
various company departments. ``Our team meets quarterly,'' said
Larry Piotti, corporate security manager. ``We look at troubling
situations and employees. We decide who should be referred to
counseling. We also train supervisors and managers to recognize and
diffuse aggressive behavior. Separate training sessions are held
for all employees.''
</P>
<P>
   --Hold a workplace violence risk audit. Braverman advises
managers to talk directly to employees about safety and security
issues, to review records for past violent incidents, and to
conduct an internal security check.
</P>
<P>
   --Based on the information gathered, develop policies and
procedures. Then, make sure everyone knows what they are. Define
workplace violence for employees, indicate that there will be no
tolerance for it, specify how incidents should be reported, and
make it clear that employees who make reports will be kept safe.
</P>
<P>
   --Train managers and workers. ``The primary goal of training is
to make sure employees at every level are willing to make a phone
call,'' Braverman said.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T spokesman, Burke Stimson, says confronting a troubled
worker and delivering a pink slip are among the most difficult
assignments a supervisor can face. ``It takes a good deal of
self-confidence to ask someone into your office to discuss what you
perceive as emotional troubles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stimson said front-line managers and workers often are the first
to recognize workplace problems. ``People in the neighborhood might
say, `Oh, Haskins was a pleasant guy,' but you can bet his
co-workers saw the signs.''
</P>
<P>
   --Give workers access to medical and mental health expertise.
Standard assessments determine whether a person is fit to do his
job. This is different. The goal here is to find out if someone is
dangerous and, if not, to determine the nature of the problem and a
possible solution.
</P>
<P>
   At Air Products and Chemicals, for example, workers have access
to a 24-hour crisis center, and a 1-800 crisis hotline number. The
company, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, says the
system was designed to respond to any incidents that might occur at
night, but is now available around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   --Develop layoff and termination policies.
</P>
<P>
   Braverman notes that most of the calls he receives are from
managers whose firms do not have termination policies or
procedures. As a result, many are afraid confronting a worker will
lead to the violence they fear.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't surprising, said Donald Gibson, a professor at the
Yale School of Management. ``Much of the anger people are
expressing is associated with the feeling that the employer has
violated promises that had been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, coauthor of a 1996 Gallup workplace violence study,
presented this month at the Academy of Management in Chicago, said
that nearly 25 percent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they often
felt angry at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we questioned people, we found that there was a sense of
feeling betrayed,'' he said. ``And, when we asked whether the
company's values and the employee's values were similar, many said
no. So the anger is associated with the feeling that the company
has let them down. These feelings of anger or rage are also linked
to feeling stressed, overworked, or stuck in one door, with no
alternatives.''

COLLEGES GIVING ADVERTISERS ACCESS TO CAMPUS WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starting Tuesday, when students at Appalachian State University
check their e-mail or course outlines online, they will be looking
at advertising from dozens of companies including Amazon.com, Dell
Computer and an apartment-locator service called SpringStreet.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar will be happening soon at Villanova
University, the University of Memphis, the University of Oregon,
the University of Idaho and more than 500 other institutions that
have signed up commercial companies to run campus Web sites and
e-mail services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas '98 was the first `e-Christmas.' We think this is
the first `e-back to school,''' said Chad Muir, chief executive of
Campus Pipeline, a company that says it has agreements to provide
Web services to 420 colleges and universities, including
Appalachian State, at little or no cost.
</P>
<P>
   While at many universities students continue to use Web pages
that the schools have created and paid for themselves, at these 500
schools advertisers will be paying the bills. And the placement of
advertising on what some regard as the purest area of the Internet
_ the educational domain _ has spurred an acrimonious debate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is what place advertising should have in the college
environment, real or virtual, particularly in public institutions.
Some educators are alarmed at what they see as a crass commercial
intrusion, yet administrators and others argue that faced with
financial constraints, they have little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place for commercial advertisements within the
precincts of any school that takes its educational mission
seriously,'' said Scott Rice, an English professor at San Jose
State University who is researching the effects of
commercialization on education.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Williams, director of information-technology services at
Appalachian State, said he had heard such arguments. But that is
not stopping Appalachian State _ a public institution in Boone,
N.C., with 12,500 students _ from adopting the advertising model
and avoiding the need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to
create the Web sites on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will say that it's not ethical to advertise,''
Williams said. ``Given our druthers, we'd rather not ourselves. But
it's a pretty attractive model. We'll live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has rolled out the program by instructing 2,500
first-year students at Appalachian State to log into the system
this week. They will be among the first in the country to
experience such advertising-based pages on a university Web site.
Each page includes a square advertisement _ what the company likes
to call a ``sponsorship'' _ in the top right-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   A page labeled Campus Central has information about campus
events as well as paid advertisements _ not labeled as such _ that
link to businesses offering textbooks, financial aid information,
educational testing services, auctions and housing. A Web shopping
section will provide additional links to online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Pipeline will also try to learn more about what is
essentially a captive audience. When students first log into campus
Web sites, they will be asked to fill out an optional form about
their interests. If they do, they will receive product pitches in
their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members at Appalachian State are just learning of the
deal _ and several are voicing concerns. ``We're throwing our
freshmen to the wolves,'' said Andrew Koch, an associate professor
of political science. ``The university has become a shill for the
corporate community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells volumes,'' he continued, ``about the university,
its funding, and the business mindset that has taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   But as campuses struggle with the costs of technology _ and the
constant need to upgrade it _ such deals are becoming more and more
attractive, administrators say. Creating an internal Web service,
known as an intranet, that seamlessly pulls information from
multiple databases around campus could cost as much as $2 million
for a midsized public university, if not more. Public universities,
especially, are finding it difficult to pay such costs while facing
tightening budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Pipeline, a start-up based in Salt Lake City, began
approaching colleges late last year. It has investments from Sun
Microsystems, Dell Computer and McKinsey &AMP; Co., among others, and
says it intends to bring 100 of its 420 clients online by the end
of the fall term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Campus Pipeline, at least one other company,
called YouthStream, is offering similar services, and says it has
signed up more than 100 schools. YouthStream, which is based in New
York City, has opened a site called MyBytes.Com, which provides
students with online calendars, materials to supplement their
classes, financial-aid information and Web pages for courses if
professors choose to use them. Each page includes an advertisement
or a link to an electronic shopping area.
</P>
<P>
   Some students are practically expecting to be awash in
promotions as soon as they log on to their college's Web site. ``I
don't see anything wrong with it, unless it gets out of hand,''
said Ken Greene, a junior at the University of Memphis. ``That's
all the Web is, is lots of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   But the concept is a striking departure for most institutions of
higher education. Academia, after all, is where the Internet grew
up, and for years, as the Web has become increasingly
commercialized, colleges have kept their distance, priding
themselves on creating an online presence that is promotion-free.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, colleges have been bombarded by pitches
from companies that are eager to gain electronic access to the
Net-savvy student market. Many are approaching athletic
departments, hoping to strike deals to promote apparel or soft
drinks on pages about sports teams. Policy-makers at some colleges
are even being approached by administrators on their own campuses
who want to provide Web links to online stores like Amazon.Com, so
that the school can take in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academy is not a billboard community,'' said Margaret
Miller, president of the American Association for Higher Education.
``But it is also the case that the academy is subject to the same
economic strains as the rest of the world.'' The result, Dr. Miller
said, is a ``blurring line'' that is spurred on by the costs of
technology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Appalachian State, Williams said, ``There is no way we could
have done it ourselves.'' As one of Campus Pipeline's first
schools, Appalachian State has not yet had to pay anything for the
services. Other schools may have to pay for installation, which
could cost as much as $32,000, but which administrators say is
still far less than the cost of designing and maintaining the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Williams, colleges like Appalachian State do not
have much choice. Students now expect to be able to fill out
financial-aid forms and register for classes online. Colleges that
do not offer such services may lose their ability to attract
students.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach was taken almost a decade ago by Channel One,
a program started by the Whittle Communications company that
supplied middle schools and high schools with television sets and
paid for them with commercials. It is still derided by some
educators as a channel for pushing advertising in front of captive
students.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest example, the executives of the Web-based
companies see their approach as nothing more than a continuation of
a trend that has already become a big part of higher education.
Public and private universities of all sizes have already turned
over dining services to Marriott, student unions to Taco Bell,
copying centers to Kinkos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are increasingly getting out of specialized services
that they would rather outsource,'' said Harlan Peltz,
YouthStream's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many educators say they want a line to be drawn,
particularly when it comes to spaces _ on- or off line _ where
students are supposed to be learning and exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ehrlich, a former president of Indiana University, said
he is troubled by the idea of advertisements on sites where
professors hold online office hours or post syllabi. ``I think that
is much too intrusive,'' said Ehrlich, who is now a fellow at the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges with large endowments, like most Ivy League
schools, have declined to have commercially sponsored Web sites.
Many of them say that they have the resources to create online
services like admissions and registration without outside help.
That may lead students at less selective schools to be exposed to a
barrage of advertising, while students at elite schools are
insulated from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create a different set of haves and have-nots, so to
speak,'' said Jose-Marie Griffiths, chief information officer at
the University of Michigan, where the idea of having commercially
sponsored Web pages was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   For those that have signed up, protecting students' privacy has
been a large concern. As Campus Pipeline and YouthStream collect
information about their students, university administrators say
that they want to make sure that the information is not sold or
traded to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hilton, an assistant director in the computing center at
the University of Oregon, said that her campus has been working
with Campus Pipeline to whittle down the list of questions they ask
students and to keep the information confidential. ``That took a
while to make that point,'' she said.

 Tech Heavy Hitters Join Open-Access Fray  
 By Deborah Solomon   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in the high-tech industry are coming
out in support of AT&AMP;T and ExciteAtHome in the fight over ``open
access.''
</P>
<P>
   The Information Technology Industry Council, which includes
heavy hitters such as Cisco Systems, Apple, 3Com and Intel, sent a
letter to the Federal Communications Commission, saying it favors a
national policy that would not force AT&AMP;T to open its cable TV
lines to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some additional technology companies, such as General
Instrument, WebMD and Broadcom, also plan to ask the FCC to avoid
imposing open access.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Redwood City's ExciteAtHome are locked in a fierce
battle with America Online and other Internet service providers
over who should control AT&AMP;T's cable TV lines. The ISPs and some
consumer groups want the government to force AT&AMP;T to lease space on
its wires to other companies that want to offer high-speed Internet
service via cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities, including San Francisco, have been debating
whether to impose ``open access'' as a condition of approving
AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI and MediaOne. So far, just Portland, Ore.,
and Broward County, Fla., have approved open access, while San
Francisco decided to delay a decision until December.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and ExciteAtHome have asked the FCC to intervene and set a
national policy _ one that opposes open access. The companies argue
that local municipalities don't have the right to impose open
access and say that forcing AT&AMP;T to open its cable TV lines will
delay the development of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has been trying to drum up support for its position since
June, when a federal judge in Portland ruled that city officials
could force AT&AMP;T to share space on its cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is now on appeal at the U.S. Court of Appeals in
San Francisco, which will hold hearings in October. Meanwhile, the
parties involved have been filing ``friend of the court'' briefs in
support or against the Portland ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the FCC filed a brief in support of AT&AMP;T's position.
ExciteAtHome plans to file a similar brief today, company officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, a coalition of consumer groups sent a letter
to the FCC several weeks ago, saying that consumers would benefit
from open access because they could get high-speed Internet service
from a number of providers, not just AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter to the FCC, Information Technology Industry
Council President Rhett Dawson said regulators should not impose
restrictions on companies that want to offer high-speed Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because cable Internet access is an emerging service and the
providers currently lack market power in the Internet access
market, they should not be subject at this time to open network
requirements,'' the letter said.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Nestled in a stately building in Dudley Square, the
Boston Bank of Commerce is an emblem of the struggle by
minority-owned financial institutions to survive in the
ever-shifting world of banking.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is everywhere _ established banks, criticized for
shunning poor urban neighborhoods, are now opening branches in
inner-city communities. Technology is changing old ways of doing
business. And consumers are more demanding than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But New England's only black-owned bank is not sitting still. At
its modern downtown headquarters, the company is putting the
finishing touches on a bold plan to expand at warp speed. Under
chairman Kevin Cohee, the Boston Bank of Commerce is looking to
grow its assets eightfold by acquiring up to 18 branches that Fleet
Financial Group and BankBoston, the region's two biggest banks, are
selling as part of their $16 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee is also attempting to take over the struggling Carver
Federal Savings Bank in New York, the nation's largest black-owned
bank. Carver, which wants to remain rooted in Harlem rather than
build a national franchise, has twice rebuffed his overtures.
Undaunted, Cohee is trying to garner support from other
shareholders to win a seat on Carver's board.
</P>
<P>
   As if all that weren't a big enough challenge, Cohee is also
eyeing a Florida bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be the biggest black bank in America,'' Cohee said
recently in his executive suite, where the atmosphere seemed to
pulse with empire-building plans. ``The goal is to take our model
and to expand it on a nationwide basis.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers see a basic contradiction between the bank's
national ambitions and the community focus that has kept it rooted
in Boston's minority neighborhoods. Others see a more fundamental
problem: Cohee may be taking on too much, too fast. Indeed, for a
bank that barely a year ago shuttered one of its three branches to
save money, the proposed expansion is gargantuan. Cohee is also
squaring off against competitors eager to acquire the same branches
from the Fleet-BankBoston deal. And he must raise of hundreds of
millions of dollars to finance his plans.
</P>
<P>
   He could find out as early as next week if he has won any
branches. Some in Boston financial circles say he will get a
fraction of what he wants _ if anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohee, a former Salomon Brothers investment banker, and the
only banker in New England who can match Fleet chief executive
Terrence Murray's bulldog opportunism, is convinced his plan can
work.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after he took over a dying Boston Bank of Commerce
and restored it to health, Cohee has made it among America's
most-watched minority banks _ and a barometer of what the future
for black-owned financial institutions may look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Bank of Commerce is a test case in American banking,''
said Dina Nichelson, president of the American League of Financial
Institutions, a trade group for minority-owned thrifts. ``The
question is whether his vision of an expanded bank will be
supported by the community _ and by the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The privately held bank is one of the nation's half-dozen
``community financial development institutions'' _ small banks,
usually minority-owned, that offer traditional checking and savings
but that also finance projects in low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has had a part in many local projects _ in Roxbury, it
has helped finance the construction of People's Baptist Church, New
Covenant Church, and Muhammad's Mosque. Since mid-1998, Cohee has
spent more than $15 million on inner-city nonprofits and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing,'' he said. ``And we have to make sure
that back at the ranch, somebody is serving these communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Financing and lending to minorities is an especially charged
issue in Boston, the birthplace of banking more than two centuries
ago and the locus of a patrician financial industry. In 1991, a
landmark Federal Reserve study found that local banks were engaging
in some of the nation's worst discrimination against black home
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   That history, combined with questions over whether Fleet and
BankBoston will pull back from inner cities after they merge, makes
it especially important to community activists and others that
Boston Bank of Commerce flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank is important and symbolic because it has managed to
carve out a niche for itself and for the community it serves _ a
niche that nobody wanted,'' said state Representative Dianne
Wilkerson, a Roxbury Democrat. `And they have made it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cohee, 41, must convince investors that his proposal to buy
up to $650 million in deposits from Fleet will work. The New York
investment bank Cohee hired to help with his bid, Sandler O'Neill,
is scrambling to gain financing from minority venture capitalists
and banks on Wall Street. One potential supporter, BankBoston, has
balked, wary of the conflict of interest in being the co-seller of
the branches Cohee covets, even though the branches technically
belong to Fleet. Although it has invested around $2 million in
Cohee's bank, BankBoston is loath to bolster an institution that
seeks to compete with its own inner-city branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very aggressive in generating political support
for his bid,'' said one lawyer who requested anonymity, referring
to backing that Cohee secured from Massachusetts legislators and
the Rev. Al Sharpton. ``But he may be overreaching and trying to
bite off more than he can chew.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hurdles, Cohee's proposed leap is what makes Boston
Bank of Commerce a standout among the nation's 180 minority banks.
``What makes them unique is their risk-taking posture,'' said
William Cunningham, president of Creative Investment Research, a
Washington, D.C., firm that tracks minority and women-owned banks.
``Traditional black bankers have not had that mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   And for good cause.
</P>
<P>
   Black-owned banks first emerged in response to Jim Crow laws and
multiplied during the 1960s civil rights movement. Chronically
short of capital, many have spent their lives seeking not to expand
but merely to hang on. Even Carver, the largest minority-owned
bank, has only two-thirds of the $600 million in assets held by the
average thrift. At $107 million in assets, Cohee's bank is smaller
still. Descended from the Unity Bank &AMP; Trust Co., which was founded
by Roxbury civil rights activists in 1968 but which later
collapsed, Boston Bank of Commerce has had to claw its way back to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Fleet's and BankBoston's sale of 290
branches with $12.5 billion in deposits is a once-in-a-lifetime
chance.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard Law School graduate, Cohee has an aggressive style.
``He basically retained that Salomon attitude of, `We're going to
be bigger, badder, and better than everybody else,' '' Creative
Investment Research's Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a trait Cohee showed early in his banking career.
</P>
<P>
   One year after joining Boston Bank of Commerce in 1994, he
staged a palace coup, injecting $1 million of his own money into
the company and kicking out its chief executive, Ronald Homer. At
the time, the bank was drained of reserves and under a
cease-and-desist order from federal regulators. Leveled by years of
soured real estate loans, the company was on its deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with profits for the second year running after years of
seven-figure losses, Boston Bank of Commerce is back on track. The
bank earned $704,000 last year, and has a return on assets of over
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company has stumbled, too.
</P>
<P>
   Its $229,0000 investment in a project with a local minority
development group, Columbia Plaza Associates, to erect the Ruggles
Center building in Roxbury turned sour when the edifice was
discovered to have environmental problems. While the Boston bank's
majority stake in an ambitious Columbia-led plan to build a
37-story skyscraper in the Leather District may fare better, it has
yet to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   A second high-profile venture failed to take off. The bank's
Unity credit card, which donates a percentage of its profits to the
United Negro College Fund and other charities, was designed to
appeal to moderate-income and professional blacks. But despite a
boom in consumer spending, the card has attracted only several
thousand holders, according to Teri Williams, the bank's marketing
executive and Cohee's wife. Nonetheless, Cohee said he planned new
Unity-branded products, including debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the competition.
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday summer morning, there were only three customers in
Boston Bank of Commerce's quiet Roxbury branch. Loan officers'
desks stood empty.
</P>
<P>
   The branch shares a 19th-century building with Citizens Bank _ a
larger institution, with more services and products. Up the block
is a full-service BankBoston outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires all banks to lend to underserved
communities. For areas that until recently had only pricey
check-cashing shops, the changes have been a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But for minority banks they have been a nightmare. Lacking
capital for on-line banking, mutual funds, mortgage lending, and
financial planning, most minority banks missed the financial
services revolution. ``Fifty years ago, nobody even looked at our
market,'' said Deborah C. Wright, Carver's new president. ``Now
there's no way we can underwrite a mortgage at the same rate these
giant competitors can.''
</P>
<P>
   One result is that many minority banks provide fewer services to
the areas they hope to improve. In 1991, Boston Bank of Commerce
made 101 home loans in the Boston area, according to professor
James Campen, a community reinvestment specialist at the University
of Massachusetts in Boston. Four years later, the number had
dwindled to 14. In the past two years, Campen said, the bank has
not provided a single home loan in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee wants to reverse the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital,'' he said. ``We need to make acquisitions so that we
can have the capital base to expand. African-American communities
can't grow unless we have capital to help them do it. We have to be
viable and strong, and we have to be extraordinarily good at what
we do. Because a lot of people are depending on us.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After one two-hour meeting in Silicon Valley, Highland Capital
of Boston persuades a California venture firm to invest $5 million
in eToys Inc., the on-line toy retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast, another venture capitalist hears an
entrepreneur's investment pitch _ and must make a decision after
the second cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, NorthBridge Ventures of Waltham, Mass. chooses
to invest in MyTeam.com, a concord, Mass. firm that provides
on-line services to Little League teams.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the deals are done.
</P>
<P>
   This fast-moving landscape has rewritten how venture capitalists
do business. Investment decisions that once took three months are
now made in three weeks or less. A decade ago, a software start-up
needed $10 million to $15 million to get off the ground. Today, an
Internet company has no trouble raising the $70 million or more it
typically needs, and launches an initial public offering within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   So bullish are venture capitalists that few can name any deal
they regret making, insisting that as many as seven out of 10
Internet investments will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But other investors worry the gold rush of venture financing
will take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are too many people doing too many deals with teams
</P>
<P>
   not good enough to do the job? Absolutely,'' said Richard A.
D'Amore, a partner at North Bridge Venture Partners in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a day of reckoning? Absolutely. But people perceive a
sea change with the Internet and they don't want to be left behind.
So the price of this poker game has gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   So hectic _ and lucrative _ is the scramble to fund Internet
companies that venture capitalists are battling one another to get
in early on the hot deals. Even some manufacturing companies _
including Dell Computer _ have created strategic investment
subsidiaries to cash in on the Internet gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people look at an eBay and an Amazon.com, see a lot of
money around from successful initial public offerings, and decide
they can launch venture capital companies to where at least one is
formed almost every single week,'' said Daniel J. Nova, general
partner at Highland Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Highland, which receives 75 to 100 Internet-related business
plans per week, limits investments to 20 per year, said Nova. His
firm also saw six companies in which it invested, including eToys
and Ask Jeeves, launch successful initial public offerings in the
first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the firm's most recent investments is Boston-based
Gamesville.com, which received $14.25 million in a first-round
financing led by Highland. Operating under the slogan ``Wasting
Your Time Since 1996,'' the on-line company offers free poker,
bingo, and other games of chance _ with prizes of cash, trips, and
retail goods, according to its president, Steven Kane.
Gamesville.com makes its money by running advertising between
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hefty financial returns on Wall Street follow a circular pattern
that puts more money back into the hands of pension funds and other
investment vehicles, part of which flows back to venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, savvy entrepreneurs have figured out how to
squeeze venture capital companies into making firm commitments
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Raging Bull Inc. of Andover, Mass., which offers on-line
investment resources to day traders and other investors, recently
invited five firms to participate in its second round of financing.
It gave them just two weeks to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those firms, CMG(at)Ventures, one of the largest Internet
investors, and CNet, invested $20 million together. A third firm
also wanted in but couldn't meet Raging Bull's two-week commitment
requirement, said Stephen Killeen, president and chief executive of
the 33-employee firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this environment, you, the company, stick to your guns,''
said Killeen, who declined to identify the third firm, since it may
invest later on.
</P>
<P>
   For some electronic commerce companies, as much as two-thirds of
the total investment will be spent on marketing, promotion, and
advertising to create a brand identity _ areas once foreign to
venture capitalists whose money went into research and development
of software companies.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, venture funding was in short supply, and
entrepreneurs were mostly software and electrical engineers from
such old giants as Data General Corp. and Computervision. They
would spend money frugally, using it to hire technical talent and
delaying marketing and promotion. These emerging firms pinched
pennies until they sold their first products and reached
profitability, then cashed in on Wall Street with initial public
offerings, a process that took three to six years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, venture capitalists may spend more than $60 million to
launch an Internet start-up created by a young non-engineer,
perhaps a recent grad with a liberal arts background who worked in
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   These on-line companies are often formed from clever ideas, with
venture capitalists helping to assemble management and technical
teams. Because these newer entrepreneurs are less experienced, some
venture capitalists are playing a larger role in the day-to-day
operations of the companies they fund.
</P>
<P>
   To beat back competitors, venture capitalists use money as a
club to scare other venture capitalists from investing in rivals.
Revenue _ not profit _ is the key measurement of initial financial
success, as young Internet companies strive to reach a wide
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hefty sales growth enables some young Internet companies to
launch initial public offerings to raise additional capital while
venture capitalists and other investors watch for the stock to
soar. EToys, which sells children's games, videos, books, and toys
on line, launched its IPO in May for $20 a share, with the first
trade at 75, before closing at 81. It has since fallen to the
mid-30s, closing Tuesday at 40 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Indications that Wall Street may not rush to embrace every
Internet company surfaced last month as increasing numbers of
similar on-line retailers of luxury goods, travel services, and
general merchandise sprung up.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Curme, a general partner at Battery Ventures in
Wellesley, Mass., recalls investing in the first on-line pet
supplies emporium _ California-based PetStore.com _ only to see
three similar pet ventures launched within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fraternity rush where everyone is trying to get
picked and not be left out of the party,'' said Curme. He said the
market for on-line consumer companies is maturing and the future is
in selling products and services to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Battery Ventures recently invested in ecredit.com, a Westwood,
Mass. company that works with major banks and financial
institutions to provide on-line credit services to small and
medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and other venture capitalists worry about a potential
investor backlash from fast-growing Internet companies that fail to
build solid management teams and turn profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm spending about 40 percent of my time recruiting people,
because my biggest fear is not having enough talent, as we are
starting to see real shortages in Boston and Silicon Valley,'' said
Nova of Highland Capital.

A RECORD $1.055B FUELS NEW ENGLAND FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Venture capitalists shoveled a record $1.055 billion into 128
New England companies in the second quarter, including $70 million
into Boston-based JuniorNet, which wants to be a more robust but
commercial-free version of America Online for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for $15 million to $20 million, but had offers
of $130 million, so $70 million is a compromise,'' said Alan
Rothenberg, JuniorNet's founder and chief executive. ``I never
dreamed I would need so much money, either. In fact, we are now
looking for another $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when would-be entrepreneurs had to pound the
pavement to scrape together enough venture capital to get their
Internet companies off the ground. Today, with scores of Internet
startups touting marketable products and services, venture
capitalists are stumbling over one another to be the first to write
the checks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Boston Globe/Pricewaterhouse Coopers
Money Tree Venture Capital survey, of the 10 companies that
received the most venture capital in the April-to-June quarter,
seven were Internet-related. Following JuniorNet was $51 million
raised by Family Education Network of Boston, which offers on-line
educational services for kindergarten through 12th grade, and in
public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 56.4 percent of the more than $1 billion invested
regionally went to Internet-related businesses, such as electronic
commerce companies selling everything from home furnishings to
vitamins to travel reservation services.
</P>
<P>
   There were also business-to-business deals, such as eDOCs of
Westborough, Mass., which offers Internet companies a way to
present and collect payments from customers. Several on-line
training companies and investment service firms raised capital,
including Raging Bull of Andover, Mass., which was formed by two
recent college graduates. Plus there were substantial investments
in telecommunications and other technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing two projects per month and seeing 20 interesting
things that could be done with a high probability of success,''
said Ted R. Dintersmith, general manager at Charles River Ventures
in Waltham, Mass. ``We've stopped doing life science investments
partly because of the opportunities and challenges of the Internet
and telecommunications startups.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1.055 billion _ the second highest amount raised among
regions behind Silicon Valley _ was nearly triple the $379.5
million invested in the second quarter of 1998. Indeed, every other
region, except greater Philadelphia and Texas, saw significant
increases in venture capital spending.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, venture-backed investments in the second quarter
reached a record $7.67 billion, a 104 percent increase over the
$3.77 billion raised in the same quarter last year. Those dollars
also flowed into 30 percent more companies: 992 firms nationwide
compared to 763 businesses a year earlier. Average funding per
company also soared, up 57 percent to $7.4 million, versus $4.9
million a year ago. Nationwide investment in Internet-related
companies for the quarter was more than was raised in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another barometer of the health of venture-backed companies
nationwide is the amount that goes to early-stage financing. For
the second quarter, companies in startup and early stages of
development captured $3.12 billion, or 41 percent, of the total
invested nationally. Companies in the expansion stage accounted for
$2.7 million, or 35 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond New England and Silicon Valley, the Internet gold
rush fueled growth nationwide, as $3.8 billion went into 412
Internet-related firms, compared with $947 million in 174 such
firms in the 1998 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected investments to grow, but the magnitude of the
increase is absolutely stunning,'' said Patrick M. Gray, a partner
in PricewaterhouseCooper's Global Technology Industry Group in
Boston. ``Technology in general, and the Internet in particular,
are responsible for the leap. All the stars were aligned in the
second quater: a solid economy, a favorable initial public offering
market, and a strong stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England, Internet-based firms dominated many of the
company categories, including software and information services,
telecommunications, computer products, consumer, business services,
and retail. The biggest investments, such as in JuniorNet _ which
raised the single largest amount in the five-year history of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers venture capital survey _ went to companies
selling products and services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   JuniorNet's $70 million comes largely from RCN Corp. of
Princeton, N.J., which invested $47 million in the second-round
financing for a 43 percent stake in the company. Three venture
firms _ Euclid Partners, Boston Capital Ventures, and New World
Ventures _ put up the additional $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   RCN's president, David McCourt, said he invested after his
8-year-old son spent six hours using JuniorNet ``before he had to
be dragged away from it twice.'' RCN is one of the largest Internet
service providers in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many advertising-supported ``.com'' sites, JuniorNet is a
$9.95-per-month subscription service that combines a CD-ROM and an
on-line connection enabling kids age 3 and older to get access to
materials from publishers of children's magazines. Since Juniornet
was launched in April, Rothenberg, who declined to reveal
subscriber figures, said 30,000 families have requested information
about the service, which also limits children from gaining full
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``My original business plans called for $11 million in
financing, but to be a leader in the field we had to sign up more
partners for content. Plus, we bought a developer of children's
programming and we are growing faster than I expected,'' said
Rothenberg, who expects JuniorNet to spend more than $30 million in
advertising and promotion to create brand awareness starting this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies catering to a wider audience also attracted
large sums, such as MotherNature.com, a Concord, Mass. on-line
marketer of natural vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements that
raised $42 million from a dozen venture capital firms in a
third-round financing. It is spending $25 million for a national
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Darwinian business,'' Michael Barach, the president
of MotherNature.com, said in a recent interview. ``There are only
going to be a few electronic winners in each category. Everyone
else will die or merge.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, John Carson, president of Family Education Network,
learned that to be a major player in a large category, such as
on-line K-12 education, would require about $100 million of private
financing, before turning to Wall Street and an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has raised $71 million from a mix of venture
firms and such strategic partners as America Online; Intel Corp.;
Jostens Inc., the Minneapolis provider of class rings; and Harcourt
General Inc., publisher of educational and careeer training
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Like a television network supplying programming and other
services to its affiliated stations around the country,
FamilyEducation.com provides school systems in its network with a
mix of news, information, and educational trends and activities.
Aiming to be an on-line education community of teachers, parents,
and students, the company hopes to reach a wide audience through
its AOL and Harcourt General investors, Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising a lot of money sends a message to the venture
community about what it will take to back a competitor, plus it
protects us in a down IPO market,'' said Carson, whose 130-employee
company has signed up 870 school systems with 7,000 schools,
including 30 systems in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of New England's Internet- and technology-related
investments were in Massachusetts companies, 10 in Connecticut,
from a fledgling airline shuttle firm to a provider of
telecommunications services, captured nearly $120 million, or 11.4
percent of the more than $1 billion invested in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Bay State accounted for 85 percent of all venture
capital stakes in the region. The investments, dominated by deals
in communications, software and information services, and consumer
products. And while investments in health care and medical device
companies continue to rise, venture funding in such categories as
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology have plateaued or decreased
during the last three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is driving the big venture capital investment,
but when you look at the diversity of the region in
telecommunications, software, health care, and financial services,
New England not only holds its own, but it continues to prosper,''
said Michael Frank, a partner at Advanced Technology Ventures in
Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, funding throughout the nation was so strong that 15
venture capital companies each invested $15 million or more in the
second quarter, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, which surveyed
684 venture capital firms in late June and received 505 responses
for a 66.5 percent return rate.

ENGLISH ACTIVIST MONITORS CRA RESULTS IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Mallon came to Boston last week to learn about the Community
Reinvestment Act, the law that requires banks to make loans in
low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Senator Phil Gramm couldn't have come along. Gramm,
the Texas Republican who is doing his best to gut the law, might
have learned a thing or two about CRA, and why, for all its flaws,
it is worth preserving.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mallon is an activist in her native England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Liverpool,'' she said, when she introduced herself.
``It's where the Beatles are from.'' A tiny woman of 61, with big
gold loop earrings, Mallon got involved in banking issues two years
ago when Lloyd TS Group, a big British bank, decided to close its
branch in her working-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Another big bank had previously pulled out, and the neighborhood
was about to be left with just a single bank branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a great inconvenience, especially for older
people,'' said Mallon who, on her own, organized a petition drive
to keep the bank from closing.
</P>
<P>
   She got 4,000 signatures, delivered them to the bank's
headquarters in London, and won at least a temporary stay of
execution for the branch. ``Pat Saves Bank: Gran wins reprieve for
local branch,'' read the headline in the Liverpool Echo, a tabloid
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The British Broadcasting Corporation heard about Mallon's
exploits and decided it would make a good story to bring her to
America to see how city neighborhoods fare in a country where banks
are legally required to invest there. Britain has no equivalent of
the CRA law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain, low-income customers are viewed as a nuisance,''
said Paul Charles, one of two BBC reporters who came last week.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters picked Boston, specifically BankBoston, after
surfing the Internet and discovering that the bank has a good track
record of urban investment.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't your usual tour of Boston. No Freedom Trail or Fenway
Park. Mallon and the two reporters drove through Roxbury and
Dorchester, and heard about the progress the neighborhoods have
made with the help of bank lending. All of Boston's major banks
have beefed up their central city investments, particularly home
mortgage lending.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime the group gathered at BankBoston's Codman Square
branch for a discussion about banks and poor neighborhoods. The
issue is of concern on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Tony Blair has focused
attention on the plight of the ``socially excluded'' _ British for
poor _ and he wants the private sector to do something about it.
``Social exclusion can only be overcome with the help of business
which has abandoned many inner-city areas,'' said Blair in a recent
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The banks in England have a presence in low-income areas, but it
has been shrinking. According to Mallon, customers have been put
off by high fees and complicated rules that make many people
ineligible to have bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In England, as here, the banks, looking to cut costs, want
customers to do business over the Internet and the phone rather
than in traditional branches. Mallon made it clear that she and her
friends don't have computers and aren't comfortable banking by
phone. For them, the bank branch is vital to the health of the
whole community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the banks, the whole area would go; it would be a
ghost town,'' she said of her Liverpool neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, there are bank branches sprinkled throughout the
city. In part, that is because of CRA. Under pressure from both the
law and community activists, the local banks made a commitment to
the neighborhoods that continues to this day. The banks went in
grudgingly, but along the way they made a discovery: They could
actually make a buck in low-income neighborhoods on everything from
mortgages to mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Callahan said CRA was critical to the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without it, the banks would have continued to ignore the
opportunities in these neighborhoods,'' said Callahan, head of the
Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have learned to live with CRA. But not Phil Gramm. The
program sticks in his conservative craw. Gramm says the law
``collectivizes the American financial market,'' and is a
government scheme to redistribute wealth. He also argues that
community groups have used the law to extract ``outright bribes''
from banks that need regulatory approval for mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has a point there. Activists sometimes have used CRA to
extort money from banks. But, on balance, the law has done more
good than harm. It has helped bring poor neighborhoods into the
economic mainstream and minimized the ``social exclusion'' some
city dwellers might otherwise feel. Sometimes the free market needs
a push in the right direction. CRA has provided that shove.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mallon seemed to agree. There are cultural differences
between England and America, she said, but the notion that banks
should be required to invest in urban neighborhoods makes sense in
both places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea,'' said Mallon about the CRA concept. ``It
makes things better for people.''

HOT NEW MASSAGE LATEST TREND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Forget oxygen treatments, full-body mud wraps, and
sugar-sand body polishes. These days relaxation therapists have
gotten their hands on a steamy new trend: hot stone massage.
</P>
<P>
   In this painless process, warm stones are rubbed along the hills
and valleys of a body's muscles. The combination of heat and
massage, therapists believe, can turn beef-jerky muscles into filet
mignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penetration of heat allows us to get into muscles
deeper,'' says Helen Cooper, a massage therapist at Le Pli, a
Cambridge spa that added the massage to its menu nine months ago.
``It's much more relaxing. It increases the circulation and brings
blood to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Bella Sante The Spa began offering hot rock Reiki, an
alternative form of hot stone massage, seven months ago. ``A lot of
people walk into the store and have never had a massage,'' says
Tiffany Amorosino, co-owner of Bella Sante, ``or don't really know
much about it. We find that the stones do a great job of relaxing
them immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot stone massage began creeping into spas in Chicago, Los
Angeles, and New York just over a year ago. It's become so popular
that Allure and Glamour magazines recently noted the nationwide
trend.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the hot stone craze is generally credited to Mary
Nelson-Hannigan, an Arizona woman who developed what she calls Le
Stone Therapy in 1993. Since then she's taught the technique to
1,530 massage therapists and 109 spas, beginning with Miraval in
Tucson about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hannigan's technique combines hot basalt and cold marble stones.
In addition to having the rocks rubbed on their bodies, customers
lie on a combination of stones and have them rested on their
foreheads, stomachs, and in their hands. The body is completely
enveloped in comforting warmth, although you can get a little
sweaty if only hot stones are used.
</P>
<P>
   Hannigan says the technique came to her through channeling and
prayer, an experience she explains in detail on Le Stone Therapy's
web site (www.lastonetherapy.com). She states her goal as providing
a spiritual, rather than physical, healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body workers, healers, medicine men, shamans _ they've been
using stones for healing work on the human body forever,'' asserts
Hannigan, restating information she's learned about healing stones
from the University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Institution, and
the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost our connection with nature,'' she adds. ``Very few
people go camping or fishing or just hiking in the woods. When you
lay on those stones, especially when hot and cold are used, it
takes you instantly back to those memories of fishing or hiking or
climbing a rock. That's why people hunger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all rather New Age. In fact, it's too New Age for most
local spas. ``We don't incorporate all that into our massage
because, you know, people have so many different beliefs,'' says
Valarie Maloff, director at Guiliano's, the only Boston spa
authorized to do Le Stone Therapy. For clients, ``it might be a bit
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Christine Ford, owner of Lenox Myotherapy and Massage
Clinic in Lenox, Mass. who trained Le Pli therapists, more bluntly
puts it, Hannigan ``goes the more hairy fairy channel. I go through
the medical model. I got my feet on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a registered nurse, picked up the technique by watching
massage therapists at Miraval. She passes on the basalt and marble
stones used by Le Stone Therapy followers, incorporating rocks
found at New England beaches instead. Unlike many other local spas,
she uses both hot and cold stones.
</P>
<P>
   Bella Sante has also put its own stamp on the hot stone
blueprint. The spa combines energizing Reiki, the Japanese method
of healing through touch, with heated stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to do Le Stone Therapy because it just didn't
jibe with who we are,'' says Amorosino.
</P>
<P>
   Such modifications don't give customers the full thrust of Le
Stone Therapy, Hannigan says. ``They have the application of the
stone on the body but they don't have the full function of the
energetic exchange that's going on with the hot and cold, the human
body and the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative methods do incorporate the benefits of heat into
massage, says Chris Troyanos, director of sports therapy at Babson
College who has worked as a co-medical coordinator for the Boston
Marathon for 22 years. Troyanos believes heat, whether applied via
a whirlpool or hot pack, aids in massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helpful in getting tissues more pliable before going in
with your hands and fingers,'' he says. ``I would imagine the heat
of rocks are kind of the same effect.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing hot stone massage recipients should watch for are
burns, Troyanos says. (During my hot stone massages at Le Pli and
Giuliano's, piping hot stones were placed on my skin. Just ask the
massage therapist to take them off.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had burns because the therapist has not empowered
the client to say, `It's too hot,' '' says Hannigan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential danger, most therapists believe customers
will thaw to hot stone massage in time. Bella Sante reports an
increase in demand after the establishment (and its hot Reiki
massage) was named best new city day spa in the August issue of
Boston magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my own experience I'm doing it much more,'' says Le Pli's
Cooper, but ``it's still a novelty.''

   ATLANTA _ On a Sunday in downtown Atlanta, weekday traffic
congestion is mercifully absent. Office buildings are shut down
tight, stores are closed and the sidewalks are not crowded with
visitors. But there is plenty of life in some of the city's oldest
churches.
</P>
<P>
   At Central Presbyterian Church across from the state Capitol,
tables are set with white tablecloths and red napkins for the
old-fashioned Sunday dinner the church has hosted since many of its
middle-aged members were children. Next door, at the Shrine of the
Immaculate Conception, a priest will offer food of a different kind
as he prepares the bread and wine of the Eucharist that Catholics
consider the body and blood of Christ. And, around the corner at
Trinity United Methodist, adults are gathered in Sunday School to
share their stories with their new minister, the Rev. Cornelius
Minor, assigned to the church just this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away on Auburn Avenue, a sign in front of Big
Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church apologizes for
construction: ``Please Pardon Our Progress.'' At historic Wheat
Street Baptist Church, young Jasmine Garrett is being baptized into
the fold. ``My dear sister,'' the Rev. Michael Harris calls her as
he pushes her under water in the name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost. Across Auburn Avenue in the new sunlight-filled Ebenezer
Baptist Church, Atlanta's church of Kings, the Rev. Mary Finley is
praising God, proclaiming, ``Church, this is the day that the Lord
has made. We should rejoice and be glad in it!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these houses of worship have seen the town once called
Terminus through Civil War and Civil Rights, through booming growth
and urban decline. But they are only a handful of almost 2,000
churches scattered across metro Atlanta from Buford to Brooks.
Those, in turn, are a tiny sampling of more than 250,000 Christian
congregations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From the simplest clapboard cabin where unaccompanied voices are
raised in hymns hundreds of years old, to the most modern
mega-church with its orchestra and drama troupe, Christian
congregations are part of the warp and weft of America's history
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their buildings are a network of clinics and hospitals,
schools and universities, soup kitchens and homeless shelters
operated in the name of Jesus, the Nazarene man born some 2,000
years ago whom Christians regard as the messiah.
</P>
<P>
   His American followers have created powerful lobbying groups in
Washington and in state houses across the country where they are
part of the establishment and the anti-establishment on issues from
race relations to labor law to medical research. Since colonial
days, Christian people and churches have played significant roles
in the good, bad and ugly of American history _ they have preached
slavery and abolition, segregation and integration, war and peace,
social reform and the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Christian voices have produced the literature, theater, art and
music of their country _ from Southern Catholic Flannery O'Connor's
writings to the singing style of rock 'n' roll's King, Elvis
Presley, whose feet were firmly planted in gospel music. Phrases
from the Christian scriptures, such as ``prodigal son'' and ``good
Samaritan'' have become common usage.
</P>
<P>
   Even the names of many of America's children _ Mary and Matthew
and Mark _ are from the Christian gospels. And the best known of
modern-era American reformers _ Martin Luther King Jr. _ is the
namesake of an earlier Christian reformer.
</P>
<P>
   But as American culture has changed, so has American
Christianity. The oldest groups _ the Episcopalians and
Presbyterians, for instance _ have influence that exceeds their
numbers, while conservative Christians, under the label
``evangelical'' have set up not only powerful churches but a
parallel culture. They have borrowed some elements from the
American-born Pentecostal movement, an exuberant form of
Christianity that accepts such practices as speaking in unknown
tongues and which, from its beginnings a century ago, has become
the fastest-growing form of Christianity around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipers entering a modern evangelical or Pentecostal church
are likely to hear tunes that could come from rock and country
radio stations. At home, they can watch sweaty preachers behind
plexiglass pulpits speaking to a television audience of millions.
Or, in their cars they can opt for Christian music, Christian talk
radio or even the daily news from a Christian point of view. They
can subscribe to Christian newspapers and Christian magazines, shop
for Christian greeting cards and gifts at Christian stores, and
wear T-shirts and baseball caps with Christian slogans to Christian
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that it's a two-way
street,'' said Erskine Clarke, professor of American religious
history at Columbia Theological Seminary, an institution of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in Decatur. ``On the one hand, it
would be very difficult to understand traditional American values
and institutions apart from western Christianity ... On the other
hand, Christianity in this country is, in many ways, distinctly
North American.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not, however, remained in North America. An unprecedented
missionary force, followed by international broadcasts, have taken
Christianity, American style, around the world, imprinting
proselytes with a faith filled with Western cultural icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Christian missionaries also brought
along western culture,'' said Stephen Gunter, professor of
evangelism at Emory University's Candler School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   North America's multifaceted brand of Christianity is manifested
in styles as diverse as its beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the so-called Founding Fathers sailed from Britain,
Spanish Catholic priests traveled into the Southwestern United
States and Florida to convert Native Americans. Others, mostly
French, brought Catholicism down the Mississippi River out of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 1492 when, as the child's poem goes, Columbus sailed
the ocean blue, he expressed hope in his first diary entry that he
would be able to contact native peoples to ``determine the manner
in which may be undertaken their conversion to our Holy Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic presence in America is easily seen in the names of
cities such as St. Augustine, Los Angeles and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   With the British Colonial movement, Anglicanism came to North
America, bringing the first wave of the Protestantism that was to
dominate American society. In this country's first English
settlement, Jamestown, the Book of Common Prayer was gospel. Within
a few years of the 1607 settlement, law compelled residents to
attend worship services and catechism classes, and imposed a death
penalty _ never really enforced _ for three unexcused absences.
There were also laws against gaming and intemperance.
</P>
<P>
   This stringent approach to Christianity showed shades of the
Puritanism that was soon to come to more northern colonies _
Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire_as dissenters from
Anglicanism fled England. The Puritans, whose name came from their
desire to purify the church of England from such fancies as liturgy
and clerical robes, in turn exiled people who failed to live up to
their high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Rhode Island soon became a refuge for Baptists _ but was
still rooted in Puritanism.
</P>
<P>
   Puritans ``set the pace for the religious life of New England,''
wrote Catherine L. Albanese, author of ``America Religions and
Religion.'' They tried to shape government according to what they
saw as Biblical teaching, extending their belief in a
congregation-based structure to a suspicion of federalism in
government. Because of their belief in education, they established
schools, including Harvard and Yale universities.
</P>
<P>
   Puritans were not the only Christian souls seeking religious
freedom to come to North America. They were joined by the new wave
of Roman Catholics who founded Maryland _ and soon faced
discrimination in their own colony, the French Protestant Huguenots
in the Carolinas, Quakers in Pennsylvania, and Protestant sects
from Germany, Holland and Sweden in the Middle Atlantic colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, circuit riders were carrying Methodism to the
farthest corners of the new land, and the American Episcopal church
separated from its English home church soon after the colonies won
their independence from the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant segment of American society was the converged
membership of these groups _ ``a quite white, middle class,
mainstream Protestantism,'' said David Hackett, a associate
professor of religion at the University of Florida. ``The influence
has been tremendous and pervasive and long-lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett credits this generic Protestantism with giving Americans
a strong dose of individualism, which can be traced back to
Reformation doctrine that people are ultimately responsible for
their own relationship with God. He also sees it in the American
impulse to be thrifty and work hard, qualities that have led to a
strong emphasis on capitalism, economic development and
materialism.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants established laws that closed businesses on Sunday,
and set up entertainment standards that today are regarded as
prudish. Married couples on TV in the 1950s and early '60s _ such
as Rob and Laura Petrie on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' _ had to
sleep in twin beds; Lucille Ball and Ricky Ricardo had to film the
``I Love Lucy'' episodes about the birth of Little Ricky without
once using the word ``pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were other voices _ especially the growing
Catholic church and the socially active black Protestant
denominations _ the one that ruled was ``the dominant voice of the
dominant class,'' Hackett said. ``They stamped the world in their
image.''
</P>
<P>
   A sort of ``secularized Christianity'' or ``residual
Protestantism'' is so much a part of American culture that people
do not even notice it or define it as such, Hackett said. ``It is
part of the air we breathe. We don't see it. It's the way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it may be the absence of state sanction for any one
form of Christianity that has contributed to its pervasiveness and
endurance as an American cultural force.
</P>
<P>
   In this nation's earliest days, its founders realized they had
diverse ideas about church and government, practice and doctrine.
If they were to form a more perfect union, they knew there could be
no established church.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when the Bill of Rights was written for the new
Constitution, it expressly forbade government enforcement of any
religious belief. But it also clearly guaranteed the right to
follow one's faith without government interference.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a free market and an aggressive effort among some
quarters to proselytize, adding to the numbers and the coffers of
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a church couldn't get a congregation to support it, it
simply withered on the vine,'' said Edwin Gaustadt, author of
``Religious History of America,'' and professor emeritus of
religion at the University of California, Riverside. ``Many people
thought that was a mistake. In the long view of history, it has
worked much better for the United States than the system in
European nations where churches continued to have state support.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of security gave American Christianity a need for
renewal and revival. Great revival movements have spawned new
fervor and some new forms of Christianity, including modern-day
Pentecostalism.
</P>
<P>
   Older denominations have split and merged, taking on new names
and modifying their doctrine, powerful African-American
denominations developed, and some new religions evolved, such as
the Christian Scientists, Jehovah's Witnesses and Latter-day
Saints_ all made possible by the free enterprise system of religion
in America. And waves of new immigrants have made Catholics the
single largest Christian group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy visit to America, Frenchman Alexis de
Tocqueville wrote in 1835, ``There is no country in the world where
the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls
of men than in America.'' Many would question whether that holds
true at the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On paper a far larger percentage of Americans are church members
than in the earliest days, when barely one in 10 Americans were
likely to belong to congregations. The main reason for that is not
an increase in religious commitment but a slackening of membership
standards, said Bruce Holifield, professor of American church
history at Emory's Candler School of Theology. Around the time of
the Revolutionary War, church membership involved lengthy training
and questioning, and a willingness to subject oneself to the
discipline of the congregation, he said. Many more people attended
church than joined.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll conducted in May 1999 showed that 71 percent of
those questioned _ who were overwhelmingly Christian _ claimed to
be a member of a church or synagogue, and 44 percent said they
attend almost every week. Studies of actual people in the pews put
that figure lower.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of this country's historically dominant faith has
been diluted in the modern age by differences within Christianity
and increasing numbers of non-Christian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that about 20 percent of Americans are diligently
practicing Christians from the 17th century to the present,'' said
Holifield, but they are more diverse in their beliefs and practices
than their ancestors. He predicts that no single religious group in
the future will be able to wield the kind of power the Protestants
did for the nation's first 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The May Gallup poll shows that many Americans agree. Sixty-two
percent of those questioned said religion as a whole is losing its
influence on American life, compared to 32 percent who felt it was
increasing. At no time since 1957 has a Gallup poll shown that a
majority of Americans believed religion is gaining in influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1999, we are unmistakably and undeniably a pluralistic
nation,'' Gaustadt said. ``We've been one for a long time, but
people could ignore the evidence. I don't think it's possible to
ignore any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians continue to influence American culture ``from the
grass roots up _ that is from the local communities and from human
hearts,'' he said, and that is the way faith should exert its
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably impossible to separate American culture from its
biblical roots as far as values are concerned,'' Gaustadt said,
``but as far as power structures are concerned, I think it's not
only possible to separate them, but absolutely essential to do
so.''

<P>
   WEST BARNSTABLE, Mass. _ From the high pulpit, the Rev. Reed
Baer gazes down upon a congregation with a lineage beginning before
the Pilgrims landed.
</P>
<P>
   From the hard wooden benches and ancient family pews known as
``sheep pens,'' the West Parish flock listens to Baer's challenge
to ``live up to the vision of our founders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a very personal feeling in this old church. The way
it's laid out. The sense that the congregation is a caring
community. The connection to history,'' observes Gary Morris, a
young businessman sitting near the back with his wife, Meg, and
their infant son, Ian. ``You can't help thinking back to a time
when church was a much bigger part of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are Sundays in the oldest continuously operating
Congregational Church in America, where the Sabbath is heralded by
the pealing of a bell made by Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1717, worshippers have assembled in this steepled, wooden
meeting house on Cape Cod. The congregation traces its roots back a
century more, however, to a group of religious reformers led by
Henry Jacob. These so-called Separatists first met secretly outside
London in 1616, four years before the Pilgrims came to the New
World and settled in nearby Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Jacob called his new church ``Congregational.'' While
Puritans wanted to reform or ``purify'' the Church of England,
Separatists wanted to break away completely. Believing that each
congregation could perform all church functions and choose its own
leaders, the Congregationalists were among the Separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Jacob died in 1624, about 30 of his followers
came to Massachusetts with their new pastor, the Rev. John Lothrop.
Lothrop led the Congregationalists to found Barnstable in 1639. The
settlement grew and divided into East and West Parishes as the
1700s began. The West Parish Meeting House opened its doors in
1717.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in this historic church. The ``tithingman'' no
longer sits beneath the high pulpit wielding a long pole with a
feather on one end and an iron ball on the other. If a man dozed
off during the service, the tithingman would rap his head with the
ball. A sleepy woman would be tickled under the nose with the
feather.
</P>
<P>
   Sermons lasted two hours back then, pointed out Baer, compared
to about 15 minutes nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining West Parish, pioneer members had to credibly
testify to their redemption. Testimony of a conversion experience
is no longer required. The ``sheep pens'' are no longer deeded to
prominent families; anyone can sit in these family pews. While
early members sang psalms without musical instruments, today's
congregation is accompanied on hymns by a pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   However, the church clings to a heritage of independence. West
Parish still has its own covenant, promising not only ``to walk
together in Christian love'' but also to ``forswear all pettiness,
gossip and slander,'' and members agree to abide by its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are still elected. Before being hired about a
year ago, Baer was required to preach a trial sermon and then leave
the church while the congregation voted.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in the pews
</P>
<P>
   The parish has about 280 members, plus 110 children who aren't
counted until their confirmation in about the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for many different reasons,'' Baer said. Some are
following a family tradition. Others are on a spiritual search.
Many come for their children, he said. They grew up in the church,
drifted away as young adults, then returned to give their offspring
the same religious grounding their parents gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precious few come for the preaching,'' the minister said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps personifying how the Lord works in mysterious ways, the
reverend himself took a roundabout route to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a recovering lawyer,'' he explained. ``This is my first
church.''
</P>
<P>
   A practicing attorney for 12 years near Boston, Baer was a
deacon and Sunday school teacher in a Congregational church and the
father of two young children when his wife was diagnosed with
breast cancer. The crisis caused both to examine their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After considering teaching, ``I began to realize that I was
called to the ordained ministry,'' Baer said. ``I believe there is
more need in the world for my work in the church than there was for
my work as a lawyer. It seems there are plenty of lawyers to make
the world go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After his wife died, he graduated from theological school. He
has since remarried, and his second wife had a son several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a visitor, he reflected on history and religion
in this historic community he now calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Separatists and Puritans viewed themselves as living
in exile, as conducting an experiment in the wilderness _ which it
was, literally,'' he explained. ``Some would view the church today
as also in a time of exile. We are no longer in a churched society.
While as recently as the '50s, being a church member was part and
parcel of the American experience, today church is increasingly an
option that many in our society don't take up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church no longer has the power and influence it once
wielded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wide-ranging beliefs
</P>
<P>
   On page 365 of the Pilgrim Hymnal is the song ``Faith of Our
Fathers,'' with its stirring chorus, ``Faith of our fathers, Holy
Faith. We will be true to thee 'til death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the founding fathers of West Parish might be surprised at
the wide-ranging faith of their spiritual heirs on Meeting House
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worship doesn't have to be pious _ as long as you believe in
the basics,'' said Faith Chapman, who defined the basics as belief
in Jesus Christ as Savior. ``God is either male or female, if we
are created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Chapman and her husband, Sid, are a retired couple from
Connecticut and have attended church regularly since their marriage
in 1955. They like the liberal leanings of Congregational theology.
</P>
<P>
   So does Meg Morris, who was raised a Catholic but grew to
dislike the religion's formality and structure and rules regarding
women. During their courtship, she and Gary often rode a tandem
bicycle past the historic church while training for a race. They
decided to wed there and continued to attend services after the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I look forward to Sundays,'' Meg said. ``And for our son,
I think it's important that he grow up with that connection with
church and God and for him to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Diamond grew up Jewish, and says he still ``doesn't
believe in Jesus the way others in the congregation do.''
</P>
<P>
   While describing himself as ``not the most religious person in
the world,'' the young dentist said it's important that his
children grow up with values and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to church for the family time together,'' he said. ``And
I enjoy the sermons.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Trisha, was raised as a Lutheran. She said she came to
West Parish after seeing other Cape Cod churches spurn a young
woman who was eight months pregnant with twins and wanted to stand
before an altar to marry the father. West Parish did not spurn
them, and the couple were wed in the historic Congregational
meeting house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn sinners away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a caring church _ a friendly church _
regardless of who ministers it,'' said Jane Clingham, who has been
a member for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each minister comes in and cooperates with the congregation,
but each has his own ideas and goals, too,'' said Silja Emrich, who
joined West Parish in 1957. ``Each leaves his own mark, and with
each we've learned and grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Guided by a covenant
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cross, a gilded rooster on a weather vane sits atop
the steeple of the West Parish Meeting House. Brought over from
England in 1723, the rooster is a symbol dating back to the Last
Supper, according to parish historian Bob Russell.
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus told his disciples that they would soon desert him,
Peter protested. Jesus said, ``Truly I tell you, this very night
before the cock crows thrice, you will deny me three times.'' When
the prediction came to pass, Peter heard a cock crow and broke down
and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Russell explained, the crowing rooster has been a
reminder for Christians to stand up for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like the crowing rooster, the covenant has been part of West
Parish longer than any current member can recall. Although
associated with the United Church of Christ, each Congregational
parish has its own such set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   The covenant provides clues to what the congregation was
concerned about at the time of adoption, Baer said. West Parish
decided ``pettiness, gossip and slander'' were of such magnitude
that the covenant should require members to agree to give up such
actions ``in our dealings with one another and with all people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly when this covenant was adopted, Baer said,
and time may be nearing for the congregation to consider revisions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process even older than this historic meeting house,
dating back to Henry Jacob, who decreed Congregational churches are
constituted ``by a free mutual consent of believers joining and
covenanting to live as members of a holy society together in all
religious and virtuous duties as Christ and his Apostles did
institute and practice in the Gospel.

   ATLANTA _ The view that greets people who drive through Atlanta
at night is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   A sparkling collection of high-rise office buildings, banks and
hotels greet motorists on the Downtown Connector as the freeway
cuts through the city. The sleek skyline is testimony to Atlanta's
growing power and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Grady Memorial Hospital stands yet another Atlanta
landmark. But this one is easy to miss. It's a faded, blue neon
sign that declares, ``Jesus Saves.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign, attached to Big Bethel African Methodist Episcopal
Church _ the city's oldest black church _ has offered comfort to
generations of blacks who had little hope of gaining power or
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   It was the church that held them together when racism threatened
to tear them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that psychiatrist office that you don't have to pay
for,'' said Big Bethel's pastor, the Rev. James Davis. ``It's that
entertainment center that's free. It is everything to a people that
have nothing. Without the black church, we as a people would not be
what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would America be what it is.
</P>
<P>
   As Christianity approaches the millennium, the black church has
raised its profile. Gospel music blares from movie soundtracks and
McDonald's commercials. Cable television is full of black _ and
white _ preachers delivering sermons filled with the poetic rhythms
of traditional black preaching. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
inextricably linked to the African-American church, has become an
American icon.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this growing recognition, the value of the black
church is still underrated, said Robert Franklin, president of the
Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC), a religious graduate
school based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said the black church, by launching the civil rights
movement, inspired liberation struggles in places as diverse and
distant as Central America and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped reposition Christianity not as a religion for the
oppressors and as the ideology for dominant classes,'' Franklin
said. ``It was the black church's reposition of Christianity that
made it more appealing to other Third World people who were very
ambivalent about Christianity's relevance.''
</P>
<P>
   The black church's beginning was bitter, forged in the crucible
of slavery. Scholars estimate that the first black churches were
created in the 1790s when slaves left the segregated pews of white
churches to form their own houses of worship. Big Bethel, first
known as ``Union Church,'' was formed in 1847.
</P>
<P>
   These first black churches offered a brief refuge from slavery,
a place where enslaved blacks could throw themselves into worship _
shouting, stomping, weeping, even collapsing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the difficult and dehumanizing nature of their work,
they created a sacred space as a zone of ultimate freedom,''
Franklin writes in ``Another Day's Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aware that they would soon have to return to the boredom and
dread of field work, slaves threw themselves fully into the worship
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Toby Sanders, 37, the son of a preacher and a recent graduate of
ITC, said the emotion of the black church restores his soul. Black
church spirituals such as ``His Eyes On The Sparrow,'' he said,
touch him in a way that white hymns do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black music is the most evocative and emotional music in the
world,'' Sanders said. ``It's very personal. It's gotten me through
some difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   The black church has gotten many people through difficult times.
During segregation, Big Bethel became the church for many of
Georgia's first black elected officials, teachers and
entrepreneurs. Morris Brown College, the state's only college
founded by blacks, started in the church's basement.
</P>
<P>
   The church held political rallies, voter registration drives and
graduation ceremonies. Courtship, business connections, political
favors _ all were secured within Big Bethel's walls, said Herman
``Skip'' Mason, an Atlanta historian and ordained minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no such thing as the separation of church and state
at Big Bethel,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case at most black churches where the mission was
both sacred and secular, transforming lives and society.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. expressed this vision powerfully in an
article he wrote for the Christian Century magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any religion that professes to be concerned about the souls of
men and is not concerned about the slums that damn them, the
economic conditions that strangle them and the social conditions
that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion awaiting
burial,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement that King led could not have existed
without the black church's spiritual inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South is a very different place than it was 50 years ago
and that's been because of the civil rights movement,'' said Andrew
Billingsley, author of ``Mighty Like a River.'' ``The civil rights
movement was made possible because of the black church. The black
church provided spiritual resources, leadership and places to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bethel continues to carry on such a mission today. The
tactics, however, have changed. Forty years ago, blacks wanted to
sit at the front of the bus. Today, they want to learn how to own
the bus company.
</P>
<P>
   Economic empowerment is the magic phrase that black churches are
brandishing now. New problems require new tactics. A march does
little to correct problems such as the growth of single-family
families, the widening gap between the black middle-class and
underclass, and the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bethel's Davis said the church is reviving its community
through entrepreneurship. When Davis became pastor in 1992, the
church had not bought property in 40 years. The Auburn Avenue
neighborhood that it stood in was degenerating into a collection of
boarded-up houses, dilapidated businesses and grungy nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the church has bought 13 pieces of
property in the area, including a nightclub, a grocery store, and
several small buildings. One structure will house a federally
insured credit union, and the hope is that others will be
transformed into a multi-purpose community center that will handle
everything from day care to job training.
</P>
<P>
   The church sees a divine obligation to remain in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody is going to run from the valley, we're saying
that the valley is damned,'' Davis said. ``If there's anything
we're saying it's that it's in the valley where ministry should be
developed. That's where you get the best results.''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders within the black church community have drawn
similar conclusions, deciding it is up to them to revive the black
community. Even conservative scholars think faith-based
institutions offer the best chance of changing the lives of poor,
inner-city blacks.
</P>
<P>
   So outreach programs have become a mainstay of most major black
churches.
</P>
<P>
   New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur developed a
program that has the church adopting welfare families and providing
them with financial assistance while leading them toward
independence. And Antioch Baptist Church North offers several
innovative programs to reach drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an effort to place their own houses in order, a
new generation of black pastors is going back to school to earn
business degrees. Some churches, seeking greater economic control
and self reliance, have even hired business experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black church has traditionally been a church of volunteers
that work very well on programs like feeding programs and clothing
drives,'' Billingsley said. ``But if you're doing things like
economic community development, ministers have to get technical
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in recent years of the black mega-church _ New Birth
Missionary Baptist Church and World Changers are two of the largest
in metro Atlanta _ is creating yet another challenge within the
black community.
</P>
<P>
   More members _ mega-churches have at least 5,000 congregants and
often four times that number _ mean more political power for the
church. But the intimate style of worship that has been a mainstay
within the black church is difficult to hold onto at mega-churches,
some members say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know everybody,'' said Angella Christie, a
member of New Birth, which has 23,000 members. ``You feel like
you're more at a university, where there's more responsibility for
you to grow because one pastor can't talk to 23,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   And ITC's Franklin is concerned that the rise of more affluent
black churches could also erode the church's tradition of activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not careful, we're going to drift into cultural
Christianity,'' Franklin said. ``The black middle-class will be
completely assimilated into the ethos of the surrounding culture
with its emphasis on individualism and materialism. I hear it all
the time around me and it makes me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, sees progress around his church. It continues
fulfilling the mission that began at Big Bethel more than 150 years
ago, telling black folks that Jesus saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be landowners,'' Davis said. ``We're trying
to restore our community and we're trying to make a commitment that
honors the presence of the Lord's house in it.''

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Franciscan friar Herbert Jones stands in
front of the his congregation calling out the names of states like
a teacher checking attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska.'' Applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illinois.'' Applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine.'' Applause.
</P>
<P>
   After exhausting the list, he asks: ``Did I miss any states?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas,'' a woman tells him. The congregation applauds.
</P>
<P>
   On any Sunday, crammed into one of America's oldest Roman
Catholic churches, San Jose in San Antonio, tourists from across
America, mostly descended from European immigrants, worship beside
the predominantly Hispanic congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the San Jose worshippers represent the old and new
faces of American Catholicism, an immigrant church that now makes
up a quarter of the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   Once a church that mostly grappled with America's crowded
eastern shores of poor, unskilled immigrant laborers from such
countries as Ireland, Germany, Poland and Italy, the Catholic
Church in the United States will end the millennium with a chasm
between its now largely white assimilated members and a new crop of
immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distinct cultures, languages and diversity in the church
is a beautiful thing, but it is not without tension,'' said Bishop
Joseph A. Fiorenza of Houston, president of the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops. ``We are one family, and that's what we have
to continually talk about to our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Catholic, Christopher Columbus, set foot in the
New World in 1492, the church in America has weathered a roller
coaster ride of internal challenges, from its treatment of Indians
to dealing with the economic and ethnic tensions among its
immigrant flock.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the continuing drama plays out in a church struggling to
find enough priests to serve both its English-speaking and
non-English-speaking parishioners while trying to provide adequate
social services, education and Masses for its varied cultures and
age groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big problems for the church,'' said Catholic
sociologist and best-selling author the Rev. Andrew Greeley of
Chicago. ``The Catholic Church is confusion and crisis at the
institutional level and flourishing at the parish level.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, many Catholic scholars agree, is bigger than any
conflicts between the Vatican and American Catholics over such
issues as birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the ideological issues ... are white people's,
college-educated issues,'' said the Rev. Norbert Brockman, a
political science and history professor at St. Mary's University in
San Antonio. ``A big issue is going to be the question of what is
the role of the church with the decline of clergy? That's a very
critical question.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests and nuns have always played an important role in
America's church and social development, from creating schools and
hospitals to backing labor unions and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   The first clergy in the New World were Franciscan friars,
brought by Spanish explorers to set up missions, like San Jose in
1720, that served double duty as government outposts and Indian
conversion centers. The first one was established in St. Augustine,
Fla., in 1565.
</P>
<P>
   But as the colonies emerged in the Northeast, most Catholics
were barred from voting or holding public office by the predominant
Protestant society. Catholics sought refuge in Maryland, but
Protestants passed laws making it illegal for Catholics to
construct public houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually John Carroll, a Jesuit priest who was the son of an
aristocratic Catholic family in Maryland, would become head of the
first diocese in the United States, founded in Baltimore in 1789.
He would wrestle with his own priest shortage to serve the
estimated 35,000 Catholics then in the United States _ numbers that
paled compared to Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   All that would change in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
when millions of European Catholics, escaping poor economic
conditions and political unrest, came to the United States in
search of a better life. Coming with them were priests _ lots of
priests _ who would follow the poor, unskilled immigrant laborers
from crowded ethnic ghettos in New York to cities and farm towns
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under this migration, Catholicism became the largest
denomination in the nation _ a place it still holds today.
</P>
<P>
   As the church exploded with immigrants, numbers alone did not
protect Catholics and their priests from discrimination. They were
denied jobs, tarred and feathered, even hanged for their beliefs.
In the pews, Catholics themselves were prejudiced against their own
brethren, building churches and communities that resulted in ethnic
enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish bishops were never crazy about having a lot of
Italians in their diocese,'' said Larry Cunningham, a theology
professor at Notre Dame University.
</P>
<P>
   The descendents of those immigrants, educated and middle-class,
would blend together in the suburbs in the late '40s, '50s and
'60s, giving rise to well-heeled, Anglo Catholics more likely to
identify themselves by the states they live in than their ethnic
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the church's adherents in the United
States today are Anglo, but the fastest-growing communities in the
church are its Hispanic, Asian and African populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the church, internally, has to deal with issues of
race on a large scale,'' said Jim Davidson, a Catholic sociologist
at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Catholic Church estimates a quarter of its population
is Hispanic, and by far the largest influx of the church's
immigrants are coming from Mexico and South America, where the
populations are 85 to 95 percent Catholic. Like the European
immigrants before them, they are mostly poor and laborers. They are
spreading out across the United States, bringing growing Hispanic
populations to the South, Midwest and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago has a larger Hispanic population than San Antonio
right now,'' said the Rev. David Garcia, the rector at San
Antonio's historic San Fernando Cathedral. ``I was in Milwaukee in
June, and there is a Hispanic population growing there now, and the
same thing in Minneapolis-St. Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Bend, Ind., home of Notre Dame, there are 4,000
Hispanics, Cunningham said. ``And we don't even have 100,000 people
in South Bend,'' he added. ``And I don't think there is a Hispanic
priest in South Bend.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the church's Asian and African immigrants are coming to
the United States as college students, for jobs they have waiting
for them or to be reunited with family members, said Fiorenza,
bishop of the Galveston-Houston diocese. ``There are a lot of
Nigerians, particularly,'' said Fiorenza, who has 50,000 of them in
his diocese alone. ``A lot of them are professional people _
engineers and doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops counts 2 million
Asians, 2.3 million African-Americans and 1 million African
immigrants among its flock.
</P>
<P>
   The majority are worshipping in their own ethnic churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Koreans, it's a language problem,'' said Chun Huh of St.
Andrew Kim parish in Houston. ``Many feel comfortable when the
Masses are in Korean.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the needs of its growing ethnic communities, the
Catholic Church actively promotes the priesthood among immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priests are ordained to serve all Catholics, but often priests
from a particular culture group can be more effective in
ministering to their own people,'' said Bishop Roger L. Schweitz,
head of the church's committee on vocations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one-fourth of the 500 priests ordained were from the
church's minority groups. Only 10 percent were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Some dioceses in Texas and California _ the two states with the
largest Hispanic populations _ are making the Spanish language a
requirement for ordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``But having Father McFadden on the altar is the not the same as
having Father Gonzalez, who understands their language and their
culture,'' said Jesuit scholar Thomas Reese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there are fewer than 50,000 priests and 85,000 nuns
serving the nation's 62 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   So few women are joining the church's religious orders today
that many of the orders are expected to close in the next 20 years,
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger problem is the average age of priests in this
country is increasing every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of diocesan priests is 59. For nuns, it's 67.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is counting on the people in the pews to
take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shortage of priests does not mean a dearth in ministries,''
said the Rev. Herbert Jones, who pastors the 1,000 mostly Hispanic
parishioners who belong to San Jose. ``The Catholic Church is
furiously training people. If there is anything different for the
new millennium, it is this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s when Vatican II _ the council in Rome that
ushered in church reforms _ declared that the people of God are the
church, the doors flew open for laity to accept roles in the church
that were almost the exclusive domain of priests and nuns. Lay
people now are running many of the church's schools, hospitals and
religious programs.
</P>
<P>
   But only priests can celebrate Mass.
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry summer Sunday, Jones celebrates the Mass at San Jose
in English while mariachis _ a group of musicians _ accompany the
church choir, singing hymns in Spanish. During the Mass, women read
Scripture and serve as Eucharistic ministers.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away at San Fernando Cathedral, Deacon Doroteo
Pedroza baptizes 40 babies during a service.
</P>
<P>
   Ordained deacons, who must be male, are taking the burden off
priests by performing baptisms, marriages and funerals. They also
provide marriage and bereavement counseling and make hospital
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot more,'' Pedroza said of the diaconate that has
tripled in the past two decades to almost 13,000. ``The church load
is getting heavier and heavier.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 300 miles from the Mexican border, San Fernando
Cathedral absorbs many of the immigrants coming from Mexico and
South America. ``Every single day we have people coming in asking
for food,'' Pedroza said.
</P>
<P>
   Each Sunday, the downtown cathedral offers six Masses, drawing
an average attendance of 5,000 _ more than double its membership.
``The church holds 600 people,'' Garcia said. ``It's packed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its Sunday parishioners are new immigrants from south of
the border, but sometimes the definition of immigrant is in the eye
of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our church was here before there were any Anglos in the state
of Texas, so who is the immigrant?'' Garcia asked.
</P>
<P>
   During their noon mariachi Masses, San Fernando and San Jose
play host to Anglo-Catholic vacationers who want to worship in one
of the church's old Spanish missions and sample the flavor of its
Hispanic culture.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, tourists and parishioners at San Jose were
reminded of one way the church breaks down cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, Rick Marxkors, the descendent of German
immigrants, met his wife-to-be at a San Antonio insurance office. A
first-generation American, Norma Marxkors, is the daughter of
Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Franciscan friar summoned the couple before the altar, where
they danced to the mariachi band.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were married 12 years ago right here in San Jose,'' Jones
said. The congregation broke into applause.

   The landscape of Christian America is as varied as the country's
physical surface. Some American churches grew out of immigrant
groups, including some of the country's earliest settlers. Others
are made in America, products of the American experience. Here is a
roundup of the major Christian sects in the United States. Since
membership requirements vary from denomination to denomination,
figures included are the inclusive U.S. membership _ including not
only full, confirmed members but children and other affiliates who
may not appear on official rolls of some groups.
</P>
<P>
   ADVENTISTS
</P>
<P>
   Adventists take their name from their eagerness for Jesus'
imminent return to the world _ the second Advent. Adventism today
traces its roots to an American movement called the Millerites,
named after William Miller, who became convinced that Jesus would
come to earth again between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844.
</P>
<P>
   When nothing happened, Miller associate Samuel Snow recalculated
and determined that Jesus would return on Yom Kippur, the Jewish
Day of Atonement, which in 1844 would be Oct. 22. According to some
accounts, so sure were some of Miller's followers that Jesus would
take them to heaven that they disposed of their property and met in
fields to wait.
</P>
<P>
   As one Adventist publication puts it, ``The day came, but the
Lord did not.'' Oct. 22, 1844, came to be known as the Great
Disappointment. Although many of Miller's followers gave up the
faith, others decided that, on that day in heaven, preparation for
Jesus' return to earth had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Major group
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventh-day Adventist Church: This church, the largest group
many times over, was co-founded by Ellen White; her husband, James;
and Joseph Bates, and recognizes Saturday as the Sabbath,
emphasizes healthful living and calls for abstention from alcohol,
tobacco, coffee and tea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 825,654
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS
</P>
<P>
   John the Baptist baptized Jesus in the River Jordan, according
to the gospels, and Baptists, the largest non-Catholic Christian
group in the United States, follow his lead in emphasizing baptism
by immersion in water as a ritual symbolizing entry into the
kingdom of God. Baptists began to gain their identity in the
Puritan Separatist movement of the 17th century. Early leaders were
a young Anglican clergyman named John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, whom
he baptized.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the best-known early Baptist is Roger
Williams, who founded the colony of Rhode Island as a refuge from
religious persecution. Williams and a group of friends were
baptized in 1639 and formed the First Baptist Church of Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern Baptist Convention: Founded in Augusta, Ga., in 1945
in a split over slavery, this is the country's largest non-Catholic
Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership:15.9 million
</P>
<P>
   _ National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc.: Not only the
country's largest black Baptist group, this is believed to be the
country's largest African-American organization of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 8.2 million
</P>
<P>
   _ National Baptist Convention of America Inc.: Second largest of
the African-American Baptist bodies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 3.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Progressive National Baptist Convention Inc.: Founded in 1961
by Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders in the Civil Rights
movement who were dissatisfied with the response to the movement
among leaders of the National Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ National Missionary Baptist Convention of America: Resulted
from a publishing dispute within the National Baptist Convention of
America Inc. in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2.5 million, mostly in the far west.
</P>
<P>
   _ American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.: Originally known as
the Northern Baptist Convention, this group is generally to the
left of the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.5 million, largely outside the South.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS
</P>
<P>
   For the first few hundred years after Jesus, there was a single
church, a situation that changed when the head of the church of
Rome and the head of the church of Constantinople officially
excommunicated each other in 1054, creating the branches now known
as Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the British Protestant settlers set foot on American
soil, Spanish Catholic priests came into the Southwest and French
Catholic priests came down the Mississippi in hopes of converting
Native Americans. Catholic priests are believed to have come to the
new world with Columbus in 1492, and missionaries followed with
other explorers. Although many perished, one established the first
permanent parish in North America at St. Augustine, Fla., in 1565.
Roman Catholics founded Maryland in 1634, although they were later
restricted there.
</P>
<P>
   Although most American Catholics are part of the Roman Catholic
church, there are other branches, known as the Eastern Rites, still
under the authority of the pope but with their own customs and
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Major group:
</P>
<P>
   _ Roman Catholic Church: The largest single body of Christians
in the United States, the American church remains under the
authority of the pope and has an extensive network of cardinals,
archbishops and bishops.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 61.2 million
</P>
<P>
   CONGREGATIONALISTS
</P>
<P>
   Taking their name from the belief that power should reside in
the local church, this movement grew out of the Separatists within
the Church of England during the reign of Elizabeth I. At a time
when Anglicanism was still strictly enforced by penalty of
imprisonment, a group of Congregationalists fled England and
eventually sailed to Cape Cod on the Mayflower.
</P>
<P>
   They did not set up a church until after they were joined a few
years later by a second group of settlers led by John Winthrop. A
series of splits and mergers led to the present configuration of
congregationalist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Major group:
</P>
<P>
   _ United Church of Christ: By far the largest body with
Congregational roots, this is the product of mergers with bodies
from other traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Membership: 1.4 million
</P>
<P>
   DISCIPLES AND CHRISTIANS
</P>
<P>
   Barton Warren Stone was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1798
in Cane Ridge, Ky., but he was uncomfortable with certain aspects
of Presbyterian doctrine, especially the idea of salvation and
eternal life only for those selected in advance by God. Eventually,
Stone and some fellow Presbyterians of like mind withdrew from the
church and called themselves ``Christians only,'' referring to
their church as the Christian Church or Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   While Stone built his movement in Kentucky, another
Presbyterian, Thomas Campbell, was making his way to Southwest
Pennsylvania where he called for a return to the unity and
simplicity of primitive Christianity and thus began a movement
known as the Reformers or Disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the two movements met and became known as the
American Restoration movement.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Churches of Christ: The largest of the Stone-Campbell groups,
this body has no central headquarters and generally does not use
instruments in worship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.8 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian Churches and Churches of Christ: Members of this
group do not consider it a denomination, and government is strictly
congregational.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.1 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian Church (Disciples of Christ): Considered the most
liberal of the three Restoration groups, the Disciples of Christ
are now also the smallest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 879,436
</P>
<P>
   EPISCOPALIANS
</P>
<P>
   In 1534, Henry VIII of England wanted to divorce his wife,
Catherine of Aragon, because she had not borne him a son. One thing
stood in Henry's way _ the Roman Catholic Church's stance against
divorce. With Henry's urging, Parliament passed two acts in 1534:
One declared that the Roman Catholic pope had no authority in
England; the other established the Church of England with the
monarch as its head.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a temporary return to Catholicism under Mary Tudor,
whger brother Charles, famous for his Protestant hymns, actually
convened the first meeting of the Holy Club of young men at Oxford
University that fostered the movement. John, the older brother,
took over the club in 1729 and led the group to apply a method of
prayer and fasting to their daily lives. For this, they were
nicknamed the Methodists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1738, John had what is known as the ``Aldersgate
experience,'' during which, he wrote, he felt his heart ``strangely
warmed.'' He began to preach with new enthusiasm and gained many
followers.
</P>
<P>
   England's Methodists sent their first ministers to the colonies
in 1769, to be followed in 1771 by another team that included
Francis Asbury, who became known as the ``Wesley of America.''
Asbury stayed through the Revolutionary War, riding thousands of
miles on horseback to spread the gospel and set up Methodist
societies.
</P>
<P>
   After the Revolution, the Anglican bishop of London refused to
send more men to minister in America, and John Wesley decided to
ordain some ministers for the mission himself in 1784. This marked
the separation of the Methodists from the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ United Methodist Church: This is a majority-white mainline
Protestant group with worldwide missions and an extensive social
ministry within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 8.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ African Methodist Episcopal Church: This largest of the
predominantly black Methodist denominations began in 1787 when
former slave Richard Allen, a licensed preacher, and several other
black worshipers walked out of St. George's Methodist Episcopal
Church in Philadelphia after being chastised for being in a
white-only gallery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 3.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church: The A.M.E. Zion
church grew out of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church in
New York City in 1796 when a group of black members formed their
own chapel, incorporated in 1801.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.25 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian Methodist Episcopal Church: In 1870, white members
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (later incorporated into
the United Methodist Church) agreed to a proposal by black members
to form a separate denomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 719,000
</P>
<P>
   ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS
</P>
<P>
   Split from the Roman Catholic Church near the beginning of the
second millennium, Orthodox Christianity is similar to Catholicism
in its rich ritual and its ecclesiastical structure. Many of
America's Orthodox Christians are in identifiable ethnic groups;
however, in recent years this branch of Christianity has drawn many
new converts, including evangelical Christians who find a
continuity and historical connection there.
</P>
<P>
   Major Groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Orthodox Church in America: With Russian roots, this group
came to Alaska in 1794, long before its purchase by the United
States. Originally known as the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic
Church of America, it was granted independence, known as
autocephaly, by its Mother Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Greek Orthodox Church: The first church of this branch of
Orthodox Christianity in the United States was chartered in New
Orleans in 1864. Greek Orthodox Americans are under the
jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.95 million
</P>
<P>
   PENTECOSTALS
</P>
<P>
   Known for their exuberant worship, Pentecostals take their name
from the day of Pentecost, chronicled in the New Testament Book of
Acts when the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus' disciples and enabled
them to speak and understand strange languages, prophesy and heal
people.
</P>
<P>
   The modern day Pentecostal movement began around the turn of the
20th century. Although there were some earlier events associated
with the movement, it seemed to take flight under the preaching of
William J. Seymour, an African-American man who conducted Bible
studies at 312 Azusa Street in Los Angeles, a site now widely known
as the birthplace of modern Pentecostalism.

<P>
   PRESBYTERIANS AND REFORMED
</P>
<P>
   The father of Presbyterianism and the Reformed tradition is John
Calvin, who, at age 27 in 1536, published his ``Institutes for the
Christian Religion,'' advancing the idea of the ``elect,'' or the
concept that God first chooses people for eternal life before they
decide to follow God.
</P>
<P>
   John Knox, a Catholic priest from Scotland, studied under Calvin
and established the Presbyterian church in his homeland. In 1560,
the parliament of Scotland renounced the Roman Catholic Church in
favor of the Reformed Church. A conference in England gave the
church the Westminster documents, which serve as the foundation for
the faith in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   A clergyman named Francis Makemie is often called the Father of
American Presbyterianism because of his efforts to organize the
church in the colonies. He founded a church at Rehoboth, Md., in
1684, and, in 1706, helped organize the first long-standing
American presbytery.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.): Presbyterians were divided over
the issues of slavery, revival and missions, and by 1861, there
were four different branches of the church, two each in the north
and the south. After the Civil War, the two Southern groups merged,
as did the two Northern groups. But it was not until 1983, at a
gathering in Atlanta, that the main branches of the church came
together again to form this denomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 3.6 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Reformed Church in America: Established in 1628 by early
settlers in New York as the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, this
group claims to have the longest continuous ministry of any
Protestant denomination in North America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 304,000
</P>
<P>
   _ Presbyterian Church in America: This denomination,
headquartered in Atlanta, was formed in 1973 as a splinter group of
the Southern branch of the mainline Presbyterian Church in protest
of what organizers saw as liberalism within the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 267,700
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian Reformed Church in North America: Formed in Michigan
in 1847, this group was briefly affiliated with the Reformed Church
in America.

RECONCILIATION FOUND AFTER `LIFE' OF TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MORE THAN ONE LIFE 
By Miloslava Holubova (translated, from the Czech, by Alex Zucker
with Lyn Coffin and Zdenka Brodska) 
Hydra/Northwestern University Press, 104 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This poignant novel of a family dogged by silence and longing
cannot help recalling Tolstoy's sentence that ``all happy families
are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.''
Expressed happiness can be hard to understand, but unhappiness that
is unclear to the one who suffers it, and who cannot express it to
those close to him, can have the most far-reaching and
unpredictable effects.
</P>
<P>
   The female narrator is one of four children of a prosperous
Prague businessman and his wife in the 1920s and '30s. On the
surface, all appears to be well, but it becomes clear that the
father, called only Dad, is bitterly unhappy. He is given to rages
over small provocations or imagined slights, is convinced his wife
and children do not love him, and in raging about these grievances
manages, tragically, to make them come true. His children are
afraid of the perpetual stormy atmosphere and so avoid their
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``For how long were Dad's screaming accusations, his demands for
love and respect, nothing but an annoying burden? Dad and the
burden were so tightly intertwined, it was impossible for us to
shed the burden without shunting him aside as well.'' The
atmosphere at home is poisonous. In the mid-1930s, the father has a
brief fling with a much younger woman, then demands a divorce from
his wife. Overnight, the family disintegrates. Soon after, the
father attempts suicide and fails.
</P>
<P>
   After the communist takeover in 1948, the mother emigrates to
England with one of the grown children and eventually dies there,
while the father is seen in Prague, lonely and disengaged, until
he, too, dies in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   There is little action in this book, published in the Czech
Republic in 1994 by Miloslava Holubova, one of the literary
activists in the Prague Spring that ended with the Russian invasion
of 1968. We never learn exactly what the father's problem is. We
infer that the mother is cold and distant, but we do not see it. It
seems that the father is passionate and affectionate and needy, and
the very outpouring of his need ends up driving away those he loves
the most.
</P>
<P>
   However, though the father is the main character, the driving
emotion of the story is the desperate need of the daughter to
forgive him for his behavior and herself for her alienation, as a
child and adult, from him. The story is structured around her
meeting a gentle elderly man, whom she calls ``Eldergent,'' who is
interested in her story; he becomes the listener who allows her to
pour it out.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of her story is that children cannot grow up fully
until they can understand and forgive their parents _ whether such
forgiveness is earned or not. ``And did it bother us that he lived
in hell?'' the narrator writes. ``Not really. We were amazingly
good at not thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the daughter finds the peace she seeks. Just before
the Soviet invasion, one of her brothers, who lives in Canada,
writes to say he is coming home for a visit. He wants the four of
them, now in their 50s, to carry out, 12 years after their father's
death, his wish that his ashes be scattered on scenic Blue
Mountain, where the family held outings when the children were
small.
</P>
<P>
   In carrying out out this rite, the four find the reconciliation
they long for. The narrator writes, ``At last Mojmir (one of her
brothers) said it for all of us: `I'm glad that Dad brought us
here,' and by here we all knew that he meant more than just the
place.'' She reflects, ``Sometimes change happens one step at a
time, sometimes by leaps and bounds. And each new insight springs
the lock on a secret door opening into a new, brighter space,
rinsed clean by the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading this story, and seeing this tempestuous character at its
center, it is hard to see why the adult narrator would feel any
guilt, in retrospect, about her and her siblings' treatment of
their father _ such a man, we think, would drive anyone away. Yet
one cannot choose one's parents, and the need to understand why
they behaved as they did, what demons tormented them, is part of
finding the serenity and courage to be a parent oneself. In this
respect, even unhappy families are somehow alike.

   ATLANTA _ On a Sunday in downtown Atlanta, weekday traffic
congestion is mercifully absent. Office buildings are shut down
tight, stores are closed and the sidewalks are not crowded with
visitors. But there is plenty of life in some of the city's oldest
churches.
</P>
<P>
   At Central Presbyterian Church across from the state Capitol,
tables are set with white tablecloths and red napkins for the
old-fashioned Sunday dinner the church has hosted since many of its
middle-aged members were children. Next door, at the Shrine of the
Immaculate Conception, a priest will offer food of a different kind
as he prepares the bread and wine of the Eucharist that Catholics
consider the body and blood of Christ. And, around the corner at
Trinity United Methodist, adults are gathered in Sunday School to
share their stories with their new minister, the Rev. Cornelius
Minor, assigned to the church just this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away on Auburn Avenue, a sign in front of Big
Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church apologizes for
construction: ``Please Pardon Our Progress.'' At historic Wheat
Street Baptist Church, young Jasmine Garrett is being baptized into
the fold. ``My dear sister,'' the Rev. Michael Harris calls her as
he pushes her under water in the name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost. Across Auburn Avenue in the new sunlight-filled Ebenezer
Baptist Church, Atlanta's church of Kings, the Rev. Mary Finley is
praising God, proclaiming, ``Church, this is the day that the Lord
has made. We should rejoice and be glad in it!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these houses of worship have seen the town once called
Terminus through Civil War and Civil Rights, through booming growth
and urban decline. But they are only a handful of almost 2,000
churches scattered across metro Atlanta from Buford to Brooks.
Those, in turn, are a tiny sampling of more than 250,000 Christian
congregations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From the simplest clapboard cabin where unaccompanied voices are
raised in hymns hundreds of years old, to the most modern
mega-church with its orchestra and drama troupe, Christian
congregations are part of the warp and weft of America's history
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their buildings are a network of clinics and hospitals,
schools and universities, soup kitchens and homeless shelters
operated in the name of Jesus, the Nazarene man born some 2,000
years ago whom Christians regard as the messiah.
</P>
<P>
   His American followers have created powerful lobbying groups in
Washington and in state houses across the country where they are
part of the establishment and the anti-establishment on issues from
race relations to labor law to medical research. Since colonial
days, Christian people and churches have played significant roles
in the good, bad and ugly of American history _ they have preached
slavery and abolition, segregation and integration, war and peace,
social reform and the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Christian voices have produced the literature, theater, art and
music of their country _ from Southern Catholic Flannery O'Connor's
writings to the singing style of rock 'n' roll's King, Elvis
Presley, whose feet were firmly planted in gospel music. Phrases
from the Christian scriptures, such as ``prodigal son'' and ``good
Samaritan'' have become common usage.
</P>
<P>
   Even the names of many of America's children _ Mary and Matthew
and Mark _ are from the Christian gospels. And the best known of
modern-era American reformers _ Martin Luther King Jr. _ is the
namesake of an earlier Christian reformer.
</P>
<P>
   But as American culture has changed, so has American
Christianity. The oldest groups _ the Episcopalians and
Presbyterians, for instance _ have influence that exceeds their
numbers, while conservative Christians, under the label
``evangelical'' have set up not only powerful churches but a
parallel culture. They have borrowed some elements from the
American-born Pentecostal movement, an exuberant form of
Christianity that accepts such practices as speaking in unknown
tongues and which, from its beginnings a century ago, has become
the fastest-growing form of Christianity around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipers entering a modern evangelical or Pentecostal church
are likely to hear tunes that could come from rock and country
radio stations. At home, they can watch sweaty preachers behind
plexiglass pulpits speaking to a television audience of millions.
Or, in their cars they can opt for Christian music, Christian talk
radio or even the daily news from a Christian point of view. They
can subscribe to Christian newspapers and Christian magazines, shop
for Christian greeting cards and gifts at Christian stores, and
wear T-shirts and baseball caps with Christian slogans to Christian
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that it's a two-way
street,'' said Erskine Clarke, professor of American religious
history at Columbia Theological Seminary, an institution of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in Decatur. ``On the one hand, it
would be very difficult to understand traditional American values
and institutions apart from western Christianity ... On the other
hand, Christianity in this country is, in many ways, distinctly
North American.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not, however, remained in North America. An unprecedented
missionary force, followed by international broadcasts, have taken
Christianity, American style, around the world, imprinting
proselytes with a faith filled with Western cultural icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Christian missionaries also brought
along western culture,'' said Stephen Gunter, professor of
evangelism at Emory University's Candler School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   North America's multifaceted brand of Christianity is manifested
in styles as diverse as its beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the so-called Founding Fathers sailed from Britain,
Spanish Catholic priests traveled into the Southwestern United
States and Florida to convert Native Americans. Others, mostly
French, brought Catholicism down the Mississippi River out of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 1492 when, as the child's poem goes, Columbus sailed
the ocean blue, he expressed hope in his first diary entry that he
would be able to contact native peoples to ``determine the manner
in which may be undertaken their conversion to our Holy Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic presence in America is easily seen in the names of
cities such as St. Augustine, Los Angeles and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   With the British Colonial movement, Anglicanism came to North
America, bringing the first wave of the Protestantism that was to
dominate American society. In this country's first English
settlement, Jamestown, the Book of Common Prayer was gospel. Within
a few years of the 1607 settlement, law compelled residents to
attend worship services and catechism classes, and imposed a death
penalty _ never really enforced _ for three unexcused absences.
There were also laws against gaming and intemperance.
</P>
<P>
   This stringent approach to Christianity showed shades of the
Puritanism that was soon to come to more northern colonies _
Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire_as dissenters from
Anglicanism fled England. The Puritans, whose name came from their
desire to purify the church of England from such fancies as liturgy
and clerical robes, in turn exiled people who failed to live up to
their high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Rhode Island soon became a refuge for Baptists _ but was
still rooted in Puritanism.
</P>
<P>
   Puritans ``set the pace for the religious life of New England,''
wrote Catherine L. Albanese, author of ``America Religions and
Religion.'' They tried to shape government according to what they
saw as Biblical teaching, extending their belief in a
congregation-based structure to a suspicion of federalism in
government. Because of their belief in education, they established
schools, including Harvard and Yale universities.
</P>
<P>
   Puritans were not the only Christian souls seeking religious
freedom to come to North America. They were joined by the new wave
of Roman Catholics who founded Maryland _ and soon faced
discrimination in their own colony, the French Protestant Huguenots
in the Carolinas, Quakers in Pennsylvania, and Protestant sects
from Germany, Holland and Sweden in the Middle Atlantic colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, circuit riders were carrying Methodism to the
farthest corners of the new land, and the American Episcopal church
separated from its English home church soon after the colonies won
their independence from the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant segment of American society was the converged
membership of these groups _ ``a quite white, middle class,
mainstream Protestantism,'' said David Hackett, a associate
professor of religion at the University of Florida. ``The influence
has been tremendous and pervasive and long-lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett credits this generic Protestantism with giving Americans
a strong dose of individualism, which can be traced back to
Reformation doctrine that people are ultimately responsible for
their own relationship with God. He also sees it in the American
impulse to be thrifty and work hard, qualities that have led to a
strong emphasis on capitalism, economic development and
materialism.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants established laws that closed businesses on Sunday,
and set up entertainment standards that today are regarded as
prudish. Married couples on TV in the 1950s and early '60s _ such
as Rob and Laura Petrie on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' _ had to
sleep in twin beds; Lucille Ball and Ricky Ricardo had to film the
``I Love Lucy'' episodes about the birth of Little Ricky without
once using the word ``pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were other voices _ especially the growing
Catholic church and the socially active black Protestant
denominations _ the one that ruled was ``the dominant voice of the
dominant class,'' Hackett said. ``They stamped the world in their
image.''
</P>
<P>
   A sort of ``secularized Christianity'' or ``residual
Protestantism'' is so much a part of American culture that people
do not even notice it or define it as such, Hackett said. ``It is
part of the air we breathe. We don't see it. It's the way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it may be the absence of state sanction for any one
form of Christianity that has contributed to its pervasiveness and
endurance as an American cultural force.
</P>
<P>
   In this nation's earliest days, its founders realized they had
diverse ideas about church and government, practice and doctrine.
If they were to form a more perfect union, they knew there could be
no established church.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when the Bill of Rights was written for the new
Constitution, it expressly forbade government enforcement of any
religious belief. But it also clearly guaranteed the right to
follow one's faith without government interference.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a free market and an aggressive effort among some
quarters to proselytize, adding to the numbers and the coffers of
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a church couldn't get a congregation to support it, it
simply withered on the vine,'' said Edwin Gaustadt, author of
``Religious History of America,'' and professor emeritus of
religion at the University of California, Riverside. ``Many people
thought that was a mistake. In the long view of history, it has
worked much better for the United States than the system in
European nations where churches continued to have state support.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of security gave American Christianity a need for
renewal and revival. Great revival movements have spawned new
fervor and some new forms of Christianity, including modern-day
Pentecostalism.
</P>
<P>
   Older denominations have split and merged, taking on new names
and modifying their doctrine, powerful African-American
denominations developed, and some new religions evolved, such as
the Christian Scientists, Jehovah's Witnesses and Latter-day
Saints_ all made possible by the free enterprise system of religion
in America. And waves of new immigrants have made Catholics the
single largest Christian group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy visit to America, Frenchman Alexis de
Tocqueville wrote in 1835, ``There is no country in the world where
the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls
of men than in America.'' Many would question whether that holds
true at the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On paper a far larger percentage of Americans are church members
than in the earliest days, when barely one in 10 Americans were
likely to belong to congregations. The main reason for that is not
an increase in religious commitment but a slackening of membership
standards, said Bruce Holifield, professor of American church
history at Emory's Candler School of Theology. Around the time of
the Revolutionary War, church membership involved lengthy training
and questioning, and a willingness to subject oneself to the
discipline of the congregation, he said. Many more people attended
church than joined.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll conducted in May 1999 showed that 71 percent of
those questioned _ who were overwhelmingly Christian _ claimed to
be a member of a church or synagogue, and 44 percent said they
attend almost every week. Studies of actual people in the pews put
that figure lower.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of this country's historically dominant faith has
been diluted in the modern age by differences within Christianity
and increasing numbers of non-Christian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that about 20 percent of Americans are diligently
practicing Christians from the 17th century to the present,'' said
Holifield, but they are more diverse in their beliefs and practices
than their ancestors. He predicts that no single religious group in
the future will be able to wield the kind of power the Protestants
did for the nation's first 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The May Gallup poll shows that many Americans agree. Sixty-two
percent of those questioned said religion as a whole is losing its
influence on American life, compared to 32 percent who felt it was
increasing. At no time since 1957 has a Gallup poll shown that a
majority of Americans believed religion is gaining in influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1999, we are unmistakably and undeniably a pluralistic
nation,'' Gaustadt said. ``We've been one for a long time, but
people could ignore the evidence. I don't think it's possible to
ignore any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians continue to influence American culture ``from the
grass roots up _ that is from the local communities and from human
hearts,'' he said, and that is the way faith should exert its
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably impossible to separate American culture from its
biblical roots as far as values are concerned,'' Gaustadt said,
``but as far as power structures are concerned, I think it's not
only possible to separate them, but absolutely essential to do
so.''

   WEST BARNSTABLE, Mass. _ From the high pulpit, the Rev. Reed
Baer gazes down upon a congregation with a lineage beginning before
the Pilgrims landed.
</P>
<P>
   From the hard wooden benches and ancient family pews known as
``sheep pens,'' the West Parish flock listens to Baer's challenge
to ``live up to the vision of our founders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a very personal feeling in this old church. The way
it's laid out. The sense that the congregation is a caring
community. The connection to history,'' observes Gary Morris, a
young businessman sitting near the back with his wife, Meg, and
their infant son, Ian. ``You can't help thinking back to a time
when church was a much bigger part of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are Sundays in the oldest continuously operating
Congregational Church in America, where the Sabbath is heralded by
the pealing of a bell made by Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1717, worshippers have assembled in this steepled, wooden
meeting house on Cape Cod. The congregation traces its roots back a
century more, however, to a group of religious reformers led by
Henry Jacob. These so-called Separatists first met secretly outside
London in 1616, four years before the Pilgrims came to the New
World and settled in nearby Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Jacob called his new church ``Congregational.'' While
Puritans wanted to reform or ``purify'' the Church of England,
Separatists wanted to break away completely. Believing that each
congregation could perform all church functions and choose its own
leaders, the Congregationalists were among the Separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Jacob died in 1624, about 30 of his followers
came to Massachusetts with their new pastor, the Rev. John Lothrop.
Lothrop led the Congregationalists to found Barnstable in 1639. The
settlement grew and divided into East and West Parishes as the
1700s began. The West Parish Meeting House opened its doors in
1717.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in this historic church. The ``tithingman'' no
longer sits beneath the high pulpit wielding a long pole with a
feather on one end and an iron ball on the other. If a man dozed
off during the service, the tithingman would rap his head with the
ball. A sleepy woman would be tickled under the nose with the
feather.
</P>
<P>
   Sermons lasted two hours back then, pointed out Baer, compared
to about 15 minutes nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining West Parish, pioneer members had to credibly
testify to their redemption. Testimony of a conversion experience
is no longer required. The ``sheep pens'' are no longer deeded to
prominent families; anyone can sit in these family pews. While
early members sang psalms without musical instruments, today's
congregation is accompanied on hymns by a pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   However, the church clings to a heritage of independence. West
Parish still has its own covenant, promising not only ``to walk
together in Christian love'' but also to ``forswear all pettiness,
gossip and slander,'' and members agree to abide by its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are still elected. Before being hired about a
year ago, Baer was required to preach a trial sermon and then leave
the church while the congregation voted.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in the pews
</P>
<P>
   The parish has about 280 members, plus 110 children who aren't
counted until their confirmation in about the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for many different reasons,'' Baer said. Some are
following a family tradition. Others are on a spiritual search.
Many come for their children, he said. They grew up in the church,
drifted away as young adults, then returned to give their offspring
the same religious grounding their parents gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precious few come for the preaching,'' the minister said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps personifying how the Lord works in mysterious ways, the
reverend himself took a roundabout route to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a recovering lawyer,'' he explained. ``This is my first
church.''
</P>
<P>
   A practicing attorney for 12 years near Boston, Baer was a
deacon and Sunday school teacher in a Congregational church and the
father of two young children when his wife was diagnosed with
breast cancer. The crisis caused both to examine their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After considering teaching, ``I began to realize that I was
called to the ordained ministry,'' Baer said. ``I believe there is
more need in the world for my work in the church than there was for
my work as a lawyer. It seems there are plenty of lawyers to make
the world go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After his wife died, he graduated from theological school. He
has since remarried, and his second wife had a son several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a visitor, he reflected on history and religion
in this historic community he now calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Separatists and Puritans viewed themselves as living
in exile, as conducting an experiment in the wilderness _ which it
was, literally,'' he explained. ``Some would view the church today
as also in a time of exile. We are no longer in a churched society.
While as recently as the '50s, being a church member was part and
parcel of the American experience, today church is increasingly an
option that many in our society don't take up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church no longer has the power and influence it once
wielded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wide-ranging beliefs
</P>
<P>
   On page 365 of the Pilgrim Hymnal is the song ``Faith of Our
Fathers,'' with its stirring chorus, ``Faith of our fathers, Holy
Faith. We will be true to thee 'til death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the founding fathers of West Parish might be surprised at
the wide-ranging faith of their spiritual heirs on Meeting House
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worship doesn't have to be pious _ as long as you believe in
the basics,'' said Faith Chapman, who defined the basics as belief
in Jesus Christ as Savior. ``God is either male or female, if we
are created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Chapman and her husband, Sid, are a retired couple from
Connecticut and have attended church regularly since their marriage
in 1955. They like the liberal leanings of Congregational theology.
</P>
<P>
   So does Meg Morris, who was raised a Catholic but grew to
dislike the religion's formality and structure and rules regarding
women. During their courtship, she and Gary often rode a tandem
bicycle past the historic church while training for a race. They
decided to wed there and continued to attend services after the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I look forward to Sundays,'' Meg said. ``And for our son,
I think it's important that he grow up with that connection with
church and God and for him to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Diamond grew up Jewish, and says he still ``doesn't
believe in Jesus the way others in the congregation do.''
</P>
<P>
   While describing himself as ``not the most religious person in
the world,'' the young dentist said it's important that his
children grow up with values and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to church for the family time together,'' he said. ``And
I enjoy the sermons.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Trisha, was raised as a Lutheran. She said she came to
West Parish after seeing other Cape Cod churches spurn a young
woman who was eight months pregnant with twins and wanted to stand
before an altar to marry the father. West Parish did not spurn
them, and the couple were wed in the historic Congregational
meeting house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn sinners away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a caring church _ a friendly church _
regardless of who ministers it,'' said Jane Clingham, who has been
a member for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each minister comes in and cooperates with the congregation,
but each has his own ideas and goals, too,'' said Silja Emrich, who
joined West Parish in 1957. ``Each leaves his own mark, and with
each we've learned and grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Guided by a covenant
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cross, a gilded rooster on a weather vane sits atop
the steeple of the West Parish Meeting House. Brought over from
England in 1723, the rooster is a symbol dating back to the Last
Supper, according to parish historian Bob Russell.
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus told his disciples that they would soon desert him,
Peter protested. Jesus said, ``Truly I tell you, this very night
before the cock crows thrice, you will deny me three times.'' When
the prediction came to pass, Peter heard a cock crow and broke down
and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Russell explained, the crowing rooster has been a
reminder for Christians to stand up for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like the crowing rooster, the covenant has been part of West
Parish longer than any current member can recall. Although
associated with the United Church of Christ, each Congregational
parish has its own such set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   The covenant provides clues to what the congregation was
concerned about at the time of adoption, Baer said. West Parish
decided ``pettiness, gossip and slander'' were of such magnitude
that the covenant should require members to agree to give up such
actions ``in our dealings with one another and with all people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly when this covenant was adopted, Baer said,
and time may be nearing for the congregation to consider revisions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process even older than this historic meeting house,
dating back to Henry Jacob, who decreed Congregational churches are
constituted ``by a free mutual consent of believers joining and
covenanting to live as members of a holy society together in all
religious and virtuous duties as Christ and his Apostles did
institute and practice in the Gospel.

   ATLANTA _ The view that greets people who drive through Atlanta
at night is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   A sparkling collection of high-rise office buildings, banks and
hotels greet motorists on the Downtown Connector as the freeway
cuts through the city. The sleek skyline is testimony to Atlanta's
growing power and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Grady Memorial Hospital stands yet another Atlanta
landmark. But this one is easy to miss. It's a faded, blue neon
sign that declares, ``Jesus Saves.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign, attached to Big Bethel African Methodist Episcopal
Church _ the city's oldest black church _ has offered comfort to
generations of blacks who had little hope of gaining power or
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   It was the church that held them together when racism threatened
to tear them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that psychiatrist office that you don't have to pay
for,'' said Big Bethel's pastor, the Rev. James Davis. ``It's that
entertainment center that's free. It is everything to a people that
have nothing. Without the black church, we as a people would not be
what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would America be what it is.
</P>
<P>
   As Christianity approaches the millennium, the black church has
raised its profile. Gospel music blares from movie soundtracks and
McDonald's commercials. Cable television is full of black _ and
white _ preachers delivering sermons filled with the poetic rhythms
of traditional black preaching. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
inextricably linked to the African-American church, has become an
American icon.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this growing recognition, the value of the black
church is still underrated, said Robert Franklin, president of the
Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC), a religious graduate
school based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said the black church, by launching the civil rights
movement, inspired liberation struggles in places as diverse and
distant as Central America and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped reposition Christianity not as a religion for the
oppressors and as the ideology for dominant classes,'' Franklin
said. ``It was the black church's reposition of Christianity that
made it more appealing to other Third World people who were very
ambivalent about Christianity's relevance.''
</P>
<P>
   The black church's beginning was bitter, forged in the crucible
of slavery. Scholars estimate that the first black churches were
created in the 1790s when slaves left the segregated pews of white
churches to form their own houses of worship. Big Bethel, first
known as ``Union Church,'' was formed in 1847.
</P>
<P>
   These first black churches offered a brief refuge from slavery,
a place where enslaved blacks could throw themselves into worship _
shouting, stomping, weeping, even collapsing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the difficult and dehumanizing nature of their work,
they created a sacred space as a zone of ultimate freedom,''
Franklin writes in ``Another Day's Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aware that they would soon have to return to the boredom and
dread of field work, slaves threw themselves fully into the worship
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Toby Sanders, 37, the son of a preacher and a recent graduate of
ITC, said the emotion of the black church restores his soul. Black
church spirituals such as ``His Eyes On The Sparrow,'' he said,
touch him in a way that white hymns do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black music is the most evocative and emotional music in the
world,'' Sanders said. ``It's very personal. It's gotten me through
some difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   The black church has gotten many people through difficult times.
During segregation, Big Bethel became the church for many of
Georgia's first black elected officials, teachers and
entrepreneurs. Morris Brown College, the state's only college
founded by blacks, started in the church's basement.
</P>
<P>
   The church held political rallies, voter registration drives and
graduation ceremonies. Courtship, business connections, political
favors _ all were secured within Big Bethel's walls, said Herman
``Skip'' Mason, an Atlanta historian and ordained minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no such thing as the separation of church and state
at Big Bethel,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case at most black churches where the mission was
both sacred and secular, transforming lives and society.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. expressed this vision powerfully in an
article he wrote for the Christian Century magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any religion that professes to be concerned about the souls of
men and is not concerned about the slums that damn them, the
economic conditions that strangle them and the social conditions
that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion awaiting
burial,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement that King led could not have existed
without the black church's spiritual inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South is a very different place than it was 50 years ago
and that's been because of the civil rights movement,'' said Andrew
Billingsley, author of ``Mighty Like a River.'' ``The civil rights
movement was made possible because of the black church. The black
church provided spiritual resources, leadership and places to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bethel continues to carry on such a mission today. The
tactics, however, have changed. Forty years ago, blacks wanted to
sit at the front of the bus. Today, they want to learn how to own
the bus company.
</P>
<P>
   Economic empowerment is the magic phrase that black churches are
brandishing now. New problems require new tactics. A march does
little to correct problems such as the growth of single-family
families, the widening gap between the black middle-class and
underclass, and the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bethel's Davis said the church is reviving its community
through entrepreneurship. When Davis became pastor in 1992, the
church had not bought property in 40 years. The Auburn Avenue
neighborhood that it stood in was degenerating into a collection of
boarded-up houses, dilapidated businesses and grungy nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the church has bought 13 pieces of
property in the area, including a nightclub, a grocery store, and
several small buildings. One structure will house a federally
insured credit union, and the hope is that others will be
transformed into a multi-purpose community center that will handle
everything from day care to job training.
</P>
<P>
   The church sees a divine obligation to remain in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody is going to run from the valley, we're saying
that the valley is damned,'' Davis said. ``If there's anything
we're saying it's that it's in the valley where ministry should be
developed. That's where you get the best results.''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders within the black church community have drawn
similar conclusions, deciding it is up to them to revive the black
community. Even conservative scholars think faith-based
institutions offer the best chance of changing the lives of poor,
inner-city blacks.
</P>
<P>
   So outreach programs have become a mainstay of most major black
churches.
</P>
<P>
   New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur developed a
program that has the church adopting welfare families and providing
them with financial assistance while leading them toward
independence. And Antioch Baptist Church North offers several
innovative programs to reach drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an effort to place their own houses in order, a
new generation of black pastors is going back to school to earn
business degrees. Some churches, seeking greater economic control
and self reliance, have even hired business experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black church has traditionally been a church of volunteers
that work very well on programs like feeding programs and clothing
drives,'' Billingsley said. ``But if you're doing things like
economic community development, ministers have to get technical
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in recent years of the black mega-church _ New Birth
Missionary Baptist Church and World Changers are two of the largest
in metro Atlanta _ is creating yet another challenge within the
black community.
</P>
<P>
   More members _ mega-churches have at least 5,000 congregants and
often four times that number _ mean more political power for the
church. But the intimate style of worship that has been a mainstay
within the black church is difficult to hold onto at mega-churches,
some members say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know everybody,'' said Angella Christie, a
member of New Birth, which has 23,000 members. ``You feel like
you're more at a university, where there's more responsibility for
you to grow because one pastor can't talk to 23,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   And ITC's Franklin is concerned that the rise of more affluent
black churches could also erode the church's tradition of activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not careful, we're going to drift into cultural
Christianity,'' Franklin said. ``The black middle-class will be
completely assimilated into the ethos of the surrounding culture
with its emphasis on individualism and materialism. I hear it all
the time around me and it makes me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, sees progress around his church. It continues
fulfilling the mission that began at Big Bethel more than 150 years
ago, telling black folks that Jesus saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be landowners,'' Davis said. ``We're trying
to restore our community and we're trying to make a commitment that
honors the presence of the Lord's house in it.''

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Franciscan friar Herbert Jones stands in
front of the his congregation calling out the names of states like
a teacher checking attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska.'' Applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illinois.'' Applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine.'' Applause.
</P>
<P>
   After exhausting the list, he asks: ``Did I miss any states?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas,'' a woman tells him. The congregation applauds.
</P>
<P>
   On any Sunday, crammed into one of America's oldest Roman
Catholic churches, San Jose in San Antonio, tourists from across
America, mostly descended from European immigrants, worship beside
the predominantly Hispanic congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the San Jose worshippers represent the old and new
faces of American Catholicism, an immigrant church that now makes
up a quarter of the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   Once a church that mostly grappled with America's crowded
eastern shores of poor, unskilled immigrant laborers from such
countries as Ireland, Germany, Poland and Italy, the Catholic
Church in the United States will end the millennium with a chasm
between its now largely white assimilated members and a new crop of
immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distinct cultures, languages and diversity in the church
is a beautiful thing, but it is not without tension,'' said Bishop
Joseph A. Fiorenza of Houston, president of the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops. ``We are one family, and that's what we have
to continually talk about to our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Catholic, Christopher Columbus, set foot in the
New World in 1492, the church in America has weathered a roller
coaster ride of internal challenges, from its treatment of Indians
to dealing with the economic and ethnic tensions among its
immigrant flock.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the continuing drama plays out in a church struggling to
find enough priests to serve both its English-speaking and
non-English-speaking parishioners while trying to provide adequate
social services, education and Masses for its varied cultures and
age groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big problems for the church,'' said Catholic
sociologist and best-selling author the Rev. Andrew Greeley of
Chicago. ``The Catholic Church is confusion and crisis at the
institutional level and flourishing at the parish level.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, many Catholic scholars agree, is bigger than any
conflicts between the Vatican and American Catholics over such
issues as birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the ideological issues ... are white people's,
college-educated issues,'' said the Rev. Norbert Brockman, a
political science and history professor at St. Mary's University in
San Antonio. ``A big issue is going to be the question of what is
the role of the church with the decline of clergy? That's a very
critical question.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests and nuns have always played an important role in
America's church and social development, from creating schools and
hospitals to backing labor unions and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   The first clergy in the New World were Franciscan friars,
brought by Spanish explorers to set up missions, like San Jose in
1720, that served double duty as government outposts and Indian
conversion centers. The first one was established in St. Augustine,
Fla., in 1565.
</P>
<P>
   But as the colonies emerged in the Northeast, most Catholics
were barred from voting or holding public office by the predominant
Protestant society. Catholics sought refuge in Maryland, but
Protestants passed laws making it illegal for Catholics to
construct public houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually John Carroll, a Jesuit priest who was the son of an
aristocratic Catholic family in Maryland, would become head of the
first diocese in the United States, founded in Baltimore in 1789.
He would wrestle with his own priest shortage to serve the
estimated 35,000 Catholics then in the United States _ numbers that
paled compared to Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   All that would change in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
when millions of European Catholics, escaping poor economic
conditions and political unrest, came to the United States in
search of a better life. Coming with them were priests _ lots of
priests _ who would follow the poor, unskilled immigrant laborers
from crowded ethnic ghettos in New York to cities and farm towns
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under this migration, Catholicism became the largest
denomination in the nation _ a place it still holds today.
</P>
<P>
   As the church exploded with immigrants, numbers alone did not
protect Catholics and their priests from discrimination. They were
denied jobs, tarred and feathered, even hanged for their beliefs.
In the pews, Catholics themselves were prejudiced against their own
brethren, building churches and communities that resulted in ethnic
enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish bishops were never crazy about having a lot of
Italians in their diocese,'' said Larry Cunningham, a theology
professor at Notre Dame University.
</P>
<P>
   The descendents of those immigrants, educated and middle-class,
would blend together in the suburbs in the late '40s, '50s and
'60s, giving rise to well-heeled, Anglo Catholics more likely to
identify themselves by the states they live in than their ethnic
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the church's adherents in the United
States today are Anglo, but the fastest-growing communities in the
church are its Hispanic, Asian and African populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the church, internally, has to deal with issues of
race on a large scale,'' said Jim Davidson, a Catholic sociologist
at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Catholic Church estimates a quarter of its population
is Hispanic, and by far the largest influx of the church's
immigrants are coming from Mexico and South America, where the
populations are 85 to 95 percent Catholic. Like the European
immigrants before them, they are mostly poor and laborers. They are
spreading out across the United States, bringing growing Hispanic
populations to the South, Midwest and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago has a larger Hispanic population than San Antonio
right now,'' said the Rev. David Garcia, the rector at San
Antonio's historic San Fernando Cathedral. ``I was in Milwaukee in
June, and there is a Hispanic population growing there now, and the
same thing in Minneapolis-St. Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Bend, Ind., home of Notre Dame, there are 4,000
Hispanics, Cunningham said. ``And we don't even have 100,000 people
in South Bend,'' he added. ``And I don't think there is a Hispanic
priest in South Bend.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the church's Asian and African immigrants are coming to
the United States as college students, for jobs they have waiting
for them or to be reunited with family members, said Fiorenza,
bishop of the Galveston-Houston diocese. ``There are a lot of
Nigerians, particularly,'' said Fiorenza, who has 50,000 of them in
his diocese alone. ``A lot of them are professional people _
engineers and doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops counts 2 million
Asians, 2.3 million African-Americans and 1 million African
immigrants among its flock.
</P>
<P>
   The majority are worshipping in their own ethnic churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Koreans, it's a language problem,'' said Chun Huh of St.
Andrew Kim parish in Houston. ``Many feel comfortable when the
Masses are in Korean.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the needs of its growing ethnic communities, the
Catholic Church actively promotes the priesthood among immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priests are ordained to serve all Catholics, but often priests
from a particular culture group can be more effective in
ministering to their own people,'' said Bishop Roger L. Schweitz,
head of the church's committee on vocations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one-fourth of the 500 priests ordained were from the
church's minority groups. Only 10 percent were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Some dioceses in Texas and California _ the two states with the
largest Hispanic populations _ are making the Spanish language a
requirement for ordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``But having Father McFadden on the altar is the not the same as
having Father Gonzalez, who understands their language and their
culture,'' said Jesuit scholar Thomas Reese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there are fewer than 50,000 priests and 85,000 nuns
serving the nation's 62 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   So few women are joining the church's religious orders today
that many of the orders are expected to close in the next 20 years,
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger problem is the average age of priests in this
country is increasing every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of diocesan priests is 59. For nuns, it's 67.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is counting on the people in the pews to
take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shortage of priests does not mean a dearth in ministries,''
said the Rev. Herbert Jones, who pastors the 1,000 mostly Hispanic
parishioners who belong to San Jose. ``The Catholic Church is
furiously training people. If there is anything different for the
new millennium, it is this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s when Vatican II _ the council in Rome that
ushered in church reforms _ declared that the people of God are the
church, the doors flew open for laity to accept roles in the church
that were almost the exclusive domain of priests and nuns. Lay
people now are running many of the church's schools, hospitals and
religious programs.
</P>
<P>
   But only priests can celebrate Mass.
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry summer Sunday, Jones celebrates the Mass at San Jose
in English while mariachis _ a group of musicians _ accompany the
church choir, singing hymns in Spanish. During the Mass, women read
Scripture and serve as Eucharistic ministers.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away at San Fernando Cathedral, Deacon Doroteo
Pedroza baptizes 40 babies during a service.
</P>
<P>
   Ordained deacons, who must be male, are taking the burden off
priests by performing baptisms, marriages and funerals. They also
provide marriage and bereavement counseling and make hospital
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot more,'' Pedroza said of the diaconate that has
tripled in the past two decades to almost 13,000. ``The church load
is getting heavier and heavier.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 300 miles from the Mexican border, San Fernando
Cathedral absorbs many of the immigrants coming from Mexico and
South America. ``Every single day we have people coming in asking
for food,'' Pedroza said.
</P>
<P>
   Each Sunday, the downtown cathedral offers six Masses, drawing
an average attendance of 5,000 _ more than double its membership.
``The church holds 600 people,'' Garcia said. ``It's packed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its Sunday parishioners are new immigrants from south of
the border, but sometimes the definition of immigrant is in the eye
of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our church was here before there were any Anglos in the state
of Texas, so who is the immigrant?'' Garcia asked.
</P>
<P>
   During their noon mariachi Masses, San Fernando and San Jose
play host to Anglo-Catholic vacationers who want to worship in one
of the church's old Spanish missions and sample the flavor of its
Hispanic culture.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, tourists and parishioners at San Jose were
reminded of one way the church breaks down cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, Rick Marxkors, the descendent of German
immigrants, met his wife-to-be at a San Antonio insurance office. A
first-generation American, Norma Marxkors, is the daughter of
Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Franciscan friar summoned the couple before the altar, where
they danced to the mariachi band.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were married 12 years ago right here in San Jose,'' Jones
said. The congregation broke into applause.

   The landscape of Christian America is as varied as the country's
physical surface. Some American churches grew out of immigrant
groups, including some of the country's earliest settlers. Others
are made in America, products of the American experience. Here is a
roundup of the major Christian sects in the United States. Since
membership requirements vary from denomination to denomination,
figures included are the inclusive U.S. membership _ including not
only full, confirmed members but children and other affiliates who
may not appear on official rolls of some groups.
</P>
<P>
   ADVENTISTS
</P>
<P>
   Adventists take their name from their eagerness for Jesus'
imminent return to the world _ the second Advent. Adventism today
traces its roots to an American movement called the Millerites,
named after William Miller, who became convinced that Jesus would
come to earth again between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844.
</P>
<P>
   When nothing happened, Miller associate Samuel Snow recalculated
and determined that Jesus would return on Yom Kippur, the Jewish
Day of Atonement, which in 1844 would be Oct. 22. According to some
accounts, so sure were some of Miller's followers that Jesus would
take them to heaven that they disposed of their property and met in
fields to wait.
</P>
<P>
   As one Adventist publication puts it, ``The day came, but the
Lord did not.'' Oct. 22, 1844, came to be known as the Great
Disappointment. Although many of Miller's followers gave up the
faith, others decided that, on that day in heaven, preparation for
Jesus' return to earth had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Major group
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventh-day Adventist Church: This church, the largest group
many times over, was co-founded by Ellen White; her husband, James;
and Joseph Bates, and recognizes Saturday as the Sabbath,
emphasizes healthful living and calls for abstention from alcohol,
tobacco, coffee and tea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 825,654
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS
</P>
<P>
   John the Baptist baptized Jesus in the River Jordan, according
to the gospels, and Baptists, the largest non-Catholic Christian
group in the United States, follow his lead in emphasizing baptism
by immersion in water as a ritual symbolizing entry into the
kingdom of God. Baptists began to gain their identity in the
Puritan Separatist movement of the 17th century. Early leaders were
a young Anglican clergyman named John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, whom
he baptized.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the best-known early Baptist is Roger
Williams, who founded the colony of Rhode Island as a refuge from
religious persecution. Williams and a group of friends were
baptized in 1639 and formed the First Baptist Church of Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern Baptist Convention: Founded in Augusta, Ga., in 1945
in a split over slavery, this is the country's largest non-Catholic
Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership:15.9 million
</P>
<P>
   _ National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc.: Not only the
country's largest black Baptist group, this is believed to be the
country's largest African-American organization of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 8.2 million
</P>
<P>
   _ National Baptist Convention of America Inc.: Second largest of
the African-American Baptist bodies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 3.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Progressive National Baptist Convention Inc.: Founded in 1961
by Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders in the Civil Rights
movement who were dissatisfied with the response to the movement
among leaders of the National Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ National Missionary Baptist Convention of America: Resulted
from a publishing dispute within the National Baptist Convention of
America Inc. in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2.5 million, mostly in the far west.
</P>
<P>
   _ American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.: Originally known as
the Northern Baptist Convention, this group is generally to the
left of the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.5 million, largely outside the South.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS
</P>
<P>
   For the first few hundred years after Jesus, there was a single
church, a situation that changed when the head of the church of
Rome and the head of the church of Constantinople officially
excommunicated each other in 1054, creating the branches now known
as Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the British Protestant settlers set foot on American
soil, Spanish Catholic priests came into the Southwest and French
Catholic priests came down the Mississippi in hopes of converting
Native Americans. Catholic priests are believed to have come to the
new world with Columbus in 1492, and missionaries followed with
other explorers. Although many perished, one established the first
permanent parish in North America at St. Augustine, Fla., in 1565.
Roman Catholics founded Maryland in 1634, although they were later
restricted there.
</P>
<P>
   Although most American Catholics are part of the Roman Catholic
church, there are other branches, known as the Eastern Rites, still
under the authority of the pope but with their own customs and
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Major group:
</P>
<P>
   _ Roman Catholic Church: The largest single body of Christians
in the United States, the American church remains under the
authority of the pope and has an extensive network of cardinals,
archbishops and bishops.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 61.2 million
</P>
<P>
   CONGREGATIONALISTS
</P>
<P>
   Taking their name from the belief that power should reside in
the local church, this movement grew out of the Separatists within
the Church of England during the reign of Elizabeth I. At a time
when Anglicanism was still strictly enforced by penalty of
imprisonment, a group of Congregationalists fled England and
eventually sailed to Cape Cod on the Mayflower.
</P>
<P>
   They did not set up a church until after they were joined a few
years later by a second group of settlers led by John Winthrop. A
series of splits and mergers led to the present configuration of
congregationalist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Major group:
</P>
<P>
   _ United Church of Christ: By far the largest body with
Congregational roots, this is the product of mergers with bodies
from other traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Membership: 1.4 million
</P>
<P>
   DISCIPLES AND CHRISTIANS
</P>
<P>
   Barton Warren Stone was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1798
in Cane Ridge, Ky., but he was uncomfortable with certain aspects
of Presbyterian doctrine, especially the idea of salvation and
eternal life only for those selected in advance by God. Eventually,
Stone and some fellow Presbyterians of like mind withdrew from the
church and called themselves ``Christians only,'' referring to
their church as the Christian Church or Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   While Stone built his movement in Kentucky, another
Presbyterian, Thomas Campbell, was making his way to Southwest
Pennsylvania where he called for a return to the unity and
simplicity of primitive Christianity and thus began a movement
known as the Reformers or Disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the two movements met and became known as the
American Restoration movement.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Churches of Christ: The largest of the Stone-Campbell groups,
this body has no central headquarters and generally does not use
instruments in worship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.8 million
</P>
<P>
   _Christian Churches and Churches of Christ: Members of this
group do not consider it a denomination, and government is strictly
congregational.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.1 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian Church (Disciples of Christ): Considered the most
liberal of the three Restoration groups, the Disciples of Christ
are now also the smallest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 879,436
</P>
<P>
   EPISCOPALIANS
</P>
<P>
   In 1534, Henry VIII of England wanted to divorce his wife,
Catherine of Aragon, because she had not borne him a son. One thing
stood in Henry's way _ the Roman Catholic Church's stance against
divorce. With Henry's urging, Parliament passed two acts in 1534:
One declared that the Roman Catholic pope had no authority in
England; the other established the Church of England with the
monarch as its head.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a temporary return to Catholicism under Mary Tudor, who
became known as Bloody Mary, Henry's church survived and gained a
firm foothold in North America with the settlement of Jamestown in
1607.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial church remained firmly under the Church of England
until 1782, when the Rev. William White, rector of Christ Church of
Philadelphia and a former chaplain of the Continental Congress,
made a proposal for a United States Church.
</P>
<P>
   Major group:
</P>
<P>
   Episcopal Church: This is the mainline Anglican church in the
United States and the only one recognized by the international
Anglican communion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2.5 million
</P>
<P>
   LUTHERANS
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, 1517, as the story goes, Catholic monk Martin Luther
posted his famous 95 Theses on the door of the Castle Church in
Wittenberg, Germany, opposing the Catholic church's sale of
indulgences, or grants of forgiveness of sin.
</P>
<P>
   Although Luther advocated reform within the church, the
deteriorating relationship between Luther, his followers and the
church ensured that Lutherans would have to leave Catholicism in
order to carry out their teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Lutheranism came to North America in the 1600s through Dutch and
Scandinavian immigrants to the Hudson and Delaware River valleys.
Lutheran congregations were formed throughout the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Major Groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: A product of the
merger of three major Lutheran groups in 1988, this is the
country's largest Lutheran body.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 5.1 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod: This more conservative
Lutheran group remains independent of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America but cooperates in many endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2.6 million
</P>
<P>
   METHODISTS
</P>
<P>
   Anglican clergyman John Wesley is credited with starting the
Methodist movement, but his younger brother Charles, famous for his
Protestant hymns, actually convened the first meeting of the Holy
Club of young men at Oxford University that fostered the movement.
John, the older brother, took over the club in 1729 and led the
group to apply a method of prayer and fasting to their daily lives.
For this, they were nicknamed the Methodists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1738, John had what is known as the ``Aldersgate
experience,'' during which, he wrote, he felt his heart ``strangely
warmed.'' He began to preach with new enthusiasm and gained many
followers.
</P>
<P>
   England's Methodists sent their first ministers to the colonies
in 1769, to be followed in 1771 by another team that included
Francis Asbury, who became known as the ``Wesley of America.''
Asbury stayed through the Revolutionary War, riding thousands of
miles on horseback to spread the gospel and set up Methodist
societies.
</P>
<P>
   After the Revolution, the Anglican bishop of London refused to
send more men to minister in America, and John Wesley decided to
ordain some ministers for the mission himself in 1784. This marked
the separation of the Methodists from the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ United Methodist Church: This is a majority-white mainline
Protestant group with worldwide missions and an extensive social
ministry within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 8.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ African Methodist Episcopal Church: This largest of the
predominantly black Methodist denominations began in 1787 when
former slave Richard Allen, a licensed preacher, and several other
black worshipers walked out of St. George's Methodist Episcopal
Church in Philadelphia after being chastised for being in a
white-only gallery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 3.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church: The A.M.E. Zion
church grew out of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church in
New York City in 1796 when a group of black members formed their
own chapel, incorporated in 1801.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.25 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian Methodist Episcopal Church: In 1870, white members
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (later incorporated into
the United Methodist Church) agreed to a proposal by black members
to form a separate denomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 719,000
</P>
<P>
   ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS
</P>
<P>
   Split from the Roman Catholic Church near the beginning of the
second millennium, Orthodox Christianity is similar to Catholicism
in its rich ritual and its ecclesiastical structure. Many of
America's Orthodox Christians are in identifiable ethnic groups;
however, in recent years this branch of Christianity has drawn many
new converts, including evangelical Christians who find a
continuity and historical connection there.
</P>
<P>
   Major Groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Orthodox Church in America: With Russian roots, this group
came to Alaska in 1794, long before its purchase by the United
States. Originally known as the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic
Church of America, it was granted independence, known as
autocephaly, by its Mother Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Greek Orthodox Church: The first church of this branch of
Orthodox Christianity in the United States was chartered in New
Orleans in 1864. Greek Orthodox Americans are under the
jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1.95 million
</P>
<P>
   PENTECOSTALS
</P>
<P>
   Known for their exuberant worship, Pentecostals take their name
from the day of Pentecost, chronicled in the New Testament Book of
Acts when the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus' disciples and enabled
them to speak and understand strange languages, prophesy and heal
people.
</P>
<P>
   The modern day Pentecostal movement began around the turn of the
20th century. Although there were some earlier events associated
with the movement, it seemed to take flight under the preaching of
William J. Seymour, an African-American man who conducted Bible
studies at 312 Azusa Street in Los Angeles, a site now widely known
as the birthplace of modern Pentecostalism.
</P>
<P>
   Major Groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Church of God in Christ: The largest Pentecostal body in the
world, this predominantly black group was founded by Charles H.
Mason, and incorporated in 1907 in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 5.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Assemblies of God: Organized in 1914 in Hot Springs, Ark.,
this is the largest predominantly white Pentecostal denomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 2.5 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Pentecostal Assemblies of the World: This predominantly black
but integrated group is the largest of the so-called Oneness
Pentecostal groups that teach there is only one divinity _ or, that
Jesus is the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 1 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Church of God: Headquartered in Cleveland, Tenn., this church
grew out of a revival at Camp Creek in Cherokee, N.C. It should not
be confused with the Church of God headquartered in Anderson, Ind.,
which is not Pentecostal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 753,000
</P>
<P>
   _ International Church of the Foursquare Gospel: Founded by the
famous Aimee Semple McPherson, this Los Angeles-based denomination
came out of the Assemblies of God.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 229,600
</P>
<P>
   PRESBYTERIANS AND REFORMED
</P>
<P>
   The father of Presbyterianism and the Reformed tradition is John
Calvin, who, at age 27 in 1536, published his ``Institutes for the
Christian Religion,'' advancing the idea of the ``elect,'' or the
concept that God first chooses people for eternal life before they
decide to follow God.
</P>
<P>
   John Knox, a Catholic priest from Scotland, studied under Calvin
and established the Presbyterian church in his homeland. In 1560,
the parliament of Scotland renounced the Roman Catholic Church in
favor of the Reformed Church. A conference in England gave the
church the Westminster documents, which serve as the foundation for
the faith in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   A clergyman named Francis Makemie is often called the Father of
American Presbyterianism because of his efforts to organize the
church in the colonies. He founded a church at Rehoboth, Md., in
1684, and, in 1706, helped organize the first long-standing
American presbytery.
</P>
<P>
   Major groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.): Presbyterians were divided over
the issues of slavery, revival and missions, and by 1861, there
were four different branches of the church, two each in the north
and the south. After the Civil War, the two Southern groups merged,
as did the two Northern groups. But it was not until 1983, at a
gathering in Atlanta, that the main branches of the church came
together again to form this denomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 3.6 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Reformed Church in America: Established in 1628 by early
settlers in New York as the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, this
group claims to have the longest continuous ministry of any
Protestant denomination in North America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 304,000
</P>
<P>
   _ Presbyterian Church in America: This denomination,
headquartered in Atlanta, was formed in 1973 as a splinter group of
the Southern branch of the mainline Presbyterian Church in protest
of what organizers saw as liberalism within the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 267,700
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian Reformed Church in North America: Formed in Michigan
in 1847, this group was briefly affiliated with the Reformed Church
in America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Membership: 201,700

FOR SOME START-UPS, NOT A ROSY QUARTER

<P>
   A recent cooling of Wall Street's love affair with new
technology and Internet firms has affected some of the 11 companies
that launched initial public offerings in the second quarter. So
far, only five have shown significant gains.
</P>
<P>
   Some new issues that played up their World Wide Web connections
did well, particularly those that lived up to expectations by
posting solid sales gains. They generally saw their share prices
double.
</P>
<P>
   However, investors showed little enthusiasm for new companies
that were not Internet-related, such as Implant Sciences Corp. of
Wakefield, whose combination of warrants and common stock has
hardly moved since it went public in June.
</P>
<P>
   Even Network Plus Corp., a large regional player in
long-distance telephone and telecommunications services in the
Northeast, has seen few changes in its stock price. The 9-year-old
Quincy, Mass. company raised $128 million before underwriting fees
_ the single largest IPO in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Less fortunate were investors of Nextera Enterprises of
Lexington, Mass., a business strategy and information technology
consulting firm whose shares, which went out at $10 apiece, began
slipping shortly after its May IPO and are now priced at $5 each.
The company, whose backers include junk bond financier Michael
Milken and Oracle Corp. chairman Lawrence Ellison, face stiff
competition from such rivals as Charles River Associates, several
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street also seemed to take a dim view of companies that
suddenly added ``.com'' just before their IPOs. Streamline.com was
originally Streamline, a pioneer in the on-line grocery shopping
and delivery services for upscale suburban families, and had
significant financial backing from Reliance Insurance Co. of New
York and Nordstrom Inc., the Seattle-based department store chain.
</P>
<P>
   Since it went public at $10 a share, raising $45 million,
Streamline.com's stock has slipped, closing last week at 8 7/32,
even though the company's revenues have doubled in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders in three New England technology and
Internet-related companies that went public in the second quarter
did catch the wave. Silknet Software Inc., of Manchester, N.H.,
which raised $45 million in May selling shares at $15 apiece,
reported a threefold increase in its fourth-quarter revenues and
added customers, including Priceline.com. It now trades at more
than $31 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Viant Corp., which helps major companies expand
into electronic commerce, saw its stock soar June 18, its first day
of trading, climbing more than $8 a share. Since its $16 per share
IPO, the stock has doubled, as the company has reported strong
operating results and new contracts with Sears Roebuck and Co. and
Wit Capital.
</P>
<P>
   And the biggest gainer: Maker Communications Inc. of Framingham,
Mass., whose semiconductor design software helps engineers develop
communications processors. Its shares closed Friday at 28 7/8, more
than double its $13 initial offering price in May.

ALEXANDER YIELDS WITH GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Lamar Alexander quit the Republican sweepstakes was
positively presidential: a fast, hard decision, with no whining,
calmly and crisply accomplished, presented matter-of-factly,
gracefully, intelligently.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of money, having guessed wrong about the saleability of
his issue package and smothered by the media's tropism toward
richer or more flamboyant rivals, he bowed out like a mannerly
guest finding himself at the wrong house party. He did it in a
manner Dan Quayle could learn from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never embarrassed anybody,'' New Hampshire strategist Tom
Rath said of Lamar's effort. ``I never had to apologize for my
association with him.'' It turns out Alexander's best shot came in
'96. ``The insiders, the people who really get it, know how close
we came'' last time, shrugged Rath.
</P>
<P>
   It was a combination Dole-Forbes uppercut-haymaker that pushed
Alexander down to third in New Hampshire in 1996, behind Pat
Buchanan and Bob Dole. Lamar was the Republican Clinton feared
would give him the hardest time. But Forbes dumped a ton of
anti-Lamar TV in New Hampshire, and that depressed Alexander's
vote, enabling Dole to squeak into second and survive. Dole told
his wife he'd quit the race if he ran third, but he came in second
by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   This cycle Mrs. Dole came in ahead of Lamar. Go figure. Lamar
tried gimmicks, and they didn't work. In '96, he tried walking
across New Hampshire, playing the piano at rallies and flashing his
plaid shirt. His hole card in '96 was ``winnability.'' He could
actually win, his partisans argued, and Bob Dole or Buchanan or
Forbes or the rest of them so clearly could not.
</P>
<P>
   This time Alexander had top-flight help where it counted, Terry
Branstad, Iowa's governor for 16 years, and Tom Rath in New
Hampshire. But ``winnability'' was another candidate's issue. And
George W. Bush had the money to neutralize Forbes's megaton of
bucks. Bush and Forbes dropped more than $2 million to finish 1-2
in the Ames, Iowa, straw poll. That cheesy little gimmick to extort
a half-million dollars in voter fees left Lamar a forlorn sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me and said, `This makes it easy,' '' said Rath
of Alexander's decision to fold. ``Easy'' is not quite accurate.
Quitting the cause on which you've spent seven years and upwards of
$10 million or more is not a decision taken lightly. But the
magnitude of the defeat made it simple. George W. got 7,418 votes
for the $800,000-plus he invested, the best $100-per-vote deal he
ever made. Forbes got 4,921 votes for his $1.5 million-plus, so he
paid more than $300 per vote. Elizabeth Dole's 3,410 votes cost her
only $200,000 or so, so she got a bargain at only $60 and change
per vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar ($80 per vote) has the satisfaction _ if that's the right
word _ of knowing that of all five candidates finishing ahead of
him, their sum total of elective experience is five years in office
_ all Bush's. Forbes, Dole, Gary Bauer, and Pat Buchanan all ran
ahead of Lamar. None of the four was ever elected to any public
office. And it's highly unlikely any ever will be.
</P>
<P>
   But there has to be something screwy in the GOP when four people
never elected to anything run ahead of a man who has been governor
twice (Alexander) as well as a former vice president and US senator
(Quayle), two other senators (John McCain and Orrin Hatch) and a
congressman (John Kasich). Think about it. The antigovernment
themes plumbed by Ronald Reagan and his imitators are flushing out
the elected officials. The antigovernment party devours its own
seed corn.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, Lamar would have been the strongest GOP candidate
for '96, but I doubt any of them could have toppled Clinton. This
time, Alexander's ``winnability'' rationale was usurped by Bush.
And Lamar never came up with a resonating message. He cobbled
together a package of profamiliy policies, tax breaks, and
schooling nostrums. But we were not electing a president to run the
public schools, a scheme which he accused Gore of to absolutely no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   I still see Lamar as more presidential than any Republican in
the field. In terms of tolerance of personality, stability of
character, personal discipline, and moral probity _ all the
qualities voters insist they want _ he is a superior individual.
But you can't reason with voters dispassionately. You have to win
them over emotionally, as Reagan did.
</P>
<P>
   It's Bush's nomination to lose. Forbes's loot makes him a
factor, but not a president. Buchanan probably follows Bob Smith
through the exit marked ``Third Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole had a good day in Ames but may be too overmatched
to begin at this level and be taken seriously. And by finishing
eighth in Ames behind Alan Keyes, a crank's crank, Quayle cooked
his own goose. That leaves McCain as best bet to stop Bush in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes and the rest of the cultural conservatives who trail in
his wake cannot lick the Democrats. The United States is not like
those Kansas creationists who think Darwin is only a town in
Australia. The Republicans need a grownup to win. This time it's
McCain; last time it was Lamar. Life, as a guy named Kennedy once
shrugged, is unfair.

CHRISTIAN GROUP, BANK BATTLE OVER HOMOSEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosive issue of homosexuality has set off a dispute
between the conservative Christian organization Focus on the Family
and Mellon Bank, which has refused to do business with the group
because of its stance against homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, James Dobson, Focus on the Family's president, told
listeners of his widely-broadcast radio program that Mellon Bank
has refused to do business with the Christian ministry, saying the
bank did not want to deal with a group it called ``family
unfriendly.''
</P>
<P>
   The public battle between Mellon Bank and Focus on the Family
started when the Christian ministry, based in Colorado, recently
asked Mellon Bank to help manage its growing gift annuity program.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson asked listeners to respond directly to Mellon Bank and a
recorded message at the groups headquaters gave telephone numbers
for the bank's president and chairman as well as the ministry's
main switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Following hundreds of phone calls to Mellon, Ronald Gruendl, a
bank spokesman, said the potential business deal ``ended when it
was discovered that our non-discrimination policy and federal and
state guidelines, which have been upheld in court, and Focus on the
Family's mission statement are in conflict. Our reason for not
doing business with them was purely a business-related matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruendl also said that Mellon has asked Focus to ``retract their
statement, publicly apologize to Mellon for making such an
incorrect statement and ask their audience to refrain from further
calls to Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to adhere to our request may result in legal action,''
Gruendl said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Mellon, which is based in Pittsburgh and is
one of the nation's largest financial services corporations, issued
a new terser statement saying the bank chose not to deal with Focus
``for appropriate business reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mellon turned down setting up an account for Focus on the
Family, Tom Mason, executive vice president for the ministry said
he met with David Holtz, a Mellon vice president. During the
meeting Mason said he stressed to Holtz that while Focus supports
the civil rights of homosexuals it does not believe gays should be
treated as a ``protected class.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, according to Mason, said such a view conflicts with the
bank's policy and was one of the ``problems'' that prevented Mellon
from entering into a business deal with Focus on the Family.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry's mission statement is ``to cooperate with the Holy
Spirit in disseminating the gospel of Jesus Christ to as many
people as possible, and, specifically, to accomplish that objective
by helping to preserve traditional values and the institution of
the family.''

   --An elderly Rwandan cleric accused of participating in the
genocide in Rwanda has been ordered turned over to the United
Nation's International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda by the 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, US Circuit Court Judge Emilio Garza said
there is sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that
Elizaphan Ntalirutimana, 75, a Seventh-day Adventist clergyman,
took part in the crimes for which he's charged and that the US
extradition agreement with the tribunal is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric is accused of exhorting a large, mostly Tutsi group
of men, women and children to seek refuge in a church and hospital
complex and then participating in a daylong attack on the refugees
by Hutus _ using guns and machetes _ that led to hundreds of
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   He also is accused of being part of a group of Hutus who
continued to carry out attacks against Tutsis who escaped the
church massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Following the genocide, in which more than 500,000 mostly
Tustsis were massacred, Ntalirutimana left Rwanda for the United
States, where he eventually settled in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's ruling was lauded by human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is tangible proof of the US support for the rule
of law,'' said Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights. ``It sets an important domestic
precedent as Mr. Ntakirutimana is the first person that the United
States has been asked to surrender to either of the international
criminal tribunals.'' The other tribnal is investigating war crimes
in Bosnia.

   --For those who think Guardian Angels are just a myth, Ken
Wagner, a Brookline, Mass. author with a professional background in
economic development, claims they aren't. He says his own guardian
angel has been communicating with him for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   And to help others who may be dubious about guardian angels,
Wagner has published a ``how-to'' booklet entitled ``How to Contact
Your Guardian Angel.'' Among other things, the booklet, which
Wagner says was directly inspired by his guardian angel, recommends
ways to communicate with your guardian angel, through prayer,
meditation or writing.
</P>

SHE HANDLED PERSONAL TRAGEDIES WHILE LEARING TO HELP OTHERS

<P>
   BOSTON -- To become a good athletic trainer, a student must
learn how to interpret pain. Care for the wounded. Comfort psyches
as well as bodies; be someone to lean on during a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, Kate Kenworthy is at the head of her class.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old from Lincoln, R.I., didn't get to many Bay State
Road parties as an undergraduate at Boston University. There wasn't
much weekend window shopping along Newbury Street, or even many
long, quiet Saturday afternoons in the library. Instead, she was
working various part-time jobs, arguing with insurance companies,
paying the bills or explaining to creditors why she couldn't,
trying to scrape together mortgage money to save the family home in
Providence while in turn taking care of her sick mother and younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most college students go out on a Friday or Saturday
night to relieve their stress,'' said Kenworthy last week, pausing
during her first week as a graduate assistant athletic trainer at
BU before leaving for preseason camp as trainer for the women's
soccer team. ``I would just lay home on the couch, curl up, and
watch a movie. That would be my big release.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite responsibilities and grief that no one her age should
have to endure, Kenworthy excelled academically. Graduating in May
with a 3.76 grade point average, she was honored a month later with
a $5,000 postgraduate scholarship from the National Association of
Collegiate Directors of Athletics. Out of 101 nominees, only 16
students received the award; Kenworthy was one of four in Division
1. She also has received two scholarships from the National
Athletic Trainers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's won every scholarship she's ever been nominated for,''
said Maria Hutsick, head athletic trainer at BU.
</P>
<P>
   She's also won something far more lasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I possibly could have fallen apart and just given up on
everything,'' said her brother, Ben McLellan, now 20 and a
sophomore music student at Rhode Island College. ``I don't know
what would have happened (without her).''
</P>
<P>
   It was 16 years ago that Kenworthy's mother was diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis, and was forced to quit her job during
Kenworthy's junior year at LaSalle Academy in Providence.
Meanwhile, Kenworthy's father had contracted hepatitis; after a
lengthy illness he died in hospice of liver failure, just before
his 50th birthday, on the day Kenworthy graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Although she wasn't told of his death until she got home that
night, Kenworthy said, ``I kind of had a feeling, because I heard
the phone ring early in the morning. I was like, I'm not going to
think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, during Kenworthy's sophomore year at BU, her mother's
condition worsened rapidly. Soon her mother was alternating between
hospital and nursing home, her only daughter coming home from
college every weekend to see her, relieving her grandmother from
bedside duty, quizzing the doctors on her care, fighting to keep
insurance coverage going, helping Ben with his college
applications, trying all the while to keep pace with her
schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what you'll do and not even think about it when
you have to,'' said Kenworthy, whose two older brothers live
outside of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was unbelievable,'' said McLellan. ``She was just getting
us by so we weren't in the street, basically. She had to budget
everything. I don't know how she did it.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, her mother unexpectedly died of complications.
Again, Kenworthy tried not to think about it. ``I did everything I
had to do physically to get everything taken care of, and I just
didn't deal with it (emotionally) until the summer,'' she said.
``School was kind of a blessing, because I think I would have lost
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, 1998, she married Tom Kenworthy, the man she calls
her ``saving grace'' since they began dating three years ago.
(``It's the other way around,'' insisted her husband, a teacher and
head football coach at LaSalle Academy, earlier this week. ``She
doesn't need much help getting through what she needs to get
through. It seems like everything that happened has made her
stronger.'') About a month after the wedding, she said, Kenworthy
woke up one morning with the loss hitting her like a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God,'' she remembers thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Kenworthy's long ordeal, Hutsick and others at BU
have been watchful, helping when they could. ``She won't tell you
what's going on with her unless you ask her,'' Hutsick explained.
``She never brings it up as an excuse for anything, never `woe is
me.' We don't know how she does it because she never seems to stop.
I don't know if you'd call us her surrogate parents, but we try to
look out for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutsick was so impressed that she chose Kenworthy to be her
graduate assistant this year, breaking the precedent that graduates
be sent off to other schools to gain more-varied experiences.
``She's a very rare kid that comes along once in a million,''
Hutsick reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for Kenworthy, as an athletic trainer who needs to
be ready for something to go wrong at any moment, to put to use the
sad lessons of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm so much more empathetic to people now, to
their pain,'' she said. ``It's made me a much more sensitive person
and, I think, more mature. That's the most positive thing I took
from it. It's hard, but you definitely have to look at the positive
side of things because I know people who have gone through a lot
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, while working as a trainer on various
Terrier teams as part of her graduate assistanceship, Kenworthy
said she hopes to pursue a doctorate and become a teacher in her
field, reaping what she called the rewards of helping people learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my plan,'' she said brightly last week. ``I'm hoping I
can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there much doubt?

TV SHOWS OFFER A FEW LESSONS ON WORKING LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You're so wiped out at the end of the day that
all you want to do is flop on the sofa, grab the remote control and
have a few laughs. You certainly won't move up in the world that
way. Or will you?
</P>
<P>
   Sure you will. Think about television comedies for a minute:
They have the same characters every week _ from charming to
memorable to downright weird. They start out fresh, but get stale
in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   And God knows plenty of them are about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? In that great bumbling wasteland, though, there
are a few classics _ and they stand out for the same reasons that
great workplaces stand out. They may have a star or two, but mostly
they have a talented ensemble. And they offer their own sort of
diversity, even when their cast is whiter than Edgar Winter at an
Internal Revenue Service audit.
</P>
<P>
   All the characters have qualities that make them stand out as
individuals, and new people are brought in to keep it fresh. Once
in a while, they do something completely unpredictable, just to
keep their sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five classic workplace comedies, and a lesson you can
learn from each:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'': When the show started in 1970,
the first line of the theme song was, ``How will you make it on
your own?'' That's an awfully condescending way to start a TV show,
but few women back then had high-powered careers, and moving into a
town as the associate producer of a TV news show could be enough to
scare anyone, especially if your boss looks like Edward Asner.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a high-powered career, though, you have to take a
few of those scary steps. Mary Richards pulled it off, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, the first line of the theme song had been changed
to _ ta da! _ ``Who can turn the world on with her smile?'' All
right. So progress wasn't exactly swift.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you look at only TV shows about TV shows, the last
decade has offered us Murphy Brown, a woman who didn't just hold a
career, but thrived in one. (Career lesson-within-a-lesson: Don't
have children just as a plot device.) And now there's
``SportsNight,'' with women starring as the producer, assistant
producer and night producer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``SportsNight'' women are all confident and capable in their
jobs, with personalities every bit as quirky as the men's. The only
person who seems to have it together is Isaac, the executive
producer, an African-American man.
</P>
<P>
   The working world does indeed move forward, even if it's at the
pace of rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``WKRP in Cincinnati'': In a memorable episode, bumbling boss
Arthur Carlson decides to hand out turkeys on the air as a
Thanksgiving promotion for the radio station. Only one problem: He
hands them out from a moving helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turkeys are hitting the ground like sacks of wet cement!''
WKRP news director Les Nessman screams.
</P>
<P>
   Turkeys can't fly. Remember that next time you hire someone.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Taxi'': Sometimes bosses can be the most evil, underhanded,
snarling little creatures who ever ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you're better off paying less attention to the evil
Louie and focusing more on Andy Kaufman's lovable Latka, a
soft-spoken immigrant with a deer-in-the-headlights quality.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, though, Latka's dark side appears in the
form of smooth-talking gigolo Vic Ferrari, way too slick and way
too confident for anyone to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   You need a split personality to survive in the world of work
these days. Even if you prefer being as gentle as Latka, get Vic to
negotiate your salary.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``MASH'': In the show's next-to-last episode, Margaret decides
to bury a time capsule so that people 100 years in the future will
understand what it was like to be in the Korean War. But all she
wants to bury is the regular-Army sort of stuff, like boots and
duty rosters.
</P>
<P>
   So Hawkeye starts a capsule of his own, showing how big of a
nuisance the war has been to people's lives, with things like
bunion pads and a bottle of cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, he realizes that he's found the perfect
items for Margaret's time capsule: things like Radar's forgotten
teddy bear, representing all those who went to Korea as boys and
came home as men; and Henry Blake's fishing lure, for all those who
never made it home.
</P>
<P>
   You need a sense of purpose to make your work worthwhile, but it
takes a lot of ``little'' things to make it memorable.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cheers'': Yes, a bar can be considered a workplace,
especially if you're a journalist over the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the show's final episode, as Sam walked toward
the back of the bar, he stopped long enough to straighten a picture
of Geronimo. It was a gesture that meant absolutely nothing, and
absolutely everything.
</P>
<P>
   The picture had belonged to Nicholas Colasanto, the actor who
had played Coach. Colasanto had died during the course of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   We all lose people we care about. But their pictures live on, as
long as we take the time to straighten them.

VALLEY OF THE GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It's Friday, just shy of 9 p.m., and the
after-work crowd is waiting for a table, waiting for a bar stool,
waiting for a woman, any woman at all.
</P>
<P>
   Straight from their office cubicles and computer terminals, the
software engineers and Internet entrepreneurs who spill onto the
sidewalks are mostly male, mostly without female companionship for
the evening. The scene resembles a beer commercial, except that few
of them appear overjoyed to be hanging out with the guys, again.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Dominguez, a 31-year-old electronics technician from
San Jose, put it, ``To get a date, you either have to look like a
model or have the money. It's like a role reversal, where the women
are the ones who get to be picky about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez has not had a date in months, but he is hardly alone.
As the men who live and work in Silicon Valley note with
frustration _ and the women who do the same note with some
satisfaction _ the region has developed a guy glut to go with its
semiconductors and personal computers. It's like Alaska, only with
better weather and richer men.
</P>
<P>
   The imbalance is evident everywhere in Silicon Valley, from San
Jose's cyber cafes to the Palo Alto hotel where an organization
called American Singles recently held its convention. Men
outnumbered women to such a degree that the San Rafael-based
group's chairman, Rich Grosse, actually got to sit out some dances.
Explained Andy Miller, a 23-year-old computer engineer from
Mountain View, ``Go to a concert, go to whatever, it seems like
it's all guys.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the all-guy scene night after night, product marketing
manager John Dang and his male friends have developed a strategy:
Each e-mails the women he knows and invites them to get together as
a group for drinks after hours. It is a way for everyone to
prospect without pressure. ``It depends on the guy, but there is a
strategy to meeting women,'' said Dang, 28, who recently went on
what he deemed a successful first date with certainty of a second _
with a woman who lives in Seattle. ``I invite my friends, they
invite their friends. Everyone invites all the ladies they can
think of. It's what you have to do around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of excess men, however, is more than anecdotal,
although there is plenty of that. Nationally, single women
outnumbered single men about 43 million to 36 million in 1997, the
most recent figures available from the US Census Bureau. Similar
surpluses of single women hold true in most major cities.
</P>
<P>
   But in Santa Clara County, which encompasses the high-tech world
known as Silicon Valley, the odds are reversed. In this small slice
of America, there are 5,400 more single men than single women
(including people who are widowed and divorced), according to US
Census and demographic data compiled by Claritas Inc., an
Arlington, Va., market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the nearly 1.3 million people age 15 and older who
live in the county, that might seem like a minuscule amount of
extra men. But it is enough to make Santa Clara County one of the
few major metropolitan areas where the odds tend to be in a woman's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do these parties all over the world and we get too many
women, except in the Silicon Valley,'' said Grosse, of American
Singles. ``Women complain bitterly that there are not enough men to
dance, except in the Silicon Valley. Sometimes I have to ask eight
women to dance to keep them happy, except in the Silicon Valley. .
. . Those guys are hungry down there.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not, of course, mean there is someone for every woman
in the cities south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, some of the single men are probably gay men
working in high tech or living in Silicon Valley because they are
unable to afford the even pricier real estate in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the age of the bachelors to consider and their
outlook on professional versus personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations and individuals who specialize in making that
perfect match said most are 24 to 35, since the computer industry
tends to attract younger employees. They said many spend too much
time at their terminals, too little time cultivating outside
interests. Gosse noted that more than a few are new to the United
States, drawn by the demand for their computer skills but
unfamiliar with American dating. Robin Anderson, who owns Premier
Matches in Belmont, went so far as to call some of them
unsocialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely there are more men than women in that age group.
They're all over the place,'' she said. ``My feeling is it doesn't
make them any more emotionally available. . . . Either they're so
wound up in making their mark or they aren't socialized or they
just aren't ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Katia Dimitrov, a 29-year-old marketing analyst, ``Sure
there are lots of guys, but they're all the same guy. There's no
variety.''
</P>
<P>
   Men out in groups of two, three, even six, on a recent weekend
disputed that they were to blame for their inability to attract a
date, although many conceded they were concentrating on their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I don't have time for it anyway,'' said Joe
Vause, 35, who works in business development at a new Internet
company. ``With any luck, in three or four years I will have time,
but it's going to have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ted Nannariello, 27, admitted to an unwelcome
drought. The computer engineer, dressed in a special edition ``Star
Wars'' trilogy T-shirt, called women ``picky,'' not just in Silicon
Valley, but especially here.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond ``Tim'' Mitchell, a 40-year-old Cadillac mechanic, said
most women will not even talk to him because he does not stand a
chance to make millions on computer stock options. His friend,
general building contractor Christopher Scott, insisted women have
gone snooping into his finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really happened,'' said Scott, 44. ``I've been out on a
date and I went for an after-dinner drink at her house and my
portfolio was up on her computer. She said she had my driver's
license and was able to get all this information on me. She was
really proud of it. I said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   During his time in Silicon Valley, Gamon Yaklich, 23 and in
software sales, said he has discovered what works: talking to women
about something other than megahertz or megabytes. He said he does
all right. His last official date was five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women can give you the cold shoulder very easily here, and
they do,'' Yaklich said. ``I found it much easier to meet women in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, couples can be seen nuzzling on the street
throughout the Silicon Valley. Whole families crowd into
restaurants. Getting a date is not an impossibility. Still, Bethany
Glover began calling her girlfriends after the San Jose Mercury
News dubbed the region ``Guyville U.S.A.'' and urging them to move
to Santa Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling them, `Honey, you've got to come down here,' ''
said Glover, a Harvard Law School student who is home for the
summer. ``There have got to be some good catches among the dorks.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover, engaged to be married in September 2000, can look on the
singles scene with a certain detached bemusement. So can Crystel
Milon, 30, who has a steady date, but still gets asked out _
sometimes when she is standing beside her boyfriend. She tells
about young men with six-figure incomes pulling out their credit
cards in clubs and offering to pay for women's drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous how many men approach you,'' said Milon, a
saleclerk at an upscale Palo Alto boutique. ``They'll just say,
`Order whatever you want, it's on me.' They don't even want
anything for their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Glover, ``They do it because they can.''
</P>
<P>
   One 29-year-old bachelor who works in the high-tech financial
side said that sort of standard concerns him. He could easily
afford to pay for strangers' drinks. But he would rather not be
judged by his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' he said, declining to give his name and point
up his plight. ``Sometimes all you see are men, men, and more men.
But I figure it's like anything. If you try hard, you'll succeed no
matter the environment.'' He said his most recent date was just the
night before. He expects to call her again.

VIDEO TELLS THE STORY OF TEAM SPORTS AND GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About three years ago, Ann Troussieux of California was looking
around video stores in search of a tape that might show her then
4-year-old daughter what girls were doing in the world of sports.
She found videos about ballet, about gymnastics, or ones with
well-known (male) jocks like Steve Young, but nothing that showed
girls playing team sports.
</P>
<P>
   So, based on the research that had come out showing the positive
effects on sports on girls, combined with the lack of videos that
expressed that, Troussieux said she decided to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   She called up friend and filmmaker Shelley Frost, and the two
went to work.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Real Girls, Real Sports,'' a half-hour video
that was released last month is available for $14.95 on the
Internet through www.amazon.com and www.throwlikeagirl.com.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, who had made three other videos, including one called
``Baby Mugs!'' of shots of babies, that sold over 500,000 copies,
and ``Kidstuff with Dick Clark,'' said she wanted to stay in the
video business, but with a different focus.
</P>
<P>
   She has a son _ not a daughter _ ``but I remember my teen years
well, and thought this had a lot of merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women went to soccer teams, softball teams, and boys'
and girls' clubs to interview hundreds of girls for the video. They
narrowed it down to five girls and their parents, ranging from
6-year-old Hannah, who is learning softball, to Sanam, a
13-year-old soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   The video that cost the two women less than $10,000 to produce
at times looks more like a home movie than the slick sneaker ad
that shows girls extolling the benefits of sports. And it's not
obviously not easy to elicit articulate ideas from the younger
girls with questions like, ``How does your body feel when you
play?'' (answer from the 6-year-old: ``I feel happy.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the older girls offer more thought-out ideas, like
12-year-old Katie, who talks about the boys in school putting down
the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think we can do as much, sport-wise, so they'll
challenge us to a basketball game at lunch, and I think the girls
really try and rise to the occasion,'' she says. Adds Sanam: ``I
don't care, I just want to do what I like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches and parents have their say too, as Hannah's mother
acknowledges: ``She's gained a lot of confidence, and we had
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The women producers, whose goal is to get the video on TV,
recently got a deal from Beyond Words Publishing to write a
companion book that will expand on the video by talking to women
who already have made it in sports, like Olympian softball player
Dot Richardson, or in their careers, like an astronaut, or a
company CEO.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Frost said she believes she's moved beyond the
children's videos she used to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this can make a difference in lives,'' Frost said.
``Baby Mugs didn't.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: The trouble with being Hungary
 &HT;    (Eds: Last in a series. Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
reported from Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago, just
before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to
write about the changes that have led three former Eastern Bloc
countries _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland _ to become the
newest members of NATO. At the end of the series, CoxNet will
compile some of these columns into our weekly Focus page, good for

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ Hungary's geography is its history, both past and
future.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ferenc Gazdag, 52, director of the Institute for
Strategic and Defense Studies for the past eight years, makes the
point well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary is located at the very center of the conflict between
East and West,'' he said. The Kosovo war was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Of the NATO countries, Hungary is the only one bordering all of
the former republics of Yugoslavia, in particular Serbia, which
includes 300,000 Hungarians living there as a minority.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as a result of Hungary's territory being carved up after
World War I, there is a minority of Hungarians in all of its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary is the only nation in Europe that is surrounded by
themselves, by Hungarians,'' Professor Gazdag said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Hungary has ``a special interest in seeing
democracy spread and succeed'' throughout the region to bring
freedom to Hungarians everywhere, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country, for centuries, has shared the same values as
Western Europe. Now, all of the political parties have agreed on
this much, to turn West.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a member of NATO, Gazdag said, is crucial for a smaller
country like Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not a member, you have no choice but to accept
their decision because of their power. If you are a member, you
have the power to influence that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary came eagerly into NATO, a move favored by 85 percent of
the voters in a referendum on joining.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the NATO membership finally arrived, it was in the form
of the Kosovo war,'' Gazdag noted. ``It is like, `Welcome, and here
is your bill, please.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The feelings against air strikes ``were quite strong'' in
Hungary, he said. For one thing, there was the fear of refugees
pouring across the borders, though that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   But with the embargo against Serbia, the Hungarian economy has
paid a high price in the loss of exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a matter of theory for us,'' the professor said.
``It is reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hungary is faced with ``the delicate balance,'' Gazdag said,
``of keeping its borders open with Yugoslavia,'' serving as it does
as a channel for goods from Russia, including electrical power and
oil and gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hungary waits for membership in the European Union,
which, Gazdag said, ``is the payoff'' in the form of aid for
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our dream to join as soon as possible,'' he said. ``Up
until now, we are paying the price to be a part of the European
community. On the other side, we are not getting any of the special
funds to help our development.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hungary's relations with the United States, ``We believe
the U.S. still has a role to play in Europe's security,'' he said.
``Only the U.S. has the capacity to stop the aspirations of
countries like Russia and China.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of history, Hungary has served as a ``ferry
country'' between East and West, connecting one with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now our hope to anchor this small country on the Western
side,'' Gazdag said. ``If it is so, Hungary can be very optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, we are on the borderline. This is the geography, and we
cannot change our geography.''
</P>

AGENCY LAWSUITS COULD AFFECT BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Gov. George W. Bush crisscrosses the country
in his bid for the White House, he is being targeted back home by
lawsuits that could wind up as fodder for political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the controversy surrounding Bush's 1960s-era
service in the Texas Air National Guard _ and questions about how
he got in _ has become a subject of exploration. In another, Bush
has been subpoenaed to testify about a whistle-blower case
involving a politically connected funeral home company.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys on both sides say politics has not affected their
approach to the lawsuits, but experts say candidates who run for
president can expect distracting and sometimes embarrassing legal
fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest disadvantages of being a front-runner is
the nearly guaranteed onslaught of legal complaints,'' said Larry
Sabato, political scientist at the University of Virginia. ``That's
another (Bill Clinton) legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks, the state attorney general's office will
go to court to try to quash a subpoena for Bush's testimony in
connection with the whistle-blower lawsuit involving funeral home
giant Service Corporation Int.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek to find out what he knows and when he knew it,'' said
Derek Howard, a lawyer representing Eliza May, who claims she was
fired from her job as director of the Texas Funeral Service
Commission for pursuing an investigation of the funeral home's
embalming practices.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said the governor's political ambitions have no bearing
on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be proceeding exactly how we are currently with or
without a presidential bid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the lawsuits distracting the governor from his official
duties, Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A governor is high profile, and people often think of a
governor when they're naming people in a lawsuit against the
state,'' she said. ``It's part of being a public official.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a rundown of some of the legal maneuvering involving the
governor or his office:
</P>
<P>
   _May contends that the Bush administration and a Democratic
state senator pressured her to drop her agency's investigation of
Service Corporation, the world's largest funeral services company.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based SCI faces a record fine of $450,000 based on
allegations by the commission that unlicensed and unsupervised
workers were embalming bodies for the corporation's homes in Hurst
and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   May is suing the state commission, the funeral home company, and
the company's chief executive officer, Robert Waltrip. The lawsuit
notes that Bush received $35,000 from SCI's political action
committee for his 1998 re-election bid, and that lawmakers who
sought information about the inquiry also received thousands of
dollars in contributions from the funeral home giant.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush, his staff, nor any state lawmaker is listed as a
defendant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   An SCI spokesman called the lawsuit politically motivated. Bush
filed an affidavit saying he played no role in May's Feb. 8 firing
and had no involvement in the state's investigation of the company
or any discussions with commission members or SCI officials about
the case.
</P>
<P>
   An SCI lobbyist gave a different story to Newsweek, saying Bush
ran into Waltrip outside his office and asked him if ``those people
\Rare\S still messing with you.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the motion to quash Bush's subpoena is set for Aug.
30.
</P>
<P>
   _Lawyers for Lawrence Littwin, fired in 1997 as director of the
Texas Lottery, have notified the attorney general that they want to
question Bush about Littwin's lawsuit against Gtech, the company
that operates the game. Attorney General John Cornyn will fight any
subpoenas of Bush in the case, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Littwin contends that he was fired for aggressively pursuing
what he believed were contract violations by Gtech. According to
court records, Littwin is pursuing a link that was alleged between
ex-Gtech lobbyist Ben Barnes and Bush. The lawsuit makes note of
allegations that Barnes, as House speaker in 1968, helped Bush get
into the Air National Guard to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   An unsigned letter sent to federal prosecutors in 1996, and
later obtained by Littwin's lawyers, alleges that a deal was
brokered whereby Gtech would keep its contract and Barnes would not
reveal his role in helping Bush get into the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech spokesman Marc Palazzo said ``that scenario goes well
beyond being factually incorrect. It's bizarre.'' He declined to
comment further about the suit because the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose father was a Houston congressman at the time, has
denied that he used influence to get into the Guard. Barnes has not
revealed whether he had a role.
</P>
<P>
   _In two separate whistle-blower lawsuits, three former employees
of the governor's Criminal Justice Division claim they were fired
for reporting alleged violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In one suit, former employees Valerie Curbo and Carol
Funderburgh contend that a supervisor made disparaging remarks
about homosexuals when describing proposals to award crime victim
grants to gay rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The other suit had been thrown out by a Travis County judge, but
last month an appeals court overturned the decision and revived the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _The Sustainable Energy and Economic Development Coalition, a
Texas environmental group, has sued the Office of the Governor,
alleging violations of the Texas Open Records Act.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a clean air initiative spearheaded by the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition contends that the governor's office is withholding
documents related to its effort to persuade ``grandfathered''
industrial plants to give up their exemptions to modern clean air
laws voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said it has given the coalition all the
records related to the program and called the lawsuit a publicity
stunt.

EXOTIC FRUIT DRINKS ARE EVERYONE'S FAVORITE SQUEEZE

   Apple and orange? Kids' stuff. Grape? How ``passe.'' Cranberry?
So 1989.
</P>
<P>
   There's a brave new world of juices out there, and Americans are
bellying up to the bar to give them a try.
</P>
<P>
   Lime cactus quencher.
</P>
<P>
   Hibiscus cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Orange octane.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberry Saint Johnswort.
</P>
<P>
   Orchard oasis.
</P>
<P>
   From single-serve bottles in the convenience store cooler to
freshly squeezed iced quarts at the neighborhood health store to
family-size exotics in the supermarket aisles, consumers are
tapping into juices in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-the-century trend to reach for ``grab-and-go'' food
to eat on the way to work, after a workout or sitting at the
computer is feeding the juice frenzy. Although soft drinks, coffee
and sports drinks have their places, they can't replace a sit-down
meal. Juice can.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of trends, the burgeoning juice market can be traced
to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juices really took off along coastal areas of the country,
particularly California,'' says Dan Titus, president of Juice
Gallery, a multimedia publishing and restaurant consulting firm for
the specialty foods service industry. ``There is a lot of
disposable income there, and a high awareness of health benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Juice Club, the nation's first smoothie bar, opened
in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Juice Club was later renamed Jamba
Juice, and it's now a franchise of 250 smoothie bars. (Jamba Juice
recently acquired Zuka Juice, making it the second-largest player,
next to Smoothie King, in the juice bar jungle.)
</P>
<P>
   But the storefront operations are just one segment of the juice
movement. Juice bottlers are also experiencing ballooning growth
and adding products at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
   R.W. Knudsen has been producing natural juices since 1960, and
now has 200 flavors under that name and its Santa Cruz brand, an
all-organic line. Now the company is pumping up its Rocket Juice _
fresh-squeezed, all-natural and nutritionally fortified juices and
smoothies. It's 14 Carrot Calm includes passion flower and
chamomile, as well as antioxidants, vitamin C and folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen spokeswoman Kirsten Spielmann sees the 78 million baby
boomers leading the trend, although she is quick to add that not
all boomers are alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different reasons why consumers drink the
juice they do,'' Spielmann says. ``There's the environmentalist who
drinks organic juice because it's better for the planet; there are
people who want the nutriceuticals for health reasons; the
convenience seekers who reach for the aseptics for their kids; the
taste-sensation seekers who like the sensual pleasures of a coconut
or a mango.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are avoiding food and beverages that are high
in fat, high in sodium, things with preservatives,'' says Bruce
Langer, vice president of Langers Juice, another California company
that has been around since 1960. ``People realize consuming
vitamins and minerals is very important. They may not like taking a
pill, but they'll eat or drink something that has an enhancement.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Langers produces a ``100'' line that is 100 percent
juice with no added sugar and that provides 100 percent of the
daily requirement of vitamin C. ColdBuster 100 is an orange blend
pumped up with zinc and echinacea.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the whole craze can be put down to boomers who have
given up cigarettes and alcohol as they've aged and are looking for
some new indulgence, albeit a healthy one. Titus of Juice Gallery
doesn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have people over to the house and make up a batch of
smoothies and throw in some 151 rum,'' he says. ``They figure
they're one ahead with the smoothie and one behind with the rum, so
they end up at par.''

candidates in primary elections four years ago but managed only a
handful of votes. Or John Glenn, the astronaut-turned-senator who
seemed to have the right stuff but whose candidacy fizzled on the
launch pad. What did these presidential wannabes learn from their
humbling electoral defeats? How hard was it to cope with resounding
rejection? (Shepard, Cox News Service). 25.

   SIERRA _ When Milton Boyle returned to his homeland of Sierra
Leone earlier this year, fighting swept through the capital of
Freetown. Peeking out the window as he cowered on the floor, Boyle
saw rebel soldiers committing atrocities. But he is ready to
forgive, in the name of peace. Nevertheless, the recent peace deal
ending Sierra Leone's brutal civil war is highly controversial. It
gives rebels who, as a means of sowing terror, lopped off the hands
of thousands of civilians and children, several seats in a new
government. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has urged that the
deal be implemented. But Human Rights Watch says the deal rewards
brutal criminals _ in contrast to the treatment afforded Slobodan
Milosevic, who was indicted in the midst of the Kosovo crisis. Is
forgiveness, even of unspeakable atrocities, sometimes warranted to
save a country from the total destruction of war? Or do such deals
reward and even encourage grotesque criminal behavior? We look at
the issue through the eyes of metro area Sierra Leoneans, some of
whom are once again considering going home. (Melvin, Atlanta

WHY DO SUCH FOLKS STAY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine what sort of self-deluding fantasy caused
Lamar Alexander to run for president _ and caused him to keep
running for years after voters had made it perfectly clear that
they had no interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   But give him credit for finally facing reality the other day and
withdrawing from a race in which his only identifiable function was
to whine about the apparent invincibility of front-runner George W.
Bush. After finishing a dismal sixth in the Iowa straw poll over
the weekend, Alexander wisely gave up the ghost in his no-chance
campaign for the Republican Party's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Alexander did not give up his penchant for
sniping at Bush _ even though the former Tennessee governor
grudgingly conceded the inevitability of the current Texas
governor's nomination to head the GOP ticket. Alexander refused to
endorse Bush, steadfastly clinging to the ridiculous proposition
that Bush is not ready to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to be lured into a spitting contest with an
ex-candidate whom he had already vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamar is a good man who poured his heart into his campaign,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. Bush is always more gracious to his opponents
than his opponents are to him.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Bush ran for governor, incumbent Ann Richards
spent the entire campaign lobbing petty, personal insults at Bush.
He never returned the fire, choosing to devote his time and energy
to articulating his vision for the future of Texas. He just isn't
interested in negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Before Alexander dropped out of the race, it was easy enough to
dismiss his negativity as a symptom of desperation. Bush's
fund-raising juggernaut had made it virtually impossible for an
also-ran such as Alexander to corral campaign contributions;
frustration can engender bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   But why keep up the attack after quitting the campaign? When
Ohio Rep. John Kasich folded his tent several weeks ago, he
immediately endorsed the front-runner and enthusiastically jumped
aboard the Bush bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Alexander will get with the program after he's taken some
time to wrestle with the disappointment of shutting down a campaign
that dominated his life for more than six years. He's probably
earned the right to sulk for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Dan Quayle. The only thing the ex-veep has earned
is the scorn of sensible Republicans who would like to know why in
the world he decided to get into the presidential race. He wasn't
qualified to be president when he was vice president, and he's not
qualified now.
</P>
<P>
   How unqualified is he? Well, he finished behind Alan Keyes in
the Iowa straw poll _ and absolutely no one considers Keyes to be a
serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's insistence on remaining in the race proves beyond any
doubt what some of us have been saying about Danny Boy all along:
Once a nitwit, always a nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republican contenders are hardly nitwits, but most of
them seem to have put their brains on ice while mindlessly pursuing
a goal that they cannot attain. For all his money, Steve Forbes
will never be the Republican nominee for president. For all her
experience, charm and charisma, Elizabeth Dole is destined to
finish up the track in this particular presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The others _ Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan, Keyes, Orrin Hatch, John
McCain _ are beating their heads against a brick wall. Maybe
they're doing it because it will feel so good when they stop;
surely none of them can believe that he will overtake Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They are all interesting candidates. They all have something to
offer in the way of ideas or leadership or just plain
entertainment. But they are going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The also-rans and the Bush-haters were hoping that the Texas
governor would stumble in the Iowa straw poll, that the Bush
bandwagon would be derailed in the first formal test of the 2000
campaign. He didn't. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush Express keeps rolling on. Destination: White House.

   CATSKILLS (Ellenville, N.Y.) _ Maybe it's the tiny glossy
photograph of the bowler hat and hatrack tacked to the wall of the
foyer. Maybe it's the amber plastic beads substituting for a door
to the funky aqua and white kitchen with the Italian molded chairs.
Or maybe it's the young woman with shingled hair, a graphic
designer/wire sculptor who wears her tank top and Dickies painter's
pants with elan and who has turned the old plastics factory here in
the Catskills into her personal retreat. Whatever it is, this is

FASSEL MAKES THE RIGHT CALL ON FAMILY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ His gravely ill mother needed him. Now. Not when
it would be a little more convenient. His family needed him. Now.
Not when it would be a little more convenient. His football team
needs him all the time, judging by the round-the-clock,
round-the-calendar application of nose to the grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   A convenient time for Jim Fassel to tear himself away from his
responsibilities as coach of the New York Giants?
</P>
<P>
   Wait till next career.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel knew what he needed to do, and it wasn't quit his job. He
knew where he and his priorities needed to be, but it wasn't that
simple. National Football League coaches aren't in the habit of
giving themselves permission to be human.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel needed a little reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a little peace of mind, some sort of assurance that
leaving his team for a few days during training camp didn't make
him unfit for office at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to hear from Giants defensive coordinator John Fox.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Fox was trying to make a name and a
career for himself. Fox was in his first year as defensive
coordinator at the University of Pittsburgh, and his mother, Kaye,
was critically ill in San Diego. She had cancer. She was running
out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had a scrimmage that he was absolutely convinced couldn't go
on without him. He left the day after the scrimmage to be by his
mother's side. He got there five minutes after she died. He'll
regret it to the day he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said to me was, `This is a prime example of why you've
got to take care of family business right now,''' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel was back for football business at the State University of
New York at Albany campus Tuesday morning. He had been away since
Thursday, when he left camp to be at his 76-year-old mother's side
at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. Dorothy Fassel is off a
ventilator and receiving dialysis treatments for kidney problems.
She is feeling strong enough to insist that her son get back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made the statement to our staff, and I've made the
statement to my players at different times: We need your undivided
intention, your focus,'' Fassel said. ``This is an all-consuming
business. The only thing that should come in front of that would be
your family if they need you. I've told them that, so I need to
heed my own advice.''
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about the coaching culture that Fassel would find
it necessary to do any soul-searching at all when it comes to
tending to a loved one. The work of NFL coaches, in particular,
never seems to be done. It's not a profession. It's an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Practices. Meetings. Videotape sessions. Exhibition games.
Regular-season games. Playoffs. Evaluating college prospects.
Evaluating and recruiting free agents. Mini-camps. More mini-camps.
Training camp. Life is what happens to other people.
</P>
<P>
   NFL coaches wear their single-mindedness, their workaholism,
like a badge of honor. If an NFL coach ever figured out how to win
while working a 9-to-5 schedule, his colleagues would look down on
him for not breaking something so he'd have to spend time fixing
it.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder coaches burn out faster than double-A batteries. No
wonder the Jets' Bill Parcells refers to two years as a head coach
as ``a lifetime.'' No wonder Jimmy Johnson shows up for work one
day in January fully intending to resign. Johnson allowed himself
to be talked into giving the Miami Dolphins one more chance because
he, like so many others, is addicted to the chase of championships.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Johnson's voice broke that day, describing the
changes that came over him after his mother's death the previous
month? The day after her death, Johnson had been on the sidelines
for a Monday night game against Denver. He missed the viewing of
her body and was having a hard time forgiving himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to coaches around the league, and they say, `First
comes my religion and second comes my family and third comes
football,''' Johnson said. ``And yet, they work at football 15, 16
hours a day, seven days a week. Well, that tells me football was
first. They go to church for an hour a week and they're with their
family two hours a week. So it looks to me like it was football, a
little bit of family and a little bit of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves spent weeks last season ignoring a burning sensation
in his chest similar to the one that led to two angioplasties in
1990. Reeves wound up undergoing quadruple-bypass surgery that
doctors suspect came just in time to head off a massive heart
attack. He was on the sideline for a playoff game 26 days after the
bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more stressful not to coach,'' Reeves explained.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams coach Dick Vermeil, the founding father of the
burnout syndrome, didn't leave his team for a single day last
season after a fire killed his sister-in-law and seriously injured
his brother. And the Rams were 4-11 and headed nowhere at that
point.
</P>
<P>
   Former Redskins coach Joe Gibbs used to sleep in his office
three nights a week. His wife periodically sent tapes to keep him
up to date with the lives of their children. Parcells couldn't find
the time to attend the Hall-of-Fame induction of Lawrence Taylor,
the player most responsible for making Super Bowl winners out of
the 1986 and 1990 Giants. The Jets, you see, had a scrimmage. So
when Fassel abruptly left training camp, Giants players understood
the significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I think that the best coaching decision he has
ever made was to go home and see his mother,'' Giants defensive end
Michael Strahan said. ``Had he not, his mind wouldn't have been
here and he would have regretted it. I think he did the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He did the human thing _ in a sport that isn't in the habit of
recognizing humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can get caught up in the business and not
realize that the guys really are your family, and that you do have
a family outside of this,'' Strahan said. ``When you see somebody
on the team who is having a situation like Coach Fassel has, it
makes you realize you need to get closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did was call my mom, just to give myself a
little better feeling. Also, you try to console him and let him
know we're all behind him. We're with him. The last thing he needs
to worry about is us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants gave Fassel one less worry by pounding the Minnesota
Vikings on Friday night, 36-21. Fassel watched the first half on
television in his mother's hospital room. He watched the second
half at his hotel, surrounded by other family members. It was a
great escape from life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being back at work presents another set of realities.
``It's good to have you back,'' John Fox said upon spotting Fassel
back in camp. Fox couldn't resist adding, ``Get some rest.''
</P>
<P>
   There's work to be done, and it can't wait.

   MUENSTER, Germany _ It's a little past 11 at night, and Mikhail
Gorbachev has just appeared on the tree-lined path that leads to
the hotel. He's walking slowly, with his shoulders hunched over and
his arms behind his back. He's wearing a blue T-shirt and a pair of
new blue jeans. A few steps behind him, one of two bodyguards is
carrying the black bag that goes with Gorbachev wherever he goes.
It's a reminder of the famous ``nuclear'' bag, which hasn't been
his for years now. But this bag remains filled with mysterious
things the former Soviet president doesn't want to be without.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember having ever seen Gorbachev so strained. It
makes me think of that photograph of Raisa and him on the mobile
staircase of the airplane that had just landed in Moscow, after
they had been held for three days under house arrest by armed
emissaries of the August 1991 coup. His wife was visibly shaken,
but the eyes of the president were flashing like those of a tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Now the light is gone in that weary gaze. He's clearly moved and
gives me a quiet hug. ``So good of you to come, let's go get
something to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's tired. He says so: ``The first 10 days were very rough
_ I was alone. Irina (his daughter) came once she'd settled things
in Moscow and brought along the grandchildren (Xenia and Nastia). I
wanted _ and had _ to stay with Raisa Maksimovna all the time. They
were sleepless nights both for her and for me, and I had to help
her change her position every 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   With a melancholy smile, he goes on: ``Now I've got a terrible
back pain that never lets up. You know, it's exactly like that kind
of movement they advise weightlifters to avoid, where you bend over
to lift something. And I did it 40 times a night!''
</P>
<P>
   He eats some salad and a yogurt, but I can see that he wants to
talk, to tell his story. Things are going a little better now, he
tells me. Irina goes to the clinic early in the morning to see her
mother and stays there till 2 p.m. Then it's his turn to take care
of Raisa until the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot. I don't leave until I see that she is
relatively calm. For the first few days she was so exhausted. She
suffered a lot. The treatment is so violent, so harsh,'' he sighs.
</P>
<P>
   He shows me the most recent batch of letters of support. On top
of a pile is one from Vitali Tretiakov, a mutual friend, director
of the Nezavisimaia Gazeta. I catch a glance at phrases that I too
would have liked to write: ``Mikhail Sergeivich, I'm with you. But
please think of your own health too, try not to overdo things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev shakes his head forcefully. ``No! I am not leaving
here, no matter what happens, I am staying with her. Do you see? It
makes all the difference for her, and also for me. In certain
moments of life you realize that some things have become crucial.
You feel friendship, human warmth in a completely different way. I
tried to understand the nature of this illness, but then I gave up.
I have confidence in the doctors. But I feel that it is vital to
stay close to her. And Professor Buchner (the head doctor) says the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Raisa Maksimovna had learned of the diagnosis only a few days
earlier. The compassionate attempt to keep her mind free of the bad
news couldn't last for long. It was one of her own questions that
put Gorbachev up against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never told her a lie in my entire life. She knows that _
so she didn't ask the doctor, she asked me. I told her yes, it was
a form of leukemia, one of the many different ones. She closed her
eyes and remained silent for 40 minutes. I didn't dare to break
into that silence, which seemed to last an eternity. That was the
hardest moment. I tried to imagine what she was thinking. Then
Professor Buchner arrived and he helped me by explaining everything
to her in complete candor. He showed her the lab reports and told
her there was hope. He was persuasive, and he provided a bit of
relief for me too.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal medicine clinic at University Hospital in Muenster
is one of the world's finest treatment centers. Gorbachev and Irina
recount in detail all the steps, from discovering the illness to
her hospitalization in Germany. The original diagnosis was made in
Moscow by Dr. Andrej Vorobiof of the Central Clinic, the famous
``ZKB'' of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vorobiof who stressed the urgency of a full examination
and suggested the best therapeutic facilities in the world. That
was on July 21. The German and U.S. ambassadors in Moscow were
immediately contacted and they responded within a few hours with
proposals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Muenster was chosen because of its proximity to Moscow. On Fri.,
July 23, the German doctors, Buchner of Munster and Mertelsmann of
Freiburg, were already in Moscow to confer with Vorobiof. They
confirmed his diagnosis, and by Sun., July 25, Raisa was already in
the high-tech room of the transplant department of the Muenster
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   To enter this room you must remove all your clothing, put on
sterilized clothes and cover your mouth with a mask. The hundreds
and hundreds of letters that keep arriving for Mrs. Gorbachev are
not even allowed into the ward. They are rerouted to the hotel room
of Karen Karagesianz, the press secretary of The Gorbachev
Foundation, who interrupted his vacation in order to be at the
former Soviet president's side.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, I enter that hotel room _ insofar as one can say
``enter'' _ for there is already a huge stack of letters and the
bed can be reached only by a slalom through the packages of mail.
It takes hours just to hurriedly open the letters, in order to look
at the signatures, but a team of secretaries would be needed to
read and organize them.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot help but inquire: how did Raisa get to Muenster so
fast? It's certain that she came by plane. And not on a commercial
flight. I can't resist asking: Was it the Russian government? Did
Russia provide a plane? Gorbachev shakes his head. He would rather
not talk about this. Irina also keeps mum, despite herself.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, following most all of the others, a telegram
arrived from Boris Yeltsin (after those from the Clintons, Gerhard
Schroeder, Lionel Jospin, the Nazarbayevs, George Bush, Mrs.
Thatcher and countless other world leaders, past and present, as
well as Nobel Prize winners and international cultural and
religious figures).
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's telegram reads: ``I want to express my deep concern
for the ordeal that your family is going through. I know well how
hard it is to experience the illness of a loved one. More than
ever, in moments like these, mutual support, warmth and caring are
needed. I wish for you, my esteemed Mikhail Sergeivich, strength
and perseverance and, for Raisa Maksimovna, courage in her struggle
against the disease as well as a speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in the last nine years that Boris Yeltsin
has addressed himself directly to Mikhail Gorbachev, and the former
Soviet president clearly doesn't want to stir up any controversy.
He remarks: ``They're kind words, a very nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   So I have to look elsewhere to quench my curiosity about what
airplane carried the patient and Gorbachev from Moscow. It turns
out that it was a plane that departed from a Swiss airport and was
flying the Swiss flag. It also appears (although this remains
unconfirmed) that the aircraft was rented by the Greek shipowner
Lazis, a close friend of the Gorbachev family since faraway 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So the Gorbachevs didn't get their airplane from the Russian
government. Or was it that they didn't ask for one and simply
preferred to arrange things by themselves? Right now there's no
answer to these questions and, in the final analysis, they're of
little importance in light of the human drama confronting Gorbachev
and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, while Irina takes her turn in the clinic and after
Mikhail Sergeivich finishes updating reporters, we go for a long
walk in the park.
</P>
<P>
   People stop and stare at Gorbachev. You can hear the screeching
of brakes _ it's as if they come from the thousands of bicycles on
the winding streets of Muenster and the green plains of Westphalia.
Occasionally someone comes up to Gorbachev and shakes his hand.
Others simply say, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-dressed, elderly gentleman says to him, first in German
and then in English: ``You are the Napoleon of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Gorbachev says, in a forceful German _ and then,
snickering to me sotto voce: ``It is not a great compliment. He
ended up on Saint Helena. And besides he was more of a general than
a reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   Raisa slept better, he says, and the temperature she was running
since the night before last has disappeared. So Gorbachev is in a
better mood. And while it's too bad that it has come at such a
time, he's clearly happy with the coverage of Raisa's story in the
Russian media. It's a kind of moral recompense that seems to
somewhat soothe the wounds of being ignored for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know something?'' he asks. ``I never expected
this from the Russians. I thought it would take a whole generation
before they understood. But I see that not one bad word has been
written against her, or against me. It's as if our pain has broken
through all of that lack of understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tears in his eyes, and this time he doesn't try to hide
them. He shakes his head and puts his fingers over his eyes _ then
takes a newspaper clipping from his pocket. ``Read this.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he tries to recompose himself, I read an article from
Izvestiya, headlined ``Ledi Dostoinstvo,'' the Lady of Dignity:
``Maybe we Russians are becoming people again. ... We seem not to
have lost the capacity to share the pain of others. ... It may be
only this sad occasion, but we are showing great respect for two
people who love each other, Raisa and Mikhail.''
</P>
<P>
   With interest, I read on: ``Diminutive and elegant, with
sophisticated tastes, she is not like the others. She has been the
symbol of a country that wanted to free itself from its dreary
greyness. People didn't understand her, or perhaps they didn't want
to understand her. Maybe too much was asked of them when the couple
was in power. But it's also true that no one was able to bend their
will and subordinate them.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Raisa read the article? ``Yes, she read it and cried. I
think she has never read so many expressions of tenderness and
admiration for her before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Sergeivich once again has the look of somebody ready for
battle. ``I remember,'' he says, ``how they wrote that Raisa went
shopping in London with an American Express card, when we didn't
even know what a credit card was. Or when they spread rumors that
Raisa was spending great sums of capital to compete with Nancy
Reagan, when in actual fact all of her wardrobe and personal things
were made for her by Tamara Makeeva in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev is smiling, as if a great weight has been
lifted from him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his hotel room, he shows me the telegram sent by Bill
and Hillary Clinton: ``For a long time we have admired your grace
and composure while supporting the unprecedented changes throughout
the courageous political activity of your husband. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In a certain sense, it's the same acknowledgment that came from
Isvestiya, only this time expressed in English.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev searches through the load of letters and finds one
from Giulio Andreotti, the former Italian prime minister: ``Dear
friend, I am following with great concern what's happening to
Raisa, and I hope you will consider me at your disposal for
whatever you may require. You are in my prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   It pleases Gorbachev; he speaks with simple, grateful words:
``You know, some letters arrive written just as you might think
they would be, but it's very satisfying to get them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, after finishing his turn at Raisa's bedside, I
find Gorbachev again walking around the gardens in a light summer
rain that gives off a warm, fragrant mist. In the quiet there, his
voice comes, as if he is thinking out loud, firm and soft, but also
with the resoluteness of a decision already made: ``Raisa said
something very important to me today. 'When I recover, if I
recover, let's find a little house somewhere, near the sea, where
there's a lot of sunshine, so that we can enjoy these last years we
have.' And I thought to myself: 'Yes, she's really right. It's time
to live out fully, with our feelings, these last years we have.'''

the lab reports and told her there was hope.
</P>
<P>
   The internal medicine clinic at the University Hospital in
Muenster is one of the world's finest care centers. The original
diagnosis was made in Moscow on July 21 by Dr. Andrej Vorobiof of
the Central Clinical Hospital. Four days later, Raisa Maksimovna
was in the high-tech room of the transplant department at the
Muenster clinic.
</P>
<P>
   To visit this area you have to remove all your clothing, put on
sterilized clothes and cover your mouth with a mask. The hundreds
of letters and flowers and gifts that keep arriving are not even
allowed into the ward. They are rerouted to the hotel room of Karen
Karagesianz, the press secretary of The Gorbachev Foundation, who
is taking care of business.
</P>
<P>
   But how, I wonder, did Raisa get to Muenster so fast? In her
weakened state, she couldn't have taken a commercial flight. Did
the Russian government provide a plane? Gorbachev shakes his head.
He would rather not talk about this. Irina also keeps mum, despite
herself.
</P>
<P>
   They show me a batch of recent well wishes. Two days earlier, a
telegram arrived from Boris Yeltsin (after those from the Clintons,
George Bush, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and countless other world leaders, Nobel Prize winners and
cultural and religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's telegram reads: ``I want to express my deep concern
for the ordeal that your family is going through. I know well how
hard it is to experience the illness of a loved one. More than
ever, in moments like these, mutual support, warmth and caring are
needed. I wish for you, my esteemed Mikhail Sergeivich, strength
and perseverance and, for Raisa Maksimovna, courage in her struggle
against the disease as well as a speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in the last nine years that Yeltsin has
addressed himself directly to Mikhail Gorbachev, and the former
Soviet president clearly doesn't want to stir up any controversy.
He remarks: ``They're kind words, a very nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   I have to look elsewhere to find out what airplane carried the
Gorbachevs from Moscow. It turns out that it departed from a Swiss
airport and was flying the Swiss flag. It may be (although this
remains unconfirmed) that the plane was rented by a Greek
shipowner, a close friend of the Gorbachev family since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So they didn't fly courtesy of the Russian government. Or was it
that they chose to arrange things by themselves? Beyond politics,
it is true, these questions are of little importance in light of
the human drama confronting Gorbachev and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, while Irina takes her turn in the clinic and after
Mikhail Sergeivich finishes updating reporters, we go for a long
walk in the park. People stop and stare at Gorbachev. He is a hero
in Germany. Bicycle brakes screech to a halt on the winding
streets. A woman shakes Gorbachev's hand. A teen-ager simply says,
``Thank you.'' A well-dressed, elderly gentleman says to him, first
in German and then in English: ``You are the Napoleon of our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Gorbachev says, in a forceful German _ and then,
snickering to me sotto voce: ``It is not a great compliment. He
ended up on Saint Helena. And besides he was more of a general than
a reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   The prior night Raisa slept better, he says, and her high fever
has disappeared. So Gorbachev is in a better mood. He's clearly
happy also with the coverage of Raisa's story in the Russian
newspapers and on the TV stations. It's a kind of moral recompense
that seems to somewhat soothe the wounds of being ignored for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know something?'' he asks. ``I never expected
this from the Russians. I thought it would take a whole generation
before they understood. But I see that not one bad word has been
written against her, or against me. It's as if our pain has broken
through all of that lack of understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tears in his eyes, and this time he doesn't try to hide
them. He shakes his head and puts his fingers over his eyes _ then
pulls a newspaper clipping from his pocket. ``Read this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an article from Izvestiya, titled ``Ledi Dostoinstvo,'' the
Lady of Dignity: ``Maybe we Russians are becoming people again. ...
We seem not to have lost the capacity to share the pain of others.
... It may be only this sad occasion, but we are showing great
respect for two people who love each other, Raisa and Mikhail.''
</P>
<P>
   I read on: ``Diminutive and elegant, with sophisticated tastes,
she is not like the others. She has been the symbol of a country
that wanted to free itself from its dreary greyness. People didn't
understand her, or perhaps they didn't want to understand her.
Maybe too much was asked of them when the couple was in power. But
it's also true that no one was able to bend their will and
subordinate them.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Raisa read this article? ``Yes, she read it and cried. I
think she has never read so many expressions of tenderness and
admiration for her before.''
</P>
<P>
   Again Gorbachev has the look of somebody ready for battle. ``I
remember,'' he says, ``how they wrote that Raisa went shopping in
London with an American Express card, when we didn't even know what
a credit card was. Or when they spread rumors that Raisa was
spending great sums of capital to compete with Nancy Reagan, when
in fact all of her wardrobe and personal things were made for her
by Tamara Makeeva in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his hotel room, he shows me the telegram sent by Bill
and Hillary Clinton: ``For a long time we have admired your grace
and composure while supporting unprecedented changes throughout the
courageous political activity of your husband. ...''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, after his turn at Raisa's bedside, Gorbachev is
walking in the garden during a light summer rain that sets off a
warm, fragrant mist. His voice comes, as if he is thinking out
loud, but also with the resolute quality of a decision: ``Raisa
said something very important to me today. 'When I recover _ if I
recover _ let's find a little house somewhere, near the sea, where
there's a lot of sunshine, so that we can enjoy these last years we
have.' And I thought to myself: 'Yes, she's really right. It's time
to live out fully, with our feelings, these last years we have.'''

 &HT;    
 By RUTH CONNIFF  
 c.1999 The Progressive  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, is probably the most visible representative of feminism in
the United States. She's always in the hot seat _ called upon to
account for everything from feminists' ``coziness'' with the
Clinton administration to the perception that feminists are a bunch
of man-bashing radicals.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Ireland has been through a lot of changes. She
writes in her autobiography, ``What Women Want'' (Dutton 1996),
about her seven-year career as an airline stewardess, as well as,
years later, breaking the ``glass ceiling'' by becoming one of the
first women to make partner in a corporate law firm.
</P>
<P>
   We met for a couple of hours in her corner office at NOW's
national headquarters in Washington, D.C.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUTH CONNIFF: You tell a story in your book about a bomb threat
while you were working as an airline stewardess. The pilot asked
you to stay on the plane to cook him a steak.
</P>
<P>
   PATRICIA IRELAND: Right, everyone else got off, while the plane
was about to be exploded at any moment, as far as we could tell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You decided to turn off the grill and get off the plane too,
and to tell the pilot to cook his own steak. Was that a turning
point for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. There were those little progressions. I don't think
anything radicalized me as much as being a stewardess. It was what
made those blinders fall from my eyes. ... Why in the world was I
standing in an airplane that might be blown up at any minute while
this guy was sitting in the crew lounge safe and waiting for his
steak? Get serious!
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of moments like that. That one just struck
me particularly because it was so outrageous. Because planes WERE
being blown up. It wasn't like it was a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   I came up in school when all of these movements were out there:
the free-speech movement, the civil-rights movement, the
women's-rights movement. The anti-war movement was very big when I
was in college. And I was an armchair supporter. I thought, ``Yeah,
that's great, I agree with that.'' But I was never active at all.
It really wasn't until something touched me personally that I
recognized you have to learn to fight back. And if you have a
movement, you're more likely to have success.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get from stewardess to corporate lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because (at the airline) I discovered the disparity in the
benefits that the women got vs. what the men got _ it had been
totally illegal for years. And yet nobody among us had known our
rights. I didn't even have to file a lawsuit. I just had to go to
the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Just as now, women who are being pushed off public assistance
don't know that they still should and can get food stamps and child
care. Years ago we didn't know it was illegal for the company to
have this benefit package that covered men's families but not
women's. And nobody challenged it.
</P>
<P>
   So when I figured out how many years the company had gotten away
with that _ how much money women and their families had been ripped
off for the corporate bottom line _ I just figured I wanted to go
to law school and know more about how to enforce those rights.
</P>
<P>
   All through law school I took courses I thought I'd use _ law
and the poor, civil rights and the law, women's rights and the law,
social policy and the law. I got my lowest grades in corporate law.
I never took securities law. And I really thought I was going to do
international law work, and especially international human-rights
work.
</P>
<P>
   Then I discovered that to get to do international law I would
have to move to Washington or go out to L.A. I really loved Miami,
so that was private international law _ private business
transactions. I looked at all my friends who were going into Legal
Services or becoming public defenders, and I just figured I would
be very frustrated by doing that. Also I found, much to my
surprise, that in representing a lot of these corporations that
needed affirmative-action plans, I could go in as their lawyer, and
they knew I was on their side, and without a big fight I could get
them to do things I could not possibly have gotten them to do as a
plaintiffs' counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You and other feminists have been accused of not wreaking
havoc or taking shots at President Clinton. Barbara Ehrenreich
wrote an op-ed in The New York Times accusing you of being too cozy
with him. And I went to a press conference at the Democratic
Convention where Gloria Steinem and other prominent feminists said,
``We've got to vote for him because he's the only one who can undo
the welfare legislation he just signed.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. But we were never part of that. And we never endorsed
him. I was arrested in front of his White House protesting the
welfare repeal. And one of the things I was peeved at Barbara about
was for saying I had gone to the Democratic Convention and danced
the macarena. I never went inside the Democratic Convention. I went
there to see if we could get some demonstrations going on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I went to Chicago because we had meetings with
Clinton administration officials who were trying to negotiate on
what they could do to settle us down about welfare. They wanted to
meet with us and hear from people we had gathered together about
the tie between domestic violence and poverty. They were in the
process of writing the rules on welfare: Could you get a temporary
exemption for women in poverty because of horrendous violence in
their lives? How did you deal with women who were stalked or
attacked in the workplace and therefore couldn't keep a job?
</P>
<P>
   We didn't endorse Clinton, we took him on full force over the
poverty issue and over lesbians and gays in the military, and yet
because we go in the door and negotiate about these issues,
suddenly we're ``in his camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't NOW pull its punches when it came to the sexual
accusations against Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Go back and look at the web and some of the transcripts.
I have called him everything on television. I've said we weren't
defending him, that his actions were indefensible. You know, I've
been very hard-edged about what he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we better off with Clinton than we would have been with
Bush or Dole?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. And at the same time, I really think Clinton has got a
very serious problem. Clinton is beyond what even the worst of the
culture of men usually behave like. When I was a stewardess, the ad
campaigns were ``We really move our tails for you'' and ``Fly me.''
I saw some of the worst of the worst of guys when they were away
from their families and thought they could do anything they wanted.
And when I first heard this story, I could not imagine even the
most outrageous pilot or passenger I knew dropping trousers and
asking for a blow job. What is that about?
</P>
<P>
   So I think he's got a serious problem. And that's why, again,
we're so focused on trying to get more candidates we can trust into
the political pipeline. I think I've been pretty hard on Clinton.
But it isn't what some of the reporters wanted to hear or see. I
think what they wanted was to say, ``Oh, the feminists are
defending Clinton.'' And, true, the real news would be if all the
feminists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You caused some problems for Janet Reno when she arrived in
Washington by revealing that you played softball with her.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, yes _ I really thought that was most amusing. I was
trying to put forward a different image from the one that got
across. Of course, every softball team I know and every soccer team
_ I wouldn't say they're all lesbian, but ... that was an amusing
little sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Reno play softball a lot? Are you still playing against
her?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. We played when we were both much younger, in a women's
law league _ all women lawyers. It was great. It was one of those
things for some of us who missed Title IX, and didn't get to play
sports in high school and college. The first time I could look out
there and go, ``Hmmm, they're not covered in right field, that's
where this ball is going,'' and I was able to hit it where I wanted
to _ that felt like a real accomplishment! Especially for someone
who had no sports skills growing up. It's just a fun thing. And
Reno was a heck of a player. I mean, she was scary.
</P>
<P>
   I remember I was playing first base when she was batting, and
when she was running the bases you definitely did not want to make
the mistake of being on the baseline. She was just an aggressive,
physical player. And I admired that, at the same time as it scared
me. When I met her, I just thought: Wow, who is this tall, strong,
aggressive player? Turned out to be Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about how Monica Lewinsky ended up? Was she
exploited or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think she's very young. I think you don't show your thong
bikini underwear to your employer without giving a signal of some
sort that you'd welcome a sexual advance. And I don't think anybody
tried to coerce her into anything, except Ken Starr and his merry
band of men.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time I fear that she will live to regret this,
although she seems temporarily to be riding high. Part of what
happens with any young woman who comes to see her only value as her
sexual appeal and her conventional attractiveness, who is so
obsessed with her body being too large, and trying to fill that
insecurity with attention from men, is that the ageism of the
culture catches up to her.
</P>
<P>
   You are only sexually attractive, conventionally, for a very
brief period in an otherwise long life. And if you don't have
something else about yourself that you value _ forget about whether
the rest of the world values it, but just start with yourself _ you
don't have anything to fall back on. When the next boss or series
of bosses are looking at the younger and younger women, what is she
going to have to feel good about herself? What does she value in
herself? And what does she have to offer of value that she's going
to present to the world? I worry about that. In that sense, I think
she has made some really big mistakes that are going to catch up to
her.

   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, is probably the most visible representative of feminism in
the United States. She's always in the hot seat _ called upon to
account for everything from feminists' ``coziness'' with the
Clinton administration to the perception that feminists are a bunch
of man-bashing radicals.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Ireland has been through a lot of changes. She
writes in her autobiography, ``What Women Want'' (Dutton 1996),
about her seven-year career as an airline stewardess, as well as,
years later, breaking the ``glass ceiling'' by becoming one of the
first women to make partner in a corporate law firm.
</P>
<P>
   We met for a couple of hours in her corner office at NOW's
national headquarters in Washington, D.C.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUTH CONNIFF: You tell a story in your book about a bomb threat
while you were working as an airline stewardess. The pilot asked
you to stay on the plane to cook him a steak.
</P>
<P>
   PATRICIA IRELAND: Right, everyone else got off, while the plane
was about to be exploded at any moment, as far as we could tell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You decided to turn off the grill and get off the plane too,
and to tell the pilot to cook his own steak. Was that a turning
point for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. There were those little progressions. I don't think
anything radicalized me as much as being a stewardess. It was what
made those blinders fall from my eyes. ... Why in the world was I
standing in an airplane that might be blown up at any minute while
this guy was sitting in the crew lounge safe and waiting for his
steak? Get serious!
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of moments like that. That one just struck
me particularly because it was so outrageous. Because planes WERE
being blown up. It wasn't like it was a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   I came up in school when all of these movements were out there:
the free-speech movement, the civil-rights movement, the
women's-rights movement. The anti-war movement was very big when I
was in college. And I was an armchair supporter. I thought, ``Yeah,
that's great, I agree with that.'' But I was never active at all.
It really wasn't until something touched me personally that I
recognized you have to learn to fight back. And if you have a
movement, you're more likely to have success.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get from stewardess to corporate lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because (at the airline) I discovered the disparity in the
benefits that the women got vs. what the men got _ it had been
totally illegal for years. And yet nobody among us had known our
rights. I didn't even have to file a lawsuit. I just had to go to
the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Just as now, women who are being pushed off public assistance
don't know that they still should and can get food stamps and child
care. Years ago we didn't know it was illegal for the company to
have this benefit package that covered men's families but not
women's. And nobody challenged it.
</P>
<P>
   So when I figured out how many years the company had gotten away
with that _ how much money women and their families had been ripped
off for the corporate bottom line _ I just figured I wanted to go
to law school and know more about how to enforce those rights.
</P>
<P>
   All through law school I took courses I thought I'd use _ law
and the poor, civil rights and the law, women's rights and the law,
social policy and the law. I got my lowest grades in corporate law.
I never took securities law. And I really thought I was going to do
international law work, and especially international human-rights
work.
</P>
<P>
   Then I discovered that to get to do international law I would
have to move to Washington or go out to L.A. I really loved Miami,
so that was private international law _ private business
transactions. I looked at all my friends who were going into Legal
Services or becoming public defenders, and I just figured I would
be very frustrated by doing that. Also I found, much to my
surprise, that in representing a lot of these corporations that
needed affirmative-action plans, I could go in as their lawyer, and
they knew I was on their side, and without a big fight I could get
them to do things I could not possibly have gotten them to do as a
plaintiffs' counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You and other feminists have been accused of not wreaking
havoc or taking shots at President Clinton. Barbara Ehrenreich
wrote an op-ed in The New York Times accusing you of being too cozy
with him. And I went to a press conference at the Democratic
Convention where Gloria Steinem and other prominent feminists said,
``We've got to vote for him because he's the only one who can undo
the welfare legislation he just signed.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. But we were never part of that. And we never endorsed
him. I was arrested in front of his White House protesting the
welfare repeal. And one of the things I was peeved at Barbara about
was for saying I had gone to the Democratic Convention and danced
the macarena. I never went inside the Democratic Convention. I went
there to see if we could get some demonstrations going on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I went to Chicago because we had meetings with
Clinton administration officials who were trying to negotiate on
what they could do to settle us down about welfare. They wanted to
meet with us and hear from people we had gathered together about
the tie between domestic violence and poverty. They were in the
process of writing the rules on welfare: Could you get a temporary
exemption for women in poverty because of horrendous violence in
their lives? How did you deal with women who were stalked or
attacked in the workplace and therefore couldn't keep a job?
</P>
<P>
   We didn't endorse Clinton, we took him on full force over the
poverty issue and over lesbians and gays in the military, and yet
because we go in the door and negotiate about these issues,
suddenly we're ``in his camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't NOW pull its punches when it came to the sexual
accusations against Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Go back and look at the web and some of the transcripts.
I have called him everything on television. I've said we weren't
defending him, that his actions were indefensible. You know, I've
been very hard-edged about what he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we better off with Clinton than we would have been with
Bush or Dole?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. And at the same time, I really think Clinton has got a
very serious problem. Clinton is beyond what even the worst of the
culture of men usually behave like. When I was a stewardess, the ad
campaigns were ``We really move our tails for you'' and ``Fly me.''
I saw some of the worst of the worst of guys when they were away
from their families and thought they could do anything they wanted.
And when I first heard this story, I could not imagine even the
most outrageous pilot or passenger I knew dropping trousers and
asking for a blow job. What is that about?
</P>
<P>
   So I think he's got a serious problem. And that's why, again,
we're so focused on trying to get more candidates we can trust into
the political pipeline. I think I've been pretty hard on Clinton.
But it isn't what some of the reporters wanted to hear or see. I
think what they wanted was to say, ``Oh, the feminists are
defending Clinton.'' And, true, the real news would be if all the
feminists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You caused some problems for Janet Reno when she arrived in
Washington by revealing that you played softball with her.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, yes _ I really thought that was most amusing. I was
trying to put forward a different image from the one that got
across. Of course, every softball team I know and every soccer team
_ I wouldn't say they're all lesbian, but ... that was an amusing
little sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Reno play softball a lot? Are you still playing against
her?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. We played when we were both much younger, in a women's
law league _ all women lawyers. It was great. It was one of those
things for some of us who missed Title IX, and didn't get to play
sports in high school and college. The first time I could look out
there and go, ``Hmmm, they're not covered in right field, that's
where this ball is going,'' and I was able to hit it where I wanted
to _ that felt like a real accomplishment! Especially for someone
who had no sports skills growing up. It's just a fun thing. And
Reno was a heck of a player. I mean, she was scary.
</P>
<P>
   I remember I was playing first base when she was batting, and
when she was running the bases you definitely did not want to make
the mistake of being on the baseline. She was just an aggressive,
physical player. And I admired that, at the same time as it scared
me. When I met her, I just thought: Wow, who is this tall, strong,
aggressive player? Turned out to be Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about how Monica Lewinsky ended up? Was she
exploited or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think she's very young. I think you don't show your thong
bikini underwear to your employer without giving a signal of some
sort that you'd welcome a sexual advance. And I don't think anybody
tried to coerce her into anything, except Ken Starr and his merry
band of men.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time I fear that she will live to regret this,
although she seems temporarily to be riding high. Part of what
happens with any young woman who comes to see her only value as her
sexual appeal and her conventional attractiveness, who is so
obsessed with her body being too large, and trying to fill that
insecurity with attention from men, is that the ageism of the
culture catches up to her.
</P>
<P>
   You are only sexually attractive, conventionally, for a very
brief period in an otherwise long life. And if you don't have
something else about yourself that you value _ forget about whether
the rest of the world values it, but just start with yourself _ you
don't have anything to fall back on. When the next boss or series
of bosses are looking at the younger and younger women, what is she
going to have to feel good about herself? What does she value in
herself? And what does she have to offer of value that she's going
to present to the world? I worry about that. In that sense, I think
she has made some really big mistakes that are going to catch up to
her.

  (jt) 
 By LESLIE LAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Saving Yarrow &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We recently planted yarrow according to instructions, digging
a hole as deep as the pot, putting in peat moss and filling it with
water. As suggested, we removed about 1{ inches of the bottom of
the dirt on the plant in order to open the roots. All the plants
appear to have died, for example turned brown. Can we still save
them?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a lot of handsome yarrows, including the common
weed, Achillea millefolium; the graceful fernleaf, A.
filipendulina, and the pompom-flowered A. ptarmica, also known as
sneezewort, a name that dates from Colonial times, when the dried
roots were used as snuff. All of these are heat and drought
resistant and notoriously tough to kill, but it sounds as if you
may have managed. You might want to turn your attentions to the
planting instructor next.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that advice was fine. You did want to set plants as deep
in the ground as they were in the pot, and ample initial watering
was essential. But peat moss isn't soil, it's a more or less
nutrient-free soil amendment. It must be thoroughly moistened, then
well mixed with earth before it can be used.
</P>
<P>
   As for opening the roots, such violence is called for only if
they are tightly packed and running in circles, in which case the
plant is pot-bound and should not be purchased. (Suspect this
problem if roots are growing out of the bottom of the pot, if the
soil surface looks tight and crusty or if weeds or moss have taken
hold. Confirm your suspicions by gently tipping the plant out of
the pot and taking a look.)
</P>
<P>
   Though you'll be better off starting over, salvation is
distantly possible. Cut the plants back to a joint where tiny green
shoots in the leaf axils suggest there is still life, replant in
loose garden soil and apply a dose of transplant fertilizer. Keep
well watered, and hope for a stretch of cool weather.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Harvesting Onions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Though the tops of our onions are still partly green, most of
them have fallen over. The skins are brown in places. I say it's
time to harvest. My husband says we should leave them until the
tops are completely dry. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Both of you. The onions will continue to gain weight _ albeit
not much _ until all the leaves are down and brown, but leaving
them that long is chancy. If the weather is hot and humid, they may
fall prey to disease; if it's rainy, they may re-sprout. They'll
also have a somewhat shorter storage life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweet onions like Walla Walla or Sweet Spanish can be left in
place; they don't store well, anyway. But if you planted
strong-flavored keepers like Stuttgarter (the most common onion
sets), hoping to put them under the Christmas roast, lift them now.
Spread them out in a warm, dry place, protected from strong
sunlight, and let them cure until the necks are dry and tight,
three days to a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you can braid the tops (braid in a length of
twine to give the finished rope hanging power) or cut them off.
Either way, store the onions where they will be cool and dry and
get good air circulation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Cricket-Free Garden &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. For several summers, I have been plagued by hundreds of
crickets in my vegetable garden. I do not want to use a pesticide.
Is there a natural or environmentally safe alternative?  &QL; 
A. Pesticides are substances formulated to kill pests, so getting
rid of the latter without using the former tends to be a tall
order, but chickens work pretty well. So do toads, snakes, spiders
and skunks, if you don't want to keep poultry. Assuming there are
no perennials to protect, you can use winter to break the cycle. In
late fall, remove all organic debris to the compost, then turn the
soil. Cricket eggs will thus be exposed to hungry animals and
freezing temperatures. Let the ground freeze hard, leave it for six
weeks, then mulch to prevent erosion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are willing to use a pesticide, you can try insecticidal
soap, boric acid or formulations based on neem (Azadirachta
indica). None is perfect, but all are natural and comparatively
safe, environmentally. Pretend you have grasshoppers and follow the
instructions on the label.
</P>

FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY WARY, A HERO WHO'S HALF HARDWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If movie audiences blink, they might miss Andy Heyward's cameo
appearance in the new children's comedy ``Inspector Gadget.'' But
Heyward, a producer of the film, is in many other ways seldom off
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward, 50, the president and chief executive of DIC
(pronounced deek) Entertainment, a major animation house in
Burbank, Calif., created the film's lead character, a bumbling,
sweet-natured police officer who is as much machine as man.
</P>
<P>
   While playing it for giggles, the human-hardware convergence
that is at the heart of an increasing number of new children's
films and cartoons like ``Inspector Gadget,'' from Walt Disney
Pictures, and the ``The Iron Giant,'' from Warner Brothers, is
worthy of serious consideration, Heyward says.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone familiar with the original television cartoon version of
``Inspector Gadget'' that Heyward created in 1982 knows that Gadget
is as likely to launch a bottle rocket from his big toe as he is to
sprout a helicopter rotor from his hat to help him catch bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike, say, the Six Million Dollar Man, Inspector Gadget is
not fully in control of his seemingly endless array of internalized
gadgetry. In that way the character may be emerging as an unlikely
spokesman for many people who are increasingly uneasy with the
rising tide of high-tech gadgets threatening to swamp homes,
offices and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Gadget, after all, is wrestling to harness his own very personal
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   When Inspector Gadget, played in the film by Matthew Broderick,
awakens from an operation that saves his life but crams him with a
slew of crime-fighting gizmos, he looks into a mirror and says, ``I
don't want to be like this. I'm not me anymore. I'm a hardware
store.''
</P>
<P>
   When Inspector Gadget's image recently made it to the cover of
the gadget-laden Sharper Image catalog, Heyward said in a phone
interview, ``It made me wonder if it wasn't raising Brave New
Worldish questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create something, a world you think is completely
fantastic, and a few years go by and it is not so fantastic
anymore. There's a lot of reality attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Inspector Gadget is helped by a heavily
computerized, talking automobile called the Gadgetmobile. This
summer Clarion is selling a talking, in-dash personal computer
called the Auto PC that offers wireless e-mail and global
positioning functions.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said he is always looking for new technologies to
improve the quality and efficiency of his company's work. DIC is
preparing to start an animated television series called ``Sherlock
Holmes in the 22d Century,'' which will use 3-D computer-generated
imagery and more traditional 2-D animation.
</P>
<P>
   A youthful-looking man who is fond of color coordinating his
eyeglasses (he owns 200 pairs) with his neckties with his socks,
Heyward said he is also developing a mystery series for television
that will help preschool children master computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward, who has three children, ages 7 to 15, said his
children, like many of their generation, are very comfortable with
technology. He said his 11-year-old son is building his own
personal computer and corresponding by e-mail with Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are,'' Heyward said, ``constantly giving me ideas that
relate to technology.''

   Q. How big can an attachment file be for an e-mail message? Is
there an official size limit to how much you can send?
</P>
<P>
   A. In theory, there are no official size limits across the
Internet pertaining to e-mail attachments. In practice, however,
many e-mail system administrators regulate attachment sizes to
avoid clogging their lines with megabytes of data and filling user
mailboxes on their mail servers. These size limits vary with each
system and usually range from 2 to 4 megabytes, but check with your
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network, for example, limits inbound and outbound
messages to 2 megabytes total (including the message text and the
attached file). America Online also maintains an approximate
2-megabyte limit for messages between AOL and other service
providers, but if you have an AOL account and are sending a file to
another person using AOL, you can send about 8 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   To provide some control, many e-mail programs will let users
specify a maximum size for attachments in the program's settings.
Some programs will also give users the option of breaking a large
attachment into several files that can download more quickly on the
other end. If you have a large file to send, you may want to reduce
its size with compression software or use a third-party
file-splitting program (available on many shareware Web sites) to
send the file in chunks.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Our new house has flush doors that are simply painted. I
would like to somehow ``dress them up'' get rid of the flat, dull
appearance and make them look more like a paneled door. Have you
any suggestion as to how I can create the look of a paneled door,
without replacing them and preferably without covering them with
any type of wallcovering?
</P>
<P>
   A: Use some standard picture frame molding to assemble four,
five or six ``frames'' in the sizes desired for each raised
``panel'' on the door. Or have a local dealer who sells and
assembles picture frames make them up for you. Then glue these
frames, properly spaced, to the door face as shown here, arranging
them to create the desired ``raised panel'' effect. Then paint as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me the best way to take paint off my kitchen
cabinet doors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Take the doors off so you can work on them in the garage or
basement. Remove all handles, hinges and other hardware, then use a
semi-paste, non-flammable chemical paint remover to strip the paint
off while the doors are laying flat on a bench or table. Spread the
remover on in thick layers with a minimum of brushing and allow to
soak in for 15 or 20 minutes. Scrape off the softened residue with
a dull putty knife and repeat if necessary. Finally, wipe off the
surface with steel wool that has been dipped into solvent
recommended for that brand of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am going to install a new flagstone walk in place of the
existing concrete walk leading to my front stoop. I will set the
stones in cement, and fill the joints between them with mortar.
Many of the flagstones will have to be cut to size before I can
install them so can you tell me how to cut them where necessary?
</P>
<P>
   A: The easiest way is to use a portable circular saw equipped
with a masonry-cutting abrasive blade. These power tools can be
rented, although you may have to buy your own blade. The saw is
usually used to make progressively deeper cuts on one side, then
the stone is turned over and tapped along this cut with a hammer to
break off the waste.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our house once had ivy growing on the brick wall on each side
of the house. This ivy was removed by the previous owner, but there
are still lots of little stem pieces visible where not all of the
vine was removed. I've tried scraping, rubbing with steel wool and
scrubbing with detergent, but the particles are still visible. What
can you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a difficult task that usually requires either
pressure washing with a suitable chemical (not a job for the
do-it-yourselfer) or using a wire wheel attached to an electric
grinder. Either way, the task must be done carefully to avoid
damaging the brick and safety goggles must be worn to protect your
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general

</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``DECORATING A PLAIN DOOR'' goes with

</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Wood picture frames glued to face of door create
appearance of ``raised panels'' on flush door.

 WINDOWS IN iMAC CLOTHING  
 (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in college, a classmate turned in a writing assignment that
was almost identical to a short story written years earlier by Ray
Bradbury. Only the characters' names and minor details had been
changed. The instructor suggested that the work was dangerously
close to plagiarism. ``It's not plagiarism,'' the student declared
defiantly. ``It's  &UR; homage. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The response itself was too good to have been original. And the
same might be said for the new eOne computer from Emachines, which
is, shall we say, a very good  &UR; homage &LR;  to Apple Computer's popular
iMac. Only the operating system and some minor details are
different. And, oh yes, the price: The eOne went on sale last week
at Circuit City for $799, about $400 less than the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Like the iMac, the eOne is a one-piece computer with a built-in
15-inch monitor, in translucent blue and white plastic, with a
skeletal keyboard, a weird mouse and a multicolored power cord.
</P>
<P>
   Put the iMac and the eOne side by side, and the most obvious
difference appears to be that the eOne has a clunkier, boxy design
and is less elegantly molded than the beachball-like iMac.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the iMac is ugly, you will want to beat the eOne
with a stick. But a bigger difference is that once the power button
is pushed, the eOne hoists the Jolly Roger flag of the Windows 98
operating system, running on a 433-megahertz Intel Celeron
microprocessor, instead of the happy-face logo of the Mac OS
running on the iMac's 333-megahertz PowerPC G3 chip.
</P>
<P>
   While the eOne lacks the elegance of the iMac, it is
nevertheless impressive for the money. I was able to set it up and
connect it to the Internet over a telephone line in less than 10
minutes, and that included a few puzzled moments lost when the
on-screen instructions suddenly and mysteriously lapsed into German
(this may be the most original thing about the eOne).
</P>
<P>
   Although it loses points on originality, the eOne scores bonus
points for including standard features that the iMac lacks, like a
floppy diskette drive, extra system memory, and serial and parallel
connection ports.
</P>
<P>
   The eOne also improves greatly on the iMac's skeletal keyboard
and hockey-puck mouse. But unlike the iMac, which comes in a choice
of five fruit colors, the eOne comes in only one color, which
should probably be called ``Sue Me Blue.'' Apple last month sued
Daewoo Telecom, a South Korean electronics company, and its PC
subsidiary, Future Power, after they announced plans to start
selling one-piece, translucent, fruit-colored, Windows-based
computers that looked remarkably like the iMac. An Apple
spokeswoman, Katie Cotton, said this week that the company had
``absolutely no comment, for obvious reasons'' on the introduction
of the Emachines eOne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear ours was not designed to be a copy,'' said Pattie
Adams, a spokeswoman for Emachines. ``Yes, it is an all-in-one
design, it is translucent and it is blue, but the similarities stop
there,'' Ms. Adams said. ``We're not offering multicolors. Our
mouse is different. You have to be a space alien to use theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   And you would have to be from another planet to be unaware of
the spectacular success of the iMac, which was introduced a year
ago. Month after month, the iMac is the most popular single model
of computer sold at retail, for reasons that include styling,
simplicity, price and ease of use, particularly for making it easy
to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The eOne mimics the iMac's style, at two-thirds of the price. It
is just as simple to set up, and it connects almost as easily to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, because, after all, this is a Windows machine, and
Windows is not quite as easy for beginners to use as the Mac OS.
Example: Just a couple of mouse clicks into the Internet set-up
routine, the eOne made an annoying ``boink!'' noise and issued this
warning: ``File and printer sharing is running on the same TCP/IP
connection you will use to access the Internet. Other users on the
Internet might be able to access your files. You cannot continue
unless you disable file and printer sharing.'' The user, who may
never have used a computer before, has two puzzling choices, ``OK''
or ``Cancel.'' How rude.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to this: The Macintosh operating system is a
little easier to use, and generally more stable than Windows. In
part because of the iMac's success, Apple is no longer a risky
choice. But 90 percent of all new PC's today are based on the
Windows operating system, and far more software is available for
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   There is safety in numbers, especially when you are trying to
find someone to help fix a computer problem at 10 p.m. On the other
hand, there will probably be more problems to fix with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   If the main purpose of the computer is to connect to the
Internet, browse the World Wide Web and send and receive e-mail,
and maybe handle personal finances and an occasional game or
educational program, the operating system is becoming less and less
important.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing then becomes a battle of features. Let's compare: The
eOne has a 433-megahertz Celeron chip with 128 kilobytes of Level 2
cache, which improves the chip's performance. The iMac has a
333-megahertz PowerPC G3 with 512 kilobytes of L2 cache. Although
the clock rate on the Celeron is higher, the iMac has the better
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The eOne comes with 64 megabytes of random access memory and a
6.4-gigabyte hard disk drive. The iMac comes with 32 megabyte RAM
and a 6 megabyte hard disk. Boosting the iMac's memory to 64
megabytes, which is highly recommended, adds $70 to the price.
Advantage, eOne.
</P>
<P>
   Both have a 24X CD-ROM drive, but the eOne has a floppy drive
while the iMac has none. A floppy drive may not be state of the
art, but no matter what Apple says, almost everyone needs some sort
of removable storage device.
</P>
<P>
   Both machines come with an Ethernet networking port, and both
have two Universal Serial Bus ports. Both come with a built-in V90
modem and fax software. But the eOne wins on connectivity, because
it also has a built-in home phone line networking port (HomePNA),
two PC card slots, a serial port, a parallel port and a game/MIDI
(musical instrument digital interface) port. It also has video-in
and audio-in ports.
</P>
<P>
   The eOne has a Rage XL AGP graphics accelerator with 8 megabytes
of video memory for displaying 3-D graphics in games and for
viewing Internet video. The iMac has a more powerful Rage Pro Turbo
graphics card with 6 megabyte video memory. Advantage: iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The eOne comes with a one-year parts and labor warranty and 15
days of free telephone technical support; subsequent support calls
are $20 ``per incident.'' Apple offers a limited one-year warranty
and 90 days of telephone support; after that, calls are $35 to $37
per incident.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Emachines  &UR; (www.e4me.com) &LR; , which recently passed Apple
to become the fifth-largest PC seller in America, is a partner in
America Online's $400 rebate program for customers who sign a
36-month contract for AOL's Compuserve Internet service at $21.95 a
month. That cuts the initial cost of the eOne to $399, an even
better bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Has Emachines plagiarized the iMac? That is for the courts to
decide, if Apple chooses to file another lawsuit. Perhaps Emachines
will be brazen enough to market the eOne with the slogan, ``Think
Undifferent.''

 &HT;    No culinary conundrum is too difficult to solve
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how experienced a cook may be, it is inevitable that
there will be times when something comes up in the kitchen that
presents a problem. An unavailable ingredient, an unfamiliar
technique or any number of unforeseen situations can arise,
prompting a cook to reach for the phone or a favored cookbook
looking for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   By now every cook with a computer knows that it would take 10
lifetimes to run out of ideas for what to make for dinner, so
jam-packed is cyberspace with recipes
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also is an outstanding resource for solving cooking
problems. But unlike a search for recipes, it's better to know
where to look in a search for solutions. Here are some addresses
you may want to bookmark:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At www.learn2.com/browse/foo.html, one of the first things
you'll learn is how to boil an egg. After the basics, there are
lessons on how to carve a turkey; choose a knife, cooking oil or
wine; clean a fish, eat sushi and get rid of fishy smells; make a
great pot of coffee or tea; and make a roux, sourdough starter,
flavored vinegars, foamed milk, pizza dough and rice _ for
starters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then there's Betty Crocker at www.bettycrocker.com/recipes
</P>
<P>
   /guide/index.html to guide you through the minefields of creme
fraiche, sharpening shears, insulated cookie sheets, decorating
with fresh flowers, freezing cabbage, drying tomatoes, smashing
peppercorns, making garnishes, peeling kiwis, roasting garlic and
much more.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The information at the Better Homes and Gardens Kitchen
Cooking Encyclopedia at www.bhglive.com/food/cookhelpers
</P>
<P>
   /encyclopedia/index.html is, well, encyclopedic and easy to
access as well. There are easy-to-follow instructions and hints on
just about anything from pulling taffy to carving a goose. Useful
charts include emergency substitutions and cooking for a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If it's a technique you need boning up on, check out Cuisine
Magazine's Kitchen Tested Tips and Techniques at www.augusthome
</P>
<P>
   .com/cuitips.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Epicurious weighs in with another excellent problem-solving
site, ``1,001 Tips From Great Cooks'' at
food.epicurious.com/eeating
</P>
<P>
   /e02secrets/aindex.html. Searchable information is listed from A
(how do make acidulated water) to Z (everything you want to know
about zest).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There's lots of practical info at Fabulous Foods Cooking
School, at www.fabulousfoods.com/mainframe.html, where you will
find such topics as measuring, making stock and bread and boning a
chicken breast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It's always helpful to see a picture of the dish accompanying
a recipe, and www.augusthome.com/cooking/cuisine/RECIPES
</P>
<P>
   /marshs.htm goes a step further to provide pictures of the
step-by-step preparation.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a sampling of a multitude of sites that, combined,
probably answer every kitchen question ever asked. Links to the
sites already mentioned and to many more are at
www.kitchenlink.com/cgi/publicframes?page &QC; faqs.

 &HT;    Yes, you can can

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jam and jelly making may seem more like a science experiment
than cooking. After all, there are strict guidelines, some special
tools and some funny ingredients like pectin involved.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let that intimidate you. Or squelch your creativity. I've
discovered that half the fun is making combinations you truly can't
find in the grocery store, like tart orange and Grand Marnier and
ginger and peach.
</P>
<P>
   Any jam or jelly recipe will break down into four essential
parts: fruit, pectin, acid and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit gives jams and jellies their characteristic flavor and
color. It also provides part of the pectin, acid and liquid
required for successful jell formation.
</P>
<P>
   Pectin is the substance that causes jams and jellies to jell.
Some fruits, such as apples, can have enough natural pectin for
jell formation. The riper the fruit, the less natural pectin it
contains. Luckily, commercial pectin may be used (and I highly
recommend it for beginners).
</P>
<P>
   Acid also is needed for jell formation, as well as flavor.
Fruits vary in acid content. Lemon juice or citric acid is commonly
added when fruits are low in acid.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar not only provides flavor and helps with jelling, but it's
also a preserving agent.
</P>
<P>
   We provide you here with everything you need to know to get
started, from equipment to recipes. And this is a great project to
share with a friend. Set aside a half-day or day, gather the fruits
and jars and have a jam session.
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of books and Web sites out there on the
topics of food preservation, including jam and jelly making. It's
important to get reliable and safe information. A call to your
county extension office always is the best place to start. Or, if
you are online, you can have the University of Georgia Cooperative
Extension Service's resources at your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you do: go to www.fcs.uga.edu
</P>
<P>
   /outreach/coopex. Then you'll be given a menu of choices. Choose
``food safety and preservation,'' then ``publications and
resources,'' and then ``food preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another good source is the ``Ball Blue Book Guide to Home
Canning, Freezing and Dehydration'' ($5.95), which can be purchased
by calling 1-800-392-2575 or sending a check with name and address
to Alltrista Consumer Products, P.O. Box 2005, Department MK,
Muncie, IN 47307.
</P>
<P>
   EQUIPMENT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saucepans for boiling lids and cooking fruit.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For jelly, a bag or pouch for extracting fruit juices. The bag
can be made of several thicknesses of closely woven cheesecloth or
firm unbleached muslin. Be sure it is washed and rinsed well after
each use.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boiling water canner or a deep cooking pot with lid and rack.
(I used a 10-quart stockpot with a colander basket.) The jars
cannot rest directly on the bottom of the pot (thus the rack) and
you must have room for 1 inch of water above the jars and another
inch boiling room.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Canning jars (see below) with new lids. Jam and jelly recipes
usually call for half-pint, or 8-ounce, jars. Be sure all jars are
free from cracks and chips. Remember that lids can only be used
once (but the bands that screw on around them can be reused.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tongs for removing jars from boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A wide-mouth funnel is not absolutely necessary, but it sure
does make pouring the jam or jelly into the jars a whole lot
easier. If you see one, pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The advanced jelly maker will want a jelly or candy
thermometer for making products without added pectin.

</P>
<P>
   PREPARING JARS
</P>
<P>
   Usually, half-pint jars are used for jams and jellies. First,
wash the jars, along with the lids and screw bands, in hot soapy
water or the dishwasher and rinse thoroughly. Dry and set the bands
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Next, sterilize the jars. Place the jars on a rack in a deep pot
or canner and cover with water. Jars must be totally submerged.
Bring the water to a boil; boil jars 10 minutes, and then allow
jars to remain covered in hot water until ready to use, removing
one at a time as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Place the lids in a separate saucepan and cover with water.
Bring the water to a simmer (180 degrees) and heat for 10 minutes,
then allow to rest in the warm water until needed, removing one at
a time. Do not boil the lids _ that may result in seal failure.
</P>
<P>
   _``Ball Blue Book Guide''
</P>
<P>
   PROCESSING JAMS AND JELLIES
</P>
<P>
   All jellied products must be processed in a boiling water bath
to prevent mold growth. Some cookbooks and recipes may suggest that
you simply need to pour the hot liquid into a hot, clean jar, put
on a hot lid and invert for five minutes. But that method has not
been proven to be failsafe when it comes to preventing spoilage. So
play it safe and go with the water bath.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the hot jam or jelly mixture into the hot, sterilized jars,
leaving 1/4 inch head space. Wipe the jar rims and close with
treated canning lids and screw bands. Place on a rack in a large
pot or canner filled with boiling water. The water should cover the
jars by at least 1 inch, with additional room for boiling. Cover
the pot or canner. Bring the water back to a boil and boil gently
for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then remove the jars to a protected surface and cool, away from
drafts. Do not move jellied products for 12 hours after they're
made; moving them can break the jell. After 12 hours, check the
seal, remove the screw band, label and store in a cool, dry, dark
place.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter the storage time, the better the product. Though
cooked jellied products should keep for at least a year, their
flavor and quality begin to decrease within a few months.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   COMMON QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is it necessary to process jellies, jams, conserves,
preserves and marmalades?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mold and other spoilage microorganisms can grow when the seal
is not airtight. Processing pushes air from jars and helps ensure a
good seal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get jars, pectin, canners and other equipment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hardware stores usually are excellent sources for jars,
tongs, canners and equipment. There's also a mail-order form for
canners and other equipment in the boxes of Ball jars. Discount
stores like Wal-Mart and Target sometimes carry the equipment,
though it varies by season and geographic location (summertime and
rural areas are your best shot). Grocery stores also carry jars,
lids and pectin. Look near the freezer bags and containers, though
the location can vary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use honey or corn syrup in place of sugar when I make
jelly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Light, mild-flavored honey or corn syrup can be used, but not
to completely replace sugar. In products with added pectin, up to 1
cup of honey can replace an equal amount of sugar for a recipe that
yields 6 half-pint jars. Honey can replace up to half of the sugar
in recipes with no added pectin, but there will be a honey flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Corn syrup can replace half the sugar if powdered pectin is
used, and 2 cups per batch if liquid pectin is used.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial sweeteners cannot be substituted for sugar in regular
recipes because the sugar is needed for jelling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I make jelly without added sugar?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, there are methods, but recipes should come from a
reliable source. Contact your county extension office for
directions and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I double a jam or jelly recipe?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's best not to. The cooking time changes in relation to the
proportion of ingredients when you increase the recipe. The bigger
the batch, the worse the problem. Small batches of jelly are easier
to handle and are more apt to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since the fruit in jam is mashed anyway, can I use mushy
fruit?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mushy fruit may be overripe and have very little natural
pectin and acid. You can use it, but it may never jell and the
flavor may not be good. Always add pectin if you use overripe
fruit, and never use moldy fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My jam tastes like wine. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: It fermented, due to an improper seal and possibly a poor
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is my jelly bubbly?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the bubbles are active, it's a sign of spoilage. Throw it
out. Stationary bubbles indicate that the jelly was poured too
slowly or from too great a height into the jars and air was
trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What makes jelly too stiff?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was either overcooked or had too little sugar or too much
pectin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I decrease the amount of foam that forms on my jelly?
</P>
<P>
   A: The foam that forms from the boiling process will not hurt
the product but will detract from the appearance. Adding 1/4
teaspoon butter or margarine will help eliminate foam. Foam also
can be skimmed from the surface of jam before pouring into jars.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can be done to make soft jellies firmer?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several methods for remaking a failed batch of
jelly safely. Contact your county extension office for directions.

   A friend of mine told me pectin was for sissies. So I tried this
recipe, which does not call for pectin. But you'll see it listed in
the list of ingredients anyway. That's because I could never get
the jelly to sheet properly. So I threw in the pectin at the last
minute. Call me a sissy. But my jelly is darn good. You can give
the hard way a try. With perfectly ripe fruit, you may be
successful. But keep the pectin on hand anyway.

the fruit is soft. Extract juice by pouring the plum mixture into a
jelly bag or pouch made with several layers of cheesecloth or
muslin set inside a strainer. Allow the plums to cool slightly,
then gather the cloth up and squeeze the juice into a bowl. Be
careful _ the fruit will still be quite hot.

still have an abundance of peaches, this recipe is ideal. It's an
old favorite with a new flavor twist _ ginger. This is great on
bread and muffins, but also makes a wonderful glaze for roast

   Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, allowing the marmalade to
bubble a little, for approximately 10 minutes. At that time, turn
off the heat and place a spoonful of jam on a cold plate in the
refrigerator. If in 10 minutes it has developed a skin, it is
ready. If not, return to the heat and keep cooking, and try again
in a few minutes. When ready, pour into hot, sterilized half-pint

   This tasted luxurious and makes a wonderful gift. Hold on to
this recipe for the citrus season just before the holidays. It will
be a wonderful way to make use of a crate of oranges.
</P>
<P>
   For juice extraction:
</P>
<P>
   6 oranges, each cut into 8 pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 large lemons, each cut into 8 pieces
</P>
<P>
   For the jelly:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons strained fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Grand Marnier
</P>
<P>
   6 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 3-ounce pouch plus 2 tablespoons liquid pectin
</P>
<P>
   Extract the juice: With a food grinder fitted with the coarse
blade, coarsely grind the oranges and lemons, or in a food
processor mince them, pulsing the motor several times and scraping
down the sides. In a large saucepan combine the fruit and 3 1/2
cups cold water. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium-low heat,
stirring occasionally, and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Ladle
the mixture into a jelly bag set over a large heatproof bowl and
let it drip, undisturbed, for 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have a jelly bag, line a fine-mesh strainer with
layers of cheesecloth, muslin or a damp tea towel and suspend over
a large, nonreactive bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Do not squeeze the jelly bag, but occasionally rub it gently and
scrape the juices from the outside with a spatula into the bowl. If
there is less than 3 cups of the extracted juice, pour a small
amount of hot water into the jelly bag and let the mixture drip
until there is 3 cups juice.
</P>
<P>
   Make the jelly: In a heavy 8-quart kettle, combine the extracted
juice, the lemon juice, the Grand Marnier and the sugar and cook
the mixture over high heat, stirring constantly, until it comes to
a full rolling boil that froths up toward the top of the kettle and
cannot be stirred down. Stir in the pectin, bring the mixture to a
full rolling boil again, stirring constantly, and boil it, stirring
constantly, for 1 minute. Remove the kettle from the heat, skim off
all the froth and pour into hot, sterilized half-pint jars, leaving
1/4 inch head space. Wipe rims clean, secure lids and process in a
boiling water bath for 5 minutes. _ Gourmet, September, 1985

   Kim Curley, host of WSB's ``Food and Wine'' show, spent a
morning making jam with me, sharing the fact that her grandmother
always relied on the recipes inside the Sure Jell pectin box. But
occasionally, she'd throw in a twist _ one small box of raspberry
Jell-O. Either way, this recipe is a gem.
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chopped apricots (about 3 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 box (1 3/4-ounce) powdered pectin
</P>
<P>
   7 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Put the apricots and lemon juice in a large saucepan and stir in
the pectin. Bring mixture to a full rolling boil over medium-high
heat, stirring constantly. Add the sugar quickly (and the raspberry
Jell-O, if using) to the fruit mixture, return to a full rolling
boil and boil exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from
heat. Skim off any foam and pour into hot, sterilized half-pint
jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Wipe rims clean, secure lids and
process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes.

   I've tried many biscuit recipes but lately keep coming back to
this one. It can be doubled, and it's also good with buttermilk
instead of cream. But the cream does give it a bit of a scone
characteristic, which makes these absolutely ideal for butter and
jam.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees and lightly grease a baking sheet.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.
Cut 5 tablespoons butter into bits and with your fingertips or a
pastry blender, blend bits into flour mixture until it all
resembles coarse meal. Add cream, stirring with a fork until just
combined. Transfer mixture to a lightly floured surface and gently
knead about 3 times until it just forms a dough. Pat dough into a 6
1/2-inch round about 1/2 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out biscuits and arrange
about 1 inch apart on baking sheet. Gather and pat out scraps and
cut out more biscuits. Melt remaining tablespoon butter and lightly
brush on biscuits. Bake biscuits in middle of oven until pale
golden and cooked through, about 20 minutes. _ Gourmet, February

 &HT;    Do-it-yourselfers can't keep a lid on their creativity when it
comes to mixing ripe fruit with sugar in hopes of getting jars full
of colorful condiments that fly off the shelves
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pull the biscuits from the oven, puffed and golden.
Take one, split it and quick, while the steam escapes, crown each
half with a pat of butter and a jewel of jam.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a ruby-red raspberry, sweet yet tart. Or amber apple
jelly, subtle and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Take a bite, close your eyes and most surely a queenly
apparition of your grandmother will appear.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother felt so downright unshackled by the arrival of
convenience foods, the Ball jars were never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   So each time I'd see jam and jelly jars at a roadside stand or
farmers' market, I'd wonder: How can you take the colors of a
rainbow, give them vibrant substance and taste and put them in a
jar, to be dolloped out on a whim?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not as magical as I imagined _ though as I
finished my first batch of jam (raspberry rum) this summer, I felt
a certain special power.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Liles, 50, of Cedartown, Ga., who also has experienced the
joy of jam making for the first time this summer, knows what I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a feeling you get after you're done and you look at
your jars and the beautiful fruit and you know you did it,'' said
Liles, who's recently traded urban life for country living. ``It's
easy to walk into the store and buy it, but you did this with your
own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that we are not alone in venturing into this
nostalgic art. ``We are having a very good sales year,'' said Judy
Harrold, spokeswoman for Alltrista Consumer Products Co., maker of
Ball and Kerr jars. Harrold said that while jar sales have been
increasing slowly throughout the '90s, a sharper increase over last
year's 4.7 million cases is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is good growing seasons; some of it may be Y2K
concerns and some of it may be the return to home arts,'' Harrold
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's research shows folks typically like to can
vegetables and make jams and jellies to have control over the
quality of ingredients. ``After that, people say it's just for the
sheer enjoyment of it, as a hobby and for relaxation,'' Harrold
said. ``And jams and jellies are always good places to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Good because jams and jellies don't require a significant
investment in special equipment or lengthy preparations. The fruit
tree in your back yard, a trip to a U-pick farm or organic market
or a visit with a friend who gardens will provide you with the
goods. Then you'll need jars and lids, tongs, a deep stockpot and a
rack for the jars to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, making jams and jellies simply requires
cooking down ripe fruit with sugar, adding some pectin and pouring
into sterilized jars. Then, boil the jars in a water bath to seal
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you do it more, you'll learn to get the fruit at just the
perfect time, and it will always be better than store-bought,''
said Suzanne Franklin, 44, of Dawsonville, Ga., who's been making
jams and jellies for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you usually can't find combinations like ginger and
peach or hot pepper and mint on the grocery shelves. ``I like to
mix apple and grape. That makes real good peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches,'' said Erris Brown, 67, who has a farm in Haralson
County, Ga., and has been a jam maker for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many jam and jelly makers say they enjoy sharing the experience
_ both in making and in giving. Brown often works with her daughter
and daughter-in-law. Lori Wilkins, 25, a family and consumer
science specialist with the Gwinnett County Extension Service
(Ga.), makes peach and strawberry jams with her mother to give as
Christmas gifts. ``It's great to make some with ripe summer fruit.
Then you have a head start on the holidays,'' said Wilkins. Jams
and jellies usually are tasty for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Add a beautiful label and tie on a hat of calico fabric with
some raffia, and you'll have a gift that speaks thoughtfulness _
something that required more effort than the swipe of a credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the trick is keeping the jams and jellies on the
shelf. Chances are the stock will dwindle each time the toaster
pops up or a pan of biscuits is pulled from the oven. But that's
OK. Make jam or jelly once, and you'll always have the magic.

 &HT;    Can-do Brunswick stew simmers
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marlene Brown's request for Brunswick Stew using all
canned ingredients brought a dozen similar replies. All called for
canned barbecue meats, vegetables, tomatoes and corn. A few added
cans of lima beans or okra. And some called for a chopped fresh
onion, deviating just a pinch from the all-canned requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference, though, was in the cooking. Most called
for simply opening cans, stirring the mix and heating for 20 to 30
minutes. One went further _ to simmer an additional hour. But a
couple make use of the crockpot _ simmering the stew all day,
blending the flavors, so it is ready when you get home. Our tester
liked this slow-cooked one, sent by Alva Bentley of Decatur, Ga.,
and said it benefits from cooking the full eight hours.

COURTS EMBRACE CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the suspect in a high-profile Yosemite
murder case was scheduled for an arraignment at the federal
courthouse in Fresno last month, staff members there braced for a
media circus of O.J. Simpson-trial proportions.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what they got: A pack of reporters, bulky
satellite trucks in the parking lot and even a legal pundit or two.
</P>
<P>
   But the least of their problems, surprisingly, has been meeting
the demand for records. Since the case broke, almost every legal
document related to the case of Cary Anthony Stayner has appeared
on the court's World Wide Web site an hour after filing.
</P>
<P>
   Posting records on the Web is a growing trend in California
courthouses, where the public can cut through multiple layers of
red tape with a few strokes on a computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern District federal courthouse, based in San
Francisco, has a Web site (www.cand.uscourts.gov) that is even more
advanced than the Fresno site and most others in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at the other Web sites,'' said Northern District
clerk Rich Wieking. ``Ours is as good as, if not better than, the
best of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If a federal court case breaks with as much public interest as
Stayner's, officials in the Northern District say they are ready to
post documents on the Web. Stayner is accused of killing a
researcher at the Yosemite National Park and reportedly confessed
to killing three visitors to the park earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other jurisdictions could have used such a service.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the document needs for the O.J. Simpson murder trial and
civil lawsuit was a hassle for the staff of the Los Angeles
Superior Court, who had to print numerous copies of inch-thick
documents, selling them for 57 cents per page.
</P>
<P>
   While the staff in the Eastern District managed to avoid that
nightmare, the Stayner case wasn't the first major news event to
get an assist by a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents from the case of Theodore Kaczynski, the
convicted Unabomber, have been on the Web for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having Kaczynski in our district, I wasn't looking
forward to having such a high-profile case,'' said Marianne
Matherly, deputy in charge of the U.S. District Court clerk's
office, who handles media requests for the Stayner case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it went quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northern District Web site includes detailed maps to each of
its courthouses, downloadable forms, court calendars for each judge
and new civil case filings, which are updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew J. Jacobs said prosecutors
juggle cases in different courtrooms and appreciate the Web access
to court calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very helpful,'' Jacobs said. ``I've used it, and I know
others have used it frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he hopes entire cases end up on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of paper that gets used in litigation, both
civil and criminal,'' Jacobs said. ``For some cases, (paperwork)
can end up filling a whole room, or several rooms.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLENVILLE , N.Y. _ Maybe it's the tiny glossy photograph of the
bowler hat and hatrack tacked to the wall of the foyer. Maybe it's
the amber plastic beads substituting for a door to the funky aqua
and white kitchen with the Italian molded chairs. Or maybe it's the
young woman with shingled hair, a graphic designer/wire sculptor
who wears her tank top and Dickies painter's pants with elan and
who has turned the old plastics factory here in the Catskills into
her personal retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it's not your grandmother's Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is still the land of mobile homes and mountains, of
high grass and old farmhouses. It's still the land of abandoned
borscht belt bungalow colonies and tacky trout fishing souvenirs.
But now it is also a land of young New Yorkers, many of whom labor
in the design fields, who have begun to buy weekend and even
year-round houses in Ulster, Sullivan and Delaware Counties. These
men and women say they come for the serenity, the friendship and,
perhaps most important, the prices. Farmhouses with more than 100
acres go for less than $200,000; a cottage with 18 acres and a pond
sold for $65,000. A tiny house on one Main Street just went for
$23,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's your New York City types like me,'' said Ellen
Swandiak, the West Village graphic designer who is celebrating her
first summer in the white vinyl-sided factory in Ulster County.
(``Everyone has a name for their place up here,'' she said. ``Mine
is The Lab.'') ``Then there's your Hasidic types. Then you have
your gays. Then you have the ashrams. Then you have your rednecks _
all in the same spot.''
</P>
<P>
   In this population amalgam, the new people are not exactly
embraced by the local residents, but they are tolerated. There is a
grudging understanding that they fill up the cabins and create the
herb-suffused restaurants with names like Le Potagerie. In Sullivan
County, for example, the median yearly income has risen from
$33,884 to $45,000 in the last nine years, a rise that Jonathan
Drapkin, the county manager, links to an influx of new homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The low house prices have a lot to do with the Catskills' allure
for the newest settlers _ Ms. Swandiak says that 20 friends have
moved to the mountains _ but so do the rusted-out pickup trucks.
``It's about getting sick of the snobbery,'' she said. ``In the
city, everyone asks: `Am I wearing the right things? Am I thin
enough?' Here, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dolce, an editorial consultant to magazines and to a new
fashion wire service, moved to the Sullivan County town of
Wurtsboro several years ago, in the vanguard of the new wave. He
shares Ms. Swandiak's Catskills vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long we spend our energies searching for the chic and
sleek,'' he said. ``We want to spend the rest of our time where
absolutely nothing is in fashion, and that just about sums up
Sullivan County: the anti-sleek.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Ms. Swandiak said she spent no more than $75 on any
piece of furniture, plucked from local thrift shops and auctions,
but each was chosen and is displayed with a designer's eye. Dolce,
too, boasted of his shopping prowess: ``Nothing costs more than
$100, including the red Formica table and four chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolce's little gray-green '40s bungalow might once have been one
in a million, but now it's one of a kind. He ripped out walls and
created a cathedral ceiling. ``We put in an old claw-foot tub and
tiled,'' he said. ``We rebuilt the outdoor shower. This year, we're
painting the bedroom all white.'' But they're not ripping out the
knotty pine. Or the multicolored Christmas bulbs strung around the
cornice. Or the plastic deer on the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Dolce and a handful of other New Yorkers live on a tiny street
in the section of town called Wurtsboro Hills. You can identify
their bungalows by the designer touches: red caladiums in
earthenware pots on a handkerchief-size patio; a brand-new trellis
leading to a guest cottage; perfectly patinated 1930s green lawn
furniture with flowered pillows on a screened-in porch.
</P>
<P>
   Wurtsboro, with its giant gas station, its real-estate offices
and its restaurants, Irish bar to French bistro, is one of the
larger towns in Sullivan County: its population hovers just under
1,200. Wurtsboro Hills was built in the '30s and '40s as a summer
community, where the water ran through above-ground pipes and was
turned off in October, then turned on again in May. Now the
newcomers have dug wells and insulated their houses. Still, the
section is about 60 percent summer people, 40 percent year-round
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Polakov, a Manhattan writer and graphic designer,
bought a Wurtsboro Hills bungalow that he had visited as a child: a
little cottage he has transformed into shelter-magazine chic.
``Wurtsboro is rare for the Catskills,'' he said, explaining why he
and so many of his friends have chosen the area. ``It's intact;
it's a real place. It's not as much of a ghost town as some
others.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wurtsboro, there are antiques shops, an ice cream shack
called Custard's Last Stand, a gym, a tattoo parlor, a pet shop and
a Harley-Davidson dealership. The full-time residents may drive the
Harleys, but everyone buys the ice cream cones.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wurtsboro is close to Mountain Dale, which until a few years ago
looked like many Catskills towns: somewhat seedy. There are still
some boarded-up shops, but there are also signs of renewal: a new
balcony along Main Street and freshly painted shop fronts _ and For
Rent signs in the windows. There are hanging baskets with pink
petunias spilling from them.
</P>
<P>
   In other towns that ring the Catskill Mountains, things are not
so rosy. At midday in early August, Fleischmanns (pop. 346) in
Delaware County looked dusty and virtually abandoned. Yet the
newest inhabitants are delighted with the place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jee Levin, 27, and her husband, Randy Buck, 32, have just signed
a contract to buy a foursquare, turn-of-the century brown shingled
house at a corner on Wagner Avenue, once a prosperous street of
grand Victorian mansions. They are following their friends: five
other couples who have bought houses within 30 minutes of one
another. The listing price on their immaculate house, with a
raucous stream running across the back of the property, was
$69,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Wagner Avenue mansions appear to be well tended (``You don't
see any For Sale signs on them, do you?'' Buck asked, already
chauvinistic about his town.) But the town has a certain aura of,
well, poverty: empty stores and sagging sidewalks. There are no
pink petunias here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Prince, a local real estate broker, was asked about finding
a place in Fleischmanns. ``Oh, that's easy,'' he said. ``The whole
town is for sale.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many towns in the Catskills _ towns like Loch Sheldrake and
Livingston Manor and Pine Hill _ Fleischmanns looks as if it needs
an infusion of money. Look what just such an infusion has done for
Margaretville, another once-sleepy backwater about five miles away.
On almost every block, at least one magnificent Victorian bears
signs of recent restoration, and the downtown is jumping, as much
as a place with a population of 690 can jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Fleischmanns, it has equally beautiful antique
Victorian houses,'' said Jonathan E. Korn, a Margaretville
real-estate agent. But Margaretville has been lucky enough to land
the area's major supermarket, as well as new stores and
restaurants. Margaretville was also lucky _ in a macabre way _ to
be hard hit by flooding in 1996. Insurance paid for new sidewalks
and a new Main Street. Mayor Bill Hubbell also credited the
newcomers.

   ``A lot of people are from New York,'' he said, ``and they've
brought fresh thoughts to the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn moved to Margaretville part time four years ago and has now
cut his ties to Manhattan: two weeks ago, he sold his city
apartment. He flipped through a book of listings: ``This is in the
New Kingston section, the TriBeCa of Margaretville,'' he intoned
with a straight face. ``Six acres, glorious valley. The owner calls
it Snow Beach _ $139,000. My God, that's the price of a studio in
the city. And look at this little cottage for $59,000. We're
showing it 10 times a day!''
</P>
<P>
   The agent took a visitor on a tour. ``You'll see a lot of people
like me, gay people,'' he said. ``But we don't want Margaretville
to be known as a gay place.'' He pointed out a stylish house on a
hill. ``That sold to straight people.'' He paused. ``Thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Margaretville are higher than those in surrounding
communities. ``We're having a boom,'' Korn said, ``but the prices
here are still half the price of a house in Woodstock.'' But
there's a reason, he added: ``Woodstock is 45 minutes closer to the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck, an art director for FAO Schwarz, and Ms. Levin, a food
stylist, advise young or impecunious house hunters to go the extra
distance. ``Look beyond the two-hour range,'' he said, referring to
the driving distance from midtown Manhattan. ``Look into the
two-and-a-half, even three-hour drive if you really want something
amazing. If you want Duchess County, you'd pay at least $225,000
for our house.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buck also warned prospective buyers not to fall into the Land
Trap. ``Everybody gets carried away with 10 or 15 of their very own
acres,'' he said. ``But you'll pay more. And you'll pay more taxes.
Do you really have to call the woods yours?'' He and Ms. Levin
found that a lot of land was on steep mountainsides where no one
could build. ``You can get less acreage and more house for the same
amount of money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends what a buyer is looking for. Buck and Ms. Levin
like a village feeling. Piyawat Pattanapuckdee, a clothing
designer, bought 18 acres and a cabin in Spring Glen for its
isolation and serenity. Bernard Figueroa, a shoe designer, lives in
the woods nearby, on 37 acres. ``An old guy had used the place to
go hunting and shoot targets with his children,'' Figueroa said.
``There were just beds.''
</P>
<P>
   He created a big square living room and a little square
bathroom. ``It's not all fixed up,'' he said in his thick French
accent. ``You know, it's not about showing off,'' he said. ``It's
not about fancy. It feels like being in the woods. Because that's
exactly where you are.''

COALITION SUES GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Earth Island Institute and nine other
environmental groups filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the U.S.
Commerce Department, alleging that commercial tuna boats in the
Pacific Ocean continue to deplete the dolphin population.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that an agency of the Commerce Department
in April wrongly weakened the protections offered by the ``Dolphin
Safe'' label on cans of tuna. Congress adopted the label in 1990 as
a way to ensure consumers that packers and processors were buying
and selling tuna from U.S. and foreign fleets that didn't net tuna
when dolphins were swimming nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Deep sea boats set nets to operate like big drawstring purses,
first encircling, then cinching up large schools of yellowfin tuna.
But the ``purse seine nets'' can also trap, crush and drown
dolphins that frequently swim above the fish, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants Commerce Secretary William Daley
and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   Because of tuna fishing, more than 7 million dolphins have died
over the past 40 years, making it ``the largest scale slaughter of
marine mammals in the world,'' the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Marine Fisheries Service concluded in April
that it couldn't determine that encircling dolphins with nets
during tuna fishing significantly harms dolphin populations.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, under the current rule, fishing fleets can use the nets
when dolphins are present, yet sell under the ``Dolphin Safe''
label unless international observers on board the boats actually
see dead or seriously injured dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco,
seeks to overturn the Marine Fisheries Service decision.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says the government's action will have ``a direct
and immediate'' impact on the northeastern offshore spotted
dolphins, eastern spinner dolphins and coastal spotted dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Research to date does not indicate that fishing with purse seine
nets poses a long-term threat to the populations, said Scott
Smullen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the branch of the Commerce Department that oversees
the fisheries service.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past years, the purse seine technique has improved
dramatically, Smullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act of
1997, the fisheries service is required to survey dolphins in the
eastern tropical Pacific to try again to determine whether purse
seine fishing is depleting the populations, particularly spinner
and spotted dolphins. Final results are due in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Earth Island Institute, said, ``We
feel that the research done so far by the National Marine Fisheries
Service staff scientists and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission already shows that populations are not rebounding and in
some cases are still declining.''
</P>
<P>
   Several processors and packers of canned tuna have pledged to
maintain the pre-April standard of not encircling dolphins. The
list includes StarKist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea, which
sell 90 percent of canned tuna in the United States.

 &HT;    The Taj travels to Africa
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taj Mahal's musical passport has been stamped so many times it
must be falling apart. The peripatetic guitarist stays in motion,
whether he's reaching back to unearth the prewar roots of country
blues or touring the Caribbean islands, the better to master
rhythms that are part of his genetic history. Mahal's latest
project is a collaboration with Toumani Diabate, the Malian master
of the kora, a stringed instrument that uses a large gourd as a
resonator. Along with a small band of musicians from Mali, the pair
creates a quietly captivating fusion of American blues and two
streams of traditional music: that of the Mande griots
(historically, praise songs for royalty) and wassoulou, or hunters'
music.
</P>
<P>
   Those distinctions begin to blur almost as soon as the album
begins. The harplike flutter of the kora's strings finds an earthy
counterpoint in Mahal's flat-picking guitar style, just as his
gruff voice is offset by vocalist Ramatou Diakite's gracefully
longing soprano. The song ``Queen Bee'' sets the stage, as the
ensemble seeks common ground. The music, recorded last April in
Athens by producer John Keane, radiates warmth and informal humor,
as when Mahal sings the glories of Toumani's wife, ``Fanta Sacko.''
The tune features Mahal's jaunty New Orleans-style piano, lyrics
sung in Cajun French and the fleet, delicate melody of the balafon,
an African xylophone.
</P>
<P>
   It's disarmingly heartfelt stuff. As with guitarist (and former
Mahal bandmate) Ry Cooder's acclaimed meetings with Mali's Ali
Farka Toure, the project offers a conveniently broad and engaging
entry point into the sounds of West Africa.

 &HT;    In the last analysis, it's funny enough
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to expressing his feelings with a bullet, gangster
Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is not a natural candidate for
psychotherapy. But in this slick farce, the shiny-suited mobster
winds up in the bland suburban office of Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal),
a nebbishy psychiatrist whose clients run toward long-marrieds
bored with their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for a meeting of New York's rival mob families, Paul
has had trouble sleeping. And breathing. He'd rather think it's
heart trouble than his doctor's diagnosis: a sissy-sounding ``panic
attack.'' That's what leads him to demand some quality shrink time
with Ben. Or else.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the good doctor has to face the moral quandary of
helping Paul become ``a happy, well-adjusted gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ramis (``Groundhog Day'') directs with a sleek
professionalism, but the movie won't surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   You get mob jokes, therapy jokes and parodies of scenes from
``The Godfather.'' It never hits the giddy heights a top farce
reaches, but the stars (plus Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make
it worthwhile.

<P>
   &QR;  ``EDtv'' (PG-13) _ Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a
24-hour-a-day documentary in Ron Howard's comedy. Yeah, it's too
much like ``The Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick
packaging and strong cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres
and Martin Landau) help it stand on its own. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Playing by Heart'' (R) _ This would-be Altmanesque tapestry
about a group of people looking for love in Los Angeles becomes a
deeply annoying exercise in overwriting. That's because
writer-director Willard Carroll is clearly in love with his own
voice, making every character speak in the same overly articulate,
precious way. The good, wasted cast includes Sean Connery, Gena
Rowlands, Gillian Anderson and Angelina Jolie, who cuts through the
twee dialogue with a vibrant, party-girl performance. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Office Space'' (R) _ An amusingly and eerily familiar comedy
for anyone who's ever struggled against the monotonous mind control
of a large corporate workplace. After wittily building audience
resentment for nearly 90 minutes, writer-director Mike Judge (TV's
``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head,'' ``King of the Hill'') seems to pull his
punches with a less-than-apocalyptic ending. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Jill Vejnoska
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``200 Cigarettes'' (R) _ Like a New Year's Eve nightmare writ
large, numerous New Yorkers struggle to hook up with someone on the
way to an end-of-1991 party. Most of the characters are obnoxious
and sex-obsessed, but a few performances, the only-in-the-'80s
outfits and, most especially, the music, shine through. Grade: C+

   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything to be ``Bitter'' about after listening to
this album, it's that this magnificent bass player isn't _
noticeably anyway _ playing. That aside, this is the third in a
series of incredible, cohesive explorations of emotion by arguably
the best thing to come out of R&AMP;B this decade, MeShell Ndegeocello.
Stripped of the dense, lush arrangements that made predecessors
``Plantation Lullabies'' and ``Peace Beyond Passion'' so engaging,
this nearly naked effort tugs at our hearts with prominent acoustic
strings, coupled with Ndegeocello's usually strong writing. With
each song she slowly fleshes out the inseparable insecurities
(``Fool of Me'') and ecstasies (``Satisfy'') that come when you let
someone in.

</P>
<P>
   Ghostly, melancholy and unexpected, Julie Miller's songs are
like fireworks stands along the great Americana highway. Her images
may be rooted in the real, but her obsessions spring from the
shadows between this world and the next. With husband Buddy Miller
on guitar and backing vocals (and able assists from Patty Griffin,
Victoria Williams and Steve Earle) she sings her well-made tales of
love and ashes with a voice that swings from kidlike highs to
reedier depths. The album's centerpiece is the title track, which
constructs a modern hymn of surrender upon the chorus ``you can
have my heart, if you don't mind broken things,'' bolstered by
cello, bass, piano and Emmylou Harris' celestial harmonies.

</P>
<P>
   Few bands make music with as much apparent joyousness as
Superchunk. The enthusiasm is so infectious that you can forgive
the looming shadow of the Pixies that hangs over every note. These
four indie rock poster children from North Carolina have cranked
out stuff like this for a decade: solid, tuneful and fun. ``Come
Pick Me Up'' makes a fine addition to the band's catalog, working
its punky magic incrementally. The first listen passes without
incident. Play it again and you're mumbling, ``Hey, that song is
kinda cool.'' Soon, you just have to shake your head to ``Hello
Hawk'' again or marvel one more time at the charmingly incongruous
strings on ``1000 Pounds.'' It may not set the world on fire, but
it's not Nirvana-lite or a funk-rap-metal hybrid, putting ``Come
Pick Me Up'' miles ahead of the music spewing from the maw of the
American corporate rock machine.

 &HT;    Kool Keith trips up on spacey fantasies
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hip-hop's answer to such extraterrestrial personages as Sun Ra,
George Clinton (in his ``Mothership Connection'' phase) and that
androgyne who fell to Earth, David Bowie, the rapper known as Kool
Keith fancies himself a starship trouper. The erstwhile founder of
Ultramagnetic MCs reinvented himself as Dr. Octagon a few years
back and became a fringe sensation. Portraying an alien sex fiend
who spewed untidy rhymes, Keith got over on sheer audacity and
comic perversity. DJ Automator (Dan Nakamura) was his secret
weapon, though, cutting up Pachelbel's Canon and '70s porn
soundtracks with heavy metal riffs and video-game bleats.
</P>
<P>
   Now calling himself Black Elvis, Keith's back with a sequel. But
what seemed fresh now looks more like a gimmick. The run-on
cadences jump with hilarity, as the opening track challenges
hip-hop posturing: ``Why are you making those mean faces in your
videos with the fish-lens effects?'' And, on such tracks as
``Supergalactic Lover'' and ``Master of the Game'' (with the late
Roger Troutman), Keith finds inspiration in old-school funk and R&AMP;B
grooves. But the sci-fi themes, like the rapper's throwaway
approach to lyrics, wear thin over 17 tracks. And without the
Automator around to scramble expectations, ``Black Elvis'' is a
persona that's all punch line and no punch.
</P>
<P>
   Take consolation in this, however: You can buy a ``Black Elvis''
wig, just like the one Kool Keith wears, for $20.

numbing language of program names and acronyms. That the council
feels the need to run such seminars says something about a
persistent difficulty facing Democrats as they head into the next
election: strategists say the public once again sees the
Republicans as the party of values. By Alison Mitchell.

   LUTHERAN-EPISCOPAL (Denver) _ Amid intense and unusual church
politics, the legislative assembly of the nation's largest Lutheran
denomination has gathered to debate one of the most important
ecumenical proposals of the last 50 years, a sweeping agreement for
close cooperation between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America and the Episcopal Church, a plan that some are likening to
a marriage. If passed, it would bind the two denominations, each
highly influential among American Protestants and with a combined
membership of nearly 8 million people, in a pact to recognize each
other's sacraments, share clergy members where needed and engage in
joint missionary and social service work. By Gustav Niebuhr.

they can shackle China's deflation, which threatens to seriously
undermine economic growth, which is faltering. By Seth Faison. &QL;

THE POOL WANTED PALMS, SO IT MOVED TO MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hold the chain saw _ I'm moving to Florida!'' Daniel R. Lewis,
an insurance heir, recalled telling his construction workers as
they were revving up to add a $1 million indoor swimming pool to
his 8,000-square-foot house in suburban Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a director of the Progressive insurance company, founded
by his father, had decided that the house was simply not
distinguished enough for the swimming pool he had in mind: part
Roman Baths of Caracalla, part Eastern European shvitz, or sweat
bath. Oh, and part art installation, too.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was a much more natural fit.
</P>
<P>
   The pool house _ a minimalist marble nirvana so sleek it looks
as if some ancient ruin had been tossed into a stone tumbler and
polished _ has now been appended to a 1920's Mediterranean-style
villa in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, surrounded by swaying
palms and an artfully dilapidated wall of coral arches.
</P>
<P>
   No one was happier about the last-minute change of venue than
Jackie Ferrara, a New York sculptor, and William Bialosky, a New
York architect, who had been hired to collaborate on Lewis' dream
design.
</P>
<P>
   Bialosky knew exactly how the pool and bathhouse had to work. As
Lewis' nephew, he had often accompanied Lewis to the old-fashioned
neighborhood bathhouses in Cleveland, with their customary hot
rooms, followed by cold dips followed by card games, pirogis and
cigars _ a routine loosely adapted from ancient bathing rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rite of passage in our family,'' Bialosky said. ``Dan
and I used to go a lot when we were growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Ms. Ferrara's miniature study models of Roman
bathhouses lined up on a shelf in her SoHo studio that had
entranced Lewis when he visited her in search of art for his
sculpture collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bathhouses are one of my favorite places,'' Lewis said. ``I
love the history of how they evolved from a community service for
people who couldn't afford plumbing into places where people
socialized. And when I walked into Jackie's studio and saw these
models, I thought, `Aha!'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferrara's fascination with baths is more geometric than
social. (``Jackie is infatuated with brick arches you can't walk
through,'' Bialosky said.) She is known for her austere geometries
in projects like the tiled-arch motif on the shuttle platform in
Grand Central Terminal and a new red granite amphitheater at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Her imagery often combines the
archaic and the futuristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm drawn to things that are not easy to put a date on,'' she
said. ``I read a lot of science fiction. `Blade Runner' is my
favorite movie.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lewis bathhouse, Ms. Ferrara and Bialosky put an
L-shaped pavilion and a lap pool at the edge of a wide green lawn.
For the pool, which is 4 feet deep, 12 feet wide and 75 feet long,
Ms. Ferrara composed an extravagantly elegant backsplash of arches
etched in beige and rose-colored marble (from Greece by way of Long
Island City).
</P>
<P>
   Bialosky noted that the earlier pool design, for the house in
Cleveland, also had arches but that they came to vivid life only
when set against the crumbling coral arches that already lined the
property.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-foot-long marble colonnade with a redwood trellis as a roof
contains the rooms for the shvitz. There's the requisite hot room,
which Lewis can turn on from his airplane. The room, a marble-clad
cell with walls that gently stack ziggurat-style up to a ceiling
made of circular glass block, heats up to 180 degrees and is
equipped with the traditional wooden buckets for pouring cold water
over the head when the heat becomes unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a shock-therapy shower running with water
refrigerated to 50 degrees. The hardy can proceed to swim laps or
collapse in what Bialosky calls ``the wet living room'' _ an
8-by-12-foot ledge at poolside where the water is six inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper floor, there's a card room with marble walls and a
mahogany card table that Ms. Ferrara fashioned in the spirit of
Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Poker is the game of choice, and Ms.
Ferrara, her client said admiringly, keeps a note pad recording
winnings that go back several years.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he and his wife usually invite seven or eight couples
at a time to enjoy the pool and bathhouse, which he described
succinctly as linear, clean and spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, masseuses and manicurists are stationed in the hot
room. The unisex changing room is stocked with bathing suits in
every size, for those who want to wear a little something. Guests
don robes for dinner, which is served on a terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying the bathhouse, Lewis said, is ``the true focal point of
the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel indulged,'' he said. ``It's obviously very
casual.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are that Miami's weather, unlike Cleveland's, is
always permitting.

NEW WAYS TO PLAY MP3 MUSIC, WITHOUT PLUGS OR SPEAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first portable MP3 player appeared on the market last
year, it looked like some shrew-size mammal living in the shadows
of the thundering dinosaurs of cassette and compact disk players:
humble enough but poised to evolve into the planet's dominant
species.
</P>
<P>
   Now other companies have joined Rioport, a new sudsidiary of
Diamond Multimedia Systems, in the market for ultraportable,
chip-based music players. They are cleverly designed, Walkman-like
devices (mini-computers, really) that are the size of pagers, each
one slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   They download music from a computer, and store it on a RAM chip,
which plays it back through headphones. This year Samsung released
a series of players in Korea called the Yepp. Major consumer
electronics companies like Casio and Thomson Multimedia are
expected to develop their own players for the North American
markets soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the hottest new thing in portable audio players,''
said Amy Hill, spokeswoman for the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association. ``Every teen-ager I know wants one of
these things, and older people do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm, projects that
sales of the players will reach about 1 million units by the end of
this year and anticipates a surge to 32 million units by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly increasing popularity of devices that can capture
and replay music found on the Internet has often been described as
nothing less than a revolution, driving a new kind of E-commerce as
well as raising fears of copyright violation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is enough music, some free and most a
credit-card transaction away, available for online downloads. More
is becoming available every day, much of it in the MP3 format.
Music CDs can also be use to create MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   But freeing listeners from the computer has long been considered
vital if downloadable music is to be embraced by mainstream
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are crucial as a way of getting the music off of
the PC,'' said Joe Butt, director of consumer technology research
at Forrester. ``Sitting at your computer and listening to
downloaded music was a big yawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief advantage of hand-held MP3 players is that they do not
depend on tape cassettes or whirling optical disks to play recorded
music. They have no moving parts, making them extremely mobile,
skip-resistant and gentle on batteries.
</P>
<P>
   And while improvements are certain to be made as these portable
players evolve, the newest offerings are worth a close look. But
they do have disadvantages. They are relatively expensive, with
list prices from $169 to $299.95. Playback time is limited, usually
no more than an hour; and the sound, while improving, still lacks
the power and richness of music heard on most CD and minidisk
players.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players have limited storage; if the memory is full,
users must erase what is stored there before they can add more
music or other audio input.
</P>
<P>
   And to use these new machines, you must be able to link them to
a computer. Computers get the music, or other recorded sounds like
the spoken word, usually by downloading it in highly compressed,
high-fidelity audio formats. Downloading music into the computer
and transferring it to the player takes far more time and effort
than popping a CD into a portable player.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, users must know enough about computers to
master software programs, usually on CD-ROMs included with the
players, that permit the players and computers to communicate. Like
the players themselves, some of the programs work better and more
easily than others. The quality of the software can be just as
important as the model of player.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio PMP 500, expected to be on store shelves late this fall,
is the only second-generation player on the market. It is a
re-engineered update of last year's Rio PMP300 (the first MP3
player on the market) and at $269 costs about $100 more than its
parent did when it went to market last November.
</P>
<P>
   The new Rio also has a 64-megabyte internal memory, twice as
much as the old Rio. With an additional removable flash memory
card, the memory can be expanded to 96 megabytes. A typical
five-minute high-quality music selection takes about five megabytes
of memory.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of design, the Rio 500's hardened plastic case appears
more durable than its predecessor. Rioport has replaced the old
Rio's confusing array of buttons, arranged in a circle, with a few
well-placed, recessed buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The new player also features a slightly larger display screen
that is backlit so that the helpful playback information, like the
lengths and names of tracks, can be read in low light.
</P>
<P>
   A key feature, found only on the new Rio, is a speedy Universal
Serial Bus line to transfer audio files from computers. The
player's software comes in Mac and PC versions. And the player
itself comes in three different finishes _ conservative silver,
translucent teal and translucent purple.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the players, the Rio 500 has a voice recorder and
is capable of playing multiple audio formats like those used for
Audible's books on tape. But while the new Rio is capable of
playing at much higher volume than the old one, its overall sound
still tends to be tinny.
</P>
<P>
   The Rave MP ($269) by Sensory Science is a distinctively
hourglass-shape MP3 player and voice recorder that has 64 megabytes
of internal memory. Like the Rio 500, it has a slot for additional
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rio 500, the Rave MP operates on a single AA battery
and has a large LCD screen. Unlike any other player on the market,
the Rave doubles as a rudimentary personal digital assistant. It
includes a clock and can store as many as 128,000 telephone numbers
or more than 13,000 pages of text.
</P>
<P>
   Like most players, the Rave connects to computers by a cable
plugged into the PC's printer port. Its software is hardly
intuitive, but once it is mastered, converting compact disk music
into MP3 files or downloading audio files from the Internet takes
only a few minutes on a Pentium class computer with at least a 56K
modem connection. Transferring the music takes about 30 to 40
seconds for a 5-minute selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Rave can be clunky to use, especially its horseshoe-shaped
array of buttons. Some of its display icons and indicators for
things like battery life and volume settings are too small to be of
much real use. The overall sound is adequate and best when heard
through Sennheiser MX4 Audiophile Earbuds that are packaged with
some of the Rave players. (All the MP3 players come with some kind
of headphones.)
</P>
<P>
   Half the size of a shirt pocket, the Nomad is Creative Labs'
long-awaited entry into the portable media player arena. The
machine has a retro-forward look, bearing a striking resemblance to
the communicator device from the original ``Star Trek'' television
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Nomad is finely engineered with a row of tiny buttons along
its smooth sides. A liquid crystal screen the size of a quarter on
the front smartly lets listeners know what tracks they are
listening to by name and performer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the sound that really sets the Nomad apart from the
competition. Music heard on the player is rich, full and detailed.
The Nomad is also distinctive in the way it links to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It uses a docking station that connects by cable to the
computer's printer port and doubles as a recharger for the two AAA
nickel-metal hydride batteries the device uses. The software is
fairly simple to use and works smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Nomad comes with only 32 megabytes of
internal memory. But it also comes with a 32-megabyte flash memory
card for a total of 64 megabytes. Like most players it can record
up to four hours of speech. Unlike most players, however, the Nomad
has an FM radio tuner.
</P>
<P>
   I-Jam by I-Jam Multimedia, released last week and sold only on
the Internet, is the newest of the MP3 players. Covered with
rubberized skin that comes in 10 colors from dark gray to plum-like
purple, it is also by far the smallest _ about three-quarters the
size of a standard computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its small size, it is capable of a big sound and has
lots of features. It includes an FM tuner and treble and bass tone
controls, and it is compatible with both PCs and Macs. It comes
with 32 megabytes of storage, on two 16-megabyte Scandisk memory
cards about the size of postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Jam can hold only one card at a time, meaning that it
gives only 16 minutes of playback of near CD-quality music. The
I-Jam comes in a range of models, priced from $199 to $299.95.
</P>
<P>
   As with all the players, industry experts say, the price is
certain to drop as more are sold and the cost of flash memory
drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of electronics are deflationary,'' said Ms. Hill
of the electronics manufacturers association. ``As time goes on the
players will offer more and better features for less money.''

   When Thomas G. Nelson was teaching English in Malaysia last
year, he was able to keep up with old friends and family in his
hometown in Kansas every week by using his computer to read The
Marion County Record, the local weekly newspaper, on line.
</P>
<P>
   He could find out about high-school friends celebrating their
anniversaries, check out the wedding announcements of people he
remembered as babies and see how the local sports teams were
faring. One week, his father was featured in an article on
refinishing furniture.
</P>
<P>
   He would joke with his family in Burdick, 20 miles northeast of
Marion, that he would get the news on line a day or two before they
would get it in their mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the computer, you felt like you weren't missing out,''
said Nelson, 46, who is now back in Burdick. ``You know everybody
in town.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line news is not the exclusive territory of major daily
newspapers anymore. In the last few years, small community daily
papers and weeklies have been setting up Web sites and getting into
the online news business.
</P>
<P>
   While many just sample the waters by putting up a simple Web
page with a few local stories, sports items, classified
advertisements and obituaries (the most popular item), others have
hired extra staff members, put display advertising on line and set
up large community news operations.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of their bigger counterparts, these smaller papers
generally are not making profits yet from their online ventures.
But many editors and publishers interviewed said they believed it
was essential that small-town America get its news and advertising
on line from them before someone else takes that market out from
under them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to stop viewing ourselves as a newspaper company and
view ourselves as an information company,'' said Mark Hamilton, who
publishes the The Iowa Falls Times-Citizen  &UR; (www.iafalls.com) &LR; , a
twice-weekly publication with a circulation of 4,000, and put the
paper on line three years ago. ``This is important for small
towns.''
</P>
<P>
   But the game can be expensive, and many small newspapers that
are already operating with tight budgets and small staffs are
choosing to go slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the large papers, small papers' online operations
run the gamut,'' said Peter M. Zollman, principal partner in the
Advanced Interactive Media Group , a Florida consulting firm.
``Some are making money, some are losing their shirts, some aren't
doing it because they are afraid they will lose their shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Going slowly and not using much staff time or financial
resources seems to be the game plan of most weeklies and dailies
with circulations under 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who has any sense is doing only that, because the
economics of publishing will not sustain a large investment,'' said
Eric Meyer, assistant professor of journalism at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and managing partner in Newslink
Associates, a research and consulting firm for online publishers.
Meyer also owns the 3,500-circulation Marion County Record
 &UR; (www.marionrecord.com) &LR; , with his father, Bill, who is the
publisher and editor.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not known exactly how many of America's 1,500 daily
papers and 7,200 weeklies are on line, Meyer estimates that the
figure includes more than half of the dailies and at least 1,000 of
the weekly papers.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that Americans still prefer delivery to their
doorstep, he said. But competition from large dailies trying to
compete for suburban and small-town circulation, and races against
other small publications, have pushed many small papers onto the
Web in the last four years, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe that they will be left behind if they don't go on
line,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Aspen, Colo., both daily papers have gone on line. The Aspen
Daily News  &UR; (www.aspendailynews.com) &LR; , a free, 12,500-circulation
daily, set up a Web site three months ago in ``an effort to
distribute our content without printing more papers,'' said Darin
Miller, general manager of the newspaper. The Aspen Times, which
has a circulation of about 15,000 and charges for only the weekend
paper, has had a weekly version on line
 &UR; (www.aspentimes.com/weekly.htm) &LR;  for about three years and a daily
one  &UR; (www.aspentimes.com) &LR;  for a year, said Andy Stone, the paper's
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers that go on line eventually decide to abandon the
effort. About 100 newspapers in each of the past three years have
made that decision, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Griffin Daily News, a 13,000-circulation daily in Georgia,
went on line in late 1995 and took the Web site down in the summer
of 1997. The paper plans to go back on line this summer with a
simpler site that will include less content, said Alan Turner, the
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Sentinel  &UR; (www.rochsent.com) &LR; , a 4,800-circulation
daily in rural Indiana, has gone the route of many small dailies,
with a less labor-intensive and expensive Web site. Each day the
site includes a new photo, the main local news story, weather,
obituaries and classified ads. The paper's publisher, Sarah
Overmyer Wilson, said it probably costs about $250 a month for
server space and to pay an employee who comes in about one hour a
day to update the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's profitable from a commitment standpoint,'' Ms. Overmyer
Wilson said. ``We've made many friends by having it, and friends
can be currency, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While many small papers look at their Web presence as a public
service, said Steve Outing, a consultant, they may be losing
advertising revenue by not taking advantage of the potential to be
a dominant information and commerce site for their area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its tough for them, because they don't have much in the way of
resources and they don't have much staff to throw at this,'' said
Outing, who runs Content Exchange, an employment service for the
online publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   The sites that are successful, he said, are often those that
have more than just the newspaper. Sites like Town Online in
Massachusetts are handbooks for small towns where users can find
the news and also learn where to go to get a dog license or find
Web pages on non-profit community groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Newspaper Company, based in Needham, Mass.,
publishes more than 100 papers, including The Metro West Daily
News, as well as weeklies and shoppers. It began its Town Online
Web site in the summer of 1996  &UR; (www.townonline.com) &LR; . The site
provides newspapers as well as guides to more than 200 towns and
communities in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   At Thomson Newspapers, executives decided to build the commerce
side of the online business before turning to news content.
Thomson, which includes about 60 daily newspapers in the United
States and Canada, started looking into Internet strategy in 1995,
said Jonathan R. Sheer, vice president of electronic products for
Thomson and chief executive officer of Thomson Interactive Media.
By June 1998, all the papers had an online presence, but only about
10 percent carry daily news content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest risk to us is advertising migration, not reader
migration,'' Sheer said. ``It's commerce, community and content, in
that order.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheer said he wanted to build an advertising base first, then
add community information, and add the news content last.
Newspapers need to ``take people from the real world and direct
them to the online world,'' he said.

COWBOY POETS AT HOME ON THE WEB

<P>
   What, you may ask, is cowboy poetry?
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy poetry is for people who define ``deconstruction'' as
what you do when you break camp, but who find meter and mood and
metaphor in the rough beauty of that camp.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy poetry is for people who think The New Yorker is someone
to feel sorry for and The Paris Review is where The New Yorkers go
to watch fancy ladies dance the cancan. It is also for people who
know better but do not care.
</P>
<P>
   It is for people who know that plain and straight does not mean
stupid, who would rather risk being trite than being untrue, and
who agree with John Ford that if the West did not really happen
that way, it should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowboy poetry is simple, it's to the point, it tells a story
and is fun, or thoughtful, or even very sad (and we hope it
rhymes),'' Michael ``Coyote'' Schroll wrote by e-mail. ``There are
a lot of cowboy poets out there, some say 100,000 of us (I wonder
about those figures, though; anyone can call themselves a poet) all
trying to tell their stories in a simple way that our friends can
understand and appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, from www.cowboypoems.com, is a tiny sample from Schroll,
who bills himself as Wyoming's resident cowboy poet: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The cowgirl looked into his eyes
</P>
<P>
   He took her breath away.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Her words he couldn't say. . . .''(end italics)

   The Cowboy Cattle-Log (cattle-log.com) is a mix of Western
music, literature, tourism and merchandise links based in Recluse,
Wyo., including Dry Crik Press and Cattle Call Magazine. Cattle
Call has a Featured Poet page (cattle-log.com/callpoet.html). This
is from ``Fallin' Asleep'' by Fred Engel:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Late in the evenin', when the
</P>
<P>
   Sun's gone down,
</P>
<P>
   And I'm in my blankets,
</P>
<P>
   I've spread on the ground,
</P>
<P>
   My mind starts driftin'
</P>
<P>
   While lookin' up at the sky,
</P>
<P>
   And thoughts cross my mind,
</P>
<P>
   That make me wonder why. ...(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've for a long time written these little stories and these
things that rhyme, and then I found out it was called cowboy
poetry,'' Engel, a cattleman, said by telephone. He says of the
poetry, ``It's a genuine attempt to keep the undisputed symbol of
the American West alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel reads a poem each week on KPIG radio (107-oink-5 FM) in
Freedom, Calif. He guesses that his poem ``Attention Vegetarians''
got the most response. ``I wrote that at the time when Oprah got in
trouble with the Texas cattle feeders.'' (The poem ends:
(italics)``Just sit down and relax, and pass the steak sauce if you
please.'')(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the first Elko, Nev., Cowboy Poetry Gathering was held
at the Western Folklife Center. Its Web site, www.westfolk.org,
highlights the 1999 gathering in January, with links, history and
stories. Users with Real Player can listen to a lot of poetry.
Similar gatherings, attracting big audiences, have spread to
Alpine, Texas, Riverton, Wyo., Medora, N.D., and many other places.
</P>
<P>
   There is poetry about the buffalo soldiers and about rural
women. (See Barney Nelson's speech at the Westfolk site on the need
for poems (italics) ``about the ten thousand antelope, wildflowers,
redtails and dawns we saw while driving the kids to school.'')(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   And there are Irish cowboy poets, like John P. Doran, ``the
Celtic cowboy.'' His Web site, www.cowboypoet.com, combines poetry
and his day job, outfitting wilderness trips in Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Doran grew up on a ranch in Twisp, Wash., and remembers asking
his father if he could learn to play the bagpipes. ``I don't see no
reason; it's in your heritage,'' his father told him. He said
cowboy poetry is ``the same old Irish tradition of telling the
story in verse.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal totem is the coyote: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)High above the valley floor,
</P>
<P>
   where the rocks are sharp and bare,
</P>
<P>
   he sits back on his haunches
</P>
<P>
   and drinks in the cool night air.
</P>
<P>
   He sings a song of freedom,
</P>
<P>
   of the wilds and of the night
</P>
<P>
   and bestows his nocturnal hymns
</P>
<P>
   to a horse-thief moon so bright.
</P>
<P>
   Then it made me think that I was him
</P>
<P>
   upon that distant hill.
</P>
<P>
   For my spirit soared and my heart found peace
</P>
<P>
   just to know he's out there still.(end italics)

TWO WORLDS (WELL, AT LEAST ONE) STILL SPIN AT SPOLETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNE MIDGETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOLETO, Italy _ At 8:30 p.m., the piazza in front of the
cathedral here is empty. Late sun strikes gold from the high bell
tower, but the square is steeped in silvery shadow, and the air is
so unseasonably cool that the musicians playing on the steps of the
Teatro Caio Melisso are comfortable, rather than sweltering, in
their formal tails.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people are sitting in the chairs in front of them.
Across the square a couple of cocktail drinkers watch from the
handful of tables huddled in front of the restaurant Tric Trac. The
musicians finish, to a scattering of applause, and the Teatro Caio
Melisso prepares for a performance of ``Les Porteurs d'Eau'' by the
Theatre Talipot from Madagascar that only a few dozen people will
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week of the festival is always slow,'' said sculptor
Robin Heidi Kennedy, a local resident, red velvet glowing from the
empty seats around her.
</P>
<P>
   In a town like Salzburg or Bayreuth, using the words ``slow''
and ``festival'' in the same sentence might imply the kiss of
death. But in Italy, one expects invited guests to come a little
late. And the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, while it has moved
far from the kind of informal happening it was when Italian
composer Giancarlo Menotti founded it in 1958, still offers
something of the casual intimacy that characterized it when Jerome
Robbins and Luchino Visconti were fixtures, and young musicians
named Yo-Yo Ma and Jacqueline Du Pre or luminaries like Sviatoslav
Richter made impromptu appearances in the noontime concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Established though it is, Spoleto, which ran this year from
mid-June to mid-July, still relies on a personal touch, announcing
noontime programs at the last minute, or loading audiences for the
series Music in Secret Umbria into buses and driving them out for a
picnic and concert in Romanesque churches nestled in the hills,
like a good host showing the area to out-of-town guests. Menotti,
creator of ``Amahl and the Night Visitors,'' holds the unofficial
title of most-performed living composer. Still, the German
newspaper Rheinischer Merkur is not alone in assessing him as
``cleverer as a festival founder than as a composer.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the mainstream classical-music world looks askance at his
operas, condemning them as popular and facile (even as American
opera companies seek out new narrative, tonal works to lure the
audiences that used to flock to Menotti's pieces). His festival, on
the other hand, is an acknowledged institution, unusual in Europe
for its equal emphasis on music and theater, film, art and dance.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 program included a new monologue by Nobel Prize winner
Dario Fo, a theater piece by French film director Eric Rohmer, a
concert by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet (who played here at earlier
stages of his career) and Menotti's staging of Prokofiev's
seldom-performed opera ``War and Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spoleto was started to prove that the arts could turn the
economy around in a small, depressed town,'' Menotti said over
lunch recently. A village that used to boast but a single hotel now
has a full complement of pensione and ristoranti for the annual
influx of guests; and more and more well-heeled foreigners are
buying and restoring houses in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Menotti has changed his economic outlook as well. Now 88, the
man who once said he wanted to live out his old age in a cottage by
the sea resides during the year in a full-blown castle in Scotland,
with his adopted son, Francis, his son's wife and their two sons,
Claudio, 12, and Cosimo, 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian press has called Menotti the Sun King of Spoleto: a
benevolent but all-powerful ruler with a whim of iron. But the
second of his ``two worlds,'' the United States, countered monarchy
with democracy in the best American tradition at Spoleto's American
colony in Charleston, S.C., founded in 1977. When Menotti tried to
designate Francis as his heir, the board of Spoleto U.S.A.
rebelled, and the elder Menotti finally cleared the field in 1993
and retreated to Umbria, severing ties with the Charleston festival
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has no problem with dynasties: Francis Menotti has served
as the festival's president since 1993, and this year he officially
took over as artistic director. Born Francis Phelan in
Pennsylvania, a former professional ice skater and actor who used
to appear in Menotti works (like the play ``The Leper,'' which was
written for him), he was adopted in 1974, at age 36. He proclaims
himself dedicated to continuing the festival in his father's spirit
while solidifying an organizational structure that has been
dependent on Giancarlo Menotti's whim.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Testimony to the weather vane changes of his decrees are the
short tenures of some of the festival's artistic and music
directors. Thomas Schippers, who served a long tenure as artistic
and then music director until 1975, was followed by a string of
short-termers: Massimo Bogianckino, Romolo Valli, Rafaello de
Banfield. ``Four or five years,'' Menotti has said, ``then I think
that we should get some new view in here.'' This year was the first
for the newest director, the British conductor Richard Hickox.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Menotti bubbled with charm and anecdote,
opinions about the evils of modern stage direction, and concern
about how to fit the huge cast and chorus of ``War and Peace'' onto
the diminutive stage of the Teatro Nuovo. Still, he would hardly
have undertaken the Herculean task of staging the work had the
scheduled director not pulled out at the last minute. In any event,
the co-director, Roman Hurko, did most of the heavy lifting, with
Menotti presiding over an occasional rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   The staging hardly won raves: reviews described it as naive,
rudimentary and even ``in an antiquated Bolshoi style.'' Yet the
ensemble was roundly praised, and Hickox, who had devoted
considerable time to auditioning the students who play in the
Spoleto Festival Orchestra, was hailed for creating ``a vibrating
cosmos of tender lyricism.'' The event made a good case for
revivals of an opera that the expert on Russian music Richard
Taruskin calls ``Prokofiev's masterpiece.'' Opening night of ``War
and Peace'' was sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Festival regulars often wax nostalgic about Spoleto's glory
days; and there is no question that the festival, like its founder,
has lost some of its energy. Yet the Festival of Two Worlds
prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the festival has hardly lost its freshness is
demonstrated by the program of this 42nd edition,'' said the German
daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ``Where else in Europe can you find
such a constellation'' of different shows and events?

 &HT;    Give a lasting memory
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a christening, friends and family often celebrate with
parents at a reception, brunch or party. Appropriate gifts should
be lasting mementos, which might be engraved with the baby's
initials or date of the christening. Silver is a typical gift and
could include a picture frame, a small comb and brush set, a mug or
cup or a fork-and-spoon set. Other silver suggestions: a baby
rattle, a Bible with a silver overlay, a keepsake box or a
christening cup that holds the water used in certain baptisms and
christening ceremonies. A bit more whimsical gift might be a small
toy, a piece of clothing such as a cotton bib or booties or a set
of children's china.

   Shopping Destination: The Mall of Georgia
</P>
<P>
   It's the mall to beat all. After two years in the making, the
mammoth Mall of Georgia _ the biggest in the state _ has opened
with much fanfare on 500 acres near Buford on Ga. 20 at I-85 (Exit
46). The mall, with its 1.7 million square feet of retail space,
aims to be a regional draw, bringing millions of shoppers and
dollars to Gwinnett County. Despite its size, developers want the
mall to have a small-town warmth, and many of its features attempt
to evoke images of bygone Main Streets. Three anchor department
stores _ Dillard's, J.C. Penney and Lord &AMP; Taylor _ are open.
Nordstrom is expected to open next spring; Rich's, next fall. About
100 of the 150 retail slots for smaller stores are filled, and the
remainder will open over the next several months. Here's a look at
the store lineup. Information: 678-482-8788.

   Q: Last year I bought a tin of fruit jellies from the food
department at Neiman Marcus in Lenox Square. I went back several
times, but they have run out. Can you find out when I can buy these
candies again?
</P>
<P>
   _Lydia S. Vicente, Lilburn
</P>
<P>
   A: Even the tin looks good enough to eat. And so do the candies
_ colorful fruit ``slices'' that have soft centers and are coated
in sugar. Churchill's Natural Luxury Fruit Jellies ($12.50 for a
9.52-ounce tin) are once again at Neiman Marcus and come in such
flavors as raspberry, apple, tangerine, peach, pineapple, plum and
blackberry. Information: 404-266-8200.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find powdered vanilla? I use it in my coffee that
I buy by the cup at Caribou, but I can't get any information on
where to find it in retail stores. This vanilla makes an excellent
topper for plain coffee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tamara Williams, McDonough
</P>
<P>
   Another vanilla question: A recent recipe in the Food section
called for Nielsen-Massey Vanilla. Can you tell me where it's
available?
</P>
<P>
   _ Joanne Schmidt, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Vanilla originated in Mexico and was brought to Europe in the
1500s. Grown mainly in Madagascar and Indonesia, the vanilla bean,
or pod, is the only edible fruit-bearing orchid. Since 1907,
Waukegan, Ill.-based Nielsen-Massey has been making a Pure Vanilla
Powder ($4.99 for a 2.5-ounce bottle) and a Pure Vanilla Extract
($4.99 for a 4-ounce bottle; $7.99 for an 8-ounce bottle). They are
available at Whole Foods Market, 2111 Briarcliff Road N.E.
(404-634-7800).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a line of hair products by the name Bumble
and bumble. I have looked everywhere, but no one seems to have
them. Thanks a bunch!
</P>
<P>
   _Leslye Vaughn, Lawrenceville
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the buzz on Bumble and bumble. It's a trendy New York
hair salon founded more than 20 years ago by Michael Gordon. Models
as well as regular folk flock there to get the newest cuts and
colors. The staff also styles hair for fashion and beauty stories
in such magazines as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Town &AMP; Country. The
salon developed its own line of shampoos, conditioners and other
styling products ($9-$20), which are available in salons across the
country. In Atlanta, look for the line at: Studio Oliver, 789
Argonne N.E. (404-607-9757); Parkside Hair Studio, 1451 Piedmont
Ave. N.E. (404-873-2546); and the Austin Avenue Barber shop, 914
Austin Ave. N.E. (404-523-2324).

<P>
   Q: I am looking for a soap called Maja. It smells like
sandalwood and has a Spanish dancer on the wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Ann Miller,
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree City
</P>
<P>
   And this Maja plea: I am looking for a soap called Maja that
used to be carried by JC Penney. Now I can only find it in a
Spanish drugstore in Miami. Is there some place locally to buy it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Carol Murphy, Woodstock
</P>
<P>
   Yet another soapy request: I am looking for Castile bar soap.
It's in a white package with red and blue lettering and has coconut
as an ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ben Thomas, Peachtree City
</P>
<P>
   A: Let us get on our soap box. First up is Maja, a
clean-smelling sandalwood soap. It's imported from Barcelona,
Spain, and comes in a dramatic black box accented with a Spanish
dancer and colorful red and orange flowers. A 5.2-ounce, round bar
is $6 at King's Drugs, 2345 Peachtree Road N.E. (404-233-2101).
</P>
<P>
   Now for Castile. Reader Thomas knows his soap. Kirk's makes the
all-natural Coco Hardwater Castile bar soap from coconut oil. It's
$2.99 for a 4-ounce bar at Miller's Rexall Drugs, 87 Broad St.
(404-523-8481). According to the manufacturer, you can also use
this soap as a shampoo, since it ``makes handfuls of creamy lather
and rinses in a flash.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for the laundry stain remover ``Easy Wash'' made
by Reckitt &AMP; Colman of Wayne, N.J. It's the best I've ever used.
For about a year, A&AMP;P carried it. But those stores are gone. And I
have only one bottle left. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Shirley Watson, Alpharetta
</P>
<P>
   A: Washing clothes will be a snap now that you can replenish
your supply of Easy Wash. According to spokeswoman Deborah
Valerian, this laundry stain remover has ``limited distribution,''
but loyal fans love it so much that the company makes it available
via mail order. Call 1-800-456-9477. A 22-ounce bottle is $1.99; a
32-ounce bottle is $2.49.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Heinz still make ketchup in a glass bottle? Everything I
find is in plastic squeeze bottles that make the most disgusting
sounds when squeezed. It's just a personal pet peeve, I know.
</P>
<P>
   _ John E. List, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurry and stock up. To help celebrate the 130th anniversary
of Heinz, the company has brought back the classic glass ketchup
bottle _ until Sept. 30 _ in a larger, 24-ounce, size. It's
available at most grocery stores, including Cub Foods at 1701
Mountain Industrial Blvd., in Stone Mountain, where we found a
bottle for 98 cents. We also spotted it at Kroger, 10779 Alpharetta
Highway, in Roswell for 99 cents and at Ingles Supermarkets, 2546
Powder Springs Road in Marietta for 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the best way to get ketchup out of the
narrow-necked glass bottle is to tap it on the neck. The perfect
spot? On the embossed ``57'' number.

 UNIVERSAL NAMES MISHER NEW HEAD OF PRODUCTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THE NEW YORK TIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In a move likely to surprise no one in the movie
business, Kevin Misher was elevated Tuesday to president of
production for Universal Pictures, making him responsible for the
studio's feature film output.
</P>
<P>
   Misher's promotion from his previous job as Universal's
co-president of production ends an executive shuffling set in
motion by the ouster of Frank Biondi Jr., the former studio
chairman, and Casey Silver, the former head of production.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Silver on Nov. 30 resulted in the departure of
the last top Universal executive; his tenure dated from before the
purchase of the company by the Seagram Co..
</P>
<P>
   The appointment Tuesday was seen by many in Hollywood as giving
Edgar Bronfman Jr., Seagram's chief executive, a handpicked team in
the feature film division.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bronfman is doing is creating a well-rounded artistic and
financial team,'' said Brian Grazer, whose Imagine Entertainment
has produced numerous films with Universal, including
``Bowfinger,'' starring Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Misher, 34, graduated from the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania in 1987, joined Tri-Star Pictures as a production
executive in 1990 and moved to Universal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At Universal, he has been associated with films like ``Patch
Adams,'' a hit that he was credited with having rescued from limbo,
repackaging it with Robin Williams as the star.

   Lethargic thunderstorms focused heavy rains near Arizona's Grand
Canyon on Wednesday, prompting the National Weather Service to
issue small stream advisories for flooding. Moisture that fueled
the thunderstorms, originating over Mexico and the Gulf of
California, was drawn northward by a high pressure system parked a
few thousand feet above Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, thunderstorms will expand westward into the deserts of
southern California as the lofty high drifts westward toward the
mountains of New Mexico. As the high shifts west, a potent jet
stream disturbance will be able to slide into the Ohio Valley from
the southern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, showers and thunderstorms will erupt as very warm
and humid air is lifted by the system. A few thunderstorms will
approach severe levels, with large hail and damaging winds posing a
threat. Downpours are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a broken line of showers and thunderstorms will again
flare in Florida along the leading edge of the sea breeze as it
forges inland from the Atlantic and lifts hot, humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the mercury soared to 100 degrees at Dallas for the
22nd consecutive day. Temperatures should reach triple-digits again
Thursday afternoon, but the string may break Friday as slightly
cooler air arriving a few thousand feet above the ground mixes down
to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning will start cool across the Northeast, with
temperatures staying below seasonal levels as a high pressure
system from Canada noses southward.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HURRICANE HUNTER
</P>
<P>
   A suspicious cluster of thunderstorms over Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula and the adjacent Bay of Campeche caught the attention of
forecasters at the National Hurricane Center the past few days. So,
Wednesday, an Air Force Reserve hurricane hunter aircraft was
dispatched to investigate the possibility that the batch of showers
could organize into a tropical storm. Because tropical systems
often form over remote areas that are bereft of weather
observations, forecasters must rely on aircraft reconnaissance to
gauge the vital signs of these potentially dangerous systems.

<P>
   In case you haven't noticed, this country's 300 or so wireless
telecommunications companies are eager for phone users to cut the
cord on their wired phones and go completely mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Leading wireless carriers like AT&AMP;T Wireless, Sprint PCS, Bell
Atlantic Mobile and BellSouth are encouraging ``bucket plans,'' in
which subscribers pay flat monthly rates for as much as 1,500
minutes of cell phone time.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, a trade group based in Washington, the pricing plans,
which in many cases are better than long distance rates for wired
phones, are working. The group estimates the number of cellular
phone users in this country to be about 77 million, with more than
37,500 people signing up for wireless phone service each day. And
these users are talking more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But for every college-bound student who has just purchased 1,000
minutes a month of talk time, there is a cell phone user out there
like Stephanie Rudolph Soderberg, a New York City resident who
signed on to AT&AMP;T's Digital One Rate plan more than a year ago.
When asked if she was satisfied with her cell phone service, she
replied: ``What service? I have no service.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rudolph Soderberg said that every time she tries to call
her husband, Bob Soderberg, an electrical engineer who works mostly
outdoors in the city, she hears a fast busy signal, indicating that
the call cannot be completed because there is too much traffic on
the phone network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it very personally,'' she said. ``I'm starting to think
it's me, maybe something about my body that obstructs calls.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows the precise number of calls that are not
completed, fade in and out or get cut off midconversation, such
incidents are increasingly common complaints among wireless users.
And they raise an important question: As successful as wireless
companies have been in attracting subscribers, what are they doing
to keep them happy?
</P>
<P>
   In cities like New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, where cell
phone use is among the highest in the country, incomplete or
disconnected calls often occur because there are too many
conversations for the limited number of channels within a wireless
carrier's network. Buildings also greatly interfere with the
transmission of cell phone signals. In less populated suburban and
rural areas, transmission failures occur because the wireless
networks have yet to be fully built, leaving holes in coverage
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The simple solution to these problems is to increase the number
of cell sites _ the antennas and base station equipment that send
and receive cellular signals.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the wireless carriers have heard the complaints of
cell phone users and escalated the construction of cell sites in
response to demand. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association estimates that as of December 1998 there were more than
65,000 cell sites in the United States, a 28 percent increase over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Jane O'Donaghue, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T, whose digital wireless
network had difficulty sustaining the initial demand brought on by
the carrier's Digital One Rate calling plan, said the company would
spend more than $2 billion on its wireless infrastructure in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At Sprint PCS, which has 11,000 sites in 280 markets, Tom
Murphy, a company spokesman, said Sprint would spend more than $1.5
billion on coverage and capacity this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fix is for the carriers to go out and spend the money
on building cell sites, but they also have to factor in how much
that will improve coverage,'' said Matt Hoffman, an analyst with
Dataquest, a research company in San Jose, Calif. ``They can try
and cover you in an elevator, but you could also wait until you get
downstairs. How much adding a cell site will increase customer
satisfaction is tough for the carriers to grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with huge expenditures on infrastructure, wireless
companies face an uphill battle to achieve better service coverage.
The low signal strengths inherent in the newer digital wireless
networks, for example, are the source of a slew of coverage
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A wireless phone works by transmitting and receiving radio
signals to and from the nearest cell site. As the user travels from
one cell to the next, the system hands off the signal so that
service is uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Every wireless carrier has a designated chunk of the radio
spectrum, which it divides into cells. A typical cell in an urban
area will handle about 100 channels, depending on the wireless
technology being used.
</P>
<P>
   Even though channels can handle more than one call
simultaneously, if there are too many subscribers in a given cell
at one time, the result can be a fast busy signal. If a subscriber
already on the phone travels into a cell that is at capacity, the
result can be a disconnected call.
</P>
<P>
   Most cell sites cover transmissions in an area from 2 to 10
miles in diameter, depending on the terrain and other factors.
Because the signals are transmitted at relatively low power (as low
as 0.6 watts in digital wireless phones), channels can be reused in
other cells without concern that there will be interference. A
carrier with a limited number of channels can theoretically take on
more subscribers by building more cells and reusing the channels.
</P>
<P>
   Because the zeros and ones of a digital signal take up less
space on a channel than do analog signals, digital wireless
represents a boon to a channel-hungry wireless carrier. A digital
cell can handle up to 10 calls per channel, several more calls per
channel than an analog cell.
</P>
<P>
   But some digital signals transmit at higher frequencies than
analog signals and are more susceptible to energy loss as they
travel between points. As a result, it takes more towers to carry
the signals. That is a likely explanation for why digital wireless
subscribers experience the most dropped calls while they're
driving. The digital signal becomes weakened as the driver moves
out of one cell, and it is not strong enough to be picked up
immediately by the neighboring cell site.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, it is not signal strength that is the
problem, but the lack of digital cell sites. Although the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association estimates that 70 percent
to 75 percent of the land area of the United States has wireless
coverage, there is greater coverage for analog systems than for
digital. Many wireless operators use the analog network as a
fallback for digital customers.
</P>
<P>
   But even when there is an analog cell in the area to default to,
it's generally easier to hand off calls between digital cells than
it is to hand off calls between digital and analog cells. A
digital-analog handoff involves moving to a separate system as the
signal is transmitted at the carrier's switching network. And if
the analog transmission fails, the signal cannot be transferred
back into digital mode.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, wireless providers use different digital
technologies that don't always hand off seamlessly between cells,
particularly when a call is being relayed out of a cell in a
subscriber's home coverage area and into the cell of another
carrier, during a process known as roaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be so much better off if we had a couple of nationwide
networks handing calls off to each other,'' said Nancy Gohring,
wireless networks editor at Telephony, an industry trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Radio frequency engineers at companies that manufacture base
station equipment, like Lucent Technologies and Motorola, are
constantly working on software upgrades to ease compatibility
issues. Industry experts say the next generation of digital
wireless will have a standard interface to better enable the
different systems to hand off calls to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Olson, an analyst at the Strategis Group, a
telecommunications information services company based in
Washington, estimates that it costs between $140,000 and $180,000
to build a single cell site. In any urban area, there is usually a
high density of sites to accommodate a large number of users.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless providers are looking for more economical ways to add
to their networks. One alternative to building a cell is to extend
the signal by stringing a series of devices known as repeaters in
areas between cells. Repeaters can amplify and extend a signal some
10 or 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, wireless carriers are also installing micro
cells, which have lower power and fewer channels, in areas that are
difficult to penetrate, like buildings and tunnels. Repeaters and
micro cells are cheaper, but they will not solve all coverage
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some structures will still be almost impossible to penetrate,
given the high frequency and low power of the digital signals,''
said Richard Wong, a network engineer for Telus Mobility, a
cellular provider in western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Another economical alternative to building more cell sites is to
lease channels on another company's existing cell site, something
that wireless carriers are becoming much more flexible about. Such
consolidation is also a response to community zoning regulations,
which often prohibit the construction of new towers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of years, many carriers have sold their
cell sites to companies including Crown Castle Corp., based in
Houston, and Pinnacle Holdings, based in Sarasota, Fla. These
companies then lease the space to the carrier that used to own it,
and to one or two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``With only two players in the market, there weren't the current
issues with real estate and zoning,'' said Olson, of Strategis.
``Now, with five or six players in each market, the carriers are
much more likely to share tower space.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new generation of digital phones allowing limited Web
access and e-mail already here and expanded wireless data services
on the horizon, mobile phone use will only increase. Will a time
come when the digital wireless network fills up entirely?
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for that exists, but it's not any kind of a
reality at this point,'' said Mark Desautels, managing director of
the Wireless Data Forum, a Washington-based trade organization. The
Federal Communications Commission, he said, ``has the ability to
shift spectrum and allot additional bandwidth should that become
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the current coverage problems, industry experts
believe that the carriers will be able to build themselves out of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that this, too, shall pass,'' said Tom
Wheeler, president and chief executive of the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association. ``It took 75 years before
wire line phone service had the same kind of coverage that the
wireless carriers have achieved in a much shorter period. It's not
where it should be, but it's moving at lightning speed and
improving every day.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Here are some steps you can take to improve your wireless
service:
</P>
<P>
   _ Study and compare various carriers' coverage areas, which are
viewable on maps in cell phone stores and on carriers' Web sites.
Or talk to wireless phone users who use the different services
available in your area.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most people, usage tends to be fairly predictable, so it's
possible to do a little research and to subscribe to a carrier with
the strongest signals in your area,'' said Sam Simon, chairman of
the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a
Washington-based consumer group. Sign up with a carrier that offers
a 30-day trial period so you can switch carriers if you have
service problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ If your phone has an extendable antenna, pull it out. Like the
antenna on a transistor radio, it will improve the reception. If
you experience coverage problems indoors, move close to a window
or, if possible, go outside to improve the signal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider buying a car antenna if you make a lot of calls while
driving. They are available for under $100 at electronics stores
and at Internet-based wireless phone dealers like those at
www.point.com and www.cellwest.com. Because they are mounted to the
exterior of your car, the antennas can prevent the signal
interference sometimes caused when making calls from inside. Most
car antennas connect to your phone by a cable, which is unplugged
when exiting the car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget the analog mode. Most digital wireless phones are
capable of being switched to analog by pressing a function key. If
you're in an area where your digital service is spotty, you can try
switching for better reception. But be aware that you run the risk
of being disconnected during the transition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Move around. When outdoors, moving just a couple of steps or
waving your phone around in the air can improve the signal. Check
the signal strength bar on the screen before dialing a phone
number. It will help you avoid having to hit the resend button.

   If an earthquake had wrecked the Los Angeles Convention Center
last week, there would be no special-effects industry. Summer
blockbusters would have to conjure interesting dialogue. Military
simulation laboratories would be tragically half-staffed, and the
spectacular evolution of video game explosions would stall for at
least 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Because under this gargantuan roof were gathered 45,000
scientists, artists, engineers and designers whose careers are
dedicated to computer graphics _ virtual reality, 3-D modeling and
computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   The Siggraph (Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics)
conference, now in its 26th year, started as a congregation of
programmers who worked for academic research laboratories or the
Defense Department (often both). Back then, the ivory tower and the
Pentagon were the only institutions that financed cutting-edge
computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The eggheads and skunk workers are still in attendance. But over
the last 15 years, their mission has been subsumed by commerce,
particularly by Hollywood, with the computer game industry nipping
at everyone's heels. For better or worse, Jar Jar Binks represents
the current state of the art in computer graphics and animation.
(Our peace dividend runneth over.)
</P>
<P>
   On the Siggraph trade floor, it is not unusual to see tenured
computer scientists ogling technical demonstrations by special
effects studios like Digital Domain, and Industrial Light and
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's a proposal for a $100 million research
effort that would make the Defense Department joint partners with
Paramount,'' said Michael Zyda, a professor at the Naval
Postgraduate College who readily incorporates Doom into his
discussion of networked military simulations.
</P>
<P>
   At a cocktail reception sponsored by Silicon Graphics, a company
that manufactures high-end workstations, you could see the
military-entertainment complex standing in line for nachos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of work for the aerospace industry,'' said Bob
Francis, who runs a 3-D modeling company called Surface
Technologies. ``We worked with the people who did the B-2 bomber.
We also did the elephant in `Tarzan.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Siggraph's emerging-technologies showcase, the Millennium
Motel, a company called Virtual Celebrity Productions brought
Marlene Dietrich back to life as a 3-D talking head, larger than
life on a giant television screen in glorious black and white.
``Want to know what really seh-pa-rates zeh men from zeh boys?''
she asked. A smile played around the corners of her virtual mouth.
``Skill. It's (italics)all(end italics) about skill.''
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, Siggraph has always been a shrine to skill. At the
Electronic Theater, Siggraph's annual film festival, one
eye-popping display featured virtual porcelain so skillfully
crafted that it shattered upon impact with the virtual floor.
</P>
<P>
   In another sequence, a computer-generated cathedral was lined
with giant stone slabs, each one polished to a high sheen that
accurately reflects the surrounding objects. As they fell like
dominoes, subject to perfectly simulated gravity, giant ball
bearings dropped from the ceiling to reflect the whole scene with
spherical distortion as they bounced down the length of the
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   It was an orgy of technical expertise. A thousand PhDs, software
engineers and punk animators burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   In this technological wonderland, one would not expect to find
people who hate computers. But there was a whiff of technophobia at
the show, particularly among the 20-somethings who haven't spent
their whole lives doing basic research.
</P>
<P>
   For this new generation of graphics whiz kids, computer science
isn't the goal. It's just a tool that allows them to get on with
their art. They take the technology for granted. If it's difficult
to use, they get mad at it. And at Siggraph, you could see this
frustration scrawled on white boards under the escalator:
</P>
<P>
   ``Down with polygons!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your supposed 3-D world is no more than shiny silicon
origami!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have something against origami?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Origami is great, but you don't see me modeling trees with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the frontier of computer graphics is not
technological. Moore's law assures us that the chips will get
faster, the resolution will increase; we'll be able to generate
realistic graphics on computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people will use fantastic digital images: academics,
industrial designers, film directors, doctors, military strategists
and game programmers with baggy shorts and blue hair. Those people
use many of the same tools. But they don't share a common culture,
and they don't necessarily speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the real challenge for Siggraph is to integrate
those cultures, so that people who speak different design languages
can learn from one another. That will require good interfaces, and
making good interfaces is harder than making fast chips.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most popular software at Siggraph was an interface
simple enough for a child to use, a 3-D modeling tool called Teddy,
programmed by Takeo Igarashi at the University of Tokyo. In front
of a dumbfounded audience, Igarashi sketched shapes that puffed
into rotund, three-dimensional forms on the screen: a teddy bear, a
fish, a bunny. On a laptop. In seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy is not a modeler for precise, careful design,'' Igarashi
noted. ``It's for creating rough models instantly. This can be used
by nonprofessionals. Or for rapid prototyping. Or as a
communications tool, for a doctor or a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Generating organically shaped 3-D models is easier than drawing
with crayons. Computer graphics has arrived.

A FAR-FLUNG CLAN GATHERS ONLINE TO PUT AUNT SHEILA TO REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHOBA NARAYAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aunt Sheila was dead. Although my family does not
hold wakes by religious tradition (we are Hindu), my grandfather
had picked up the practice from his British boss in India and
instituted it in our family.
</P>
<P>
   But, scattered across the globe, my family couldn't meet at one
place for a wake. So my eccentric cousin Vikram, known as Vicky,
suggested cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Then he chose me to deliver the eulogy, against my bitter
protests and better judgment. (My fondest memory of Aunt Sheila was
of her forcing us kids to drink spoonfuls of castor oil every
Sunday morning.)
</P>
<P>
   Why me? I demanded. ``Because nobody else will do it,'' Vikram
replied.
</P>
<P>
   My family was already online _ 36 cousins are members of the KDS
Family Newsgroup, named after the first three initials of my
grandfather's name. Byte by byte, we had reached out to each other
during the last year: an e-mail kaffeeklatsch that spanned five
continents.
</P>
<P>
   The talk had been on many subjects. A cousin from Bangalore,
India, having bought a new home, issued an electronic invitation
for his house-warming party. A cousin from Sydney said that his
daughter had been admitted to a prestigious Australian medical
school. A cousin from Portland, Ore., wrote that he was thinking of
starting a business and was looking for wealthy investors. Someone
asked for information on cheap air fares to India, while someone
else inquired about the job situation in Zambia. A 40-year-old
uncle, famous for his reticence, wrote a long travelogue about his
recent trip to the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   The family was more vocal in cyberspace than we ever had been in
person, and that proved to be a problem. My grandparents had 10
children who each had several children of their own, of disparate
ages and personalities. My uncles and aunts were spread all over
India _ brash New Delhi, intellectual Calcutta, mercantile Bombay
and traditional Madras. My cousins from Bombay with their
mini-skirts and penchant for rock 'n' roll disdained those of us
from southern India, with our traditional Indian clothes, oiled
hair and lack of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   As the members of my generation grew up to be engineers,
doctors, advertising copy writers, chefs, lawyers, and
entrepreneurs in esoteric ventures ranging from sheep-farming to
tea plantations, we put as much distance between us as
geographically possible. It wasn't that we hated each other. It was
that we had little in common besides our ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet intervened. One day, I received a message
inviting me to join the KDS Family Newsgroup. The moderator was my
brother from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are actually seeking their company?'' I asked. ``Why?'' He
replied, ``I am a father. Our children need to know their family,
their roots.''
</P>
<P>
   So it began, a trickle of e-mail that soon became a monsoon as
more relatives signed on. I renewed relationships with the cousins
I liked and compared careers with the ones I didn't. Problems
became apparent almost immediately. The trouble with cyberspace is
that everything is a shout: the Internet didn't allow the luxury of
snide asides or giggled whispers. When my oldest cousin Dino wrote
from Lyon, France, about how he had accomplished so much in his
life despite the fact that nobody in the family had supported him,
I couldn't turn around to my favorite cousin, Gita, and whisper,
``pompous ass'' like I usually did. Nor could I choose my
conversational partners. Unless I took the trouble to find out
individual e-mail addresses, I had to speak to the whole clan or
not at all. That included my cousin who once (wrongly) accused me
of cheating her out of her inheritance. But the real difference to
meeting online was the lack of gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace removed the context of conversation and made the most
innocuous questions sound portentous. It enforced restraint in a
congenitally garrulous, volatile family.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, for instance, knew what Vikram did for a living. The
family hadn't forgiven him for eloping with his high-school
sweetheart and he hadn't forgiven the family for not forgiving him.
So he exiled himself in Auckland, New Zealand, and continued his
rabble-rousing over the Internet. There were rumors that he ran a
sheep farm for a rich heiress, that he was a kept man. Had we met
at a family reunion, it would have been ridiculously easy to chat
Vikram up and casually pop the question. ``Oh, Vicky. So what are
you doing in Auckland?'' Somehow the very same question when
written in e-mail took on a confrontational tone.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   We decided to put aside all old enmities for Aunt Sheila's wake.
By then, we were all using real-time chat software, so we could
carry on an electronic conversation. Vikram picked 7 p.m. on a
Sunday in Auckland as the time for the wake, about 3 a.m. in New
York. After logging in and identifying myself, I found that
everyone was present except my notoriously late cousin Dino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because he is getting a doctorate in molecular biology,
he thinks he has to play the part of the always-late, absent-minded
professor,'' I typed in. I was groggy and grumpy and I rued the day
I joined the family newsgroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I remind everyone that we are here for a sacred event?''
Vikram replied pompously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry for being late, folks. Couldn't get out of the lab. Here
I am,'' Dino typed, entering the fray. ``Dearly Beloved,'' began
Vikram.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a wedding. This is a wake,'' my brother reminded
him. ``I know,'' Vikram typed. ``I've never conducted a wake
before. Have some patience, would you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindus don't hold wakes,'' said Dino, the doctoral student.
``Besides, Aunt Sheila was cremated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't I know it?'' Vikram was getting testy. ``All I wanted
was to hold something in the spirit of a wake. You know. A moment
of silence. That sort of thing. After all, she is our beloved
aunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you say beloved?'' our cousin in Bangalore asked, dripping
sarcasm. ``Are we speaking of the same lady?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak no ill of the dead,''replied Dino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, ladies, Please. Couldn't we all just try to act our
age for a change?'' Vikram asked. ``Now, Shoba will deliver the
eulogy.''
</P>
<P>
   I cleared my throat. ``Cousins, Friends, Ancestors,'' I typed.
``We are gathered here to celebrate and mourn the life of our
beloved Aunt Sheila who has passed into the hereafter.'' The
rhythmic snores of my husband and child interrupted my narrative.
The computer glowed like a beacon in my dark room. The slate-black
New York sky was inching toward dawn. I felt utterly ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be that as it may, that she poisoned us with castor oil,
making us retch, puke and in some cases, spend the day in the
bathroom,'' I typed. ``Be that as it may that the kindest thing
that she has ever told any of us is, `Hey, child, get out of my
way.' Be that as it may that she never remembered any of our names,
right until the very end when she became senile. The point is that
dear spinsterish Aunt Sheila meant well. That is the thought that
we have to hold for support as we convene to celebrate Aunt
Sheila's life.''
</P>
<P>
   That was about as far as I could go. I took a deep breath, and
decided I would not hang around after the eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``May her ashes rest in peace,'' I finished abruptly. ``Amen,''
came the heartfelt replies. I signed off.

CROWDING TRANSISTORS ONTO A CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Integrated circuits 40 years ago had a handful of transistors
wired together on a piece of silicon. Integrated circuits of 2005
will very likely have about 200 million transistors packed into
each minuscule microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep up this marvelous shrinking act (and shrink they
must to get ever faster), the camera systems that help pattern the
extremely miniature circuitry onto silicon wafers have to change,
because even the small wavelengths of light used are becoming too
crude a tool.
</P>
<P>
   The existing method of chip manufacturing, called photo or
optical lith-ography, uses ultraviolet light to record an image of
the circuit on a slice of silicon, much as a photographer records
an image on a piece of film.
</P>
<P>
   Now two competing technologies have emerged that use sources
with far shorter wavelengths. One is called electron-beam
projection, the other extreme ultraviolet: both offer the
possibility of greatly shrinking the geometries of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the mid-'90s, the industry realized that we would
eventually hit the wall with conventional light,'' said Jess
Blackburn, a spokesman for Sematech, a consortium in Austin, Texas,
of semiconductor manufacturers. ``We knew the next generation of
chips would require a different wavelength.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1997, Sematech sponsored an industrywide evaluation
of new lithographic systems. The semiconductor industry, through
Sematech and other groups, has issued several roadmaps for
manufacturing development as it heads toward the
200-million-transistor integrated circuits it hopes to build by
2005. Such circuits are currently in the 5- to 10-million range.
</P>
<P>
   Because the development of new chip manufacturing processes is
so enormously expensive _ some predictions put the cost between
$300 million and $500 million for the semiconductor industry as a
whole _ only one technology is expected to predominate on the
production lines of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   One of the contenders for next-generation lithography, being
developed at Bell Laboratories, replaces light with electrons.
``We've switched from printing with light to printing with
electrons,'' said Dr. Lloyd R. Harriott, a physicist at Lucent
Technology's Bell Laboratories who is program manager for the
project. ``This technique allows you to get around the difficulties
of printing with light like diffraction and interference, which
limit you today to feature sizes about equal to the wavelength of
light.''
</P>
<P>
   The electron beams project an image onto the wafer. ``You can
print much smaller features when you switch to electrons, which
have an effective wavelength of 3.7 picometers, about a million
times smaller than the wavelength of light,'' Harriott said. A
picometer is one-trillionth of a meter.
</P>
<P>
   Precise beams of electrons, similar to those in scanning
electron microscopes, have long been used in laboratories to
inscribe shapes directly, but the process was thought to be too
slow for the manufacturing of semiconductors. But the tool, which
uses a beam far larger than earlier technologies to project a
high-contrast image onto the wafer, has a number of optical and
production refinements that lend it the potential for high-speed
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Harriott and his group have worked on the tool for more than a
decade. The prototype of their electron-beam projection system is
built; they are working with several semiconductor equipment
manufacturers to produce a more advanced model commercially. They
hope to have a beta version developed by 2002 or 2003, Harriott
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other contender for next-generation high-resolution
lithography uses ultraviolet light _ but unlike current systems it
uses the far or extreme end of the spectrum, where wavelengths are
very short.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles W. Gwyn of the Intel Corp. directs the program for
extreme ultraviolet development, a consortium effort that includes
a number of research laboratories and manufacturers. ``Extreme
ultraviolet lithography is an extension of conventional optical
wavelength technology, using very, very short wavelengths of 13.4
nanometers to expose critical circuit dimensions,'' he said. ``The
technology builds on present industrial optical experience _
integrated circuit manufacturers are used to working with optical
lithography.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme ultraviolet light is absorbed by all materials, so the
process uses reflective rather than transmissive materials, which
are used in the current technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies contracted to build prototypes of the
extreme ultraviolet tool is Silicon Valley Group, a manufacturer of
equipment for the semiconductor industry. A first-generation
version of the tool is scheduled for completion in 2003, said
Noreen Harned, who directs the program at Silicon Valley Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harned said she thought there would be only one victor in
the battle to control next-generation lithography. ``The whole
lithography field is so expensive that no circuit manufacturer will
want to buy more than one next-generation tool,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers are trying to find ways to extend the
boundaries of present optical technology. ``The industry has years
and years of comfort using optical lithography equipment,'' Ms.
Harned said. ``They are experts at squeezing as much as possible
out of the present generation of light.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the lifetime of a particular generation of
lithography technology is extended until a total switchover to the
next generation can be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea which technology will predominate or when,''
said Blackburn of Sematech. ``Next-generation lithography is a
moving target based on demands of the industry.''

 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first portable MP3 player appeared on the market last
year, it looked like some shrew-size mammal living in the shadows
of the thundering dinosaurs of cassette and compact disk players:
humble enough but poised to evolve into the planet's dominant
species.
</P>
<P>
   Now other companies have joined Rioport, a new sudsidiary of
Diamond Multimedia Systems, in the market for ultraportable,
chip-based music players. They are cleverly designed, Walkman-like
devices (mini-computers, really) that are the size of pagers, each
one slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   They download music from a computer, and store it on a RAM chip,
which plays it back through headphones. This year Samsung released
a series of players in Korea called the Yepp. Major consumer
electronics companies like Casio and Thomson Multimedia are
expected to develop their own players for the North American
markets soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the hottest new thing in portable audio players,''
said Amy Hill, spokeswoman for the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association. ``Every teen-ager I know wants one of
these things, and older people do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm, projects that
sales of the players will reach about 1 million units by the end of
this year and anticipates a surge to 32 million units by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly increasing popularity of devices that can capture
and replay music found on the Internet has often been described as
nothing less than a revolution, driving a new kind of E-commerce as
well as raising fears of copyright violation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is enough music, some free and most a
credit-card transaction away, available for online downloads. More
is becoming available every day, much of it in the MP3 format.
Music CDs can also be use to create MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   But freeing listeners from the computer has long been considered
vital if downloadable music is to be embraced by mainstream
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are crucial as a way of getting the music off of
the PC,'' said Joe Butt, director of consumer technology research
at Forrester. ``Sitting at your computer and listening to
downloaded music was a big yawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief advantage of hand-held MP3 players is that they do not
depend on tape cassettes or whirling optical disks to play recorded
music. They have no moving parts, making them extremely mobile,
skip-resistant and gentle on batteries.
</P>
<P>
   And while improvements are certain to be made as these portable
players evolve, the newest offerings are worth a close look. But
they do have disadvantages. They are relatively expensive, with
list prices from $169 to $299.95. Playback time is limited, usually
no more than an hour; and the sound, while improving, still lacks
the power and richness of music heard on most CD and minidisk
players.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players have limited storage; if the memory is full,
users must erase what is stored there before they can add more
music or other audio input.
</P>
<P>
   And to use these new machines, you must be able to link them to
a computer. Computers get the music, or other recorded sounds like
the spoken word, usually by downloading it in highly compressed,
high-fidelity audio formats. Downloading music into the computer
and transferring it to the player takes far more time and effort
than popping a CD into a portable player.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, users must know enough about computers to
master software programs, usually on CD-ROMs included with the
players, that permit the players and computers to communicate. Like
the players themselves, some of the programs work better and more
easily than others. The quality of the software can be just as
important as the model of player.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio PMP 500, expected to be on store shelves late this fall,
is the only second-generation player on the market. It is a
re-engineered update of last year's Rio PMP300 (the first MP3
player on the market) and at $269 costs about $100 more than its
parent did when it went to market last November.
</P>
<P>
   The new Rio also has a 64-megabyte internal memory, twice as
much as the old Rio. With an additional removable flash memory
card, the memory can be expanded to 96 megabytes. A typical
five-minute high-quality music selection takes about five megabytes
of memory.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of design, the Rio 500's hardened plastic case appears
more durable than its predecessor. Rioport has replaced the old
Rio's confusing array of buttons, arranged in a circle, with a few
well-placed, recessed buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The new player also features a slightly larger display screen
that is backlit so that the helpful playback information, like the
lengths and names of tracks, can be read in low light.
</P>
<P>
   A key feature, found only on the new Rio, is a speedy Universal
Serial Bus line to transfer audio files from computers. The
player's software comes in Mac and PC versions. And the player
itself comes in three different finishes _ conservative silver,
translucent teal and translucent purple.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the players, the Rio 500 has a voice recorder and
is capable of playing multiple audio formats like those used for
Audible's books on tape. But while the new Rio is capable of
playing at much higher volume than the old one, its overall sound
still tends to be tinny.
</P>
<P>
   The Rave MP ($269) by Sensory Science is a distinctively
hourglass-shape MP3 player and voice recorder that has 64 megabytes
of internal memory. Like the Rio 500, it has a slot for additional
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rio 500, the Rave MP operates on a single AA battery
and has a large LCD screen. Unlike any other player on the market,
the Rave doubles as a rudimentary personal digital assistant. It
includes a clock and can store as many as 128,000 telephone numbers
or more than 13,000 pages of text.
</P>
<P>
   Like most players, the Rave connects to computers by a cable
plugged into the PC's printer port. Its software is hardly
intuitive, but once it is mastered, converting compact disk music
into MP3 files or downloading audio files from the Internet takes
only a few minutes on a Pentium class computer with at least a 56K
modem connection. Transferring the music takes about 30 to 40
seconds for a 5-minute selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Rave can be clunky to use, especially its horseshoe-shaped
array of buttons. Some of its display icons and indicators for
things like battery life and volume settings are too small to be of
much real use. The overall sound is adequate and best when heard
through Sennheiser MX4 Audiophile Earbuds that are packaged with
some of the Rave players. (All the MP3 players come with some kind
of headphones.)
</P>
<P>
   Half the size of a shirt pocket, the Nomad is Creative Labs'
long-awaited entry into the portable media player arena. The
machine has a retro-forward look, bearing a striking resemblance to
the communicator device from the original ``Star Trek'' television
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Nomad is finely engineered with a row of tiny buttons along
its smooth sides. A liquid crystal screen the size of a quarter on
the front smartly lets listeners know what tracks they are
listening to by name and performer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the sound that really sets the Nomad apart from the
competition. Music heard on the player is rich, full and detailed.
The Nomad is also distinctive in the way it links to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It uses a docking station that connects by cable to the
computer's printer port and doubles as a recharger for the two AAA
nickel-metal hydride batteries the device uses. The software is
fairly simple to use and works smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Nomad comes with only 32 megabytes of
internal memory. But it also comes with a 32-megabyte flash memory
card for a total of 64 megabytes. Like most players it can record
up to four hours of speech. Unlike most players, however, the Nomad
has an FM radio tuner.
</P>
<P>
   I-Jam by I-Jam Multimedia, released last week and sold only on
the Internet, is the newest of the MP3 players. Covered with
rubberized skin that comes in 10 colors from dark gray to plum-like
purple, it is also by far the smallest _ about three-quarters the
size of a standard computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its small size, it is capable of a big sound and has
lots of features. It includes an FM tuner and treble and bass tone
controls, and it is compatible with both PCs and Macs. It comes
with 32 megabytes of storage, on two 16-megabyte Scandisk memory
cards about the size of postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Jam can hold only one card at a time, meaning that it
gives only 16 minutes of playback of near CD-quality music. The
I-Jam comes in a range of models, priced from $199 to $299.95.
</P>
<P>
   As with all the players, industry experts say, the price is
certain to drop as more are sold and the cost of flash memory
drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of electronics are deflationary,'' said Ms. Hill
of the electronics manufacturers association. ``As time goes on the
players will offer more and better features for less money.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology and industrial companies dominate the
latest Fortune (Sept. 13) list of America's fastest growing
companies, two of which are based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Profit Recovery Group International, which uses special audits
to help clients find lost profits, ranks 40th overall based on a
formula that includes three-year revenue and per share earnings
growth. Premiere Bancshares ranks 75th.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's list of fastest-growing companies is notable not
only for the staggering profit and revenue gains posted by these
100 businesses, but for the impressive returns they produced for
investors,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the list is Siebel Systems, a San Mateo, Calif., software
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Four reasons for bullishness
</P>
<P>
   Esquire (September) came out with a stock market ``crash''
edition last year just as the market tanked in the worst correction
in eight years. As a result, contributing editor Ken Kurson claims
that this lends credibility to his latest forecast that the Dow
Jones industrial average will hit 15,000 by August 2001.
</P>
<P>
   He gives four reasons for the forecast: pent-up demand for
stocks by aging baby boomers; recovering corporate earnings;
continued consumer spending in a minimal-inflation economy; and the
recovery of depressed foreign markets, which will promote
profitable foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   Too cool for school
</P>
<P>
   Maybe mutual funds should be managed by youngsters, Bloomberg
Personal Finance (September) suggests. Take the case of Alec
Hufnagel, a Scarsdale, N.Y., high school junior who turned $500,000
into $1.7 million in eight weeks trading stocks and options in
companies such as eBay and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Hufnagel, age 15, the money was hypothetical.
It was traded as part of Investment Challenge, one of a growing
number of stock market games designed to acquaint students with the
basics of investing.
</P>
<P>
   Among other such games are the CNBC Student Stock Tournament,
Salomon Smith Barney Young Investors Network and The Stock Market
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Money (September) says the extended bull market has instilled
a level of confidence in investors unmatched in recent history. The
problem is that many overconfident individuals taking command of
their own portfolios are making costly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The founders of Home Depot _ Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank _
are on the cover of one more magazine: Atlanta-based Business to
Business (August).
</P>
<P>
   _ In a special two-week ``bonus'' edition, Business Week (Aug.
30) offers 21 ideas for the 21st century. Separate articles look at
trends and possible scenarios on topics such as technology, energy,
the environment, religion and management.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Death can leave symphonies unfinished and paintings
incomplete, but it usually speeds the creation of a memorial
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   When the Victorian architect Charles Barry unveiled plans for
Trafalgar Square in 1841, he intended to erect equestrian statues
to the country's most recently departed kings, George IV and
William IV, on two mammoth plinths at the north end of the huge
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   A bronze cast of George on his steed went up as planned, but
William and his mount never made it. It turned out that at his
death in 1836 he had left no money to build his memorial, so the
plinth ended up vacant.
</P>
<P>
   It has remained that way until now, a precious piece of
architectural real estate facing avenues lined with Britain's
sovereigns, war heroes and parliamentary leaders. It stands in
starkly empty contrast to the three matching granite bases
elsewhere in the square bearing the triumphalist likenesses of King
George and two military commanders from the days of empire Sir
Henry Havelock and Gen. Charles James Napier.
</P>
<P>
   After 158 years, a figure has appeared atop the plinth this
summer, the first in a series of six-month occupants, all produced
by British sculptors. They will take their place there as part of
an effort by the Royal Society of Arts to spur a public debate on
what permanent use to make of the choice spot.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions have ranged from the Queen to the Spice Girls to a
giant pigeon, in honor of the square's most numerous inhabitants.
But the first arrival, appropriately for the eve of the Third
Millennium, is Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Standing modestly in the shadow of the 172-foot tower with
Nelson on top and four lions at its base and the dark military
statuary on the three other corners of the square, it is a
human-scale Jesus in white marble resin. He is bare-chested,
without the customary long hair and beard, his eyes are downcast
and his hands bound behind him. A twist of gold-plated barbed wire
encircles his head.
</P>
<P>
   The work, called ``Ecce Homo _ Behold the Man'' is by Mark
Wallinger, 40, a London sculptor who said he was trying to portray
a vulnerable Christ at the moment of His presentation to the crowds
by a mocking Pontius Pilate. Though the sculpture has struck some
observers as too diminutive and retiring to represent the son of
God, Wallinger said in a written explanation accompanying its
installation last month that that was his intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purity of a white statue and the humility of its life-size
would contrast with the outsized black bronze relics of Empire,''
the artist said.
</P>
<P>
   In January it will be replaced by a work of Rachel Whiteread,
36, who has built an exact replica of the 24-foot-tall,
15-foot-long and 6-foot-wide plinth to be placed upside down on top
of the real one.
</P>
<P>
   ``After spending time in Trafalgar Square observing the people,
traffic, pigeons, architecture, sky and fountains, I became acutely
aware of the general chaos of central London life,'' she said in a
statement about her entry. ``I decided that the most appropriate
sculpture for the plinth would be to make a `pause,' a quiet moment
for the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Next summer will see ``Listening to History,'' described by its
sculptor, Bill Woodrow, 51, as ``a large statue head with a book
covering the uppermost ear, the two held together on the plinth by
the root mass of a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   The three sculptors were the finalists from a group of 19 who
submitted ideas to a panel of artists and curators set up by Prue
Leith, a deputy chairman of the Royal Society of Arts who has
campaigned for five years to draw attention to the neglect of the
plinth. A Web site (www.fourthplinth.com) has been created to
elicit suggestions, and a final decision will be made by a
committee headed by the writer Sir John Mortimer.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher J. Thorpe, the project's design director, said that
of the estimated 5,000 people who had visited the web site, 40
percent liked the Wallinger, 20 percent disliked it and the
remaining 40 percent favored using the plinth for a rotating
exhibition of British contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The juxtaposition of the Christ figure with the other figures
in the square fosters levels of reflection of a profound nature,''
one wrote. Another asked, ``How often do we actually bother to look
at official public sculpture? I know that I have never spent time
looking at the sculptures on the other three plinths, they are just
part of the urban wallpaper. By having an ever-changing site, one
will be keen to see what's being shown currently and how is it
different from what's gone before.''
</P>
<P>
   One respondent saw an opportunity for another equestrian statue
``either St. George killing a Welsh dragon or Henry V killing lots
of Frenchmen.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The Evening Standard threw the contest open to its
readers and published two pages of responses. The Queen and Queen
Mother figured in many answers, though traditionally statues are
not built of royals during their lifetime. Betty Boothroyd, the
Speaker of the House of Commons, suggested a representation of the
women of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other names that emerged were Shakespeare, Thomas
Paine, Gandhi, Nehru, Nelson Mandela, Diana, George Orwell,
Dickens, Churchill, Florence Nightingale, Margaret Thatcher and
Alan Turing, the British mathematician who cracked the German naval
Enigma code during World War II and developed early computing
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The last word may go to a letter writer named Jane Birch who
said that the plinth was ``wonderful: a great, tomb-like slab in
Trafalgar Square's northwest corner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it be,'' she said. ``Our descendants will thank us for
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)

<P>
   Or then again it might go to Larry Adler, the 84-year-old
American harmonica player who has lived in England since being
blacklisted in the United States in 1949 for his political views.
In a telephone interview, he shamelessly confirmed that he was
indeed the Larry Adler listed as the author of the final suggestion
in The Evening Standard's list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I propose a statue to Moby-Dick,'' it read, ``the display to
be called _ what else? _ The Plinth of Whales.''

TAKING INTERNET MUSIC TO THE LIVING ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those tired of listening to their MP3 collections through
computer speakers or the headphones of a portable player, there is
now a way to transport the Internet music experience to the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   Netdrives in Ithaca, N.Y., has developed a compact disk player
for home stereo systems that can play traditional CDs and disks
recorded in the MP3 file compression format that is popular among
Internet music aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the component, called the Brujo (pronounced
BREW-hoe), is the first consumer MP3 player that is PC free,
meaning that it never needs to be connected to a personal computer.
Instead, song files are downloaded from the Internet, then
transferred, or ``burned,'' onto a standard recordable CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the Brujo, MP3s are no longer limited to computer
speakers,'' said Jennifer Wolfe, the president of Netdrives. The
Brujo comes with a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many commercial CD players, which can hold five or more
CDs at once, the Brujo has only one disk tray. But because a
standard CD can hold more than 11 hours of MP3 music files there
should be no concern about disk swapping unless you are playing a
regular CD.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you intend to make MP3 CDs, you will need a CD
recording drive for your computer. So Netdrives sells a companion
product called the Burner, a rewritable CD recorder that works with
Macintosh and Wintel computers.
</P>
<P>
   The devices cost $300 each or $550 when bought together. They
are available on the company's Web site at www.netdrives.com.

   EBAY ADDICTS COME UP FOR AIR
</P>
<P>
   Now eBay users can bid and run. In an effort to differentiate
itself from competitors, the auction giant has started a paging
service that will update users on the progress of their auctions
when they are away from their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of eBay users were telling us they go out and get
busy,'' said Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for the company,
countering the popular image of his customers. ``They've lost track
of time. When they get home, the auction has ended and they've been
outbid. If there is some way that we could have notified them, they
would have skipped the second course or cut their cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   The service, playfully titled ``eBay-a-go-go,'' costs $55 for
about 500 messages and uses any wireless device that offers text
messaging. Individuals can use their own devices or buy one from
eBay. The service notifies users when they have won an item, been
outbid or sold an item. Users can sign up through
www.skytel.com/ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Users are apparently clamoring for still more. They want the
ability to bid on the run. ``Eventually, the idea is to make it a
two-way service,'' said Pursglove.

   REAL FEEL SIMULATIONS TRY TO BRING GAMES TO LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Imagine taking a Nantucket fishing expedition without leaving
home? Or how about hustling colleagues in a game of snooker between
meetings? Starting this winter, armchair athletes will be able to
ditch their traditional joysticks and keyboards for a new line of
inexpensive sports simulation accessories called Real Feel from
Miacomet.
</P>
<P>
   The first accessory, due in October, lets players slide a pool
stick across a small sensor that translates motion into an
on-screen image. Real Feel's second release, scheduled for January,
is a 30-inch replica of a fishing pole that simulates the tugs and
pulls of fishing. A minnow may pose little challenge, but a
50-pound bass will have anglers wrestling in their chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Founded on the belief that the space bar and enter key do not
provide a realistic enough game experience, Miacomet of
Springfield, Mass., hopes to attract a wide range of consumers,
from arcade-goers to weekend anglers. Though Real Feel products,
expected to cost $50 to $100, will come with software, they also
will work with other brands and will be compatible with PCs and
video game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who could not catch a fish in a bathtub, Miacomet
is developing baseball, snow boarding, golf, football and soccer
simulators.

   CELL PHONES ARE NO. 1 WITH BUSINESS TRAVELERS
</P>
<P>
   Modern travelers will use cell phones in the car, on the street
and even while standing beside another telephone. That is one of
the conclusions of a new survey of the technological habits of
1,000 business travelers conducted by the research firm Greenfield
Online.
</P>
<P>
   A cellular telephone is the No. 1 piece of electronic gear
carried by travelers, with seven out of 10 travelers surveyed
toting one.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority, 94 percent, of those who carry cell phones
use them in cars. Nearly two-thirds, however, said they make calls
while walking.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those surveyed make calls on their cell phones from
offices, hotels and airports while traveling, although wired phones
are plentiful. Margot Turk, Greenfield's director of NetReach
Services, said respondents were not asked why they make cell phone
calls from places where other phones are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it's convenience. If you use your cellular
phone, you don't need to worry about the 15-digit calling card
number. You don't need to wait in line for a pay phone,'' Ms. Turk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about half of the business travelers surveyed carry laptop
computers on business trips, a figure that surprised Rudy Nadilo,
Greenfield's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, e-mail still has a ways to go in being the
mainstream business communications tool,'' Nadilo said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 36 percent of the respondents own pagers. Hand held
PC/personal digital assistants have not reached high levels of
usage among business travelers. One in 10 surveyed take such a
device on trips. However, among those who own such devices, 92
percent take them on trips. And the survey found that the most
popular device was the Palm Connected Organizer, owned by 77
percent of those surveyed who owned a hand held PC.

   FOR HANDS-OFF USERS A FOOT-GUIDED MOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Thompson, an entrepreneur in Pacific, Mo., has come up
with an alternative for people who, because of a disability or
simple wrist pain, cannot use a mouse. He calls it the FootRat.
</P>
<P>
   The FootRat, as you might suspect, is a cursor-control device
that can be manipulated with your feet. It does not look like much
_ just a black plastic shell that fits over a regular mouse. It
comes with an elastic strap to fit over shoes and an anti-static
pad called a RatMat.
</P>
<P>
   Other accessories include footpedals, to be used by the other
foot, that substitute for a mouse's click buttons. The product also
comes with free software that can enable FootRat users to use
keystrokes for mouse clicks instead. All are for sale on
www.touchtime.com; the FootRat sells for $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Senders, a University of Toronto professor who
specializes in ergonomics, has not yet used the FootRat but says
that Thompson has hit on a ``very good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of footpedals in general is always overlooked by
people who design things,'' Senders said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, adapting to foot controls is not easy. ``But easy is
a relative term,'' Thompson said. ``The first time using a mouse,
it was unlike anything I had ever done before.''

THE BABY AMERIKAN STORY

   Who is Baby Amerikan and why was he in the news?
</P>
<P>
   He is the first baby born in America to parents who escaped the
war in Kosovo. His father, Naim Karaliju, and his mother, Lebibe
Karaliju, were among 453 refugees brought in an airlift to Fort
Dix, N.J., on May 5, and Amerikan was born less than 24 hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   The child's birth drew national attention, and President Clinton
wished the infant well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We named him Amerikan as a sign of our appreciation to this
country,'' Naim Karaliju told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Dix, an Army base, refugees got ID cards and medical
exams before being resettled in places such as Detroit, Fort
Worth-Dallas and New York. Amerikan _ who is a U.S. citizen because
he was born in this country _ and his family moved to Dallas on
June 4 to be with relatives. There are 33 family members living in
Dallas in all.
</P>
<P>
   The Karalijus had fled their farm in a Kosovo village of about
300 after Serbian soldiers burned their home to the ground and
killed an aunt and uncle, according to news reports. Kosovo is a
region within Serbia, one of two provinces in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Baby Amerikan back in the news?
</P>
<P>
   Just two months after the Karaliju family moved to North Texas,
they were in the news again. This time an article in the Aug. 2
edition of the New York Post said that Amerikan's father had
complained that the agency that was helping the family resettle did
not fulfill promises to provide cash, rent money and help finding
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a hard time. There is not enough money to buy
milk for the baby,'' Naim Karaliju was quoted as saying through a
translator.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the end of the story, however.
</P>
<P>
   National media reported the family's statements the next day.
But the Philadelphia Daily News published a piece that said that,
despite what Karaliju had said, his family was not suffering. The
reporter said the Karalijus had a furnished apartment. Chip
Corcoran, executive director of Refugee Services of North Texas,
was quoted as saying that the family had access to cash, food
stamps, medical care, English classes and job training. Deborah
DeWinter, associate director of Church World Service, which
oversees Refugee Services of North Texas, said that Amerikan's
father had turned down several job offers.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Aug. 3, the New York Post ran another article
that said that United Parcel Service had offered Karaliju a job
after executives from the shipping company in New York read about
the family in that newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But again, the story was not over.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 6 article in The Dallas Morning News, Karaliju
acknowledged that his family's needs had been met by the
resettlement agency, which had provided more aid than was required
by the government. Records showed that three months' rent on the
family's $750-a-month north Dallas apartment was provided, as well
as furniture, dishes and hundreds of dollars in food and cash. The
Karalijus, the story said, also receive more than $550 a month in
food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Karaliju acknowledged he had worked a construction
job for about six weeks. He told the newspaper that what worried
him were his family's long-term needs: ``We have a lot of food _ no
problem. The problem is, I don't know if I'm going to have enough
money later.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the U.S. policy for helping Kosovo refugees, and did
Baby Amerikan's family receive the aid it should have?
</P>
<P>
   In April, the U.S. announced that it would take up to 20,000
refugees who had escaped the war. More than 10,000 ethnic Albanians
who live in Kosovo had been killed and an estimated 900,000 were
forced from their homes by Serbian forces. Many of these Kosovars
escaped to neighboring countries such as Macedonia. The U.S.
airlift, which brought 12,085 Kosovo refugees to America, was begun
to relieve overcrowded refugee camps in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has said that it will pay to send back home
Kosovo refugees who arrived before July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Ten national agencies receive government money to resettle
refugees in the United States. The State Department requires that
refugees be provided a minimum of one month's rent, food, clothing,
``safe, decent and sanitary housing'' and access to English
classes, said Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   The Karaliju family was among approximately 400 Kosovo refugees
resettled in Texas. According to Corcoran, the refugees got what
they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Amerikan is healthy and well-fed. The family is doing as
best as we can expect being just recently removed from a war
zone,'' Corcoran told CLASS ACTS.
</P>
<P>
   Terminology to know:
</P>
<P>
   Refugee: A person who flees to a foreign country to escape
danger or social, religious or political persecution. Usually this
move is not planned and the person may not have brought along any
belongings. He or she might not know anyone in the new country or
speak the language.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant: A person who moves from his or her native country to
another country to live permanently. There is often a long wait to
get the U.S. government's permission to come to America.
</P>
<P>
   Resettlement: The process of providing money, housing, food and
services to help refugees rebuild their lives. In the United
States, 10 agencies do this work.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic cleansing: Killing or driving groups of people from their
homes because they have a different background in terms of their
common history, language, customs and characteristics.

   ``BOWFINGER''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Jamie
Kennedy, Christine Baranski and Robert Downey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Bobby Bowfinger, an aspiring movie producer (and a
schemer, a liar and an all-around crude guy) recruits a bunch of
odd but likable losers to help him trick the biggest name in movies
to star in his super-low-budget film.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Very original script with an absolutely hilarious
performance by Eddie Murphy, who plays two roles: Kit Ramsey, a
Hollywood action star with a big ego and his brother, Jiff Ramsey,
who is sweet but kind of nerdy.
</P>
<P>
   Also fantastic was Steve Martin, who wrote the screenplay for
this comedy and plays Bowfinger. By the way, Martin was born in
Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Graham, seen this summer in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me,'' appears as Daisy, an actress newly arrived in
Hollywood from the Midwest who pins her hopes of being a movie star
on Bowfinger. And Downey plays Jerry Renfro, a hot-shot movie
studio executive who reads Bowfinger's film script.
</P>
<P>
   Rating and reason for rating: PG-13 for offensive language, sex
scenes and sexual innuendo.

   ``EYE OF THE GREAT BEAR''
</P>
<P>
   Author: Bill Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   For: grades 3 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher: Pocket Books, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $14 hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   Pages: 161.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that the best part of Independence Day is the
fireworks. For most of us, that is. However, this is not the case
with 11-year-old Bailey Trumbull. Why? He has his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in our lives we have all been teased for one thing
or another and know how horrible it can be. In this story, Bailey
has the same problem _ his brothers and friends tease him about his
jumpiness _ and like most kids, he overreacts and thinks the
problem is bigger than it actually is.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey knows he's not a coward, he just has to get everyone else
to believe it. This story, which takes place near Abilene in 1899,
is very enjoyable and easy to relate to.

   CD ``THAT'S THE TRUTH''
</P>
<P>
   Artist: Paul Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   Country music: Either you love it or you hate it. Well, listen
to one song by Paul Brandt and you'll start to love it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth album by Brandt, whose hometown is Calgary,
in the province of Alberta, Canada. The first album, ``Calm Before
the Storm,'' was released in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His new CD is real fun, blending rock and pop with country. He
has a smooth voice. Watch out Garth Brooks, you might have some
competition. I think this guy will be popping the charts with this
CD.
</P>
<P>
   The CD includes songs such as ``that's the Truth,'' ``There's a
World Out There'' and a nice mellow tune, ``The Sycamore Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a really good CD. And that's the truth.

   Berry-bacon cheeseburger, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   How does a hot blueberry burger sound? It could be on your
cafeteria menu someday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are mixing blueberries and cranberries into ground
beef to learn if the fruit helps keep the meat tasting fresh.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chemical reaction that causes a change in taste when
meat is cooked, chilled and reheated, and researcher Keith Moore, a
graduate student at the University of Maine, is looking into
whether the fruit can affect that reaction.
</P>
<P>
   School lunch programs, nursing homes and other places that
reheat meat might benefit if the fruit theory works. Also,
fast-food restaurants could cook burgers one day and reheat them in
a microwave the next, without sacrificing taste.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer first beeped almost 50 years ago. It hasn't stopped
since. And now it's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers beep. Answering machines beep. ATMs beep. Elevators beep.
Phones beep. We have warning beeps, ready beeps and attention
beeps. There have been private and public beeps and beeps heard
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The beep has even entered the vernacular, courtesy of the
answering machine (``Leave your message after the beep ...'').
American society has been inundated by peppy beeps.
</P>
<P>
   The beep originally served as an alert. And for a long time,
only high-tech things beeped, like satellites and computers. But
today the most mundane things _ from children's toys to pens _ do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are moments of my day where I think: If hear another
beep, I think I am going to shoot the device,'' said Cindy Mason, a
computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, who
added that sometimes she hears more than 100 beeps in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   With its democratization over the last 40 years, the beep has
moved from cutting-edge chic to downright tacky. And it may be
headed for the scrap heap if sound designers have their way. ``The
time has come for the beep to die an honorable death,'' said B.J.
Fogg, a researcher at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   A small army of researchers, engineers and programmers has
declared war on the beep, which, they say, has overstayed its
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beeps have become like the little boy who cried wolf,'' said
Bruce Tognazzini, a human-computer interaction designer for the
Healtheon Corp. ``They are often ignored even when they might have
been useful. Having a computer that constantly emits the identical
sound whether it is just happy to see you or is on fire and about
to explode is akin to having a housemate that is similarly
afflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the beep continues to hold its ground. ``The downfall of the
beep is only in fiction,'' said Bill Buxton, chief scientist for
Alias/Wavefront, a software subsidiary of Silicon Graphics, and a
foe of the beep. ``In the real world, the beep is still thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer irritation caused by the beep is one reason for its
longevity. Research has shown that humans are bothered by sounds
that are sudden, high-pitched and short.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to design an annoying sound, you can't do much
better than a beep,'' said Bill Gavin, a researcher at the Royal
College of Art in England. Fogg described a beep as ``a poke in the
ribs, a simple but annoying method for gaining attention or
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer historians say that modern computer beeps evolved from
typewriter carriage return bells. Piercing beeps were substituted
as alert signals for the familiar ring of the bell. Today the
program code to make a computer beep is still called the bell
character.
</P>
<P>
   Why a beep, as opposed to a buzz or even a ding? The answer is
dictated by economics. ``Beeping is cheap,'' Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   A beep requires only two mechanical parts: an energy source and
something to vibrate. Beep sound waves are produced by the rapid
oscillation of on and off electrical pulses, in either a square
form or a sine wave form. In contrast, more complicated electronic
sounds require many more components.
</P>
<P>
   The 1957 launch of the Russian Sputnik satellite ushered in a
new era of celebrity for the beep. At the height of the Cold War,
American television and radio stations continually broadcast the
satellite's taunting signal as it blazed over United States soil
every 96 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound was something very remote, very powerful and very
frightening'' said James Katz, a Rutgers University professor who
was 9 years old at the time. ``After all, it was a man-made entity
in space over the United States. The beep made it much more real.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, beeps became most strongly associated with
high-powered mainframe computers, and for engineers and
technicians, they were a comforting and familiar sound. But when
computers breached mainstream workplaces, the beep began to lose
its luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers are very sensitive about not making mistakes, so the
beep gave the users an incredible psychological stress,'' said
Giordano Beretta, who worked as a bank computer support technician
in the 1970s. ``If you use a beep to signal a problem, people hate
it because they feel socially responsible for making a mistake.''
Beretta said he was regularly asked to disable beep features on the
computers.
</P>
<P>
   When bar code scanners were first introduced, many library and
supermarket employees often felt that beeps represented
management's measuring of their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Even appliances not designed to beep will chime in the chorus
given the right electrical impulses. In 1987 a utility company in
Dallas conducted an experiment using electrical transmission lines
to carry digital signals. As a result, all the electronic
appliances around the house of John Feagins began emitting a series
of soft beeps every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hear it out of the TV speakers,'' recalled Feagins, who
was a physics student at the University of Texas at the time. ``I'd
hear it out of the radio speakers. I'd hear it out of the stove. It
was everywhere in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his complaints to the utility, the beeping continued on
and off for about a year. ``I got aggravated enough to unplug
everything, because otherwise I couldn't sleep,'' Feagins said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that the proliferation of the beep has a
cultural basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, Americans believe that the device needs to
shout at you _ hence the loud beep,'' said Richard Giordano, a
computer science lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French, on the other hand, believe that the user should
not be distracted from solving the problem, that the device should
indicate the problem to the user in a calm manner and not get in
the way of solving the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That is why French nuclear power stations are much quieter than
American ones, Giordano said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of the beep is not simply a matter of eradicating
it; the beep has to be replaced with something else. Specialists
who work in ``human factors'' laboratories are looking to create
sounds that are less sharp and richer in timbre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pity people don't use chimes and bells more often,''
lamented John Murray, a human factors specialist at Exponent
Failure Analysis, a consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There are three main approaches to the design of information
tones. One is the earcon, an audio equivalent of an icon, which
uses different rhythms, pitches, timbres and melodies to
communicate different messages. Increasing a sound's tempo, for
example, makes it seem more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   A paralinguistic approach gives computers a library of nonspeech
tones used in human spoken communication (like ``uh-oh''). Finally,
audio icons use caricatures or simulations of naturally occurring
sounds _ like a burp _ that carry specific associations.
</P>
<P>
   The current trend is for high-tech companies to have their own
trademark sound _ a logo for the ears, like America Online's
``You've got mail'' and the ICQ instant messenger's peppy
``Uh-oh!''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's Macintosh computer was the first serious desktop assault
on the computer beep. Instead of using the simple grating tones,
users could choose from a host of alerts ranging from a quack to
the sound of a droplet.
</P>
<P>
   One Macintosh sound, called sosumi (``so sue me''), was a
pointed taunt at the Beatles' Apple Corps company, which threatened
legal action to prevent Apple Computer from releasing music under
the Apple name.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows platform also comes with a standard litany of sounds
to choose from. Screen savers and other programs let users
substitute sounds, from Homer Simpson's ``D'oh!'' to the ``Star
Wars'' theme song.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enmity it faces, the beep is still healthy, thanks
especially to answering machines and to personal pagers, which made
beeps mobile (much to the dismay of many churches and theaters).
</P>
<P>
   But pagers also contributed to the beeper backlash. Pagers were
originally the domain of an elite few who had to be reached
immediately, like doctors. ``A loud ring on such a device let
certain louts know, who might otherwise have remained unaware, that
the pagee was someone of money and distinction,'' noted Tognazzini,
of Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   When pagers became commonplace, their beeps became scorned
rather than respected. As a response to customer complaints,
companies introduced vibrating pagers, dealing the beep a major
blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vibration was huge,'' said Karen Holmes, a marketing manager
at Motorola. ``Consumers just loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Glassman, author of a book on techno-etiquette, says that
pagers should always be kept on vibrator mode while in public. She
adds that the only reason pagers still have a beep mode is ``so
that we don't have to call them vibrators.''
</P>
<P>
   The pager beep was displaced not only for reasons of etiquette
but also for practical reasons. Mono-frequency beeps are unnatural
to the ear, and psycho-acoustic research has shown that human ears
have great difficulty determining the direction the sound is coming
from, which is why it often seems difficult to find a misplaced
pager or cell phone in a room or to identify whose phone or pager
is sounding.
</P>
<P>
   To Buxton, of Alias/Wavefront, this is evidence that the beep's
days are numbered. ``When people start designing devices that
demonstrate subtle, well-designed sounds are less intrusive and
more effective than the beep, the beep will be shamed out of
existence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not going quietly. Even without a sound card, today's
desktop PCs can still belt out a primitive trill, which Eric
Isaacson, a technical writer at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
in Pullman, Wash., discovered much to his dismay.
</P>
<P>
   After Isaacson installed Windows NT on his office computer, the
machine suddenly began beeping loudly enough for officemates 10
feet away to hear. For four weeks, the support technicians at his
company could not figure out how to make it stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I just got a little irritated when it beeped at me,''
Isaacson said. But the situation soon escalated. ``Later,'' he
said, ``I started making it beep on purpose, after it beeped at me
first _ kind of the `I'll show you' attitude. This progressed to
the point of my stabbing at the keys to make it beep, taking out my
frustrations on the poor keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, through an online news group, he found a way to silence
the beep. ``Now my beep lets out not a peep,'' he said.

   Many older homes have exterior basement doors made of wood.
Unless they are maintained properly, these old doors can become an
eyesore, and as the boards age they will shrink and allow rainwater
to leak through. If you have such a door on your basement entry
well, consider replacing it with a modern heavy-gauge steel door.
It is more durable than a wooden one; it also provides a stronger
barrier against intruders and requires less maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Installing one is not difficult and can be accomplished with a
few basic hand tools. Usually one person of average size can handle
this job without help. However, the installation procedures will
vary somewhat depending upon the type of foundation (called the
well foundation) that surrounds the basement entryway.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types. One has sides that slope from the ground to
about three feet on the house wall. The other type of foundation is
level with the ground, but there are wooden walls on either side
that rise from the well foundation level to the top of the opening
in the house foundation. The doors hinge from these walls. With the
flat foundation, you will first have to mount a metal housing with
sloping sides. The doors will be mounted on this. Since the housing
butts against the house, you may have to cut back some of the
siding so everything fits precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can order a door, you will have to take some
measurements of the well foundation. Measure the width from the
outside of one wall to the outside of the opposite wall; call this
W-1. Measure across the inside width of the well foundation
opening, W-2. Determine the length of the foundation from the house
wall to the outside front edge of the foundation, L-1; and the
length of the well opening from the house wall to the inside edge
of the well foundation, L-2. If you have a flat foundation, take an
additional measurement, the height of the well foundation to the
height of the opening in the house foundation.
</P>
<P>
   As you are taking these measurements also look carefully at the
top of the foundation walls to see if they are relatively flat and
smooth. If they are not, you will have to order special foundation
plates.
</P>
<P>
   With these measurements in hand, you can order a new door. Your
local home center may stock metal basement doors, or look in the
Yellow Pages under ``doors'' for a nearby dealer; or you can order
directly from a manufacturer. The dealer will have charts that
allow you match your figures with the appropriate-size door.
</P>
<P>
   If the new door is smaller than the well opening, you can modify
it by adding extension panels. These are metal plates that attach
to the door frame and span the gaps across the width and height of
the opening. The manufacturer's charts specify which panels are
needed to adapt the door to your well opening. For a flat
foundation, manufacturers offer a sloping frame. This mounts
directly onto the well foundation and to the adjacent house wall.
</P>
<P>
   When you have the door and framing, you can mount them in place.
First remove and discard the old door and all of the wooden framing
pieces. Next examine the well foundation for defects like cracks,
holes or crumbling masonry. These should be repaired before
proceeding further.
</P>
<P>
   If the top surfaces of the well foundation are rough or uneven,
install the foundation plates first. The foundation plates and all
metal framing pieces are anchored to the masonry with expansion
fasteners (these are usually provided by the manufacturer). Place
the plates on the foundation walls and mark the position for the
anchors holes. Drill into the concrete with a masonry drill bit
then insert the expansion plugs. Reposition the plates and secure
them by driving the fasteners into the plugs. Next attach the door
frame with anchors. Make sure it is square and level (you may have
to insert shims in some places to correct distortions). Finally,
bolt the door flanges to the frame and attach the doors to the
flanges. Lubricate the torsion cams on the doors with light oil,
then slide the torsion bars in place (not all doors have torsion
cams).
</P>
<P>
   When the doors are in place, apply a bead of caulk around the
perimeter of the frame then paint the doors and all exterior metal
parts with a high-gloss alkyd metal enamel. Choose a color that
will reflect sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Installation procedures may vary, but in most cases the
manufacturers provide detailed step-by-step instructions and all
the necessary hardware.

DRUG USE AMONG TEENS DROPS BUT IS STABLE FOR OVERALL POPULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying teen-agers have ``turned the corner'' on
drugs, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and White
House drug adviser Barry McCaffrey announced Wednesday that illicit
drug use among people ages 12 to 17 fell last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings show our message of no tolerance for drugs is
working,'' McCaffrey said in releasing the results of an annual
household survey of 25,500 people 12 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that in 1998, 9.9 percent of teens under 17
were ``current users'' of drugs, meaning they had used drugs within
the previous month, down from 11.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The rate was highest in 1979, when 16.3 percent of teens under
the age of 17 were classified as current drug users. The rate
dropped to 5.3 percent in 1992, then gradually rose until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the report showed that young people were
``getting the message that drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of teens saying they had tried drugs at least once in
their life also was down, falling from 18.8 percent in 1997 to 16.4
percent last year. The decline was driven by 16- and 17-year-olds,
with the percentage in those ages who have used drugs dropping from
30.7 percent to 26.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the battle against illicit drugs we've turned the corner
... but we have a long way to go,'' Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the survey reported that despite the drop in use among
teens under 18, overall drug use in the United States remained
steady last year because of increased use among young adults 18 to
25.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, 16.1 percent of young adults were
current users, up from 13.3 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is a real challenge for our country because it's
much harder to change the way people think about drugs as they get
older,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 13.6 million Americans, or 6.2 percent of the
population, used drugs at least once a month in 1998, nearly the
same as in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In total, 78 million Americans had tried illegal drugs at some
point in their lives, the survey reported. Marijuana is the
country's most popular narcotic, with nearly 37 million people
having tried it.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also measured the use of tobacco and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans 12 and older who had smoked a cigarette
in the previous month fell last year to 60 million, or 27.7 percent
of population, from 64 million, or 29.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of young adults aged 18 to 25 who smoked in the
previous month climbed from 40.6 percent in 1997 to 41.6 percent
last year. That compares with 34.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The number of drinkers in the United States held steady in 1998,
with 113 million Americans 12 and older having had at least one
drink in the 30 days before the survey was conducted. Of these
people, about 33 million were considered binge drinkers, meaning
they drank five or more drinks on one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Although drinking is illegal for anyone under the age of 21,
more than 10 million young people 12 to 20 had had a drink at least
once in the previous month, the report said. That number has
remained steady since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're pleased that the number of kids drinking hasn't
gone up, we as a country need to remind ourselves that alcohol is a
deadly drug for teen-agers and cannot be tolerated,'' McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which is based on interviews conducted nationwide
throughout the year, also tracked drug use of among minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also said:
</P>
<P>
   _ The percentage of blacks of all ages using drugs grew from 5.8
percent in 1993 to 8.2 percent last year, the report said. The
trend for Hispanics was similar, from 4.4 percent in 1993 to 6.1
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ A total of 130,000 people were using heroin in 1998, double
the number in 1993. In addition, the age of heroin users was
dropping. In 1997, the typical heroin user was 17.6 years old the
first time they tried the drug, down from 18.3 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of cocaine users remained the same in 1998 compared
to 1997 at about 1.75 million. However, there were increases among
teens and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of cigar smokers increased last year to 15 million,
6.9 percent of the population, from 13 million, 5.9 percent of the
population, in 1997.

WHERE NO BEEP HAD GONE BEFORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 (Eds: The byline is correct)  
 By JENNIFER 8. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like an aging movie star, the beep has seen its glory days in
Hollywood fade over the last 30 years, paralleling its fall in the
public sphere. The 1960s television series ``Star Trek'' and its
later offshoots provide a case study of how the beep has fallen
from high-tech symbol to low-tech annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   In the original series, which ran from 1966 to 1969, the beep
was a star. Machines on the bridge of the starship Enterprise
emitted a constant backdrop of beeping and booping to accompany the
plot line. During the height of the 1960s space race, beeping was
considered cutting-edge chic.
</P>
<P>
   In recent ``Star Trek'' incarnations, however, the beep makes
only cameo appearances. Gurgling, swishing and speaking have taken
its place. The banishment of the beep was a conscious decision by
the producers of the pilot of ``Star Trek: the Next Generation'' in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled up the sound of the bridge from the original
series,'' said Peter Lauritson, who has worked as a producer on
``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' as well as the later series
``Deep Space Nine'' and ``Star Trek Voyager.'' ``It was a loud,
constant, harsh environment. In contrast to that, we tried to make
things softer and calmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the electronic interface designers of today, the ``Star
Trek'' producers tried to serve the esthetic thresholds of humans.
The ``Star Trek'' characters live aboard the ships for years on
end, Lauritson said. ``The reality is they wouldn't be able to take
it,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to keep the sounds fairly gentle and minimal until
something needed to be said with the sound. We were hoping it would
convey sophistication, that things had advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' the sound designers aimed
for a so-called pastel range of electronic sounds that were muted
and subtle. But then they realized even the harsh beeps and boops
had a necessary role.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the background sounds in ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Star Trek Voyager'' aimed for a more ``primary'' sound palette,
with harsher electronic noises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally went overboard in making things so sophisticated
that it was boring,'' said Lauritson. ``We had to start backing off
of that a little bit to get a little more life into the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The beep's prestige has diminished as it has become more
mundane. ``I think that the beeps and the boops sounds in the
earlier days were kind of a futuristic signature,'' Lauritson said,
``whereas now, they're kind of everywhere.''

SMALL-SCREEN HELP FOR BUDDING FILMMAKERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. )   By ERIC A. TAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer programs to help screenwriters have been around for
more than a decade, since writers began dropping the IBM Selectric
typewriter in favor of the Apple Macintosh. But in the last few
years, they have come to include not only simple aides but also
complex systems offering, like the hyperbolic movie industry
itself, bloated promises that you'll soon be writing a blockbuster
with ``passionate themes'' and ``unforgettable characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all writers, those who create film and television scripts
strike out the most. Scripts often sell for the wrong reasons: The
writer is a friend of a producer. The writer has persuaded a star
to participate. Projects that are universally disliked are suddenly
loved once money is committed.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriters know that even if their films are produced, most
of what they write may never be heard or even read, buried under a
mountain of rewrites or hidden in a sea of descriptive action meant
to capture the imagination of one of the scores of people who will
have to sign off on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're part of the tiny fraternity of screenwriters who
can sell a script based on a two-sentence idea, you must create a
story that a reader _ whether a low-level employee, studio
executive, agent or star _ immediately finds compelling. You must
quickly show that the characters are complex and fresh, the
situation unique and intriguing, the dialogue biting and germane.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for the equivalent of a digital dishwasher, a
program into which you can dump all your words and receive a clean,
finished script, don't waste your time. Writing programs do not
evaluate dialogue and narrative. Rather, all these programs try to
help the writer think more critically. Each tries to give rules for
character development, conflict, plot and resolution, while the
user enters information or answers multiple-choice questions about
the intended story. Some programs can be mastered in a few minutes;
others require days.
</P>
<P>
   If you insist on software that features the latest in computer
graphics, choose carefully. Several packages remain mired in a
1980s style, using fixed, primitive screen layouts and built on
inflexible databases that tend to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Has a screenwriting program, like a word processor, become a de
rigueur tool for the budding filmmaker? Of course not. In fact,
some of these programs seem to exist on disk for no other reason
than that they can: a book version of the same material would often
suffice. However, if you find that critical prodding helps you
think more rigorously, then each of the four programs examined here
is worth a look. All are available through the Writers Store in Los
Angeles (writersstore.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Plots Unlimited'' (Ashleywilde; $199; Macintosh and Windows 95
or later.) Writers stuck for story ideas, or those unable to figure
out where their story should go next, may benefit from Plots
Unlimited. Created by Tom Sawyer, head writer-producer for the
television series ``Murder, She Wrote,'' the program requires
minutes to master.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a thesaurus of story ideas, with one choice
leading to other logical options among the 5,600 situations
available from the program's database. It's perfect for television
writers looking for new twists to old ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Writers first name the project, and then pick the number of
characters and their relationship to one another from 165
alternatives, or specify the type of story they are developing
(like romance or married life). If you have little idea of what
your story is about, the Master Plot option lets you combine
general statements that spell out the protagonist, the action and
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   If Howard Koch and Julius and Philip Epstein had had Plots
Unlimited, they could have begun their work on ``Casablanca'' by
choosing to develop their screenplay via the story option. This
classic film is a triangle between a woman, her husband and her
former lover. Picking the marriage option brings up 290 conflict
situations, like ``Carol, wife of Jack, runs into an old lover,
Gary, and has no choice but to borrow money from him.'' (Don't
worry: the program allows each character's name to be changed.)
</P>
<P>
   The user can look for story options that either take the story
forward or fill in preceding events. One of the three forward
suggestions for the scenario above is, ``Jack's wife, Carol, finds
herself in the power of a former lover, Gary.'' Each successive
step can be previewed to see where the story will lead and, if
inappropriate, rejected for other permutations.
</P>
<P>
   The program has a clunky interface that requires the user to
allocate additional memory. Each suggestion appears in a small
window and type size, neither of which can be changed; even though
character names can be personalized, the generic names provided by
the program incongruously continue to be used by parts of the
program. The program is available on floppy disk only,
necessitating an external drive.
</P>
<P>
   Plots Unlimited's suggested plot development ideas, while
numerous, are neither exhaustive nor gospel. However, if all you
need is a way to jump-start your thought processes with some basic
plot twists, then it can help. Of course, if you don't care about
using a computer, the course contains the same information, in its
book of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writepro'' (The Writepro Corp.; $149.95;
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh 6.0.5 or later and Windows 3.1 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   While the program bills itself as ``for novelists and short
story writers,'' Writepro is just as valuable for screenwriters,
because the writing lessons it teaches are universal.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Sol Stein, a novelist, book editor and publisher of
writers like James Baldwin and Lionel Trilling, Writepro takes the
user through elementary, essential rules for creating well-written
material.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into eight lesson plans, Writepro gives rules for
characterization, dialogue and plot development are given; then the
writer enters a description of the character or scene and is asked
to re-evaluate that work to insure that it is true to the form of
good storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Stein presents a number of bare plot points that the writer must
embellish. What does your fictional character want? How do
antagonists _ obstacles or events _ prevent the main character from
achieving his goal?
</P>
<P>
   Once the user has finished one part of the story, a complication
is presented. The main character, a woman, meets an attractive man
at a party. The story's antagonist is there also, forcing us to
consider how both elements will change the story's direction.
</P>
<P>
   As Stein points out, as the story continues, the obstacles must
get stronger. If one conflict is resolved, the next must be greater
in intensity. ``If the villain appearing at the party was a
surprise to our heroine,'' he writes, ``then there better be a
bigger surprise when she gets home.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's program is unrelenting in its demand that you re-examine
your work. Yet the tone is friendly, more like that of a supportive
teacher watching over your shoulder than a stern taskmaster as you
learn to tighten dialogue by removing redundant lines, intensify
characters' conflicts and enhance characterization.
</P>
<P>
   There is no chance to work on your own story ideas while using
Writepro, but the program is a useful tool for novices. The
program's small font and screen size cannot be enlarged. However,
maneuvering between screens and lessons is simple to master. The
program is available on floppy disk only.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``John Truby's Blockbuster'' (Truby's Writers Studio; $295;
Macintosh 7.0 or later and Windows 3.1 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   For John Truby, a longtime writing instructor, the key to a good
screenplay is to follow his 22 steps. These include brainstorming,
developing the premise and fleshing out the plot. They are in turn
divided into four categories: idea, character, plot and scene
creation.
</P>
<P>
   The program has a colorful, but small interface that cannot be
enlarged to fill the screen of today's 17-inch monitors. Beginners
can use the ``quickstory'' path and develop a few of the levels to
get an idea of how stories are created.
</P>
<P>
   You start by brainstormingyour story, jotting down ideas about
the plot and characters. At the start of each lesson, a comment
screen pops up, indicating what type of information is required.
Clicking on one button brings up a condensed version of Truby's
writing course; clicking on another illustrates how a well-known
film script would handle the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   For example, once you enter step two, developing initial scenes,
Truby cautions that you should ``expect that the order of your
scenes will change radically by the time you have finished
developing your story.'' When creating dialogue, the writer is
advised to rewrite each scene three times: first composing words
that explore the action, then inserting ``moral'' dialogue that
explores underlying emotions. Finally, dialogue should be reviewed
again for the inclusion of key words that move the story forward.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Truby's thoughts and examples, you enter the
requested information. The screens can be printed individually or
all together.
</P>
<P>
   Once finished, you are presented with a list of common
screenwriting mistakes and asked to check off the elements missing
from your story. While all of your original work can be printed,
the lessons cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The program does not have the look of modern software; on the
Mac platform, users are cautioned to disable a system extension
before use. But doing so prevents signing on to the Internet; the
extension must be enabled and the computer restarted before that is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was the best program of those reviewed, filled with
valuable information, useful tips and good illustrations from
classic films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dramatica Pro'' (Screenplay Systems; $399; Macintosh 7.0 or
later and Windows 95 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're the type of person who hates to read manuals, this
program is not for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a
piece of software that can raise more questions about your story's
plot, characterization, individuals' motivations, inner thoughts,
moral dilemmas and course of action than you may even care to know,
then Dramatica Pro deserves consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The program, developed by two screenwriters, takes users through
what they call ``a new theory of story.'' The underlying premise is
that ``story forming,'' creating the dramatic skeleton of a story
stripped of its illustrations, is a different process from ``story
weaving,'' the telling of a story to the audience. Both should be
developed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatica offers more than 32,000 story forms, which eventually
become narrowed down to one as the user continues to answer
questions about the story. Our Casablanca screenwriters would have
been asked to consider issues like: ``Does Rick use a logical
method of problem solving or an intuitive method?'' ``Do actions
force decisions, or decisions force actions?'' Does the struggle
between Rick and Ilsa ``involve a manner of thinking or demeanor?''
</P>
<P>
   The process can take days to complete. After the user runs
through the various story forms, it is suggested that it be done
two more times to check for accuracy. It is a tedious process, but
it forces the writer to think carefully about the structure and
implications of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Where the other programs look outdated, Dramatica Pro is a
visual breath of fresh air. Virtually all elements of the software
are customizable, including overall screen size, font and font
size. Characters can be assigned one of scores of thumbnail
portraits to help personalize each.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the entire process and you'll be presented with a report
on your screenplay that could be almost as large as the final work.
The process can be so daunting and complex that Dramatica classes
are held at the company's Los Angeles offices to help users master
the program. With each release, the company has tried to simplify
the software, reducing the size of its printed manuals and
substituting lay terms for technical jargon.
</P>
<P>
   The program is overengineered for my taste, and there are so
many tasks to accomplish and so many areas to cover that you begin
to wish you could get on with the job of writing.

PRISONERS OF EDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They had gone out to Long Island to see about a summer rental,
and as soon as they saw the cinder-block cottage in Springs, they
fell for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was buried in thick, overgrown, decrepit greenery, with big
chokecherries growing right outside the door and wild roses
climbing over everything,'' said David White, who grew up on Cape
Cod, so his heart went out to this landscape.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few native azaleas near the door and some pale pink
dogwoods smothered in honeysuckle. Cedars, ailanthus and oaks had
seeded themselves all around the house, and the eastern side,
toward the water, was a wall of bullbrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house was musty and damp,'' said Robert Jakob, who grew up
among farmers in Germany. ``And there was only one door, on the
north side, so you had to go all the way around to get back in.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a room with possibilities: 20 by 30, with a high
gable 17 feet up. A picture window faced east, across a patch of
brown lawn, a picnic table, a birdbath _ and then the wall-o-weeds.
Small windows on each side of the cottage let in more light, though
they were largely obscured by vines creeping over the house. And
there was a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   The rental agent started to say that people would be traipsing
through the place, as it was for sale, when they looked at each
other and knew who had to buy it. Then they spent the next 20 years
learning from the land and cherishing the little house at its
heart.
</P>
<P>
   White, Robert Rauschenberg's exhibition curator, is the pruner,
the shaper. Jakob, a graphic designer and artist, is the plantsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't wait to get my hands on a chain saw,'' White said.
``I saw all these things buried, waiting to be revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   He started sawing deadwood out of the cedars, which were scrawny
and thin from being smothered in vines. Others lay fallen from a
storm, rotting in a heap on the south side of the house, where
Jakob envisioned a flower garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a diagonal path winding through a few summer flowers,
like black-eyed Susans and hollyhocks,'' Jakob said, padding
barefoot down a brick path he laid years later. ``It was free-form
at best.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wanted to plant an orchard in front of the house, by the
road. So they had a nurseryman take down the towering trees of
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody came by and said, `Why did you do that?' and we felt
bad,'' said Jakob, whose voice bears a trace of Germany. Very tan,
in old white pants and a white shirt, a cigarette dangling from his
hand, he lends a Mediterranean air to the late-bloomers: blue
salvia, achillea, crocosmia and the delicate white flowers of
oxydentera, a species gladiolus that makes the hybrids seem blousy
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both David and I were hesitant to cut anything down,'' he
said. ``Though I admire the kind of ruthlessness of `bring in the
bulldozer.' Our neighbor erased everything.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't really mean it. These two are notorious for moving
things, like the peach trees that weren't happy in front of the
house, so now they're in the vegetable garden; the cedars that now
border the edge of the perennial garden cast a bit of shade and act
as a backdrop to set off the colors of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White was tackling the wilderness. ``The blueberries
came back, and a nice stand of shadblow,'' he said. ``I remember
seeing the wonderful mottled bark showing through the bullbrier.''
He uncovered a young beech, which like everything else grew fat and
tall once it got light and air. Ferns sprouted in the sandy soil,
and mallows started blooming in the bulrushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see more birds, too,'' White said. ``Goldfinches and
warblers and red-winged blackbirds.''
</P>
<P>
   They lived in one room for six years before expanding the house,
opening it up with french doors and bigger windows and adding a
two-story tower. It has a bedroom upstairs, an aerie that looks out
on the blue water of Accabonac Harbor, and a sunny library and
guest room downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The french doors to the east and south created a powerful axis
that Jakob could not help but carry forward as his gardens grew.
The free-form flower garden turned into four square beds, with
brick paths and a long allee of clipped hornbeams extending the eye
far into the distance. You want to go there, but you want to
linger, too, in the doorway, where a tiny blue clematis winds
through the fragrant white climbing rose, Sombreuil.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains, you should smell the Rosa primula,'' Jakob
said, fingering the spicy little leaves of the yellow rose.
</P>
<P>
   The garden has taken over Jakob's life. ``I have no time to
draw,'' he said. ``I long for just two pots on the terrace, and
then we could go away to Greece.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Then he asks, ``Did you see the persimmons?'' and heads down the
brick path toward his vegetable garden, which is really an orchard
full of peaches, plums and sour cherries growing over Black Prince
tomatoes, chard, leeks, basil, fennel and long-leafed, deliciously
bitter arugula he orders from Pinetree Garden Seeds in New
Gloucester, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob grew up in the fertile Ried Valley between Mannheim and
Frankfurt. His father was a baker with an orchard full of apricots,
plums and apples for his tarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I thought I was deprived, not inheriting land,''
Jakob said, pulling a few small carrots out of a sandy plot beneath
an apricot tree. ``But in the garden, I see I'm copying what I saw
as a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakob never sprays anything in his garden, including the fruit
trees. He believes in the power of compost, which builds good soil,
which grows healthy plants, which can resist disease and insects.
</P>
<P>
   We carry fresh basil back to White, who is chopping garlic and
tomatoes in the kitchen. The house feels like an open pavilion with
inviting paths stretching in all directions. There are no screens
on the doors or windows to inhibit light or breezes _ or bugs, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get bad at night, we put a coil under the dinner
table,'' White said. ``And we have mosquito nets over the beds.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other gardens hidden behind the cedars, and as in a
big house with many rooms, it takes a while to discover them. Go
through the hornbeam hedge and it feels like Tuscany: an urn and
columnar junipers in the middle of drought-tolerant plants like
verbascum, butterfly weed, sage and crocosmia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heeled in some irises here, and they really liked it'' Jakob
said. Soon he was buying things at Heronswood Nursery in Kingston,
Wash., like Solfaterre, an apricot crocosmia with bronze leaves,
and Digitalis lutea, a foxglove with a pale yellow bloom. The man
just can't stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought I'd just restrict myself to lavender and
santolina, but I can't,'' he said, staring at the styrax in the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Across a grassy field shaded by a single great sycamore maple is
a meditative place that White hopes will remain simply green. Ferns
under the locust trees, a few magnolias, rare to the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if I could sneak a blue bellflower in with the
ferns,'' Jakob said, mumbling Campanula something-or-other.
</P>
<P>
   We eat our meal here, feet resting on warm stonework laid in
triangles and diagonals by Jakob, who was inspired by the fanciful
tilework of Aphrodisias, an ancient city in Turkey. It's one of
those wonderful ruins they don't have time to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob keeps snapshots of crumbling hillside cottages in Greece
to remind himself of life before the garden.

SEATTLE MAN'S ODD BALL NOW PART OF NERF LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRICIA DURYEE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle resident Mike McGonigle never invented a thing
in his life until Halloween 1993, when the San Francisco 49ers were
creaming the Los Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of his frustration and boredom, he threw a foam
pumpkin decoration against the wall and it spiraled right back to
him. Within hours, he had sawed off the end of his purple and gray
Nerf ball, and his invention was born: a pass-back, spiraling
football.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, Hasbro _ the creators of Nerf _ adopted the ball
into its line of spongy play toys. Now the ball that McGonigle
invented on the fly is available for children ages 6 and up to play
endless hours of football by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With a nice spiral pass, the flat end of the Nerf football will
make even contact with the wall, and it will bounce a nice spiral
right back to passer. Throw a lousy pass, and it's unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't anyone think of it before?'' asked Webb Nelson,
McGonigle's partner, who as president of Play Visions of
Woodinville helped bring the idea to Hasbro. When thinking about
how McGonigle came up with the idea, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's best when life can be serendipitous.''
</P>
<P>
   As a day trader, buying and selling stocks as short-term
investments, McGonigle is well-acquainted with serendipity. In
1986, he got fired from a computer programming job because he
traded on company time. McGonigle now covets his freedom, and
enjoys watching his idea flourish from his apartment in downtown
Seattle, where he's most comfortable in shorts, a T-shirt and a
pair of flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Toys ``R'' Us at Seattle's Northgate Mall sells the
Nerf Turbo Blast-Back Footballs at $9.99 apiece. FAO Schwarz lets
them go for $16 each.
</P>
<P>
   McGonigle is optimistic about the odd-looking football's future,
partly because of its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of those high-tech toys with a microchip,'' he
said, noting that it came about at a time when Hasbro had pretty
much tried all variations of the football.
</P>
<P>
   There have been Nerf balls with fins, multicolored versions,
some with aerodynamic grooves and far-flying ones. But this one has
a different function, McGonigle says. It returns without a partner,
and stands without a tee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kihara, sales leader and supervisor for Bellevue's FAO
Schwarz, said the Blast-Back Football looks like the head of a
rocket or bullet because one of its ends is rounded off. ``It's
something different,'' he said. ``It solves some of the basic
problems of a regular football.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a bit heavier and more durable than the average Nerf,
making it more appropriate for outdoors than for indoors. The new
Nerf bears the official NFL logo. And McGonigle and Nelson said the
Nerf's commercials feature Brett Favre, quarterback for the Green
Bay Packers, along with other leading NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of them have seen the commercials, they have
been told the advertising campaign will begin this football season.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it's more than McGonigle expected.
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly depressing when he was awaiting his patent.
McGonigle wondered why it was taking so long. Then he discovered
his lawyer still had the file in his office, wasting more than a
year of McGonigle's time.
</P>
<P>
   But when he paired up with Nelson, the ball started rolling. As
a toy manufacturer and importer, Nelson was able to put out a
version in limited circulation. Nelson also had connections to
Hasbro, and in October 1998, they signed a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw it at the (New York) toy fair, I realized it
really happened,'' he said. Nelson and McGonigle got $25,000 for
the initial contract with Hasbro. About 100,000 of the balls have
sold to date and Hasbro expects to sell 2 million to 5 million this
year alone. McGonigle and his partner stand to make as much as $1.1
million each on a return of 22 cents for every Turbo Blast-Back
Nerf football sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will invent games with this,'' McGonigle said. ``I know
they will.''

THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE: A BABYLON OF EMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Global village'': what an appropriate phrase, though not the
way it is mostly used, implying technological neighborliness among
three billion people and, who knows, ads that chirrup, ``You've got
a friend at the Bank of Wuppertal'' once your mortgage, having
bopped among half a dozen spots around the United States, begins to
bop globally as well.
</P>
<P>
   Villages are more complicated than that: often, to modify Yeats'
``great hatred, little room,'' a matter of great distance, little
room. Think of Thomas Hardy and Robert Frost. Today, of course, the
world flies, tours, migrates and settles at a smart clip. A result
_ since humans do after all gravitate to humans and even fall in
love _ can be intimacy rent by strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few contemporary novelists have touched on this, notably
Diane Johnson, whose crystal thermometer has recorded several
multinational conjugal fevers. Elena Lappin's ``Foreign Brides''
shatters the thermometer. Its women skitter wildly and erratically,
like beads of mercury abruptly unconfined. Ms. Lappin skitters with
them: Her sentences and scenes are uprooted along with her
characters, zigzagging against expectations and sometimes running
right off her own screen.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does the author paragraph on a jacket flap suggest so
closely what we will read: ``born in Moscow and grew up in Prague
and Hamburg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has lived in Israel, Canada and the United States, and now
lives in London. From 1994 to 1997 she was editor of The Jewish
Quarterly. She is working on her first novel, `The Nose.'''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about skittering: Could Ms. Lappin have written this
herself? The places figure in the stories, there is a goading
nibble to the rhythm, and the end is a comic double take.
</P>
<P>
   But I hope to read ``The Nose.'' To say that ``Brides'' is
uneven, though it is true, is misleading. The stories lurch like a
foal finding its feet; the stumbles show comic promise and serious
purpose; the leaps claim unclaimed ground.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Noa and Noah,'' the comedy is hard to resist. Noa is an
Israeli; Noah, a visiting British Jew who wins her with his
prosperous business air, London liveliness and sexy habit of
murmuring when they make love. (Noa's Israeli boyfriends keep a
brooding silence at such moments.) Disillusion sets in when Noah
takes her back to London. The airy cosmopolitan is merely an
assistant debt collector. His main recreational interest is the
Tottenham Spurs soccer team, and the sexy murmur is a tortured
reciting of the players' names so as to retard climax.
</P>
<P>
   Rebellion follows; instead of the kosher butcher prescribed by
Noah's bossy mother, Noa patronizes rosy Joe McElligott, who
displays ``various pink sections of dead pigs in his window with
such pride and delight that it almost made Noa's mouth water.'' So
does Joe. From buying his chickens _ seasoning them lustily and
instructing them to ``act kosher'' _ she goes on to take advantage
of his convenient delivery service for a blithe fling.
</P>
<P>
   There are shrewd underpinnings to the fun: the difference
between Israeli and European Jewish cultures, the reinventing that
a foreigner has to do and beneath all this, marriage itself as a
foreign country. In the rougher ``Peacocks,'' a young woman leaves
Moscow for London for an arranged marriage. Her husband's address
is promisingly posh; he, however, is the butler. The story turns
weird rather than funny, signaling the more sinister aspects of
marrying foreign, but it is excessively contrived.
</P>
<P>
   There is contrivance, too, in ``Black Train'' _ Ms. Lappin's
MacGuffins need to go on a bland diet _ but also a quiet
perceptiveness. A Czech woman, exiled in 1968, marries a prosperous
American plumber. He is kind but she is torn between reaching for
what she has lost and grasping what she has achieved. She dreams of
being buried under thousands of trees in her green suburb; her
psychiatrist gives her the haunting advice to ``hang on to that
image until I have learned the names of all those trees, in
English.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Michael Farmer's Baby,'' the woman is neither a bride nor
foreign. But she comes to a maternity ward with a false pregnancy,
having for 20 years been in love with her employer, a professor who
eventually moved away after a few rare bouts of casual sex. Not
only has she imagined a baby but also _ reading through the
professor's collection of Victoriana _ an identity: that of an
Irish servant who murdered her husband because she was in love with
her master. It is a very odd place that Ms. Lappin has taken us to;
her art is gradually to erode the oddness and leave us moved.
</P>
<P>
   There are other odd and moving foreign conditions. In the
wonderfully uncombed ``Inhaling New York'' the foreigners are the
American protagonist's English husband and a 14-year-old son from
the differently foreign land of teen-age culture. In ``Bad
Writing,'' a German woman endures marriage to a coldly vicious
American by dissolving her reality into text _ here is critical
theory with nerves and a heart _ and writing contradictory versions
of it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the finest stories and certainly the most perfectly
balanced is ``When in Palestine, Do as the Romans Did.'' It returns
us to Noa, who is now 40 and taking a holiday from Noah and their
children. She goes to Eilat, once a Middle East flash point and now
a cosmopolitan beach resort. Norwegians, Tunisians, French,
Russians and others sun and oil themselves and read Danielle Steele
in as many different translations. (Noa has met the global village
and it is kitsch.)
</P>
<P>
   Noa strikes up acquaintance with an Italian carabiniere detailed
to the United Nations forces. What follows is an exquisite, comic
and sobering dramatization of frontiers: between a world and a
world, between intimacy and distance, between dismay at what is
strange and its ineradicable allure. Perhaps the use of fences is
not just to separate; it is also to draw us to press ourselves up
against them and take the pain.

   DIGITAL-PHOTOS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once upon a simpler
time, Henry VIII fell in love when he beheld a portrait in oil of
his betrothed, Anne of Cleves. Alas, when Anne showed up for the
wedding, Henry _ who had never met her _ took one look and
underwent an immediate and total change of heart. Anne was ugly.
Henry was royally ticked off. Anne was sent packing and her
embellished portrait consigned to the royal attic. She was pretty
as a picture, but pictures can lie. Photos do not. Well, they're
not supposed to. A photo supposedly captures an image of what is,
not what might be. But with the coming of the digital age, a sweep
of a computer mouse can turn the objective reality of the camera's
eye into subjective unreality. How do you really know what you're
seeing? (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

`A TIME TO DANCE': HEALING THROUGH MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was a young actress in New York in the late 1930s. Barely
out of high school (back in Brookline, Mass.), she became a part of
Manhattan's left-wing theater scene. She had a boyfriend and they
lived together for a few months _ even though it just wasn't done
in those days _ before marrying. Then just when she had been
offered her first lead role in a play, her young husband accepted a
job in Toledo, Ohio, and off they went. So much for fame and the
arts, you might think.
</P>
<P>
   But Norma Canner, today a lovely, sprightly white-haired woman
of 80, found her creative calling anyway. Her story is told in ``A
Time to Dance: The Life and Work of Norma Canner,'' a 70-minute
documentary from two young filmmakers, Ian Brownell and Webb
Wilcoxen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Canner's specialty is teaching dance _ or more accurately,
creative movement _ as a form of psychotherapy. The method works
for ``preverbal traumatic states,'' says a psychiatric social
worker, one of numerous talking heads called on to testify to Ms.
Canner's abilities, which they do, mostly convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Canner is her own best witness. ``It will just come
out,'' she says of the emotion. ``You can't defend that place the
way you can in verbal therapy.'' Later she adds, ``When people feel
really safe enough to explore their feelings _ feelings that have
been held in their body for a very long time _ they can go to very
deep places.''
</P>
<P>
   That discovery was almost by accident. Ms. Canner had taken
dance lessons from Barbara Mettler, an advocate of free expression.
In Toledo, Ms. Canner decided to teach dance and began with
children. When she started working with adults, a psychologist who
was a student told her, ``You're doing group therapy.'' She was
soon invited to teach at a hospital. When the family moved back to
Boston in 1966, her work expanded, and today she has a thriving
practice in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Time to Dance,'' narrated with conviction by Ruby Dee, seems
to prove the superiority of nonverbal therapy by example. Old film
of Ms. Canner's early work with preschoolers shows pure joy in the
children's faces. The most fascinating encounter is hers with an
autistic boy who defends himself by threatening people with words
like annihilate and destroy. She breaks through, to his mother's
amazement, by having him rip up colored tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, scenes of Ms. Canner working with a therapy group
of adults, with some movement but a good deal of talk, come across
as painfully phony. More than one moviegoer will want to tell them
to shut up and get back to movement, where the truth is.
</P>

TREE-SITTERS LAUNCH PROTEST AGAINST LAND SWAP WITH TIMBER COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANDLE, Wash. _ A hundred and twenty feet above the forest
floor, Tim Ream shouts directions to Sarah Vekasi, who dangles in
the grip of a mountain-climbing harness alongside a mammoth Douglas
fir. She is fiddling with the rigging, trying to get around a
branch that is blocking her descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grab it (the branch) through the middle, and grab it through
the other side!'' he yells.
</P>
<P>
   Vekasi is using slip knots in tandem to work her way down the
ropes. She always keeps one knot tied tight so that if she loses
her grip, the other knot will catch and break her fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ream and Vekasi are part of a loosely-knit environmental group
opposed to a proposed trade of public land, much of it in the
Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwest Washington state, to
the Plum Creek Timber Co. Willing to risk it all for their cause,
they have set up two platforms high in the branches of an
old-growth forest on Watch Mountain, near the small logging town of
Randle in Lewis County. They vow to stay in those trees, defying
the company to cut them down.
</P>
<P>
   Tree-sitting protesters, something of a fixture in Northern
California, Oregon and even British Columbia, are rare in
Washington. These tree-sitters, calling themselves the Cascadia
Defense Network, don't like the government's plan to give 25 square
miles of heavily forested mountain land on the west slope of the
Cascades to the timber company in exchange for 75 square miles of
prime hiking land near Snoqualmie Pass. Much of that Snoqualmie
Pass land is stunningly beautiful, high alpine country that is
great for hiking and camping but not as valuable as timberland.
</P>
<P>
   The battle pits the tree-sitters against not only the federal
government and the timber company, but also against more
mainstream, largely Seattle-area environmentalists who have signed
off on the agreement. The proposal, expected to be approved by
Congress last month, is on hold while a last-minute glitch caused
by the discovery of endangered marbled murrelets on two parcels of
land is resolved. Supporters expect approval within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Ream, who is coaching Vekasi on her way down, has been sitting
in trees to try to stop logging of old-growth forests since he was
trained at an Earth First! camp in California in 1995. He's been in
trees that were bumped by bulldozers. He says he saw a Humboldt
County, Calif., forest taken down in just 17 days from his perch in
one of the trees there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to stay here for months,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to sit up there in those trees and be a spectacle
for you,'' Ream told about 160 Randle residents who showed up at
the protest meeting organized by trade opponents last week. ``We're
going to sit up there until there are chain saws buzzing all around
us and they take us to jail. And we're not going to make it easy
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   These twentysomething, mostly vegetarian tree-sitters, some
sporting dreadlocks and a grunge look, are making common cause with
the residents of Randle, population 2,000, many of whom are more
comfortable in suspenders and weathered Stetsons.
</P>
<P>
   Loggers for generations, many local residents have stood by as
the local mill closed and timber companies began shipping timber
overseas for processing. Like the protesters, they are not happy
vyth big timber companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of folks besides those sitting (in) the trees _
thank God for them _ who are local environmentalists who are
concerned and will be working on this,'' said Randle resident
Bonnie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Some townspeople let the tree-sitters come to their homes for an
occasional shower. Others are making trips up the mountain to leave
food. A few hours before Vesaki's descent, one dropped off a
vegetarian's-delight package that included homemade cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the locals are friendly to the protesters, though.
One pickup truck sports two bumper stickers. The first says:
``Earth First! We'll log the other planets later.'' The other:
``Hug a logger. You'll never go back to trees.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vekasi continues her descent, Rachel Goeke points to the four
trees supporting the 8-by-8-foot platform where Ream is standing
and calling out directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four trees. And they have names,'' Goeke says.
</P>
<P>
   Above, Ream shouts, ``Now, kind of pull the rope off your butt a
little. ...''
</P>
<P>
   On the forest floor below, Goeke points to a Douglas fir about
10 feet in diameter, the one Vekasi is descending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big one is called Meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   She motions toward the other three, all Western hemlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one the rope is hanging from is called Union. The one on
the far left corner is Sunrise. And the last one is
Confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Confrontation was so named, she explains, because on the day the
group was searching for a name, a surveyor from the timber company
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The tree-sitters and their supporters in the base camp emphasize
that they are non-violent.
</P>
<P>
   A code of conduct is posted near the Volkswagen van that marks
the base camp just off Forest Service Road 75:
</P>
<P>
   ``No monkeywrenching, tree-spiking or destruction of personal
property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect ALL life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No drugs/possession or use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O alcohol/drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Use consensus decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep camp clean and stay on trails whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintain non-violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Support local communities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are NO leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few in the group actually sit up in the trees at one
time. In addition to the 8-by-8 platform suspended between the four
trees _ the sitters call it ``Nuthatch'' _ another platform nearby
is built doughnut-like around a single tree. Called ``Homestead,''
it's considerably larger, perhaps 120 square feet compared to the
64 where Ream stands directing Vekasi.
</P>
<P>
   At the base camp, members of the group who are not tree-sitting
cook food on a gas stove under a tarp. They sleep in tents in the
woods that surround the encampment.
</P>
<P>
   Water, food and other supplies are hauled up by the tree-sitters
in buckets attached to ropes. Waste and what little garbage they
generate comes down the same way.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Ream is on the platform with a young man who
identifies himself initially as ``Stone Cascadian Obsidian.'' A
woman at the base camp identifies herself only as ``Moonstone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ream says members of the group sometimes use assumed names
because ``they want to avoid the kind of intimidation they might
experience from the police.'' Ream himself is suing a Humboldt
County deputy for rough treatment, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, adds Obsidian, ``some of us do have jobs.'' It turns
out his is as a bookkeeper in Olympia. He's 21. And, he eventually
says, his real name is Will Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Those with jobs carve out time to make the three-hour drive from
Seattle or the two-hour trek from Olympia to bring supplies and
moral support.
</P>
<P>
   The tree-sitters and their Randle supporters see their enemies
in this battle as an unholy alliance: wealthy, Seattle-area
environmentalists, the U.S. Forest Service and the Plum Creek
Timber Co., which owns 3.3 million acres of timber in six states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world are a bunch of rich boys in Seattle going to
get their mountain and their lake at the expense of yours?''
consulting forester Roy Keene, who is working with the
tree-sitters, told Randle residents at the protest meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The tree-sitters and their allies find themselves opposing
old-line Washington environmentalists, including Charlie Raines,
who has worked for years to secure government ownership of lands in
the Central Cascades east of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of high alpine country,'' concedes Raines,
whose beard is flecked with gray, ``but also there are forest,
roadless lands and rivers that have salmon in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The lands the government wants were granted in the 1800s to Plum
Creek's forerunner, the Burlington Northern Railroad, to spur
settlement. The railroad got every other square mile, and the
government kept every other square mile, creating a unwieldy
checkerboard pattern of land ownership. The idea was for the
railroad to sell or give the land to settlers, but Northern Pacific
ended up keeping much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Plum Creek is threatening to log those lands. That would
leave the natural landscape in tatters along the Interstate 90
corridor east of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Government biologists say heading off logging of that land is
crucial to the continued existence of a number of endangered
species. The landscape there already is a mishmash of man-made
intrusions, including I-90, ski lodges and clearcuts.
</P>
<P>
   By preserving as much forest as possible in a natural state, the
real estate swap would make it more likely that populations of
animals from the northern Cascade Mountains will be able to hook up
with others of their species to the south. That would keep their
genetic stock healthier, prevent inbreeding and help improve their
chances for long-term survival, government biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold these timber companies at bay, we've had to sue them.
We've had Plum Creek in court,'' said Len Gardner of the Alpine
Lakes Protection Society, which was formed in 1968 to help protect
the wilderness of the central Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, Raines and their allies lobbied the government and Plum
Creek to leave Watch Mountain, where the tree-sitters have set up
camp, out of the land swap. But ultimately, it was included anyway,
along with several other patches of land that environmentalists
would rather save from the chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, environmentalists supporting the deal say it's the best one
they can get. And the alternative is logging the alpine country, a
point they say the tree-sitters seem to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're missing the big picture,'' Garnder said.
``These are well-intentioned people who don't want to see trees
cut. But there is an exchange there, and something is being gained.
I think they probably don't realize what the gain is.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the tree-sit, Goeke says the Alpine Lakes land ``is
wonderful wilderness. It's just that the Gifford Pinchot (National
Forest, including Watch Mountain) is being used as a sacrifice, and
that's not acceptable. They were counting on these small towns not
being able to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   The tree-sitters maintain they are not anti-logging. Vekasi, in
fact, says she grew up in a Montana logging town and feels an
affinity with the people of Randle. She wants to see an end to the
practice of shipping local timber overseas, and put a stop to the
closure of small local mills.
</P>
<P>
   What she's against is Big Timber. Not against timbering, she
says. ``I live in a wood house,'' Vekasi says.``I use paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Vekasi's descent continues, and 20 gut-wrenching minutes later
she is finally on the forest floor unhooking her harness.

THE BLOBIFICATION OF MODERN DESIGN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novelist  &UR; Tom Wolfe &LR; , who between novels wrote books critical of
modern painting and architecture, considers the state of design and
bangs his walking stick on the floor in the latest issue of Men's
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Citing such titans of design as  &UR; Raymond Loewy &LR;  (whose credits
include the Studebaker and Postal Service eagle) and  &UR; Harley Earl &LR; 
(General Motors cars), Wolfe complains about today's designers of
`` `blobjets,' roundish, childish blob-like objects that now come
in every form from the iMac computer to the Mazda Miata, the Ford
Taurus and the reborn Volkswagen Beetle. These objects are not
meant to be exuberant, much less elegant. The key adjective is
childish.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe names names. ``The art world's idea of a great designer is
the Frenchman  &UR; Philippe Starck &LR; ,'' whose interiors, says Wolfe,
look like backdrops for male models, ``the ones with the eight-day
growth of beard, the hangdog slouch and the glum look of a
recovering codeine addict who just flunked out of his 12-step
program. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In a worshipful piece, the New York Times named him one of the
giants of 20th century design and said his work `revolves around
fear of rejection.' Marvelous.''

   &UR; ANSEL ADAMS FIND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ten  &UR; Ansel Adams &LR;  photos of San Francisco's then-new Grace
Cathedral, taken perhaps in the mid-'40s, have been discovered in
the cathedral basement, where they had been stored _ and forgotten
_ 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Dunn, who's on the cathedral's Art Council, says the
group hopes to display the photos for the congregation's 150th
anniversary, in December.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, however, they're in need of proper museum-quality
framing, which (along with insurance) will cost somewhere between
$3,000 and $5,000. Grace is looking for an Adams angel.

   _ Designer  &UR; Paco Rabanne &LR; , who predicted that the Mir space
station would destroy Paris during last week's eclipse, told the

   _  &UR; Sharon Stone &LR;  told Movieline magazine that she ``didn't
appreciate''  &UR; Gwyneth Paltrow &LR; 's parody of her on ``Saturday Night
Live,'' but she thinks it came out of naivete rather than malicious
intent. ``She's very young,'' said Stone of Paltrow, ``and lives in

</P>
<P>
   &UR; DeAnn Lowell &LR; , founder of Peppermint Pets, explains why an
adjustable cotton collar stuffed with a blend of herbs is a good
idea for both human- and dogwear: ``Our ancestors were very
familiar with the physical and emotional benefits of aromatic
plants and oils. Much of what they learned about aroma therapy,
they picked up by watching animals in nature. ... The fragrance of
our collars promotes an emotionally balanced and calm environment
for pets and people, so we can both be more actualized.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't understand why you would want to be
``actualized,'' the company provides some hard facts you might want
to mention at a dinner party: ``If the densely packed olfactory
membrane in the canine nose was laid out in a single layer, it
would cover an area equal to over 65 percent of the dog's body
size'' (or an eensy weensy portion of the state of New Jersey).
``By comparison, the olfactory membrane in a human nose is about
the size of a postage stamp.''

</P>
<P>
   ``I felt sorry for Jimmy because I think he fell in love with me
a little bit during the film. You know, there's a lot of hugging
that goes on in mob films, and I started to get the impression that
his hugs were lasting a little longer than they need to. ... Then
the poems started. ... Anyway, he's through it and moved on.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If an earthquake had wrecked the Los Angeles Convention Center
last week, there would be no special-effects industry. Summer
blockbusters would have to conjure interesting dialogue. Military
simulation laboratories would be tragically half-staffed, and the
spectacular evolution of video game explosions would stall for at
least 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Because under this gargantuan roof were gathered 45,000
scientists, artists, engineers and designers whose careers are
dedicated to computer graphics _ virtual reality, 3-D modeling and
computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   The Siggraph (Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics)
conference, now in its 26th year, started as a congregation of
programmers who worked for academic research laboratories or the
Defense Department (often both). Back then, the ivory tower and the
Pentagon were the only institutions that financed cutting-edge
computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The eggheads and skunk workers are still in attendance. But over
the last 15 years, their mission has been subsumed by commerce,
particularly by Hollywood, with the computer game industry nipping
at everyone's heels. For better or worse, Jar Jar Binks represents
the current state of the art in computer graphics and animation.
(Our peace dividend runneth over.)
</P>
<P>
   On the Siggraph trade floor, it is not unusual to see tenured
computer scientists ogling technical demonstrations by special
effects studios like Digital Domain, and Industrial Light and
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's a proposal for a $100 million research
effort that would make the Defense Department joint partners with
Paramount,'' said Michael Zyda, a professor at the Naval
Postgraduate College who readily incorporates Doom into his
discussion of networked military simulations.
</P>
<P>
   At a cocktail reception sponsored by Silicon Graphics, a company
that manufactures high-end workstations, you could see the
military-entertainment complex standing in line for nachos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of work for the aerospace industry,'' said Bob
Francis, who runs a 3-D modeling company called Surface
Technologies. ``We worked with the people who did the B-2 bomber.
We also did the elephant in `Tarzan.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Siggraph's emerging-technologies showcase, the Millennium
Motel, a company called Virtual Celebrity Productions brought
Marlene Dietrich back to life as a 3-D talking head, larger than
life on a giant television screen in glorious black and white.
``Want to know what really seh-pa-rates zeh men from zeh boys?''
she asked. A smile played around the corners of her virtual mouth.
``Skill. It's (italics)all(end italics) about skill.''
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, Siggraph has always been a shrine to skill. At the
Electronic Theater, Siggraph's annual film festival, one
eye-popping display featured virtual porcelain so skillfully
crafted that it shattered upon impact with the virtual floor.
</P>
<P>
   In another sequence, a computer-generated cathedral was lined
with giant stone slabs, each one polished to a high sheen that
accurately reflects the surrounding objects. As they fell like
dominoes, subject to perfectly simulated gravity, giant ball
bearings dropped from the ceiling to reflect the whole scene with
spherical distortion as they bounced down the length of the
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   It was an orgy of technical expertise. A thousand PhDs, software
engineers and punk animators burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   In this technological wonderland, one would not expect to find
people who hate computers. But there was a whiff of technophobia at
the show, particularly among the 20-somethings who haven't spent
their whole lives doing basic research.
</P>
<P>
   For this new generation of graphics whiz kids, computer science
isn't the goal. It's just a tool that allows them to get on with
their art. They take the technology for granted. If it's difficult
to use, they get mad at it. And at Siggraph, you could see this
frustration scrawled on white boards under the escalator:
</P>
<P>
   ``Down with polygons!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your supposed 3-D world is no more than shiny silicon
origami!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have something against origami?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Origami is great, but you don't see me modeling trees with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the frontier of computer graphics is not
technological. Moore's law assures us that the chips will get
faster, the resolution will increase; we'll be able to generate
realistic graphics on computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people will use fantastic digital images: academics,
industrial designers, film directors, doctors, military strategists
and game programmers with baggy shorts and blue hair. Those people
use many of the same tools. But they don't share a common culture,
and they don't necessarily speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the real challenge for Siggraph is to integrate
those cultures, so that people who speak different design languages
can learn from one another. That will require good interfaces, and
making good interfaces is harder than making fast chips.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most popular software at Siggraph was an interface
simple enough for a child to use, a 3-D modeling tool called Teddy,
programmed by Takeo Igarashi at the University of Tokyo. In front
of a dumbfounded audience, Igarashi sketched shapes that puffed
into rotund, three-dimensional forms on the screen: a teddy bear, a
fish, a bunny. On a laptop. In seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy is not a modeler for precise, careful design,'' Igarashi
noted. ``It's for creating rough models instantly. This can be used
by nonprofessionals. Or for rapid prototyping. Or as a
communications tool, for a doctor or a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Generating organically shaped 3-D models is easier than drawing
with crayons. Computer graphics has arrived.
</P>

   DIGITAL-PHOTOS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once upon a simpler
time, Henry VIII fell in love when he beheld a portrait in oil of
his betrothed, Anne of Cleves. Alas, when Anne showed up for the
wedding, Henry _ who had never met her _ took one look and
underwent an immediate and total change of heart. Anne was ugly.
Henry was royally ticked off. Anne was sent packing and her
embellished portrait consigned to the royal attic. She was pretty
as a picture, but pictures can lie. Photos do not. Well, they're
not supposed to. A photo supposedly captures an image of what is,
not what might be. But with the coming of the digital age, a sweep
of a computer mouse can turn the objective reality of the camera's
eye into subjective unreality. How do you really know what you're
seeing? (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

THE BLOBIFICATION OF MODERN DESIGN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novelist  &UR; Tom Wolfe &LR; , who between novels wrote books critical of
modern painting and architecture, considers the state of design and
bangs his walking stick on the floor in the latest issue of Men's
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Citing such titans of design as  &UR; Raymond Loewy &LR;  (whose credits
include the Studebaker and Postal Service eagle) and  &UR; Harley Earl &LR; 
(General Motors cars), Wolfe complains about today's designers of
`` `blobjets,' roundish, childish blob-like objects that now come
in every form from the iMac computer to the Mazda Miata, the Ford
Taurus and the reborn Volkswagen Beetle. These objects are not
meant to be exuberant, much less elegant. The key adjective is
childish.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe names names. ``The art world's idea of a great designer is
the Frenchman  &UR; Philippe Starck &LR; ,'' whose interiors, says Wolfe,
look like backdrops for male models, ``the ones with the eight-day
growth of beard, the hangdog slouch and the glum look of a
recovering codeine addict who just flunked out of his 12-step
program. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In a worshipful piece, the New York Times named him one of the
giants of 20th century design and said his work `revolves around
fear of rejection.' Marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSEL ADAMS FIND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ten  &UR; Ansel Adams &LR;  photos of San Francisco's then-new Grace
Cathedral, taken perhaps in the mid-'40s, have been discovered in
the cathedral basement, where they had been stored _ and forgotten
_ 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Dunn, who's on the cathedral's Art Council, says the
group hopes to display the photos for the congregation's 150th
anniversary, in December.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, however, they're in need of proper museum-quality
framing, which (along with insurance) will cost somewhere between
$3,000 and $5,000. Grace is looking for an Adams angel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Designer  &UR; Paco Rabanne &LR; , who predicted that the Mir space
station would destroy Paris during last week's eclipse, told the
Times of London, ``I am sorry. But I am still convinced that Paris
will be hit by a dramatic happening.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Sharon Stone &LR;  told Movieline magazine that she ``didn't

rarefied air that's a little thin. It's like she's not getting

eventually spend her fame valuably.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women in the generation before me cut the path for women
like me to walk freely in the world. The women in this next
generation don't really know what that cost. So they don't respect
it.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Robert Duvall &LR;  will direct and star in ``Assassination
Tango,'' which W describes as a movie about ``a dashing hit man who
gets hooked on tango while in Argentina on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   _ KKSF music director  &UR; Blake Lawrence &LR;  is hiding under his desk,
having received word, from GTSO Records, that  &UR; John Tesh &LR; 's version
of  &UR; Ricky Martin &LR; 's ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' is coming.

plants and oils. Much of what they learned about aroma therapy,
they picked up by watching animals in nature. ... The fragrance of
our collars promotes an emotionally balanced and calm environment
for pets and people, so we can both be more actualized.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It was four years ago that Frank Galati was named
director of ``A View From the Bridge,'' an adaptation of Arthur
Miller's 1955 play that will have its world premiere at Lyric Opera
of Chicago on Oct. 9. He will not meet the cast, however, until
rehearsals begin in September.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the most obvious indication of the delicate role
played by an opera director, who is responsible for the production
as a whole but lacks the supreme control of a theater director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't cast this, except to be a kind of counselor, which
has always been my role in opera,'' Galati said of the work, which
was created by the composer William Bolcom and the librettist
Arnold Weinstein. Galati is in Toronto to begin work on a musical
based on the children's books of Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   The casting of ``View'' was left to the Lyric creative staff,
which chose Kim Josephson as Eddie Carbone, the Brooklyn stevedore
brought to a tragic end by his desire for his 17-year-old niece;
Catherine Malfitano as his wife, Beatrice; Juliana Rambaldi as
Catherine, the niece, and Gregory Turay as Rodolpho, the Italian
immigrant who steals Catherine's affections and moves Eddie to the
betrayal that brings about his demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an opera, the vocal demands are so immense; I can't make
that decision,'' Galati said. ``That's a huge difference, because
in a play _ a musical, too _ I'm the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of directors, highly knowledgeable about
music, who specialize in opera _ Colin Graham and Francesca
Zambello, to name two of the best-known. But convention has it that
even they yield the casting duties to the producing company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Directors tend to be most passionate about the theater part of
the opera,'' said Samuel Smith, the spokesman for Opera America, an
umbrella group for professional companies. And, in fact, the opera
stage has long been a venue for interlopers from the theater and
even the movies. Lyric's production of Bolcom's 1992 opera,
``McTeague,'' was directed by Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though he has significant experience in opera, Galati's
renown is as a director of plays and musicals. A fixture at both
the Steppenwolf Theater and the Goodman Theater in Chicago, he won
a Tony Award for directing his own adaptation of ``The Grapes of
Wrath'' in 1990 and is perhaps best known for his first musical,
the Broadway hit ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A View From the Bridge'' is a first as well, of course, a
well-known drama receiving brand-new treatment as an opera. That
complicates Galati's task further, or at least puts more pressure
on him. Lyric is spending $1.4 million on the production, which,
like all new American operas, faces desperate odds if it is to
enter the repertory. Of 125 world premieres at American opera
companies in this decade, only about a dozen have had second
productions, and though operas tend to stand or fall on the
strength of their scores, ``View'' will not stand any chance of
surviving if Galati's staging is lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way it's liberating,'' said Galati, choosing not to focus
on the future of the work before it actually exists. ``Because it's
a new work, I have a certain freedom to explore the stagecraft and
the storytelling conventions. If you do a `Tosca' or a `Traviata'
or even `Pelleas et Melisande' '' _ all of which Galati has staged
for Lyric _ ``there are these huge expectations about something
everybody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   As a straddler of forms, 55-year-old Galati seems almost curious
himself about their separate concerns. A bearish man with a kindly
manner _ think of Santa Claus with a buzz cut _ he is a versatile
theater personage, a former actor and a writer whose adaptation
(with Lawrence Kasdan) of Anne Tyler's novel ``The Accidental
Tourist'' was nominated for an Academy Award. He has also written a
screen version of Miller's ``American Clock.''
</P>
<P>
   In his directorial work Galati is attracted to the big casts and
grand gestures of pageantry, ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and
``Ragtime'' being prime examples. It is a predilection, he said,
born of his work at Lyric, and before that, the Chicago Opera
Theater. Asked about the difference between directing theater and
opera, Galati said with a shrug, ``They sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a musical, he said, the voices do not become the
controlling elements they do in opera. ``I'm not being frivolous
when I say `they sing,''' he said. ``As a director of plays, one of
the things you have to find in a play is the music. You have to
find its rhythm, its tempo. On a technical level, you could say
that in directing plays, finding the musicality is an imperative.
In an opera, the momentum is implicit in the musical score. It's up
to the composer and the conductor to move the scene. It's not my
department.''

 TORONTO: my department.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The difference begins with casting, which in opera is
particularly complex and risky. Most projects, after all, are cast
years in advance and, as Matthew Epstein, Lyric's artistic
director, said, `` X, who is the greatest singer in the world
today, may have no voice in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Also to be considered are the preferences of the director.
``Frank needs ensemble actors,'' Epstein said. ``That's what he
comes out of, ensemble theater, and it's what opera should be
about, but isn't always. Frank would not work well in a situation
with a superstar. And in this case, even a big name like Catherine
Malfitano, she's someone who prefers to work in an ensemble
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Galati's wishes had to do with the physical presence of the
singers, a particular concern in a new work where verisimilitude is
a powerful tool with which to woo the audience. In a classical
opera, where the audience arrives more accepting of the fact that
the conventions of storytelling will be bent to serve music, that
is less of an issue. ``So Desdemona is fat, so what?'' Galati said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``View,'' the story revolves around the discomfiting animal
urge _ Eddie's lust for Catherine _ of a largely inarticulate
laborer. Josephson, a burly linebacker type, was the last principal
to be cast; a German baritone had originally been cast but asked a
year ago to be replaced, fearing he would not be able to sing
persuasively in Brooklynese, or even in English. In replacing him,
Galati argued against some other, less physically robust
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even an acting thing,'' Galati said. ``Eddie Carbone
is a stevedore. So I said, `Look, I know you've got to have someone
with the vocal chops, but you got to have a guy.' In fact, you
can't do the drama unless you have the guy and the gal. She's got
to be a babe, someone who makes a man who is otherwise grounded in
a marriage, a relationship that's real and sanctioned, cross the
border. They've got to be convincing in their physical presence if
they're going to satisfy the audience's totally understandable
demand for convincing representation of psychological reality.''
</P>
<P>
   (An interesting dilemma has just arisen. Ms. Rambaldi, a married
woman in her 30's who is to play the teen-age virgin Catherine, has
announced that she is pregnant.)
</P>
<P>
   As a director of performers who are singers before they are
actors, Galati said that he compared singers to Shakespeareans, and
that his experience had been that they are pleased to work with a
director who can help them do what they do second best. In turn,
they educate him; frequently, he said, he has made unrealistic
demands, like asking a singer to perform a difficult passage while
being lifted or lying down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work on Shakespeare, these characters, their
necessity, is verse,'' he said. ``That's the way they live, in
utterance and expressiveness. The same is true in opera; in a great
opera, the source of the music is inside the character, so the
character is the agent of this mode of expressiveness. You could
say, after all, that speech aspires to song.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera will be played on a single set, and Galati had long
discussions with the designer, Santo Loquasto, and the projection
artist, Wendall K. Harrington, about his needs, which include a
number of places for the chorus to enter and exit and to witness
the playing out of the domestic drama. In Galati's vision, the
chorus represents Eddie's neighbors in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a
tightly knit community with a common set of values and a unified
dread of the taboo Eddie is threatening to violate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my baby thinking about this, I imagine the chorus will have
a strange, surreal role in underscoring the privacy of the drama as
well as its public impact,'' Galati said.
</P>
<P>
   On the set, which is being built at the San Diego Opera scene
shop, the interior of the Carbone apartment is toward the left of
the stage, flanked by the shipyard exteriors of Red Hook. There are
several walkways suggesting the gridwork of the Brooklyn Bridge,
and in the rear, at the right, is an industrial-size garage door
suggesting the entrance to a warehouse. One of Ms. Harrington's
three projection screens forms the angled roof of an apartment; the
others will be in the rear of the stage. The images to be projected
will also underscore the private-as-public theme: blowups of
domestic images like sinks and shaving mirrors and stoves with
pasta pots in counterpoint to local exteriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garage door that slides up _ it's a huge aperture, very,
very powerful,'' Galati said. ``It can be backlit, a floodlight on
figures standing in that doorway, and in thinking about the
behavior of the chorus, I had this image: the garage door opens and
there are all the women in the chorus, standing in slips and bare
feet, and they're all brushing their hair. It's a collective
representation, in large scale, of a moment of intimacy between
husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Loquasto said that the strength of the set was that it would be
as suitable for the play as for the opera, and Galati agreed, with
a caveat: the set is in scale with the Civic Opera House, a
3,600-seat auditorium, and the grandeur of opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestral force and choral force, and the dissonances and
harmonies that Bolcom is combining in his score, this is a giant
pouring forth of musical information,'' Galati said. ``The house
invites it, and the staging has to accommodate it. The story has to
reach to the rafters, and they go way up there. Santo's set, in
terms of its geometry, is suited to the play, but in terms of the
scale and the gestures it will allow, it is suited brilliantly to
the scale of the event of an opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings Galati back to his theme: they sing. ``I do think
that part of the operatic mystery is virtuosity itself,'' he said.
The distinguishing ingredient in opera ``is sort of like the
ingredient present when you go to the circus,'' he continued. ``You
have a singer, in the way you have a tightrope walker, high above
the audience, stepping on a wire that is so thin in order to sing
those achingly pure and beautiful melodies, pianissimo. It's the
kind of virtuosity you see in those who test themselves to the
absolute limit. What if they fall? What if the pianissimo cracks?
You live in fear in the audience, just as the singer does. It's the
most difficult test the human voice can endure, and it is happening
in front of us. Now.''
</P>
<P>
   For the director, ``the profound question,'' he said, is how
much to serve the singer, how much to push. ``My impulse is always
to make it harder,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a fund-raising event, James Houghton, the founder
and artistic director of the Signature Theater Company, asked Peter
Norton, a wealthy California art collector and philanthropist, for
``a modest contribution.'' Norton is a man of impulse known for
grand gestures: recently he bought J.D. Salinger's letters to Joyce
Maynard at auction at Sotheby's (for $156,500) to return them to
the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be an immodest contribution?'' he asked Houghton.
The two agreed that nothing would be more immodest than pledging
enough money, in Norton's words, ``to have one's name slapped on
the theater's building.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Houghton announced that Norton was giving the
Signature $600,000, almost half the theater's annual budget. As a
result, the theater will be named the Signature Theater Company at
the Peter Norton Space. A ceremony to that effect is planned for
Sept. 13, at the start of the Signature season, which will be
dedicated to the plays of Maria Irene Fornes.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the stage one day this week as workers began moving
in scenery for the first Fornes production, Norton and Houghton
talked about their collaboration, what it meant for the company and
how it fit in with Norton's other philanthropic activities.
</P>
<P>
   Norton generally gives cultural grants to the visual arts. As a
collector specializing in ``cutting-edge contemporary art,'' he has
often supported young artists and he regards the Signature as an
extension of that activity.
</P>
<P>
   Although Norton is by his own admission a neophyte in theater,
for several years he has admired the Signature's work. ``If an
ordinary small theater company is a sundial,'' he said, ``this is a
Swiss watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Houghton said, ``This is a small company with a big
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on a single playwright for an entire season, the
theater can show the arc of a writer's career and illuminate a
lesser-known side of a body of work. The Signature began in 1991
with a series of plays by Romulus Linney and has since given a
stage to, among others, Edward Albee, Horton Foote (who won a
Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for ``The Young Man From Atlanta,'' first
presented during his Signature season), Sam Shepard, Arthur Miller
and, last year, John Guare.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the writers has been actively involved in the season.
``The playwrights are in the mix every step of the way,'' Houghton
said. ``When they feel they are embraced, all the defensive walls
go down and the real collaboration begins to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater has grown from a nomadic off-off-Broadway company to
an influential organization with a modern permanent home at 555 W.
42nd St. The first season cost $35,000. Gradually the budget has
grown to $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Houghton has made his own reputation as a
producer and director. He is also artistic adviser to the Guthrie
Theater in Minneapolis and he has succeeded Lloyd Richards as the
artistic director of the National Playwrights Conference at the
Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he hopes to have a synergy between the O'Neill,
which does readings of new plays in the summer, and the Signature.
With the help of Norton's grant, Houghton plans to increase his
program for young writers in residence. The grant is unrestricted
and may also be used to ease the company's cash flow problems, to
attract other donors and for the 10th-anniversary season, in which
there will be a festival of new works by house playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a big institution, ponderous wheels roll,'' Norton said.
``Write the same check to the Met and it wouldn't even be noticed.
Here you can turn on a dime. You have flexibility, and the bang for
the buck is enormous.'' While Norton joked about wanting his name
prominently on the marquee, he and Houghton made it clear that
Norton's signature on the company would be minimal. Such restraint
is in keeping with his profile to date.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, who said his background was ``as a nerd,'' made his
fortune with a microcomputer software business. In 1990 he sold it
to devote himself to art collecting and philanthropy. He said he
expected other computer entrepreneurs to follow his path: ``You've
got to remember that high-tech money is new money and philanthropic
money is generally old money. High-tech fortunes haven't been
around long enough. Let those people become elderly, in the endgame
strategies of their lives, and they'll start doing what Carnegie,
Rockefeller and Mellon did in their old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton, 56, said he is a bit of an anomaly: ``When I was first
threatened with prosperity, I started studying the natural history
of American wealth. It's basically a curve. You make it, you use it
and you throw it away. That's called shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves
in three generations. Usually the generation that makes money
doesn't know how to use it, and having made some money I wanted to
have the fun of using it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives? ``You can use money to make more money. That's
essentially Donald Trump's story,'' he said. ``You can use it to
empower public service careers. That's essentially the Kennedy and
half the Rockefeller story. You can use it for freedom _ being a
playboy. You can use it for philanthropy. I was too much of a bozo
to go into business again, I didn't have political ambitions, and
loose cars and fast women didn't suit me.'' That left philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, with his wife, Eileen, he established the Peter Norton
Family Foundation, which in 10 years has made grants of more than
$15 million in the fine arts, including $1.2 million to museum
curators to buy works for permanent collections. Among the
recipients are the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Museum of Modern Art and the
Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan. The Whitney has a
floor named after Norton. He has also given more than $4.6 million
in social service grants for programs benefiting women and
children.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortons live in Santa Monica, Calif., and have two
apartments in Manhattan (one designed by Maya Lin), with room
enough to display a substantial part of their art collection.
``It's an evangelical mission,'' he said, ``trying to seduce
conservative art patrons to be more interested in what the
youngsters are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about his philanthropy as well as his collecting, he
said, ``I'm a dabbler by nature, a dilettante.'' He added, ``I
don't want to toot a big horn, but broadly speaking I like to
support innovation where it seems to be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   About the Signature Theater, he said, ``Here's innovation, an
ecological niche being discovered, almost invented. This is a
theater that's about celebrating and nurturing writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Salinger letters (written 27 years ago to Ms.
Maynard), he said, ``Those letters were up for auction and a lot of
people felt strongly that it was a bad thing and that they ought to
go back to him. I didn't feel strongly that way.'' But when he
heard that a group of people were putting together a consortium to
buy them, he said, ``Don't bother,'' and he bid for them.
</P>
<P>
   He said that once he bought them, he did not read them: ``From
all reports, the letters were really boring.'' Then he mailed them
to Salinger's agent _ and has never heard a word from the author.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his highly individualistic behavior as a benefactor
in the arts, he said, ``What's the social utility of the rich? It's
to do the things that otherwise can't be done.''

GOV. KEATING SAYS BUSH SHOULD DISCLOSE ANY PAST INDISCRETIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With questions about possible drug use continuing
to dog leading Republican presidential contender Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, a prominent Republican fellow governor on Wednesday
urged Bush to get any past misdeeds out in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush should address issues about private conduct,''
Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma told reporters. ``In today's world,
every one of us who serves in public office needs to answer
questions about conduct that is arguably criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating, chairman of the Republican Governors Association and an
enthusiastic Bush supporter, stressed that he ``doesn't think
there's anything there'' in Bush's background. Keating added that
whatever misdeeds Bush may have committed ``were largely carousing
in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have tremendous admiration for Bush, but I think
these kinds of questions are legitimate,'' Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   Keating spoke out just as Bush reacted testily to more questions
about whether he had used illegal drugs in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush branded rumors about his personal life ``ridiculous and
absurd,'' and repeated his view that fishing for dirt in
politicians' past lives is tantamount to a sport. ``That's the game
in American politics, and I refuse to play it,'' Bush told
reporters in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, have frequently used
this line of reasoning to sidestep direct answers to questions
about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, asked whether he believes Bush should put the matter to
rest by admitting whatever it is he did, responded: ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Answers to such questions ``are not disabling, but they're
certainly relevant to candidacies,'' Keating said. ``The public is
very forgiving ... especially of youthful indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating is head of the organization representing 31 Republican
governors, including Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 22 Republican governors have endorsed Bush, making
them a key constituency in Bush's early rise to the top of the GOP
pack chasing the party's 2000 presidential nomination.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With questions about possible drug use continuing
to dog leading Republican presidential contender Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, a prominent Republican fellow governor on Wednesday
urged Bush to get any past misdeeds out in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush should address issues about private conduct,''
Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma told reporters. ``In today's world,
every one of us who serves in public office needs to answer
questions about conduct that is arguably criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating, chairman of the Republican Governors Association and an
enthusiastic Bush supporter, stressed that he ``doesn't think
there's anything there'' in Bush's background. Keating added that
whatever misdeeds Bush may have committed ``were largely carousing
in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have tremendous admiration for Bush, but I think
these kinds of questions are legitimate,'' Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   Keating spoke out just as Bush reacted testily to more questions
about whether he had used illegal drugs in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush branded rumors about his personal life ``ridiculous and
absurd,'' and repeated his view that fishing for dirt in
politicians' past lives is tantamount to a sport. ``That's the game
in American politics, and I refuse to play it,'' Bush told
reporters in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, have frequently used
this line of reasoning to sidestep direct answers to questions
about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, asked whether he believes Bush should put the matter to
rest by admitting whatever it is he did, responded: ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Answers to such questions ``are not disabling, but they're
certainly relevant to candidacies,'' Keating said. ``The public is
very forgiving ... especially of youthful indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating is head of the organization representing 31 Republican
governors, including Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 22 Republican governors have endorsed Bush, making
them a key constituency in Bush's early rise to the top of the GOP
pack chasing the party's 2000 presidential nomination.

 &HT;    3,700 flutists from around the world blow into Atlanta
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a big day in River City, Iowa, when 76
trombones caught the morning sun.
</P>
<P>
   But that's peanuts compared with the 3,700 flutes coming to
Atlanta for this weekend's annual convention of the National Flute
Association. That's 8,170 feet of shining silver.
</P>
<P>
   How many flutists, and what they are to do and play and hear,
have preoccupied Amy Porter, associate principal flute of the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, for 18 months, ever since she was named
program chair for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   It's been up to her to find the speakers and performers, design
the brochure and coordinate the logistics for this immense
undertaking. The 7,000-member NFA is the largest association of its
kind in the world, Porter says, and more than half its people will
be under the roof of the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers today through
Sunday. They're coming from as far away as Venezuela, Belgium and
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The convention offers lectures and workshops, master classes,
flute choir reading sessions and every kind of performance, from
serene Indian music to hot fusion jazz. Exhibitors and vendors will
offer all manner of flute paraphernalia, from $15,000
professional-quality instruments in gold (by the premier American
maker Gemeinhardt in Elkhart, Ind.) to flute note pads, tote bags
and sheet music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the best feelings about featuring my local
colleagues,'' says Porter. Among the conference participants will
be ASO principal flute Christina Smith and ASO piccolo Carl Hall,
who will perform the premiere of a concerto written for him by
Martin Amlin in Saturday evening's concert. Members of the Marietta
Flute Choir, the Atlanta Area Honors Flute Choir, Atlanta Music
Academy and Hotlanta are serving as ushers, gofers and helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Headline acts include the percussion ensemble Nexus and Swiss
contrabass flute Matthias Ziegler, who perform Friday, and Jim
Walker and his jazz ensemble Free Flight, whose gala concert closes
the conference Sunday. Jazz flutist Normal Rangell is to perform,
and so are William Bennett of the English Chamber Orchestra, Joshua
Smith of the Cleveland Orchestra and Irish flutist Brian Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   National Flute Association
</P>
<P>
   8 a.m.-11 p.m. today-Sunday. Day/concert passes for the general
public are $10 if purchased before 6 p.m. and $15 after. Exhibition
passes are $15. Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers, 255 Courtland St. N.E.
Information: 661-299-6680.

 &HT;    FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WHO CRASH AND BURN, DEFEAT IS
FLEETING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The winners of presidential elections ultimately
belong to the ages, but the losers belong to the families, close
friends and staunch supporters who share the agony of their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the losers set off on their next political quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it enters the bloodstream, the disease of running for
president can only be cured by embalming fluid,'' the late Mo
Udall, defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 Democratic primaries,
once quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who crash and burn en route to the White House,
like Lamar Alexander and John Kasich did in the Republican contest
this summer, eventually return to the political battlefield in some
capacity _ but rarely with the same bloodlust for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who outspent his opponents in GOP
primary elections four years ago, but managed only a handful of
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke, and it turned out no one was listening,'' said Gramm,
resorting to the self-deprecating humor that is typical of those
who have failed in their bids for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Or like John Glenn, the astronaut-turned-senator who seemed to
have the right stuff 15 years ago but whose candidacy fizzled on
the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has rarely spoken of his disastrous campaign for president
in 1984. But he spoke about the stigma of defeat with The
Washington Post three years ago: ``You wonder whether people are
going to look down their noses at you and say, 'Boy, is he a
dumbbell for trying to run for president! What made him think he
could do that?' But when I came back to the Senate, I threw myself
into my committee work, and nobody thought I was any less capable
because I tried for a higher office.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of them, though, regardless of how many times they fail
in politics, losing the presidency is a painful, gut-wrenching
experience, as two-time Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson captured
so accurately in an often-borrowed lament of losers: ``I'm too old
to cry, but it hurts too much to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of effort you have to put into one of these campaigns
is so substantial and costly in terms of money and emotion that you
couldn't be human and not be pained by losing,'' said noted
presidential historian Robert Dallek. ``These are real-life
aspirations of human beings that we watch die on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, author Richard Ben Cramer, in his book ``What It Takes''
about the 1988 campaign, captured a rarely seen moment of human
frailty in presidential politics: two-time presidential loser Jesse
Jackson gathering Dick Gephardt into a bear hug on the night of the
Michigan primary as Gephardt, realizing his dream had ended, wept
``on the breast of the only man in that room who could really
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the end was coming, but it was still so depressing,''
said former Gephardt aide Linda Moore, now the deputy director of
political affairs in the Clinton White House. ``You work so hard
for so long and it ends so suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   So suddenly, in fact, that Gephardt and his wife Jane, after his
official withdrawal from the race, had to leave a campaign staff
party to get home before his Secret Service protection expired that
evening at midnight. ``He turned into a pumpkin,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it deflates you is a massive understatement,'' former
Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker once said of his unsuccessful 1980
campaign for the GOP nomination. He compared it to the death of his
wife. ``You feel just drained ... you feel empty.''
</P>
<P>
   And often, in the bone-tiring whirl of modern presidential
campaigns, the candidates are the last to know when they have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, writing in 1988 about coming up
short in the 1980 GOP contest, confessed that it took longtime
confidante Jim Baker to silence his vows to carry on the campaign
against Ronald Reagan, the ultimate winner. ``The campaign is
finished, George,'' Baker informed him.
</P>
<P>
   Some never get that far.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Babbitt, always popular with reporters, was one of the
early casualties of the 1988 Democratic contest, dropping out
before some news organizations had even published profiles of the
former Arizona governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press won't have Bruce Babbitt to puff up anymore,'' he
declared in a tone of mock vengefulness on the day that he dropped
out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bush, Babbitt, Howard Baker and Gephardt, like so
many others who have sought the presidency, eventually bounced
back. Bush was elected president in 1988. Babbitt has been
secretary of the interior since 1993. Baker became the Senate
Majority Leader, then White House chief of staff for Reagan. And
Gephardt is the Democratic Leader in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Similary, Glenn became an elder statesman in the Senate and
eventually made a triumphant return to space. And Gramm got his
first committee chairmanship in the Senate, a position of influence
that exceeds the power of any post he held while pursing the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But some never lose the urge. Bob Dole, who lost in 1996, 1988
and 1980, is ``looking for opportunities'' to get out on the
campaign trail again, for his wife Elizabeth Dole, according to
Linda Duvall, Dole's pollster in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many individuals get a chance to be in a position to run
for president of the United States,'' said Duvall, who worked for
Gramm in 1996. ``So you would hope that there's no recriminations,
that there's no sense of bitterness. They should be proud that they
got to the point of where they could run for president. I hope
that's what they're left with.''

 &HT;    BellSouth answers call for payment services on Net
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. joined the growing ranks of companies
offering Internet billing, announcing Wednesday a new Web site that
allows consumers to receive and pay their bills online.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, available via the company's Web site
(www.bellsouth.com/bill), lets residential customers pay BellSouth
bills with credit cards or an automatic withdrawal from a checking
account. Customers may also pay through their banks or an
electronic bill provider like Atlanta-based CheckFree, options
which have been available for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Customers may choose to stop getting paper bills sent by mail,
although they will receive an e-mail notice about bills they have
not yet looked at. When they are online, customers with questions
about their bills can click on that portion of the bill and receive
an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always looking for better ways for customers to do
business with us, and we can provide better customers service by
doing business over the Net,'' said Brad Hahn, senior manager for
electronic commerce at BellSouth Consumer Services.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 21 million households online nationally, the idea
is catching on, at least partly because companies see it as a low
cost way to offer round-the-clock billing services that eliminate
paper and mailing charges. Customers are likely to be attracted by
the ability to pay bills any time, but also to bundle many bills
together for payment.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth believes about 5 percent of customers in its
nine-state region _ about 700,000 households _ are interested in
using the Net to pay phone bills. According to the Yankee Group,
nearly 80 percent of customers who want to pay online would choose
to use a central site, while 20 percent would prefer to use
individual Web sites. Of those who would choose a central site, 84
percent say they want to use their bank's site.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has offered a similar online option to residents
since March, according to spokeswoman Teresa Byrne. ``We are very,
very interested in e-billing.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also lets customers pay online, and offers the option of
clicking on an unfamiliar telephone number to find out whose
listing was called, said AT&AMP;T spokesman Andy Boisseau. ``This gives
them the opportunity to interact with bills in ways they could not
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Both BellSouth and MCI WorldCom say they also plan a
click-to-identify feature.
</P>
<P>
   Laurinda Wilson, spokeswoman for CheckFree, said the company has
agreements to handle bill paying with BellSouth, MCI WorldCom, AT&AMP;T
and GTE. CheckFree has about 13,000 Net users paying bills online,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at Jupiter Communications estimate that 16 million U.S.
households now use the Net for paying bills, checking account
balances and making stock trades. That figure will grow to 27
million within three years, says Jupiter.

THE MEDIA ARE THE MISCHIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading the newspaper the other night, my vigilant parental eye
spotted this headline: Doctors urge limiting TV time for kids.
Apparently those doctors in the American Academy of Pediatrics have
issued yet another recommendation on parenting. Frankly, as I
skimmed through the story, this one made me a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of intense study on the matter (which
may at least partially explain why I can't get a doctor[ human] on
the phone when I call my pediatrician's office), the herd of
healers has[ have] arrived at the landmark ruling that watching TV
isn't really very good for kiddos. It seems the 55,000 members of
the academy have agreed that too much media influence _ especially
television, but also including movies, video games, computer games,
music videos, radio, the Internet and books _ can lead to a scourge
of societal ills that will leave us with chain-smoking, Uzi-toting
tots with a tendency to lay into the ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on the number of fat, mean babies we're producing in
this country, the good doctors' new policy statement includes the
simple recommendation that pediatricians request, along with a
medical history of their little patients, a complete media history
on each and every child.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Now, usually I find the AAP a helpful source for my many
parenting concerns. When I have a burning question on acellular
pertussis vaccine, I turn to them for an update. And who else would
take the time to answer my long list of queries about ultraviolet
light?
</P>
<P>
   And, in truth, I could see that the AAP had some valid points.
After all, at the very minute I was reading about the policy
statement, my own two kids were strewn about on couches, chomping
chips and riveted to the 32nd showing of ``The Parent Trap''in our
own living room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of a media history made me sweat, for two
reasons: First, it means there will be something else to record and
remember about my children. Obviously those well-meaning
pediatricians have no idea that I have been unable to perform even
the simplest tasks in this respect. The binders that hold my kids'
yearly physical exam reports are covered with a thick film of dust.
The photo albums are half-empty relics on the bookshelves. A good
detective, inspecting my home, might assume its young inhabitants
had disappeared sometime around 1996. And it gets worse: I couldn't
tell you if my kids are current on their tetanus shots, or when
they last went to the dentist. I had to make up a poem to remember
my second child's birth date. (You won't forget it anymore,
Hadley's birthday is Sept. 24).
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge to my overcrowded mind is a minor concern
compared with the pain and humiliation of actually facing the
checklist when a receptionist hands it over on a clipboard in the
waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I see shaking out as I fill it in.
</P>
<P>
   Media History Survey of Your Child
</P>
<P>
   1. Does your child have a history of interacting with any of the
following? (check all that apply)
</P>
<P>
   Television? The VCR? Pokemon shows, the Red and Blue games, or
the PokeRap? Playstation _ or N64?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm. This is easy so far. Check. Check. Check, check, check.
And double check. And don't forget the Pokemon Web site while we're
at it. And the Pokemon Snap and Pokemon Stadium. And that new
yellow game, too, or is that something different?''
</P>
<P>
   2. Do you use television as a crutch or a bribe, offering it,
for example, as an incentive for getting up in the morning?
</P>
<P>
   ``Check _ but do you have a better idea? Food doesn't excite my
son in the morning, and yesterday I found him standing up, with his
head against the wall, mostly asleep in the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Have you ever experienced blackouts where you can't remember
what you've watched on TV the night before?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Have the members of your family ever experienced conflict
over the television in your family, perhaps resorting to physical
fighting over what programs you watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Check _ but this was a long time ago _ before everyone got his
or her own TV.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Have you ever lied to a friend, telling them you couldn't
attend an event because you were afraid of missing some TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, you're not including movies here?''
</P>
<P>
   6. Do your kids think that what happens on television is real?
``It's not?''
</P>
<P>
   This whole media history thing was giving me a major migraine.
And little Annie was just in the middle of telling Jessie that she
really is Annie and not her twin Hallie, and that part of ``The
Parent Trap'' always makes me and my kids cry, it's so happy.
</P>
<P>
   So I did what any good parent would do. I folded up the paper
and snuggled into the couch with my kids.
</P>
<P>
   And we watched some TV.

 By THIERRY OGIER 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In the midst of the Brazilian recession,
Embraer is flying high.
 &HT;    The only sizable airplane manufacturer in the region was
moribund just a few years ago. But it has since grabbed market
share in the United States and Europe, becoming the fourth-largest
manufacturer in the world after Boeing of the United States, Airbus
of France and Bombardier of Canada. The company registered its
first profit last year _ US$110 million _ after seven years in the
red, and sales, which increased 90 percent last year, are due to
reach $2 billion this year.
 &HT;    ``Embraer has come a long way since privatization,'' says Daniel
Henner, the head of French defense, telecommunications and
electronics firm Thomson CSF in Rio de Janeiro. ``It is a great
success story. The credit must go to its first-class management
team.''
 &HT;    For the first time since its creation in 1969, Embraer escaped
the command of the military in December 1994, when a consortium led
by Rio de Janeiro-based investment bank Bozano Simonsen and two
pension funds acquired 94 percent of the company for $181.5
million. A tough restructuring exercise has been commanded by
Mauricio Botelho, a short but sharp mechanical engineer whose
financial engineering has worked wonders. Initially, thousands of
jobs were cut as the company was turned upside down. But thanks to
the recent expansion, Embraer has been recruiting again and has
more than doubled the number of employees to 6,700 from three years
ago.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, productivity has increased dramatically. It now takes
less than six months to make a plane, instead of fourteen, and
income per employee has risen from $40,000 in 1994 to $227,000 last
year.
 &HT;    Embraer's recovery is largely due to its line of ``regional
jets,'' small planes designed to carry between 30 and 70
passengers. ``Regional jets have a special role to play,'' says
Botelho, who tested the airlines' demand before developing this new
product.
 &HT;    Embraer planes were tailor made for the growing market for
airline flights between cities that are less than 500 miles apart.
AMR's American Eagle and Continental Airlines' Continental Express
in the United States are among Embraer's main customers. But big
orders have been recently placed by several European airlines,
including Brymon Airways, the regional carrier for British Airways,
Crossair of Switzerland and Skyways of Sweden. The company is also
developing a family of 70- and 90-seat regional jets with General
Electric and Honeywell. In total, Embraer has been commissioned to
build as much as $6.2 billion worth of planes.
 &HT;    Suppliers are jubilant. ``When Embraer starts a new project,
everybody wants to be on board,'' says Alan Sinclair, a regional
executive for Rolls-Royce, which is scheduled to deliver some 300
engines per year to the Brazilian plane maker.
 &HT;    Embraer has also staged a comeback in the military market for
the first time in five years. Two new planes were unveiled in May
that will take part in surveillance missions over the Amazon River
Basin to combat deforestation and drug smuggling.
 &HT;    While Botelho still presents his company as ``the technological
and industrial arm of the Brazilian Armed Forces,'' the Greek army
is also acquiring such planes, which are equipped with Israeli and
Swedish technology. ``We are going to be the top Brazilian exporter
this year,'' boasts Gilberto Galan, Embraer's director of corporate
affairs, who expects foreign sales to reach $1.8 billion this year.
Last year, Embraer came in second behind iron-ore giant Companhia
Vale de Rio Doce (CVRD) and ranked 14th among Latin America's
largest exporters.
 &HT;    The company's export policy, however, has become controversial.
Its main competitor, Canada's Bombardier, has accused Embraer of
benefiting from export subsidies from the Brazilian government,
which still has a 6 percent stake in the airline and voting control
through its ``golden share.''
 &HT;    This is an issue that ruins Botelho's generally good humor. ``It
is not true that Embraer owes its success to these subsidies,'' he
says, arguing that credit facilities offered by the Brazilian
development bank Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e
Social (BNDES) only help level the playing field in terms of
interest rates. ``The Brazilian government tries to partially
compensate the handicap of being in an emerging market,'' Botelho
says. Adds Elcio Alvares, the Brazilian Defense Minister: ``The
financial program is essential to the company's growth.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the state hand has always been benevolent to
Embraer, even since privatization. ``If BNDES had not acted swiftly
to release credit lines for the sale of airplanes, Embraer would
certainly not have survived,'' says Roberto Bernardes, a senior
analyst at Sao Paulo state-funded research institute Seade
Foundation who wrote his doctoral thesis on Embraer.
 &HT;    For the time being, the company seems anxious to secure its
future. Embraer has been in search of a strategic partner for
several months to access new technologies. ``They won't be able to
survive on their own for very long,'' says Damian Kepp, a Latin
America analyst at Jane's Defence Weekly, a publication published
by the London-based Defence Institute. ``They are good at what they
are doing, but their capacities are limited.''
 &HT;    Embraer has made several contacts with industry players Saab and
Marcel Dassault, but nothing has evolved yet. ``The moment is one
of rationalization in the industry,'' says Gordon Wright, executive
vice president of British Aerospace in Brasilia.
 &HT;    Company officials are adamant that the company is not for sale.
And the Brazilian government could block any takeover attempt
thanks to its ``golden'' share.
 &HT;    But Embraer's chairman, Carlos Leoni Siqueira, a Bozano Simonsen
executive, confirms that the company is contemplating issuing
shares on Wall Street and is merely waiting for ``the right
moment.'' With such a strong turnaround story going for it, the
right moment may be now.

THE MEDIA ARE THE MISCHIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading the newspaper the other night, my vigilant parental eye
spotted this headline: Doctors urge limiting TV time for kids.
Apparently those doctors in the American Academy of Pediatrics have
issued yet another recommendation on parenting. Frankly, as I
skimmed through the story, this one made me a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of intense study on the matter (which
may at least partially explain why I can't get a doctor[ human] on
the phone when I call my pediatrician's office), the herd of
healers has[ have] arrived at the landmark ruling that watching TV
isn't really very good for kiddos. It seems the 55,000 members of
the academy have agreed that too much media influence _ especially
television, but also including movies, video games, computer games,
music videos, radio, the Internet and books _ can lead to a scourge
of societal ills that will leave us with chain-smoking, Uzi-toting
tots with a tendency to lay into the ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on the number of fat, mean babies we're producing in
this country, the good doctors' new policy statement includes the
simple recommendation that pediatricians request, along with a
medical history of their little patients, a complete media history
on each and every child.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Now, usually I find the AAP a helpful source for my many
parenting concerns. When I have a burning question on acellular
pertussis vaccine, I turn to them for an update. And who else would
take the time to answer my long list of queries about ultraviolet
light?
</P>
<P>
   And, in truth, I could see that the AAP had some valid points.
After all, at the very minute I was reading about the policy
statement, my own two kids were strewn about on couches, chomping
chips and riveted to the 32nd showing of ``The Parent Trap''in our
own living room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of a media history made me sweat, for two
reasons: First, it means there will be something else to record and
remember about my children. Obviously those well-meaning
pediatricians have no idea that I have been unable to perform even
the simplest tasks in this respect. The binders that hold my kids'
yearly physical exam reports are covered with a thick film of dust.
The photo albums are half-empty relics on the bookshelves. A good
detective, inspecting my home, might assume its young inhabitants
had disappeared sometime around 1996. And it gets worse: I couldn't
tell you if my kids are current on their tetanus shots, or when
they last went to the dentist. I had to make up a poem to remember
my second child's birth date. (You won't forget it anymore,
Hadley's birthday is Sept. 24).
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge to my overcrowded mind is a minor concern
compared with the pain and humiliation of actually facing the
checklist when a receptionist hands it over on a clipboard in the
waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I see shaking out as I fill it in.

NEW COMPANY BANKS ON MARKET FOR GOLF MEMORABILIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl) 
By MARGARET ANN MIILLE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ It seemed simple enough: Build a windowed case
or two displaying replicas of antique golf memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea has evolved into a much more ambitious project
since it was hatched three years ago by business associates Ki
Cuyler and Henry Van Beck of Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   It has spawned a privately held company called Antique Golf
Collectibles that has attracted to its board the likes of David
Clark, former executive vice president of Mellon Bank, and Robert
Hannan, former vice chairman of Eckerd Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And it does more than produce copies of turn-of-the-century golf
club heads and balls.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the group announced that it would kick off its own
international golf tournament next year at the Oaks Country Club in
Osprey, about 10 miles south of Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the vintage theme, those games will be played
with hickory clubs and gutta percha balls similar to those used in
the early 1900s. Golfers will dress in the style of that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone a long way in a short time already,'' said Van Beck,
company general manager and chief operations officer.
</P>
<P>
   Though display cases comprise the bulk of its merchandise,
Antique Golf Collectibles also sells golf T-shirts for $30, gutta
percha golf balls for $5; long-nosed putters for $95; and sets of
hickory golf clubs for $950.
</P>
<P>
   Van Beck and Cuyler, a sales consultant, discovered a relatively
open playing field three years ago when they began researching this
niche industry.
</P>
<P>
   They launched their trial balloon in late January, displaying
about 12 cases of merchandise at the annual Professional Golf
Association trade show in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to see what other people in the golf field really
thought about it,'' Van Beck said. ``If there is anything else like
it in the world of golf, it would be at that show.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't see themselves coming and going. And they sold
everything they had brought.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that they met Stefan White, an English collector of
antique golf clubs who agreed to market their tournament in Great
Britain. He also will add his own merchandise to that sold by
Antique Golf Collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Golf rose in popularity in the early 1900s, fueled by a change
in the materials used in the production of equipment that made
prices more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suddenly enabled everyone to have a go,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the process of making replicas from molds
acquired over the years by Cuyler operates on a cottage industry
scale. Van Beck said about 30 people, most of them artists, have so
far assembled about 2,600 display cases of resin replicas from
their workshops and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Van Beck makes the rounds, delivering materials and retrieving
finished products that he stores in Sarasota warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   But that method may change as demand increases for the cases,
which cost up to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Antique Golf Collectibles markets its three product lines to pro
shops, golf retailers, art galleries, commercial interior designers
and wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Van Beck said he has been scouting sites that could handle
increased production volume. But he doesn't know how soon they may
be needed. Geographical factors that favor the Sarasota area
include proximity to overseas shipping facilities in Tampa and
local weather that allows the sport to be played throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler expects the tournament next year to reap more foreign
contacts. Agreements have already been brokered to host the event
in Japan, Australia, Sweden, France and Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people that we are dealing with in the tournament are
all influential people who can help market our products,'' he said.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO _ Embraer sobrevuela el torbellino de la recesion
brasilena.
 &HT;    El unico fabricante importante de aviones de la region agonizaba
hace pocos anos. Pero desde entonces ha ganado participacion de
mercado en Estados Unidos y Europa, y se ha convertido en el cuarto
fabricante del mundo despues de Boeing (Estados Unidos), Airbus
(Francia) y Bombardier (Canada). La compania obtuvo sus primeras
ganancias el ano pasado (US$110 millones) despues de siete anos de
perdidas, y las ventas, que crecieron el 90 percent el ano pasado,
deben llegar a US$2.000 millones este ano.
 &HT;    ``Embraer ha avanzado mucho desde la privatizacion'', dice
Daniel Henner, director de la oficina en Rio de Janeiro del
conglomerado frances Thomson CSF. ``Es una historia de exito, y ese
exito hay que atribuirlo a su gerencia de primera''.
 &HT;    Por primera vez desde su creacion en 1969, Embraer se libro del
control de las fuerzas armadas en diciembre de 1994, cuando un
consorcio encabezado por el banco de inversion Bozano Simonsen, de
Rio de Janeiro, y dos fondos de pension adquirio el 94 por ciento
de la compania por US$181,5 millones. Mauricio Botelho, un
brillante ingeniero mecanico cuya estrategia financiera ha hecho
milagros, dirigio un drastico plan de reestructuracion, que incluyo
el despido de miles de empleados y una reestructuracion completa.
Pero gracias a la reciente expansion, Embraer ha abierto otra vez
sus puertas a personal nuevo y la cantidad de empleados, 6.700, es
mas del doble que hace tres anos.
 &HT;    Entretanto, el aumento de la productividad ha sido espectacular.
Ahora fabricar un avion toma menos de seis meses (antes tardaba 14)
y los ingresos por empleado han crecido de US$40.000 en 1994 a
US$227.000 el ano pasado.
 &HT;    La recuperacion de Embraer se debe en gran medida a su linea de
jets regionales, pequenos aviones que transportan entre 30 y 70
pasajeros. ``Los jets regionales tienen un papel especial'', senala
Botelho, que estudio la demanda de las aerolineas antes de
desarrollar el nuevo producto.
 &HT;    Los aviones de Embraer se disenaron especificamente para los
vuelos entre ciudades a menos de 800 kilometros de distancia.
American Eagle, de AMR, y Continental Express, de Continental
Airlines, en Estados Unidos, estan entre los principales clientes
de Embraer. Pero recientemente varias aerolineas europeas han hecho
grandes pedidos, entre ellas Brymon Airways, la linea regional de
British Airways; Crossair, de Suiza, y Skyways, de Suecia. La
compania tambien crea una familia de jets regionales de entre 70 y
90 asientos con General Electric y Honeywell. En total, Embraer ha
recibido pedidos por un total de US$6.200 millones.
 &HT;    Los suministradores estan euforicos. ``Cuando Embraer inicia un
proyecto, todo el mundo quiere participar'', dice Alan Sinclair,
ejecutivo en America Latina de Rolls-Royce, que debe entregar unos
300 motores anuales al fabricante brasileno.
 &HT;    Embraer tambien esta de vuelta en el mercado militar por primera
vez en cinco anos. En mayo se presentaron dos aviones que
participaran en misiones de vigilancia en la cuenca del Amazonas,
con la mision de combatir la deforestacion y el narcotrafico.
 &HT;    Aunque Botelho todavia presenta a su compania como ``el brazo
tecnologico e industrial de las Fuerzas Armadas de Brasil'', el
ejercito griego tambien adquiere sus aviones, que estan equipados
con tecnologia israeli y sueca. ``Seremos el mayor exportador
brasileno este ano'', afirma Gilberto Galan, director de asuntos
empresariales de Embraer, quien espera que las ventas en el
extranjero lleguen a US$1.800 millones este ano. El ano pasado,
Embraer ocupo el segundo lugar detras de Companhia Vale de Rio Doce
(CVRD) y el decimocuarto entre los mayores exportadores
latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, la politica de exportacion de la compania ha
llegado a ser controversial. Su principal competidor, Bombardier,
ha acusado a Embraer de recibir subsidios del gobierno brasileno,
que todavia tiene un interes del 6 por ciento en la aerolinea y
poder de voto a traves de su accion de oro.
 &HT;    Este problema ensombrece el buen humor que suele mostrar
Botelho. ``No es verdad que Embraer le deba su exito a estos
subsidios'', dice. Argumenta que las facilidades de credito
ofrecidas por el Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e
Social (BNDES) ayudaron a Embraer a recibir una tasa de interes mas
equitativa. ``El gobierno brasileno trata de compensar parcialmente
la desventaja de estar en un mercado emergente'', dice Botelho.
Elcio Alvares, ministro de Defensa de Brasil, agrega: ``El programa
financiero es esencial para el crecimiento de la compania''.
 &HT;    No obstante, el Estado siempre ha sido generoso con Embraer,
incluso despues de la privatizacion. ``Si BNDES no hubiera otorgado
rapidamente lineas de credito para la venta de aviones, Embraer no
habria sobrevivido'', afirma Roberto Bernardes, analista de la
Fundacion Seade, un instituto de investigaciones de Sao Paulo,
costeado por el Estado. La tesis doctoral de Bernardes fue sobre
Embraer.
 &HT;    De momento, la compania parece ansiosa por asegurar su futuro.
Lleva varios meses buscando un socio estrategico para tener acceso
a nuevas tecnologias. ``No podran sobrevivir solos durante mucho
tiempo'', dice Damian Kepp, analista de America Latina en Jane's
Defence Weekly, una publicacion del Defence Institute, de Londres.
``Lo que hacen, lo hacen bien, pero su capacidad es limitada''.
 &HT;    Embraer ha hecho varios contactos con empresas como Saab y
Marcel Dassault, pero todavia no ha surgido nada. ``La corriente
del momento es la racionalizacion del sector'', senala Gordon
Wright, vicepresidente ejecutivo de British Aerospace en Brasilia.
 &HT;    Ejecutivos de la compania niegan con obstinacion que la empresa
este en venta. Y el gobierno brasileno podria impedir cualquier
intento de absorcion gracias a su accion de oro.
 &HT;    Pero el presidente del directorio de Embraer, Carlos Leoni
Siqueira, ejecutivo de Bozano Simonsen, confirma que la compania
contempla la emision de acciones en Wall Street y que solo espera
por ``el momento correcto''. Con su brillante recuperacion, ese
momento correcto quiza sea ahora mismo.

VOUCHER STUDENTS OPTING FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANET MARSHALL   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The notion of public money being channeled
into private schools is at the heart of the national voucher
debate. But in Pensacola, Florida's voucher testing ground, more
parents are using vouchers to send their children to
higher-performing public schools than to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The choice doesn't surprise school officials, who figured free
transportation to public schools, plus limited space in private
ones, would keep many children in the district
</P>
<P>
   But while the option may bring comfort to those who feared a
mass exodus from public schools, it also creates some logistical
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   At A.K. Suter Elementary in Tallahassee on Tuesday, principal
Beverly Patteson was struggling with bus schedules. Taking voucher
students home Monday had taken longer than expected, because they
live in parts of town not zoned for the school. The delay kept a
bus driver from picking up high school students, a situation
Patteson doesn't want to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Heffernan, a voucher advocate and president of
Floridians for School Choice, hopes the number of people who picked
public over private schools will help shift the voucher debate away
from inflammatory issues of religion and state. Several lawsuits
have been filed in Florida challenging vouchers, arguing in part
that directing public money to private schools is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``What there ought to be is a recognition that this isn't an
issue of private schools vs. public schools,'' Heffernan said.
``The issue has been, for 20 years for me, the issue of who should
decide where a child goes to school.''
</P>
<P>
   About 860 elementary students in Pensacola qualified for
vouchers because their schools, A.A. Dixon and Spencer Bibbs
Advanced Learning Academy, received F grades from the state. The
grades are based primarily on test scores. Of those 860, about 140
left their schools, with about 80 choosing other public schools and
57 enrolling in private ones.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons parents opted for public schools vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some because it's close and some because it's a particularly
good school and some because they have had a relative there,'' said
Escambia County School District spokeswoman Barbara Frye. .
</P>
<P>
   Limited space in private schools willing to accept vouchers was
almost certainly a factor. Ninety-two students applied for 58 seats
at area Catholic schools, and those not chosen in a lottery had to
pursue another option. The fifth area private school to accept
vouchers had space for six kids, four of whom enrolled. At the
Catholic schools, 53 students ended up enrolling, said Sister Mary
Caplice of the Congregation of Notre Dame. The other five for whom
seats were available backed out at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an inkling that there would be parents who would choose
to go to higher-performing public schools,'' said Karen Chandler,
spokeswoman for the state Education Department. ``We knew there
would be a mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in public schools, transportation is neither free nor
guaranteed at private ones, though some help with car pools. Just
one of the Catholic schools here provides free or reduced-price
lunches to poor students.
</P>
<P>
   This year, only students at the two failing schools in Pensacola
qualified for vouchers. Statewide, however, 78 schools are now
considered failing. Unless they improve, the voucher program could
grow exponentially. What kind of logistical problems might that
create?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Frye said. ``Right now, we're dealing with
relatively small numbers. You can make anything work at that
level.''

SURVIVING A BAD CASE OF THE CREEPS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, Aug. 24) 
 (nk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the morning when I revealed the Swiss army knife under my
sleeping bag my friends laughed and asked if I'd planned to defend
myself with the corkscrew or the manicure scissors.
</P>
<P>
   By then I could laugh, too. It was a dazzling morning and
someone handed me a cup of coffee and someone else started cooking
breakfast. We had sun and a whole day to eat and read and swim in
the warm green lake. Life was good. The only thing making scratchy
noises in the bushes were lizards. But, you know, sometimes you
just get so scared.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to say you get scared for no good reason but we all
know it's justified. This summer an argument could be made for
never going out into the woods again. And I'm not talking about the
``Blair Witch Project,'' I'm talking about good old American
everyday horror.
</P>
<P>
   At some point between the confession in the Yosemite murders and
after the Atlanta slayings but before the Los Angeles Jewish day
care shootings, I came down with the creeps. I had nightmares. I
was distracted. I'd say things like, ``I'm not a timid person but
...''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that things don't usually bother me, except for scary
movies, like the one mentioned above and which I've already been
warned of. But there was something hanging around that was
bothering more than me. A woman at work said she dreamed about a
serial killer. A friend felt unnerved on her morning walk on
familiar streets. A woman who has lived alone for years spent most
of one night peeking through the curtains at a strange van parked
on the street. A couple planning a week's backpacking in Yosemite
said maybe they'd go to Shasta instead.
</P>
<P>
   I kept telling myself that even Carole Carrington said what
happened to her family was a one-in-a-million thing and that we
can't be afraid to live. But I couldn't shake it.
</P>
<P>
   A friend called to say she about died that day of fear. She was
in her office when she heard a skirmish out by the security desk.
She hit the floor, dialed 911 and looked up to her television,
where at that very moment, CNN was recapping the story of the
Atlanta day trader who killed family members and colleagues.
Fortunately, at my friend's office things were quickly and safely
handled and the troubled visitor was found to be unarmed. Still he
did have a beef with someone in the building and managed to terrify
everyone within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the all-women campout came up, it didn't seem like the
best timing.
</P>
<P>
   The night before we left for the lake I woke up in my own bed
worried about being worried.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, I had a bad case. No one else in the group was hesitant
about sleeping out. They said things like ``who would dare bother
all of us?'' One of them even brought along a murder mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long night. I didn't sleep much but every time I woke
up in our big tent _ having been granted the spot in the middle _ I
tried to focus on the stars through the window flap and not my
morbid imagination. The next day the crummy fear was gone and when
I floated in that delicious water and stared up at the fuzzy yellow
hills I realized I was on the lookout for deer and not killers. I
had broken through.
</P>
<P>
   It still makes me mad, though, to have been hit so hard with the
creeps. Mad at myself for being such a big baby but also because
all the shrinks and all the experts cannot keep sick people from
running amok. I'm mad at those who say we are a violent country as
if we're supposed to accept it and mad that we have more guns in
this country than common sense.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sick that President Clinton has to go on TV almost weekly to
say his prayers are with the families and victims of another
killing spree. I want him to pray for a way to prevent the next
spree.
</P>
<P>
   Another day three of us were walking on a trail and a man coming
toward us suddenly veered our way and held out his hand. In it was
a bouquet of Queen Anne's Lace and cornflowers. He offered it to
one woman and she hesitated. But then she took it and thanked him
and he walked off and so did we.
</P>
<P>
   She said when she saw the man approaching she noticed he was
swinging a stick. She hadn't seen the flowers in his other hand.
</P>
<P>
   So, the message upon the message is that sometimes when we're
worrying about a stick we get flowers. And while we are never
perfectly safe in the woods or camping or even at work, we are
likely to be imperfectly safe.

`BLAIR WITCH' FICTIONAL FILMMAKERS GET WHAT THEY DESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday, Aug. 20)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I read in the paper that some real-life witches are offended by
the movie ``The Blair Witch Project'' because it depicts witches in
an unflattering way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defames us and it makes us less human,'' said Teri Kalgren,
co-founder of the Witches Education Bureau in Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The film ``both exploits and reinforces negative stereotypes
about witches: that they are evil murderers of children and
adults,'' said Phyllis Curoff, a New York attorney and, needless to
say, a witch.
</P>
<P>
   I can only speak for myself, but I do not think ``The Blair
Witch Project'' does any harm whatsoever to the image of real-life
witches. In fact, if I were a witch, I think I'd be proud.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that the witch in ``The Blair Witch Project''
appears to kill three young filmmakers who get lost in the woods,
whatever she does to these three jerks is, in my opinion, not a
crime but a public service.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the filmmakers have about as much business going
on a three-day camping trip in unfamiliar woods as I do assembling
a fission reactor in my backyard tool shed.
</P>
<P>
   These morons do not take more than two or three steps into the
woods before they are hopelessly lost and screaming and cursing at
each other at the top of their lungs.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the kind of people who would have trouble
finding the bathroom in their own apartment, let alone reading a
contour map by firelight.
</P>
<P>
   Once they discovered that they were lost, if they had just sat
down on a log and maybe whimpered softly to themselves, it is
likely that someone would have rescued them fairly quickly,
especially given the fact that their car was parked only a few
hundred feet away, probably with the keys locked in it, the lights
on and the engine running.
</P>
<P>
   But no, they start hollering at each other, using the kind of
language normally associated with combat troops and guests on the
Jerry Springer show. Their language is bad enough to scare any
other campers out of the area, or at the very least dissuade them
from offering any assistance. You end up hoping that these
potty-mouths get gored by an enraged deer or, at the very least,
are attacked by a swarm of yellowjackets or Lyme-disease-carrying
ticks.
</P>
<P>
   When they're not stripping the bark off the trees with their
language, these losers are smoking like fiends, sending billowing
clouds of poisonous gas into the atmosphere on a magnitude not seen
since Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   You would think with all the smoke being exhaled by these bozos
that they could easily be spotted by a forest ranger peering
through binoculars from atop a fire tower several counties away.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a nice cinematic touch if these three
nicotine addicts had been blasted with a high-pressure hose or
maybe beaten with shovels or buried under a mound of dirt by
firemen trying to protect the forest, the woodland creatures and
the ears of any sensitive campers and/or witches who happen to be
hanging around the area.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the directors of ``The Blair Witch Project''
didn't ask me to approve their script beforehand, which could
explain why the fireman scene is missing and also, probably, why
the movie has grossed something like 42 bazillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in ``The Blair Witch Project'' that a real
witch should find demeaning or offensive. If anything, the Blair
witch comes across as a little too caring and sensitive, as it
waits far too long to send these annoying twits off to that Great
Film School In The Sky.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is that if the Wicked Witch of the West were still
around, these three dopes would have been toast by the end of the
first scene.

   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Hundreds of relief workers
from more than a dozen countries stream into Turkey and immediately
join the frantic search for survivors of Tuesday's devastating
earthquake. Although Turkish and foreign workers rescued many
people from the rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll
climbs steadily. According to an official count, 3,479 bodies have
been recovered, and more than 16,000 people are listed as seriously
injured. By Stephen Kinzer. 1,300 words.
</P>

   With:
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-CENTER (Izmet, Turkey) _ People here spent their day
digging, sifting, grieving and increasingly despairing that those
who have not escaped from the rubble by now are probably dead. They
watched as bulldozers and front-end loaders tried to unearth
bedrooms, which is where most people were when the earthquake
struck. Then in the swirl of dust and smoke and sweltering heat,
residents picked through the rubble with hammers and chisels and
bare hands. As delicately as archaeologists, they teased out shreds
of clothing, old photos, scraps of furniture and, inevitably, the
bodies. By Edmund L. Andrews. 1,200 words.

   METLIFE-SUIT (Undated) _ Metropolitan Life Insurance has agreed
to a $1.7 billion settlement of class-action lawsuits by
policyholders, contending they were deceived by the sales practices
of the company, the nation's second-largest life insurer. (Summary
from wires.) By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ARTS (Tokyo) _ Famous art is leaving Japan. Only a handful
of bankers and art dealers know for sure where it is going. The
paintings, including large numbers of van Goghs, Modiglianis,
Renoirs and Picassos that vanished into Japan more than a decade
ago, are being resold abroad as a result of the country's economic
collapse. ``We have already lost so much; we are losing so much
still _ and I don't mean just we Japanese,'' said Shin'ichi Segi,
an art critic who has tried to track the migration of paintings in
and out of Japan with only limited success. ``The trail is going
cold, perhaps forever.'' By Stephanie Strom. 1,700 words.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ECON (Beijing) _ In a drastic move aimed at reversing a
steady fall in prices, Chinese officials announce that they will
stop all new production of a broad range of ordinary consumer
items. By withholding approval for any new production lines, while
allowing existing output to continue, officials apparently hope
they can shackle China's deflation, which threatens to seriously
undermine economic growth, which is faltering. By Seth Faison.

Levy and Laurie Flynn.

WEST AIMS TO HELP UKRAINE AVOID REACTOR COMPUTER PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ With less than five months to go before the year
2000, a project financed by Western governments has just got under
way to try to fully immunize Ukraine's 14 aging, trouble-prone
nuclear reactors against the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the project is to insure that no bugs crop up
that could lead to power blackouts on New Year's Day, said Bob
Talbert, an American nuclear power expert who is working on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and other experts were already satisfied that
the reactors' computers would not cause any safety problems and
that the reactors would not automatically shut down at midnight on
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. congressional hearings earlier this year, CIA officials
said that the Y2K problem might prompt sudden shutdowns of nuclear
reactors throughout Ukraine and Russia. That could have
particularly devastating consequences in Ukraine, where nuclear
power accounts for almost half of all electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Although a nuclear accident was said to be unlikely, any mention
of potential problems at Ukraine's nuclear reactors raises the
specter of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in
1986, which poisoned regions of Ukraine and Belarus and sprinkled
radioactive dust across central and northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement is in the works under which the Group of Seven
industrialized democracies would help Ukraine build new energy
sources and Ukraine would shut down Chernobyl's last working
reactor by Jan. 1. But until that deal is complete, Ukraine plans
to keep the station chugging along.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a French diplomat told Agence France-Presse
that his embassy was advising French citizens who ``do not
absolutely need to be in Ukraine'' to take a vacation in France for
the four weeks around New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost certain that there will be panic buying of food
and fuel,'' the embassy's first secretary, Jean-Francois Devemy,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The French Embassy quickly issued a retraction, saying that
Devemy had been misinterpreted and had spoken partly ``in jest.''
The statemnt said there were ``no grounds at the moment to issue
any security advice whatsoever'' to French citizens living in or
planning to visit Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The American and British embassies previously issued statements
recommending that anyone planning to be in Ukraine around New
Year's Day prepare for potential problems with distribution of
power, water, fuel and food.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert, the nuclear expert, said that stocking up on water,
food and gas would be a reasonable precaution, but that the worst
he could imagine happening was localized blackouts of a few hours
on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   But another participant in the Y2K project, Valentin
Ponomarenko, a private consultant, said he was concerned that
Ukrainian officials do not fully appreciate the potential danger.
</P>
<P>
   He said his greatest fear was that power station managers would
choose to turn off faulty safety systems and keep electricity
flowing rather than shut down reactors until the safety systems
could be fixed. Energy officials have repeatedly suggested that
they are willing to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert said that all 14 ``process computers,'' which are
basically centralized record keepers that can aid after-the-fact
analysis of reactor problems, were known to be vulnerable. Although
the failure of a process computer poses no immediate safety risk,
he said, operators would be legally obliged to shut down a reactor
within hours after the process computer stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine has a record of ignoring its own nuclear safety
regulations and overriding automatic safety systems. During the
harsh Ukrainian winter, the national power grid often operates on
the brink of collapse, and nuclear power station operators come
under heavy pressure to keep electricity flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Operators are tempted to take such risky measures because
shutting down reactors would only make the grid more unstable,
potentially starting a domino effect that could shut down all
reactors and create a countrywide power failure in the dead of
winter.

CANADA BACKS MORATORIUM ON SALE OF GREAT LAKES WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Signaling its resolve to become the first nation to
outlaw bulk exports of water, Canada Wednesday threw its support
behind a six-month moratorium on the large-scale removal and sale
of water from the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Canada also suggested it will enact laws this fall to keep its
wealth of water out of foreign hands, a move seemingly directed
against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, ``is to protect
all of our water against removals.'' Such a ban could have
long-term consequences for the United States, where agribusiness
and other heavy consumers of water see Canada as the potential
savior in an increasingly dry future.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month moratorium was urged by the International Joint
Commission, the US-Canada agency that regulates the Great Lakes. In
a report released Wednesday, the commission declared there is ``no
surplus water'' in the five lakes, which constitute the world's
largest renewable supply of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Commission hinted that next year it may call for far
more sweeping protections for Great Lakes water. But Canada does
not want to wait, and is scrambling to enact federal legislation to
ban bulk exports of water from its lakes, rivers, underground
reservoirs, and Arctic ice fields, including its portions of the
Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Although not directly related, the moratorium and the report
from the joint commission were released as a drought has stricken
much of the eastern United States and Canada, a natural calamity
that points to the vulnerability of even the most water-rich
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's immediate and strong support for the moratorium showed
Ottawa's determination not to allow the country, which holds
one-fifth of the world's fresh water supply, to become a giant
reservoir for the parched farmlands of the United States or the
arid nations of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians must work together to protect our watersheds and
ensure the preservation of fresh water supplies for future
generations,'' Environment Minister David Anderson said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's aggressively anti-export stance on water represents a
surprising departure for a nation that has depended on the
exploitation of oil, ores, and other nonrenewable resources for
much of its wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The nation possesses far more fresh water than its relatively
small population could conceivably ever use. On a per capita basis,
Canada boasts 11 times as much renewable fresh water as the United
States, and quantities of water locked in ice fields or far
underground are even vaster.
</P>
<P>
   But strong public opposition to the idea of bulk water exports
suggest that Canadians are deeply fearful their nation will one day
be coerced into watering the farms of the American Southwest or
slaking the huge thirst of the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you turn on the tap, there's no turning it off,'' said
Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a nationalist
organization that has warned that the United States will seek to
use the North American Free Trade Agreement to force open the
Canadian floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts, including economists of the World Bank, predict
that water will become the most precious resource of the 21st
Century, and a cause of wars, political tensions, and
megabillion-dollar deals.
</P>
<P>
   Already, American companies have sought to haul off supertanker
loads of water from Ontario and British Columbia, although the
deals have been blocked by last-minute intervention by Ottawa and
provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, although rich in water in its own right,
suffers from serious shortages in key agricultural zones, such as
the Southwest. Since the 1950s there have schemes to divert
Canadian rivers and even entire watersheds to irrigate farmlands
from Colorado to California.
</P>
<P>
   As American water tables drop under rising urban and
agricultural demand, those schemes seem less harebrained and more
visionary. North of the border, realization that the nation's water
trove could be diverted to the United States has put the scare into
Canadian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy Wednesday suggested that the proposed ban on bulk
removals from the Great Lakes sought by the International Joint
Commission does not go far enough since since exporters might be
allowed to draw off water to meet emergencies, such as a severe
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions outlined may be too permissive,'' Axworthy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The concern in Canada is that water might eventually be defined
as a ``commodity'' or ``good'' under US-Canada trade agreements.
This could allow the United States to force Canada to open its
lakes and rivers to exporters.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, controlling Canada's water reserves will not be as
simple as passing a federal law. Although Ottawa has say over
waters shared with the United States, such as the Great Lakes, most
water rights belong to the provinces. Some, like Ontario and
British Columbia, seem receptive to a ban on bulk exports.
</P>
<P>
   Impoverished Newfoundland, on the other hand, sees a potential
bonanza in its thousands of untapped lakes, and may soon give the
go-ahead to a plan by homegrown entrepreneurs to export supertanker
loads of water to the Mideast.

 &HT;    eBay a hit for Kennedy memorabilia
 &HT;    By Jill Inkrott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On July 16, John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s Piper Saratoga
plane plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, at 11:42 a.m., an unspecified issue of George, the
magazine Kennedy founded, was sold on Internet auction site eBay
for $86.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Kennedy was buried at sea July 23, Americans'
unabashed affection for memorabilia and buying had blossomed anew
on the 24-hour flea market called eBay. JFK Jr.-related items, some
tacky, some tasteless, some worth saving, flowed onto the auction
list.
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 items have already closed for bidding and 500 or
so continue to be up for grabs. At Amazon.com, about 120 JFK Jr.
items are on the block.
</P>
<P>
   While most articles have been issues of George or other
magazines featuring Kennedy, the selection has ranged from snow
globes, memorial T-shirts and beanbag bears to autographed dollar
bills, Web site domains and a receipt for Christmas lights
purchased at FAO Schwarz in 1961 by ``Mrs. John Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I decide I really want something, price doesn't matter to
me,'' said Heidi Braatz of Dublin, Ohio, who bid on the memorial
beanbag bears because she collects them and is interested in the
Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   An autographed dollar bill went for $418.88, one of many
lithographs of his famous salute for $127.50, memorial T-shirts for
as much as $21.50. And Aug. 8, someone bid $10,000 for a letter
that Kennedy hand-wrote and signed in 1985 to a Mr. Friedersdorf,
assistant to the president for legal affairs, thanking him for
arranging a White House visit so Kennedy could invite Ronald Reagan
to a Kennedy Library fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter itself is a piece of history,'' said Philip Chen of
Berkeley, Calif., who bid but did not win it. ``And JFK Jr. himself
is another piece of history.''
</P>
<P>
   George Lesko, who runs a video news-clipping service in
Pittsburgh, Pa., wanted to own a piece of that history for
investment. He paid $510 for an autographed photograph of Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very unhappy because I have gotten e-mails offering
everything from signed golf balls to baseballs to photos for much
less ... I wonder what these are worth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to appraiser Claudia Miller, an accredited and senior
member of the American Society of Appraisers, the photograph should
increase in value, depending upon the market, amount of related
memorabilia available, authenticity and condition of the item. She
thought $10,000 ``a bit pricey'' for the letter, however, she said
that the bears, of which Beverly Hills Plush has produced 25,000
sets of two, were a ``rip-off'' as a collectible item.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a limited edition these days,'' said
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Some bidders, like Amy Alsbury, are baby boomers who lived
``through the fascination and assassination eras of John Kennedy.''
Others are twenty-somethings simply interested in the Kennedy
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Kelly of West Chester, Ohio, bought the bears for her young
daughter ``so later when she is older she would have them to help
join past with present.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous bidders, though, examined their conscience before
bidding on any items.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that a person should be allowed to rest in peace
for a respectful amount of time before others try to make money off
their untimely passing,'' said Kelly Ann de los Santos of Del Rio,
Texas. ``I don't know what that would be, although certainly longer
than has been seen of late.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Roberts, owner of Iowa-based A.A.C.S. Autographs, which
began selling autographed photographs on Aug. 5, said that his
company did sufficiently wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got these photos from the forensic authenticators a day or
so before Kennedy's tragic death. We chose to wait a significant
amount of time before posting the items on eBay out of respect for
the Kennedy family,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders, though, have come to expect a sale immediately after a
celebrity death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been a saltwater aquarium with broken pieces of
plastic plane in it _ that would have been in really bad taste and
I would have never have placed a bid on that,'' said Bill Whitaker
of Colebrook, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Local antique and collectible dealers are not carrying JFK Jr.
items, but bookstores have felt the crunch as consumers flocked to
buy magazines and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was never a good seller,'' said the manager of Dicken's
Book Shop in Lebanon, who did not wish to give her name. ``But they
flew off the shelves after he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Saunders, a salesman at Barnes &AMP; Noble Booksellers, said
that a number of people have come in requesting Kennedy books and
magazines, forcing the store to order more to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are curious about who he was,'' Saunders said.
``And they're thinking that sometime in the future the items will
be collectibles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers are showing restraint. Asking prices have
consistently decreased. At the end of July, sellers began bidding
at around $20 for a single issue featuring Kennedy. The average has
since dropped to around $5.
</P>
<P>
   But people are still buying JFK Sr. memorabilia today. Five
hundred items relating to the assassinated president are available
on eBay, and Beverly Hills Plush has issued commemorative beanbag
bears for Robert Kennedy as well. There are about 150 Richard
Nixon-related items available on the 25th anniversary of his
resignation, although that pales in comparison with Marilyn Monroe,
who has about 1,700 collectibles available on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother still collects anything Elvis,'' said Jennifer
Hanson, of Scottsdale, Ariz.

<P>
   On the Russian space station Mir, flight engineer Sergei Avdeyev
has been in orbit since Aug. 13, 1998. He has now outlasted three
Russian prime ministers: Sergei Kiriyenko, appointed by President
Yeltsin in March 1998 and fired in August of the same year; Yevgeny
Primakov, appointed in September 1998 and fired in May 1999; and
Sergei Stepashin, appointed last May and fired on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin' new prime minister-designate _ and, if we are to
believe the president, heir apparent _ is Vladimir Putin. Will he
be welcoming Avdeyev, when the cosmonaut returns to Earth? This, as
they say, is a good question.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's seemingly impulsive decision has reminded historians
of the behavior of Czar Nicholas II in the final years of the
Russian Empire. Then too, premiers were replaced in a kaleidoscopic
manner and with no apparent logic. With a major war between the
government and Islamic secessionists brewing in Russia's south, the
similarities are indeed troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Is Yeltsin's decision to sack a loyal prime minister a coldly
calculated maneuver or, as even some of his former supporters are
saying, ``sheer madness?''
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions were first asked in March 1998, when the
president abruptly dismissed another loyalist, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
At the time, most Russian and foreign observers preferred to see
that as a rational move. Not so today. Just about everyone is sick
and tired of the political puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, amazingly and ironically, the president of Russia has
become the country's greatest destabilizing factor. Confrontation,
unpredictability and destabilization are the main ingredients of
Yeltsin's political style. Still, one might expect, so close to the
end of his final term in office, that he would modify that style
out of concern for his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   It is not happening because the president is desperate. Yeltsin
is desperate because he does not know how to impose his will on
Russia's future. Protecting his cronies and members of his family
from possible prosecution after he goes may well be on his mind,
but it is only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is casting about for a strategy that will make him
relevant during his final year. And no such strategy is available.
Therefore, his convulsive moves may be not as dangerous as they
first look. More and more, they just look ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   His designation of Putin _ virtually unknown to the people,
faceless and with no trace of charisma _ as the man who could
``lead Russia into the next century,'' is a case in point. Putin's
chances of being elected president in a free and fair election are
zero. And Yeltsin's capacity to engineer a scenario that would push
him through in some other way is not that great either.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Russian society is weak and the Russian
political establishment cowardly; even so, neither are likely to
allow Yeltsin to extend his era beyond the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's main concern has always been with power politics and
personnel reshuffles rather than policy making. His supporters in
Russia and in the West have always admired his unfailing political
instincts. It is those instincts, they say, that have saved Russia
from a return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Yeltsin's failed policies and erratic
behavior have become Russia's main problem. The country is being
saved by its amazing resilience.
</P>
<P>
   After the economic collapse in August 1998, there were
predictions of all kinds of disaster _ riots, famine, perhaps
military dictatorship. It didn't happen. Primakov was no miracle
worker but he was able to restore sanity to the political process,
and both the economy and the people responded positively to his
quiet therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is now the most popular politician in Russia. If the
elections were held today he would be chosen overwhelmingly.
Yeltsin clearly wants no part of this scenario; he is rocking the
boat. The challenge for the State Duma, or parliament, is to steer
a course to two crucial destinations _ parliamentary elections in
December and presidential elections in July.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma refuses to approve Putin's nomination, Yeltsin can
dissolve the group, throwing the political calendar into disarray.
So, no matter how disgusted they are, the Duma members will
probably say yes to Yeltsin once again. The real work of solving
the country's multiple problems will have to be done by the next
president and a new parliament.

CONVICTED CHILD ABUSER'S BID FOR NEW TRIAL THWARTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Ending a 15-year legal odyssey that fueled a national
debate about the reliability of child testimony, the state's
highest court Wednesday overturned a judge's decision granting a
new trial to Cheryl Amirault LeFave, who was convicted in 1987 of
sexually abusing children at her family's day care center.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the Supreme Judicial Court means that LeFave,
whose controversial conviction was reversed last year, will almost
certainly be returning to prison in a month.
</P>
<P>
   James Sultan, LeFave's defense attorney, said LeFave will no
longer seek relief in state courts. He said he and LeFave will
decide in the next month whether to begin a federal court appeal of
her conviction or to seek clemency from Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   But Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley said she expects
LeFave to be returned to prison to resume her 8- to 20-year
sentence when the SJC decision formally takes effect in 28 days.
And a Cellucci spokesman said the governor is likely to defer to
the decision of the SJC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue my fight from behind the wall,'' said LeFave,
41, who has been free since 1995 when her conviction was first
overturned in another lower court ruling also vacated by the SJC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am outraged to think I have to go to prison,'' she said at a
press conference after learning of the SJC decision while she
worked at a local insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurt. I'm very hurt,'' said LeFave, her voice trembling.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan remarked that ``only in Massachusetts, the home of the
Salem witch trials and Sacco and Vanzetti, are the verdicts allowed
to stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go away! That's essentially the message the SJC has given us.
But we're not going away. We're going elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said he will have to decide whether to quickly put
together a federal appeal in hopes of keeping LeFave out of jail or
to spend time fashioning a more organized filing even if LeFave
must spend time in prison in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision Wednesday also throws into doubt the
future of Gerald ``Tooky'' Amirault, 45, LeFave's brother, who was
convicted in a separate trial in 1986 and remains incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for LeFave had argued that she was entitled to a new
trial on two grounds: inadequate legal counsel by her former
attorneys, and ``newly discovered evidence'' indicating that
preschool children can make up and believe stories suggested to
them through overly aggressive questioning by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Their arguments won the support of Superior Court Judge Isaac
Borenstein, who granted LeFave a new trial in June 1998. In his
stinging, 140-page ruling, Borenstein labled as ``incredible''
testimony by child witnesses that described talking robots, public
torture of animals, and being tied naked to a tree in front of the
school.
</P>
<P>
   But in Wednesday's unanimous decision, the high court ruled that
Amirault's previous lawyers had not caused her to suffer ``a
substantial risk of miscarriage of justice,'' and that so-called
new evidence was ``not remarkably different from that presented by
or available to the defendant at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, concluded Chief Justice Herbert P. Wilkins, who
authored the 19-page decision, LeFave's ``allegedly new evidence
lacks the characteristics necessary to qualify as newly discovered
evidence that could warrant granting a new trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley, whose office prosecuted the case, applauded the high
court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision vindicates all of the children who testified
to devastating abuses suffered at the Fells Acres Day School,''
Coakley said in a statement. ``It is our hope that those victims --
many of whom watched in silence while the defendants pursued appeal
after appeal -- will now be able to put their terrible ordeal
behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Wednesday, the parents of several of the victims, many
now in their 20s, declined to comment. But one mother, speaking
anonymously, said she was relieved the long-running case seems to
have come to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``These child were sexually abused, and there are no ifs ands or
buts about that in my mind or the minds of any of the people who
were involved,'' she said. ``Justice should have been served a long
time ago, and hopefully it will be now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amirault family was thrust into the public eye in 1984, when
Violet Amirault, her son Gerald, and her daughter, Cheryl, were
charged with raping and assaulting children at Fells Acres, their
family-run day care center in suburban Malden.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Amirault was convicted in 1986 and sentenced to 30 to 40
years; his mother and sister were found guilty the following year
and sent away for 8 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Amirault has since lost three appeals of his conviction,
once in Middlesex Superior Court and twice before the Supreme
Judicial Court. Violet Amirault and LeFave had also lost several
appeals until last year, when Borenstein ordered a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his highly critical decision, Borenstein wrote that
investigators were out to get the Amiraults from the beginning, and
he faulted interviewers for using overly suggestive techniques with
the toddler-aged child witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   His criticism was echoed by the Amirault's supporters, who
branded the investigation a ``witch hunt'' and accused prosecutors
of ignoring medical evidence, or lack thereof, in the face of
public hysteria over similar alleged multiple-victim child abuse
cases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In his 140-page ruling, Borenstein wrote that physicial evidence
of abuse by LaFave was at best inconclusive, and almost
nonexistent, and that the children's testimony had been ``forever
tainted'' by repetitive and leading questioning techniques by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court said Wednesday that Borenstein's assertion
that there was no evidence to support the children's testimony
``discounts the child witnesses' symptoms that were consistent with
sexual abuse and the corroborating testimony of the children's
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   LeFave and her mother had been granted a new trial in 1995 by
Superior Court Judge Robert Barton, who ruled that their rights to
confront their accusers had been violated by a special courtroom
seating arrangement for the child witnesses. But the SJC vacated
that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave and her mother continued to stay out of prison while
subsequent appeals where heard.
</P>
<P>
   Violet Amirault died of cancer at age 74 in September 1997.

BUSH PICKS LAWYER TO OVERSEE TEXAS' PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush named as commissioner of
public education Wednesday an Odessa lawyer who promised to ``stay
the course'' on tough education standards but who doesn't know
where he stands on private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush named James E. Nelson to oversee Texas' public schools,
which educate 3.9 &UR;  &LR; million students. He succeeds Mike Moses, who is
leaving to take a post at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Nelson will head up the Texas Education Agency,
which sets standards for the state's more than 1,000 school
districts. The new commissioner will be entering territory that at
times was like a mine field for his predecessor _ particularly when
it came to dealing with the State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   During his four years as commissioner, Moses was caught in
battles between social conservatives and the liberal and moderate
factions on the board _ especially when it came to adopting
curriculum standards, investment policies, textbook adoptions and
basic skills testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an open person,'' Nelson said in response to questions
about how he will deal with the dynamics on the state board. ``I
don't keep secrets. I don't have an agenda other than what's up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of career educators had been in the running
for the post, Bush said he picked the 49-year-old father of three
because he wanted ``an educational entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for someone ... willing to challenge the status
quo,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 196 Nelson has chaired the State Board for Educator
Certification. Bush appointed Nelson to this citizen-advisory
committee, which is charged with establishing credentials for
teachers, licensing them and holding colleges and universities to
teacher-preparation standards. He also is a past president of the
Ector County School Board and the Texas Association of School
Boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Nelson is committed to local control of schools, he
believes in setting high standards, and he believes in holding
school districts accountable for results,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson in turn praised Bush and Moses, saying that the reading
initiative they spearheaded ``will leave a legacy that you can be
proud of all of your life, and I think it will be a legacy that any
governor in this country would be proud to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Moses, Nelson said, ``If I can be half the
commissioner that he has has been during my time, then I know I
will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every intention of staying the course,'' he said.
``What has been accomplished over the (past) 4 1/2 years needs to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he referred to raising standards and emphasizing
local control, adding, ``I know that the people in Austin don't
have all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   On two controversial education issues _ charter schools and
tax-funded vouchers for private education _ Nelson indicated
different levels of commitment, at least at this point.
</P>
<P>
   He said he supports expanding the number of publicly funded
charter schools, which Bush has touted as one way of providing
parents with an option for their children's education, despite
serious problems a few charter schools are experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there have been problems with a very small number of
the charter schools,'' he said. ``You need to give parents
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the subject of vouchers _ which Bush has endorsed as a
way of providing more options for parents of children in failing
schools _ Nelson said he does not know whether they would hurt
public schools. Voucher legislation has failed in the last three
legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' he said. ``I would have to think long and
hard, but I don't think it's something the commissioner of
education is going to have to spend a lot of time worrying about.
I'm not going to be the commissioner of voucher schools, I'm going
to be the commissioner of public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said his job as chief of the public school system would
be to see to it that voucher proponents have very few
low-performing schools from which to lure students away. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Nelson's appointment is subject to confirmation of the Texas
Senate, which does not meet again until 2001. He said he hopes to
be on the job shortly after Labor Day but must close down his legal
practice in Odessa first. Moses' last day on the job is Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's choice for education commissioner was met with mixed
enthusiasm from a number of statewide education groups.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Rogers, executive director of the Association of Texas
Professional Educators, said that group is prepared to work with
Nelson but had hoped that the governor would appoint ``someone with
classroom experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Teachers Association praised Bush's selection.
``We are comfortable with Commissioner Nelson's leadership style
and have enjoyed a cordial and professional relationship with him
during his tenure as head of the (teacher certification board),''
said TSTA president Ignacio Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Classroom Teachers Association said Nelson is familiar
with education policy and is ``fair-minded and very open to
listening to a variety of perspectives.''

   IZMIT, Turkey _ Engulfed in the darkness of collapsed concrete
early Tuesday morning, Nuray Yildiz heard people screaming her name
but could not answer with more than gasps.
</P>
<P>
   Gulping fresh air from a small pathway through the debris, the
14-year-old spent the next twelve hours clawing her way out while
her parents and neighbors tried to dig their way in without
accidentally killing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought, I cannot die but I am waiting to die,'' the
brown-haired teen-ager recalled Wednesday. ``When I realized I
could breathe, I knew I wasn't completely underground and had a way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuray's 10-year-old brother, Omer, never did find a way out. Nor
did her aunt in the room next door. Nor did at least a thousand
others who died in this gritty industrial city near the epicenter
of Turkey's most brutal earthquake on record.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the quake's death toll across Turkey climbed,
people here spent their day digging, sifting, grieving and
increasingly despairing that those who had not escaped from the
rubble were probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   They watched as bulldozers and front-end loaders tried to
unearth bedrooms, which is where most people were when the
earthquake struck before dawn on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, amid dust and smoke and sweltering heat, residents picked
through the rubble with hammers and chisels and bare hands. As
delicately as if they were on an archaeological dig, they teased
out shreds of clothing, old photos, scraps of furniture and,
inevitably, bodies.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of heroes or valiant efforts. But there
was a desperate shortage of equipment and rescue workers, who were
stretched over thousands of individual catastrophes spread over
hundreds of square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all the good will, Izmit remained wildly out of
control Wednesday. Soldiers and relief workers were all but
invisible at many of the worst sites. And just a few minutes' walk
from where Nuray and her family had pitched a tent of scrap wood
and carpets, Turkey's biggest oil refinery continued to burn
uncontrollably and spew vast clouds of black smoke for the second
full day.
</P>
<P>
   The closer one traveled to Izmit itself, the more pervasive the
destruction. Here, minarets on many local mosques looked like twigs
snapped in the wind. Along Highway E-5 through the center of town,
buildings on almost every block had been either flattened or ripped
open as if a hurricane had swept through. Many leaned more steeply
than the Tower of Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women tended to divide their labor. Women congregated in
improvised camp sites, caring for children. Men stayed near the
piles of rubble, heaving aside rock and searching for bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the bulldozers and other heavy construction equipment
would lift off ceilings and carve a path through to where the
bedrooms were supposed to be. Neighborhood men and boys then did
the more delicate job of sifting for bodies and personal
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   But there weren't nearly enough government bulldozers, and it
was not until 2:10 p.m. Wednesday afternoon that one even turned up
on the street where Hakki Ercan grieved over the multiple deaths in
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Ercan, 64, had managed to persuade a private construction
company to lend its bulldozer for the five-story apartment building
owned by a relative.
</P>
<P>
   But by Wednesday afternoon, he was coping with death from two
forms of collapse. The first came when his daughter-in-law was
crushed under under four stories of concrete. The second was when
his son, who had been pulled out by neighbors and taken off in an
ambulance, found out his wife was dead. Ercan's son suffered a
heart attack and died shortly after he arrived at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst tragedy I have ever seen in my life,'' said
Ercan, a burly gray-haired man. Casting aside Turkish male
stoicism, he wept.
</P>
<P>
   Yumus, Ercan's 16-year-old nephew, added: ``We felt death, and
I'm still feeling death. I just want to get out of this hell.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there was no leaving. Atmis Euler Mahalles spent hours
Wednesday afternoon gingerly chipping away at the building next to
the Ercans'.
</P>
<P>
   The task was both dangerous and horrifying. The sea-blue,
five-story building had split in two, with the top two stories of
the right side plunging straight down to ground level while the
left side remained bizarrely normal.
</P>
<P>
   Still buried in the rubble was an eight-year-old girl. Mahalles,
a friend of the girl's family, stooped below a crumbling concrete
precipice that jutted out from what had been the third-floor
balcony but was now just five feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Using hammer, chisel and metal-cutters to snap the mangled steel
reinforcements, Mahalles poked and scraped beneath the precipice in
a painstaking effort to reach inside. A blue-and-green highchair
lay crunched in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Under a shared tent just across the road from the garish
yellow-and-green facade of an Aktuel supermarket, mothers,
grandmothers and children huddled with Nuray Yildiz, angry at their
helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you even bother writing pointlessly in your notebook?''
erupted Hatice Hasan, a mother in her 30s, as a reporter
approached. ``What we need is help! We need food and medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else under the tent, neither Mrs. Hasan nor her
8-year-old son Huseyin had eaten anything all day. Like them, she
had no money, no home and no possessions. And like them, she had
yet to see a social worker or government official since the
earthquake occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the others, Mrs. Hasan had yet another imperative:
her son Huseyin has leukemia, needed blood and was weakening
quickly. No one had a car to drive them to their pediatric hospital
in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why aren't the Americans doing anything?'' she lashed out in a
rage. ``Where is the government? They haven't done one thing for
us!''
</P>
<P>
   Then she dissolved in tears, quickly followed by the other
women.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking just a short distance behind the women was yet another
menacing problem and perhaps the most dramatic sign of how
overwhelmed the Turkish government was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Down a short road behind the supermarket lay the huge refinery
owned by Turkey's state-owned Tupla oil company. It had burst into
flames shortly after the earthquake hit Tuesday morning and been
throwing up plumes of smoke as high as 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, Turkish officials insisted they had the
fire extinguished. In reality, the fire was still going strong and
the refinery site had been almost entirely abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, military airplanes doused the site with water
sporadically during the morning and early afternoon as government
officials waited for more powerful fire-fighting equipment from
France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But around 4 p.m., the refinery erupted in a spectacular new
blaze that was visible from miles away and at midnight it was still
raging.

 &HT;    FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WHO CRASH AND BURN, DEFEAT IS
FLEETING
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects spelling of Linda DiVall in last two grafs.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The winners of presidential elections ultimately
belong to the ages, but the losers belong to the families, close
friends and staunch supporters who share the agony of their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the losers set off on their next political quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it enters the bloodstream, the disease of running for
president can only be cured by embalming fluid,'' the late Mo
Udall, defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 Democratic primaries,
once quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who crash and burn en route to the White House,
like Lamar Alexander and John Kasich did in the Republican contest
this summer, eventually return to the political battlefield in some
capacity _ but rarely with the same bloodlust for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who outspent his opponents in GOP
primary elections four years ago, but managed only a handful of
votes.
</P>

   ``I spoke, and it turned out no one was listening,'' said Gramm,

who have failed in their bids for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Or like John Glenn, the astronaut-turned-senator who seemed to
have the right stuff 15 years ago but whose candidacy fizzled on
the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has rarely spoken of his disastrous campaign for president
in 1984. But he spoke about the stigma of defeat with The
Washington Post three years ago: ``You wonder whether people are
going to look down their noses at you and say, 'Boy, is he a
dumbbell for trying to run for president! What made him think he
could do that?' But when I came back to the Senate, I threw myself
into my committee work, and nobody thought I was any less capable
because I tried for a higher office.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of them, though, regardless of how many times they fail
in politics, losing the presidency is a painful, gut-wrenching
experience, as two-time Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson captured
so accurately in an often-borrowed lament of losers: ``I'm too old
to cry, but it hurts too much to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of effort you have to put into one of these campaigns
is so substantial and costly in terms of money and emotion that you
couldn't be human and not be pained by losing,'' said noted
presidential historian Robert Dallek. ``These are real-life
aspirations of human beings that we watch die on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, author Richard Ben Cramer, in his book ``What It Takes''
about the 1988 campaign, captured a rarely seen moment of human
frailty in presidential politics: two-time presidential loser Jesse
Jackson gathering Dick Gephardt into a bear hug on the night of the
Michigan primary as Gephardt, realizing his dream had ended, wept
``on the breast of the only man in that room who could really
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the end was coming, but it was still so depressing,''
said former Gephardt aide Linda Moore, now the deputy director of
political affairs in the Clinton White House. ``You work so hard
for so long and it ends so suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   So suddenly, in fact, that Gephardt and his wife Jane, after his
official withdrawal from the race, had to leave a campaign staff
party to get home before his Secret Service protection expired that
evening at midnight. ``He turned into a pumpkin,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it deflates you is a massive understatement,'' former
Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker once said of his unsuccessful 1980
campaign for the GOP nomination. He compared it to the death of his
wife. ``You feel just drained ... you feel empty.''
</P>
<P>
   And often, in the bone-tiring whirl of modern presidential
campaigns, the candidates are the last to know when they have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, writing in 1988 about coming up
short in the 1980 GOP contest, confessed that it took longtime
confidante Jim Baker to silence his vows to carry on the campaign
against Ronald Reagan, the ultimate winner. ``The campaign is
finished, George,'' Baker informed him.
</P>
<P>
   Some never get that far.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Babbitt, always popular with reporters, was one of the
early casualties of the 1988 Democratic contest, dropping out
before some news organizations had even published profiles of the
former Arizona governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press won't have Bruce Babbitt to puff up anymore,'' he
declared in a tone of mock vengefulness on the day that he dropped
out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bush, Babbitt, Howard Baker and Gephardt, like so
many others who have sought the presidency, eventually bounced
back. Bush was elected president in 1988. Babbitt has been
secretary of the interior since 1993. Baker became the Senate
Majority Leader, then White House chief of staff for Reagan. And
Gephardt is the Democratic Leader in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Similary, Glenn became an elder statesman in the Senate and
eventually made a triumphant return to space. And Gramm got his
first committee chairmanship in the Senate, a position of influence
that exceeds the power of any post he held while pursing the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But some never lose the urge. Bob Dole, who lost in 1996, 1988
and 1980, is ``looking for opportunities'' to get out on the
campaign trail again, for his wife Elizabeth Dole, according to
Linda DiVall, Dole's pollster in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many individuals get a chance to be in a position to run
for president of the United States,'' said DiVall, who worked for
Gramm in 1996. ``So you would hope that there's no recriminations,
that there's no sense of bitterness. They should be proud that they
got to the point of where they could run for president. I hope
that's what they're left with.''

 &HT;    EDS: Corrects spelling of Linda DiVall in last two grafs.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The winners of presidential elections ultimately
belong to the ages, but the losers belong to the families, close
friends and staunch supporters who share the agony of their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the losers set off on their next political quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it enters the bloodstream, the disease of running for
president can only be cured by embalming fluid,'' the late Mo
Udall, defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 Democratic primaries,
once quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who crash and burn en route to the White House,
like Lamar Alexander and John Kasich did in the Republican contest
this summer, eventually return to the political battlefield in some
capacity _ but rarely with the same bloodlust for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who outspent his opponents in GOP
primary elections four years ago, but managed only a handful of
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke, and it turned out no one was listening,'' said Gramm,
resorting to the self-deprecating humor that is typical of those
who have failed in their bids for the White House.
</P>

N. KOREA SAYS IT'S READY TO TALK, EASING TENSIONS OVER MISSILE
TEST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The crisis over a possible long-range missile test by
North Korea appeared to be easing Wednesday, after the Communist
government said that it was ready to negotiate with ``hostile
nations'' like the United States, Japan and South Korea, which have
adamantly opposed the missile launch.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement carried by North Korea's foreign news agency, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``As regards the missile issue, we
are always ready for negotiation if the hostile nations honestly
ask for it out of an intention to alleviate our concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was the first conciliatory gesture by North Korea
in a tense, month-long conflict in which the United States, Japan,
and South Korea threatened to cut off all foreign aid and
remittances if North Korea proceeded with the test.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, responded to the
statement by saying, ``We've seen a number of statements that have
hopeful elements to it, but we're in the business of focusing on
commitments made through the formal diplomatic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials have said that the missile North Korea
plans to test-fire was an advanced version of the Taepodong rocket
it launched last year. The new Taepodong II has greater accuracy
and range and could theoretically reach Alaska or Hawaii, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   While some Western and Asian embassy officials in Japan and
South Korea said the statement paves the way for a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, others warned against reading too much into
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missile crisis doesn't appear to be worsening, but we
still have a long way to go before it's over,'' said a South Korean
diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats said that it was futile to interpret such
statements by North Korea as having any meaning. ``This is a very
dangerous country that makes a promise not to do something one day,
and totally reneges the next,'' said a Western diplomat, speaking
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that North Korea might be softening its position
came on Monday when CNN reported that officials close to North
Korea's dictator Kim Jong Il had expressed optimism that a
diplomatic solution could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the visitor comes and offers us a cake, we'll respond with
a cake,'' CNN quoted Kim Yong Sun, a secretary of Pyongyang's Korea
Workers Party, as saying. ``But if somebody comes with a sword or
knife, we'll respond with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and South Korea have been conducting joint
military operations near the heavily fortified border with North
Korea. North Korea has warned the drills could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Wednesday, North Korea said that it has been
compelled to develop missiles because the United States keeps
troops and weapons in South Korea and still harbors intentions to
invade the North.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that North Korea, which is in dire
financial straits and suffering from widespread famine, is using
the missile test threat to gain economic aid and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the Clinton administration has proposed
lifting an embargo on trade between the two countries in exchange
for a moratorium on missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also proposed increased relief aid and the
possibility of eventually releasing some frozen North Korean
assets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some foreign ministry officials in Japan and South Korea
expressed doubt that North Korea would walk away from a fight so
easily. ``This missile is one of the last few leverages Pyongyang
has to negotiate with foreign countries,'' one official said.

 &HT;    Your Y2K shopping list
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Retired teacher Shirley Boggus says she is not
panicky about Y2K. But she believes in being prepared _ just in
case, in the dawn of 2000, mixed-up computers turn off the light in
her fridge, shut down her water supply or put a dent in her grocery
store's supplies. She wants to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need to stock up? How do I read the dates on cans,
dry milk, rice and stuff?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Like many, Boggus is getting her cans in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Although predictions on how Y2K _ the flipping of computer
calendars to 2000 _ will affect our lives range from pandemonium to
piddly-pat, cautious types are taking no chances in the kitchen.
They are stocking up on water and nonperishable foods. For some,
it's simply extra cans of beans. For others, it's camping food or a
stash of MREs, those military Meals Ready-to-Eat that soldiers take
into battle.
</P>
<P>
   At the Banana Bay Trading Co. in Austin, which stocks MREs for
civilians, operations manager Karl Nutting says the complete
nonperishable meal packets are selling well above average this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on in the year, when they first started talking about
Y2K, we had a rush on MREs. They became scarce and it drove the
price up. Then it fell off a little. Now we're getting more
inquiries again,'' he says. The packs, which meet the daily
nutritional needs of an adult, are sold individually ($6.99) or by
the case ($79.50 for 12 assorted meals).
</P>
<P>
   At REI, freeze-dried food goes out the door as soon as it comes
in. ``Sales have probably increased 23 percent in 1999,'' says Jim
Hansel, manager for the recreational equipment store. And many of
the buyers are people who have never entered the store before, not
seasoned campers, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Although disaster experts say such shelf-stable edibles are
fine, it is not necessary to purchase food you wouldn't ordinarily.
The easiest and most economical way to stockpile for any potential
emergency _ flood, ice storm, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or Y2K
_ is simply to increase the amount of basic foods you usually keep
on your shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch-style beans, canned fruit, crackers, peanut butter, soups,
tuna _ that's what Claudia Codina, public relations coordinator for
the American Red Cross of Central Texas, is tucking in her pantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we say, if stocking up, is to make it things
you would normally buy, not foods you are unfamiliar with,'' she
says. The reason is twofold: If Y2K comes and goes without a blip,
as many expect, you are not stuck with a bunch of supplies you
might not use. But should there turn out to be something to this
Y2K thing, familiar foods will bring comfort. Call it a mental
health thing.
</P>
<P>
   The selections should be foods needing minimal cooking and sized
to eliminate leftovers requiring refrigeration. Although
survivalist types are stocking up propane for gas grills or camp
stoves and charcoal, remember such cookery must be done outside.
MREs may be cool because they come with heat packs, but ordinary
peanut butter and crackers need no warming.
</P>
<P>
   Experts disagree on how much food to stock.
</P>
<P>
   Treat the Y2K mania like a winter storm, Codina suggests.
Translation for Central Texans: enough food and water for three
days so you could exist without leaving the house. The American Red
Cross's Y2K brochure suggests extending that supply to a week. And
the Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends two weeks, even
though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your food
supply for that long.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we might run out of chips _ some consider that to be a
real emergency _ but we can exist without them. For a long time. In
fact, if activity is reduced, healthy people (exceptions: children
and pregnant women) can survive on half their usual food intake for
an extended period and without any food for many days, FEMA says.
(Could this be the new Y2K Post-Holiday Diet?)
</P>
<P>
   Central Texans, however, cannot live by food alone. The experts
admonish us that water is even more important than chips or beans
and tortillas. The general guide for storing for emergencies is a
gallon a day per healthy person _ 2 quarts for drinking, 2 for
hygiene. (In hot environments, double that amount.)
</P>
<P>
   Recyclers, here's your big moment. Plastic 2-liter soda bottles
are a terrific way to store water. Wash them well, fill them, label
them and store in a cool, dark place, rotating every six months.
</P>
<P>
   So where are you going to put all this stuff? Under the bed?
Probably OK if you get your dirty socks out. In the oven? That's
fine, assuming you never use it. In the trunk of the car or garage?
Nope, too hot in Texas. Look for a cool, dark, dry place.
</P>
<P>
   How long can you keep this giant bag of groceries? Six months to
two years, depending on the product and who you ask. For canned
goods, the general guide is two years from date of purchase. But
don't bother trying to figure out all that coding stamped on cans
of food. Written in manufacturese, it varies from company to
company but usually includes time, place and batch of canning, not
a use-by date or date of purchase. (If you really have a need to
know, call the manufacturer to find out how to decipher its
particular code.)
</P>
<P>
   Is all this stockpiling much ado about nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Howard Miller thinks so. Miller, a University of Texas associate
professor of history, has taught a seminar on millenniumism in
American culture. He has no plans to buy water or extra food. ``The
real problem is not going to be those computers,'' he says, ``but
people responding to those rumors and our need to somehow get
excited about something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be concerned about those computers,'' he stresses. ``Be
concerned about human nature. We do not handle mass panic very
well. That could be quite serious. So could people trying to use
generators and stoves that they have no idea how to run. That could
be dangerous, too.''
</P>
<P>
   More so than missing a meal or two in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Boy Scout types who want to ``put by'' a few things for this
occasion or any potential disaster need to practice two more
points: 1. Get a manual can opener. 2. Pick up some pet food or you
might be sharing your beef jerky with Fido.
</P>
<P>
   Storage tips
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep food in a dry, cool spot _ a dark area if possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep food covered at all times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Open food boxes or cans carefully so that you can close them
tightly after each use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrap cookies and crackers in plastic bags, and keep them in
tight containers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Empty opened packages of sugar, dried fruits and nuts into
screw-top jars or airtightcans to protect them from pests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inspect food for signs of spoilage before use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use foods before they go bad, and replace them with fresh
supplies, dated with ink or marker. Place new items at the back of
the storage area and older ones in front.

<P>
   _ Bottled water
</P>
<P>
   If the world is in chaos on Jan. 1, we are all going to need
some luck.
</P>
<P>
   Water, water, where?
</P>
<P>
   For emergencies, store a gallon a person a day. But if water
runs low, resist the temptation to ration. Instead, drink the
amount you need and look for more for the next day. You can use the
water in your hot-water tank, pipes and ice cubes. As a last
resort, you can use the water in the reservoir tank of your toilet,
not the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Purify water from lakes, rain, rivers, springs and streams
before taking a big gulp, using it for cooking or for hygiene.
(Avoid water with floating material, an odor or dark color.)
Purifying will kill most microbes but will not remove heavy metals,
salts and most other chemicals. Before purifying, let any suspended
particles settle to the bottom or strain them through a paper towel
or clean cloth.
</P>
<P>
   1. Boiling: Safest method of purifying water. Bring water to a
rolling boil for three to five minutes, keeping in mind that some
will evaporate. Let the water cool before drinking. Boiled water
will taste better if you put oxygen back into it by pouring it back
and forth between two clean containers. This will also improve the
taste of stored water.
</P>
<P>
   2. Disinfection. Use household bleach that contains 5.25 percent
sodium hypochlorite. Do not use scented, color-safe or added
cleaner bleaches. Add 16 drops of bleach per gallon of water, stir
and let stand for 30 minutes. If the water does not have a slight
bleach odor, repeat dosage and let stand another 15 minutes.

   BOTLIKH, Russia _ From a trench on a hill overlooking the front
lines in Dagestan, the new Russian commander-in-chief, Colonel
General Viktor Kazantsev, gestured at the surrounding mountains
that have become both his best ally and his greatest enemy.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 days of heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of
positions held by Islamic rebels, Russian troops have fought their
way to the commanding heights overlooking Botlikh, the center of
the battle with some 2,000 militants.
</P>
<P>
   But once the troops get up there, they see that the rebels have
many more places to hide in the caves and craggy slopes in this
barren Caucasus frontier land. And they see that there are even
more mountains to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to find 124 needles in 10 haystacks, and you
don't have a magnet, and the needles can kill you,'' said a
grim-face Russian soldier, peering through the sights of his
Kalashnikov assault rifle from his post on one of the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders in Moscow say they will crush the rebels and
wrap up the fighting within a week. But nothing about the fighting
around Botlikh indicates a quick and easy end to the conflict. It
is the greatest challenge to Russia's authority over this southern
region since federal troops fought a bloody and disastrous
1994-1996 war against separatists in neighboring Chechnya, some of
whom now lead the Dagestan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Russian military said they had lost eight dead
and 20 wounded in heavy fighting around Tando, a rebel-held village
several miles north of Botlikh. The rebels reported light losses,
but said more than 60 Russian soldiers were killed. Neither figure
could be independently confirmed, but the village was still in
rebel hands at nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops backed by jets and helicopter gunships also
claimed control of the Kharami mountain pass on the border between
Dagestan and Chechnya, which has served as an important
infiltration route for the rebels, according to the Russian
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops around Botlikh said their units had suffered a
number of casualties that the military had yet to admit. Many of
these men were still trapped in areas close to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Even as General Kazantsev insisted Wednesday that the
surrounding villages would be freed ``in a matter of days,'' a
helicopter flew in to an improvised airfield _ avoiding the better
but more vulnerable aerodrome where rebels shot down three federal
helicopters last week _ to carry away more wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians say the rebels, who invaded Dagestan from Chechnya
on Aug. 7 and proclaimed an independent Islamic state, are trapped.
Russia's Interior Ministry says a large force of up to 2,000
insurgents are surrounded in the villages around Botlikh, Ansalta,
Rakhata and Tando.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Moscow Dagestan police and volunteer forces say another
force of up to 2,000 men is trying to cross into Dagestan from
Chechnya at the border village of Andi, near the Kharami pass.
Russian spokesmen speak of hundreds of rebel casualties and tell of
radio intercepts that reflect dissension and panic among the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rebel's supreme commander, Shamil Basayev, put
his troops on alert in preparation for the next stage of his
assault on Dagestan. Stage two, code named ``Imam Gamzat Bek,'' is
believed by the Russian military to involve an attack on two major
cities on Dagestan's lowland border with Chechnya, Kizlyar and
Khasavyurt.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the prospect of a new Chechen attack is a source of
dread. Military analysts express amazement at how easily the rebels
crossed into Dagestan, and how slowly the Russian military reacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are observing in Dagestan gives us no reason to
believe in the quick victory our military leaders are talking
about,'' commented Alexander Golts, a military analyst for the
magazine Itogi. ``They've learned nothing from the shame of
Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has admitted its displeasure by replacing Interior
Ministry Colonel General Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov with an army
general, Kazantsev, as its commander in the campaign. Russian
military sources said that Ovchinnikov was ``unprepared'' for
mountain warfare and had trouble ``organizing troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev arrived in
Dagestan to oversee the campaign. While Sergeyev expressed
confidence that the battle would be over soon, the Dagestanis are
becoming restless.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that war could spread to the breakaway republic of
Chechnya next door, which declared a state of emergency after
Russian forces launched air strikes last week on the Chechen side
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are we going to admit that this is a full-scale war?,'' a
Dagestani official, Gadzhi Makhachev, told a meeting of military
leaders that was shown on Russian television. Makhachev, who wore
combat fatigues, said 25,000 Dagestanis had volunteered to fight
the rebels but lacked proper armament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us cannons, mortars, helicopters, everything that the
enemy has,'' Makhachev said.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers have been a big surprise for Chechen-led rebels,
who were most likely hoping for at least some popular support for
their self-proclaimed indepedent Islamic republic from the mainly
Muslim Dagestanis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian military sources, a Jordanian-born rebel
commander who goes by the name Khattab, whose wife is from
Dagestan, had guessed that there would be no problem winning over
the population of this impoverished and disaffected region. No
doubt Khattab counted on the fact that Dagestan, a fragile
patchwork of 40 ethnic groups, is a land rife with internal
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dagestanis, despite voicing displeasure with the way that
Moscow ignores their plight, are showing themselves even less
willing to come under the thumb of their Moslem neighbors, the
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides, how can these people be Muslims, if they bring
violence to other Muslims?,'' said Mogamed Debirov, a Botlikh
resident manning a makeshift checkpoint on a hill overlooking town.
Debirov's men have 20 rifles supplied by the federal troops, but no
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is ready to fight but we have no weapons,'' said
Muradis Guseinov, 34, a Botlikh resident who served as a
paratrooper the Soviet military in Afghanistan. Young, unemployed,
and with few prospects for a better life in this impoverished
mountain village, Guseinov knows he is just the kind of man the the
insurgents would like to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably thought that they would get support here,'' he
said. ``They were very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dagestanis have already helped the federal troops. As well
as the rebels prepared for their offensive _ Russian intelligence
and Dagestani police now say they knew of the militants' plans to
invade months ago _ the locals know the rugged, roadless terrain
even better. With Dagestanis' help, Russian police said Sunday they
were able to locate a group of rebels hiding in a cave on a
mountain known as the ``Wasp's Ear.'' Federal forces bombarded the
rocks above the cave, trapping and killing everyone inside, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dagestanis have also given the Russians permission to
bombard their towns to drive out the rebels, removing a potential
source of tension that was always present in the Chechnya conflict.
There, federal troops turned even loyal Chechens into rebels with
their brutal and indiscriminate bombing. Here, the Russians have
tried to be cautious, refusing to attack towns where the rebels are
holed up among Dagestani civilians.
</P>
<P>
   One of these towns is Ansalta, where Imzat Muslimova, 28,
stepped outside her modest farmhouse Aug. 7 to find dozens of
well-armed men in combat fatigues waiting in her courtyard _ the
Islamic militants led by Basayev and Khattab. ``Imam Gazi
Magomed,'' the first stage of Basayev's plan, had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in while we were asleep, they didn't wake people up,
they just sat in the yard, a few of them in every yard,'' said
Muslimova last week in the region's capital, Makhachkala. She is
among the 10,000 Dagestanis who have fled the fighting. ``They took
away the policemen's guns _ there were just four boys in the
precinct, what could they do? They said `We are of Islam, we won't
do anything bad to you, we are against Russia, we want Islamic
rule.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Muslimova said the men of her village were still there, virtual
human shields for the rebels. Prevented from attacking the village,
Russian warplanes has launched dozens of raids in the surrounding
mountains to strike rebels whenever they try to move.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of those sorties has been in question from the
outset, when a Russian jet mistakenly bombed the village of Omala
in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, wounding three residents.
Russia at first denied the bombing, but Wednesday the foreign
ministry issued an apology to Georgia and offered compensation for
the Aug. 9 incident.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police have issued daily reports saying Khattab, the
Jordian-born field commander of the rebels, had been badly wounded.
But reporters who saw Khattab Monday said the burly commander only
had a bandage around his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have charged that many of the rebels are
foreign mercenaries who are funded by unnamed ``Islamic states.''
But reporters who have visited rebel bases say their fighters
include mainly young men from Chechnya, Dagestan and other parts of
the predominantly Muslim Caucasus Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Russians' sheer superiority in firepower and men
seems to point to a sure victory, the only sure thing in Botlikh
this week was the way that the helicopters continued to land,
flying in ammunition and flying out casualties.
</P>
<P>
   All the while they avoided the airfield where the tail of one of
the downed helicopters protruded from the wreckage, its rotor
whirling in the gust like a weathervane.

ART TREASURES BOUGHT BY JAPANESE IN BETTER TIMES NOW QUIETLY RESOLD
ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With the stealth of a cat burglar, famous art is leaving
Japan. Only a handful of bankers and art dealers know for sure
where it is going, and they are not talking.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, including large numbers of van Goghs,
Modiglianis, Renoirs and Picassos that vanished into Japan more
than a decade ago, are being resold abroad as a result of Japan's
economic problems. The paintings' whereabouts are now becoming even
greater mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already lost so much; we are losing so much still _
and I don't mean just we Japanese,'' said Shin'ichi Segi, an art
critic who has tried to track the migration of paintings in and out
of Japan with only limited success. ``The trail is going cold,
perhaps forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Official trade figures show that from 1987 through 1991, the
Japanese spent more than 1 trillion yen, or $8.7 billion at current
exchange rates, on art. Many art dealers and scholars said the
actual value was probably triple that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese collectors bought at least five of the most expensive
works of art ever sold at auction, but only one, van Gogh's
``Sunflowers,'' is still in Japan, in the corporate collection of
Yasuda Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The other four _ van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' Renoir's
``Au Moulin de la Galette'' and Picasso's ``Acrobat and Young
Harlequin'' and ``Pierrette's Wedding'' _ have left Japan,
apparently ending up in Europe or the United States, along with
countless other paintings bought by the Japanese when their bubble
economy was at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a loss of face associated with this art,'' said Chieko
Hasegawa, owner of the Nichido Gallery in Ginza. ``The sale of
these paintings sends two messages: that you have financial
difficulties and that you paid too much for them from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of Japanese purchases in the late 1980s and early
'90s sparked a wave of resentment in the art world comparable with
the uproar that ensued when Japanese companies bought Rockefeller
Center in New York and the famous golf course at Pebble Beach,
Calif. Curators and dealers regarded the Japanese purchases as
losses. Some of the most prominent pieces disappeared into private
homes and were rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the trophy prices that Japanese investors paid for
real estate collapsed. Confronted with the fact that the value of
their collateral did not match the value of their loans, banks
began staking claims to whatever assets they could get their hands
on, including art. In some cases, financial institutions even lent
money to collectors expressly for the purpose of purchasing art, so
that art was the collateral. More rarely, the financial
institutions themselves bought paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many of the paintings purchased during that time ended up
in the financial system. Although the rest of the world considers
them treasures, in Japan they are literally bad assets, commonly
referred to as ``bad-debt art,'' the legacy of an era of profligate
spending and lending that many would like to forget.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some paintings have been located. The San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art, for instance, recently acquired 10 works from
Fukuoka City Bank, but the museum initially had to swear not to
identify the specific works, the deal or the seller. Since then,
however, the bank itself has talked about the sale.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dr. Gachet'' and ``Moulin de la Galette,'' the two most
expensive paintings ever bought at auction, have not been traced.
In the spring of 1990, Ryoei Saito, then president of Daishowa
Paper Manufacturing Co., paid a total of $160.6 million for the two
paintings. Soon afterward Saito sent shivers through the art world
when he said he intended to take the paintings to his grave,
literally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, however, bad debts caught up with Daishowa and Saito.
His creditors cut off his control of Daishowa and seized the
paintings, which then disappeared into their warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for selling the paintings fell to Fuji Bank,
one of Daishowa's biggest creditors, and for five years, art
dealers and collectors courted the bank. But Fuji held on to the
paintings until 1997, when it sold ``Moulin de la Galette'' to an
unidentified foreign buyer. Segi believes that it fetched roughly
$52.1 million, or two-thirds of the $78.1 million Saito paid for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Gachet'' has also been sold by Fuji, art dealers said, but
no one knows who bought it, or when or for how much, although
dealers assume that it sold for less than the $82.5 million it cost
Saito. One recent report on German television said the piece had
been sold to an American investor for $43 million, but art experts
are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Bank declined to comment, as did Sumitomo Bank, Mitsui
Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and several other Japanese financial
institutions whose names have been linked to art sales.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' silence is partly an effort to protect themselves.
The rules delineating ownership of property seized as collateral
are murky in Japan, art experts said, and bank executives place a
premium on their relationships with borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite pressure from the government for reform, the process
of selling off ``bad-debt art'' is proceeding very slowly, as most
negotiations do in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's Japan has been paying polite calls on collectors and
banks since 1992, when it became clear that an economic tailspin
would start pushing sales of art bought during the bubble. Last
year Christie's effort paid off when it won the right to sell some
500 works of art in the collection and warehouses of the bankrupt
Lake Corp., giving the auction house its best year ever in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Findlay, Christie's international director for 19th- and
20th- century art, said the Japanese had been deeply disappointed
by the yawning gap between the book value of the art they hold and
its market value. Christie's initial bit of business tended to be
appraisals aimed at helping sellers meet their accounting needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could take a $2 million loss that year, we helped them
select the painting and get it sold,'' Findlay said.
</P>
<P>
   The art market has also started picking up steam, so that the
gap between book value and market value has narrowed, encouraging
financial institutions to sell.
</P>
<P>
   But ownership issues still loom large, Findlay and others say.
``These paintings do not belong to the banks,'' Segi said. ``They
exist in a kind of no man's land between their owners and the
financial institutions that have seized them as collateral.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said a potential buyer would have to get the approval of both
the nominal owner of the painting and the financial institution
holding it. The heavy emphasis on relationships in Japanese
business means that many owners can choose not to sell their
holdings. For instance, a bank may elect to keep a painting in its
warehouse in lieu of selling it, so long as the original owner
continues to make interest payments on his outstanding debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person has to die or declare legal bankruptcy before the
ownership problems clear up,'' Segi said, and people rarely declare
bankruptcy in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The death of Saito, erstwhile owner of ``Dr. Gachet'' and
``Moulin de la Galette,'' in March 1996 probably had as much to do
with Fuji's decision to sell it as any improvement in the art
market or government pressure, a Fuji official hinted.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiyoda Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance Co., an affiliate of the
Toyota group, recently arranged the sale of a Braque that belonged
to Tomonori Tsurumaki, a former real estate and race track mogul
with loose ties to Japanese gangsters whose business was all but
bankrupt. Tsurumaki himself helped Chiyoda with the sale, Segi and
others said.
</P>
<P>
   Findlay of Christie's said that ownership issues were less
complex here than many suggest. ``Anyone who can produce the work
of art is in a position to sell it,'' he said. ``In Japan, many
dealers and agents peddle transparencies and color copies of works,
and they are usually fishing for offers or trying to get free
appraisal advice. I prefer to deal only with individuals or
companies who can actually show me the works of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's may also be deferring to the Japanese respect for
relationships and original ownership. It is currently the custodian
of what is perhaps the most mysterious painting in modern history,
``Pierrette's Wedding,'' which was part of the collateral retained
by Lake when GE Capital Corp. bought Lake's consumer finance
business.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was taken from Tsurumaki as his business empire
crumbled and was stored in the warehouse of Mitsui Trust for a
time. Findlay confirmed that the painting was no longer in Japan,
where it was exhibited only once before Tsurumaki was forced to
part with it. But Findlay insisted it was not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in the private market,'' he said. ``It is not being
offered. I don't think this is the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Has Tsurumaki requested that Christie's hold off on a sale of
the elusive ``Pierrette,'' hoping perhaps that he might one day
retrieve it? Tsurumaki is not saying, and neither is Findlay.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``These paintings coming out of Japan are being bought by
wealthy people who lead private lives,'' Findlay said. ``That's not
unusual. The buyers of 70 percent of the works sold at auction are
not identified.''

RICHARD WAREHAM, 78; LED DESIGN OF POLAROID SX-70 CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Rogers Wareham, who led design of Polaroid Corp.'s SX-70
camera in the 1970s, died, apparently of a heart attack, Aug. 7 in
his home in Lake San Marcos, Calif., just before his 79th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wareham worked at Polaroid when the high-technology company
was one of the largest and fastest-growing firms in Massachusetts.
For his achievements in designing the SX-70 camera under the
leadership of Edwin Land, Polaroid's founder, he was promoted to
assistant vice president and senior engineering fellow.
</P>
<P>
   He retired after 33 years at Polaroid in 1982, the same year
Land left the company.
</P>
<P>
   The SX-70, first of the cameras to use Polaroid's card-like
color film, was introduced in 1972 and marketed nationally in 1973.
Development of the SX-70 film and camera, and building factories to
make them, cost several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By Land's order, Mr. Wareham and a few other camera engineers
began late in the 1960s to work secretly on the ninth floor of 565
Technology Square in Cambridge. Like other small groups Land
assigned to work on different aspects of the system, Mr. Wareham's
team was isolated in the manner of the so-called ``Skunk Works'' at
Lockheed Aircraft, which developed the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s.
Land told Mr. Wareham to assume success with development of a
``chemical curtain'' that would allow the film to be developed
outside the camera _ years before this success was achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Noted for his sense of humor, Mr. Wareham commented on the
stresses of high-speed industrial development by saying: ``We're
one happy, small family _ we fight most of the time.'' Of Land's
persuasiveness, Mr. Wareham said he would ``sell me the shirt off
my own back.'' But he added: ``Anything he suggested was not
off-hand. . . . It was well thought out. . . . He wasn't really
asking people to jump seven feet in the air and stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Lynn, Mass. He graduated from Phillips Academy in
Andover in 1940, and attended the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   A reserve officer trainee at MIT, Mr. Wareham served with the
Army Engineers in Europe, including the Battle of the Bulge in
1944, and in Asia, finishing at Okinawa in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Mr. Wareham went to United Shoe Machine
Corp., where he worked as an engineer for five years. Concluding
that USMC offered ``a lot of fun but no future,'' Mr. Wareham went
to MIT's placement office in Cambridge to check for openings. He
was told of a ``funny company around the corner.'' It was the
prospect closest to MIT, and it was a very cold day, so he went and
was hired.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family lived for many years in Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after 42 years of marriage, Mr. Wareham's wife, Eve
Stone Wareham, died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his second wife, Betty; two daughters, Gayle Richards
of Rochester, N.H., and Judy Wareham of Marblehead; a sister, Jane
De Wolfe of Marblehead; and two grandsons.

TEXAS GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO REBUFF QUESTIONS ABOUT DRUG USE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He's talked about his marriage, he's talked about
his drinking, but there's one topic George W. Bush refuses to talk
about _ cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the minute he became a presidential candidate,
reporters have pressed Bush to say whether he ever used cocaine.
But voters don't seem to share the media's addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like his position on cocaine,'' said Earl J.
Billington, a retired Iowa voter who cheers Bush's steadfast
refusal to say whether he has ever used illegal drugs. ``The media
is just relentless. If it weren't this, it would be something else.
It would be one question after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the same argument to deflect the question again
Wednesday, once in Texas and later at a campaign stop in Louisiana.
No evidence of illegal drug use by Bush has surfaced, despite
persistent digging by reporters and political rivals.

SURVIVORS SAY MANY COLLAPSED BUILDINGS WERE POORLY BUILT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TURKEY-QUAKE, TURKEY-SCENE.) 
(th) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ According to a neighbor who jumped out of bed
when the floor beneath him began to shake and sway, the building
across the street collapsed in 27 seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   His son, out on the balcony, yelled back to his father, ``It is
the mosque, the mosque.'' But when Umut Umutoglu went out into the
predawn darkness Tuesday, he saw through a cloud of dust that the
newly built mosque was intact, while a five-story apartment
building next door had been reduced to a pile of tangled metal and
concrete rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Avcilar, a new neighborhood on the western edge of this giant
sprawling city, suffered more from Tuesday's devastating earthquake
than any other part of Istanbul, most of which was shaken but
largely left intact. Here, several dozen buildings were destroyed,
some collapsing face forward onto the sidewalks, others tilting
like sinking ships onto neighboring walls.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction in Avcilar seemed selective, leaving behind an
odd checkerboard pattern of buildings that remain standing, next to
houses that were utterly wrecked by the wrath of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   According to local residents, the selection was not so random.
The difference between the buildings that fell and those that
didn't lay, they said, in the quality of the construction, in the
corners cut by contractors who mix too much sand into cement and
use cheap iron in their rush to build housing for Istanbul's
exploding population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contractor was not a good person,'' said Omar Talu, 50, an
electrician who was surveying the debris that had once been home to
friends and neighbors. ``He especially cheated on cement.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 people who lived in the apartment block on Erdek Lane,
only six survived, Talu said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the residents of this neighborhood are immigrants from
the Turkish countryside who have flocked to the city in the last
decade, bringing its population to an estimated 12 million.
Apartment houses sprang up like mushrooms on the city's edges,
alongside flimsy makeshift shanties.
</P>
<P>
   Up the street from Umutoglu's house, Hassan Gunay, 50, also an
electrician, waited somberly for word of his cousin, the last
unaccounted-for member of a family of relatives who came to
Istanbul three years ago from Southeast Turkey. The family members
were killed Tuesday morning when their building came crashing down
around them. Only the cousin's body has not been found, Gunay said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gunay, the house where his relatives lived had been
built without a building permit. Three times, local officials had
ordered a halt to construction but in the end, the building, with
its eight apartments, went up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, local civil defense officials appeared at
the site, digging through the rubble with their bare hands and
pulling out survivors. By Wednesday the count was official: Of the
35 people who lived in the building, 12 were killed including the
contractor and members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably cheated on materials,'' said Erkut Oner, a civil
defense official who Wednesday was keeping crowds of onlookers away
from the site.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of another collapsed building, several dozen army
trucks were parked along a highway as hundreds of soldiers sifted
rubble by hand in hopes, one onlooker said, of finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Here, and all across Istanbul, families were settling down for
the night in local parks, parking lots and other available open
space, fearing aftershocks that could still bring down buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house is standing but it has cracks all through it,'' said
Beyhan Balci, a 47-year-old woman whose family was sharing a
makeshift tent with neighbors. ``We are waiting for the inspectors
to come and give us a report.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Istanbul was taking stock of the damage Wednesday, life
in this enormous city was returning back to normal. Tourists
flocked to the city's famous sites, none of which apparently
suffered in the quake.
</P>
<P>
   When the great Ottoman architect Sinan was building mosques in
Istanbul in the 16th century, he first built the foundations and
then let them settle for two years before completing construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the buildings in Istanbul had been built that way, then
none would have collapsed,'' said Erkan Tezkan, a geophysicist who
now works as a tour guide.

 &HT;    Painful dilemma for Sierra Leone
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Amadu Jabbie, forgiveness is a bitter pill to
swallow, even if it means saving his homeland from ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbie, who lives in the Atlanta area, wants Sierra Leone to
prosper. He dreams of returning and running a business there. He
knows the country needs peace.
</P>
<P>
   But when rebel fighters rampaged through Freetown, the Sierra
Leone capital, in January, burning, pillaging and killing, they
came upon Jabbie's nephew, 20-year-old Umaru Sesay.
</P>
<P>
   First they cut off Sesay's arms and legs. Then they shot him
dead.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of crime, along with thousands of others just like it,
Jabbie finds hard to forgive _ even if it might mean peace and the
end of a brutal, destructive civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, that war has ravaged Sierra Leone, a West African
country slightly smaller than South Carolina. At least 20,000
people have been killed, according to the U.S. Agency for
International Development _ 50,000, according to the organization
Human Rights Watch _ and more than half the country's 5 million
inhabitants have been forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The war, some observers say, has more to do with the country's
wealth of diamonds than with ideology. At any rate, it has helped
maintain Sierra Leone's status as the least-developed country in
the world. Average life expectancy in the country, according to the
United Nations, is 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   In their drive to oust the elected president, Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah, rebels of the Revolutionary United Front sowed terror by
chopping off one or both hands of uncounted thousands of civilians
_ men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people are being told that _ in the interest of peace and
even, perhaps, a small measure of prosperity _ these acts must be
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Or even rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, in Togo, Kabbah and Foday Sankoh, leader of the
Revolutionary United Front, signed a peace agreement. The agreement
offered members of the RUF _ the group blamed for wanton
amputations _ ministerial positions. And it gave Sankoh ``the
status of vice president'' and the chairmanship of an ``autonomous
body'' responsible for regulating Sierra Leone's ``strategic
mineral resources'' _ including diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also required the government of Sierra Leone to
``grant absolute and free pardon and reprieve to all combatants and
collaborators in respect of anything done by them in pursuit of
their objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders also signed the accord, as did Francis Okelo,
the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Sierra
Leone. Okelo added a disclaimer that said the amnesty did not apply
to gross violations of human rights, but the United Nations has
been criticized by human rights groups for signing the deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want peace at any cost, you just say, `OK, here's the
government,''' said Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human Rights
Watch. ``If you want a good foundation for a lasting democracy,
people who systematically chop off the hands of civilians and
children should be in jail, not in the government house.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Bell, president of CARE USA, the Atlanta-based
international relief organization, and a former board member of
Human Rights Watch, said it is possible to be too dogmatic about
punishing every single violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said he did not want to take ``hard and fast views'' on the
treaty in Sierra Leone because he is not an expert on the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're talking about is a trade-off between cessation of
the violence and the killing versus justice for horrendous
humanitarian crimes,'' he said. ``This is not a dilemma to be taken
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most human rights organizations, Bell said, would take ``a very
strong, principled position'' in favor of justice and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, the most basic right of people is the right
to live,'' he said. ``And, in my view, another fundamental right is
the right to peace.'' Still another, he said, is the right to
development and to the basic necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to punish gross violations of human rights in
absolutely every case, Bell said, must be balanced against the
killing, malnutrition and disease that are the consequence of war.
</P>
<P>
   Justice or peace?
</P>
<P>
   In the Sierra Leonean community in the Atlanta area, estimated
at a few thousand people, that argument seems to rage not between
different people, but inside the hearts and minds of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Boyle, who lives in the Atlanta area, was trapped in
Freetown in January when rebels stormed into the city in an assault
that killed about 5,000 people. Peering out a window, he saw people
used as human shields and houses set on fire. He heard people
screaming for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the terrible atrocities these guys committed,'' he said.
But, though it is ``a very tough task for all of us, a tough deal
to swallow,'' he said he is willing to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of us, we just don't have any other choice but to
welcome them,'' he said of the rebels. ``These guys don't have
anything to lose. They will just devastate the whole country. Some
of us don't want to lose any more family.''
</P>
<P>
   Jabbie wants peace so he can return to Sierra Leone. ``No place
like your home, sir,'' he said emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   And his 75-year-old mother, Sallay, prays all the time that she
will be able to go home.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview, Jabbie went back and forth, seeming
to argue both sides of the question. He did not believe in granting
amnesty to such criminals, he said, but he would do it if it was
for the good of the country. Though he did not think it would work.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, in a telephone call, he continued the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a stand on the peace accord, which I believe is
inimical to the country,'' he said. ``I believe if people live by
the sword, they should die by the sword. And I don't believe there
should be any amnesty.''

TEXAS GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO REBUFF QUESTIONS ABOUT DRUG USE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He's talked about his marriage, he's talked about
his drinking, but there's one topic George W. Bush refuses to talk
about _ cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the minute he became a presidential candidate,
reporters have pressed Bush to say whether he ever used cocaine.
But voters don't seem to share the media's addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like his position on cocaine,'' said Earl J.
Billington, a retired Iowa voter who cheers Bush's steadfast
refusal to say whether he has ever used illegal drugs. ``The media
is just relentless. If it weren't this, it would be something else.
It would be one question after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the same argument to deflect the question again
Wednesday, once in Texas and later at a campaign stop in Louisiana.
No evidence of illegal drug use by Bush has surfaced, despite
persistent digging by reporters and political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Austin, the governor chided reporters
for raising a topic he has repeatedly tried to put off limits.
``Somebody floats a rumor and causes you to ask a question, and
that's the game in American politics. I refuse to play it,'' an
obviously irritated Bush said. ``That is a game. And you just fell
for the trap. I refuse to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also accused unidentified political opponents of planting
drug questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're being planted,'' he said, refusing to
elaborate. ``They're ridiculous and absurd and the people of
America are sick and tired of this kind of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate he may right.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone survey conducted for Fox News last week, 69
percent of registered voters polled said they ``would want to
know'' whether a presidential candidate used cocaine in the past.
But 72 percent also said youthful experimentation with drugs,
including cocaine, ``should be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 37 percent said they would consider refusal to answer
evidence of guilt. About half said they would conclude such refusal
meant candidates were ``just trying to retain their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Billington, 69, said he didn't care if Bush had used cocaine as
long as he didn't use it now. He gladly voted for the Texas
governor in last weekend's Iowa straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Pueggel, 22, voted for Elizabeth Dole, but she is also
fed up with cocaine questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes too far,'' she said. ``It seems sometimes the press is
trying to find the scandals rather than finding the truth. That is
not something we really need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say Bush may be benefiting from the exhaustion voters
suffered from the drawn-out White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned anything in the last year and a half it's
that the public appetite for hearing about some types of scandal is
pretty low,'' said Gregory Fleming, research director at the
nonpartisan Pew Research Center. ``There is a sense that maybe the
investigation of private lives should pull back a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's critics contend he deserves to be grilled on cocaine
because he has talked openly about other personal issues, including
his past alcohol abuse. The governor has also claimed complete
fidelity to his wife during their 21-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he begins to utter the words, `I'm a good father,
I'm a good husband, I'm a good person,' he sort of ups the ante in
terms of the expectations people have for him,'' said New York
pollster John Zogby, a Democrat who works for candidates in both
parties. ``He's going to have to answer the question.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it turns out the answer is yes, voter opinion could
change dramatically. ``I think it could be real trouble for him,''
Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he is willing to let voters draw their own conclusions
from his refusal to say yes or no on the question of cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go to social events and they see I don't drink,
people naturally ask me why I don't drink,'' he said in explaining
his openness on that topic. ``I say I quit drinking. I can't
control what people ask, and I can't control the gossip and the
ugliness of the political process. But I darn sure can try to clean
it up, and that's exactly what I intend to do.''

CONTEMPT MOTION FILED AGAINST BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eliza May, fired earlier this year as the chief
regulator of the Texas funeral industry, asked a state court
Wednesday to hold Gov. George W. Bush in contempt for filing what
she called a ``false, misleading and deceptive'' affidavit about
his role in her ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintains he had nothing to do with May's firing in
February. He's fighting attempts to force his testimony in May's
wrongful firing lawsuit against the Texas Funeral Service
Commission and others.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt motion, which a Bush spokesman described as an
abuse of the legal system, was submitted a few hours after Bush
seemed to contradict his July 20 sworn statement about May's
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that in 1998 he had a fleeting conversation
with an executive and a lobbyist of Service Corporation
International Inc., a Houston-based funeral services provider whose
officials had questioned May's regulatory tactics. The officials
objected to the way May pursued allegations that workers at two
SCI-affiliated funeral homes had done embalming without proper
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, Bush submitted an affidavit in May's case stating,
``I have had no conversations with SCI officials, agents or
representatives concerning the investigation or any dispute arising
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also swore that ``I have no personal knowledge of relevant
facts of the investigation, nor do I have any personal knowledge of
relevant facts concerning any dispute arising from this
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Wednesday stood by his sworn statements and repeatedly
described May's whistle blower lawsuit as ``frivolous.'' Bush also
renewed his claim that he ``did not have any knowledge at all'' of
SCI's dispute with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 20-second conversation. I had no substantive
conversation with the guy,'' Bush said, adding, ``I don't remember
what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brief encounter with SCI president Robert Waltrip came
while Waltrip was in the Capitol meeting with a top Bush aide about
regulatory concerns. Johnnie B. Rogers, an SCI lobbyist who was at
the meeting, told Newsweek magazine that Bush asked Waltrip if the
commission was ``still messing with you,'' and then asked Rogers
``are you taking care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   May contends those simple questions indicated Bush had some
appreciation of SCI's dispute with regulators. Citing the magazine
account, May's motion states that ``Bush swore that he has had `no
conversations' with any representative of SCI concerning the
investigation or dispute. That is untrue. Gov. Bush swore that he
had `no personal knowledge' of relevant facts concerning the
investigation or dispute. That also is untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion said Bush's insistence that his affidavit is accurate
is ``completely implausible.'' It said Bush ``testified falsely for
the purpose of obstructing justice and the proceedings of this
court,'' and it asked that the court ``impose proper sanctions,''
including fines, against the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't aware of the contempt motion when he answered
reporters' questions Wednesday, but later spokesman Linda Edwards
said ``this is nothing more than a publicity stunt and an example
of the frivolous misuse of the civil justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   May's attorney, Charles Herring Jr. of Austin, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sworn statements were filed in response to a motion filed
by Herring that seeks to force Bush's testimony in May's civil suit
against the commission and SCI.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing has been set for Aug. 30 to decide whether Bush must
give a deposition in the case and provide May with reams of
subpoenaed documents.

 &HT;    Divide between Gingrich, Hastert one of lessons learned and
applied
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In last week's New Republic, there was a relative
oddity: a positive story about House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Plodding, dull old Coach Hastert has taken more than his share
of lumps since it was left to him to pick up the pieces of the
Republican House leadership. But as this story points out, he has
managed to get the Republicans to stop throwing so many rocks at
each other, and he has cobbled together a modest record of
achievement, including the vote on the $792 billion tax cut bill,
from which only four Republicans defected.
</P>
<P>
   The Hastert story isn't nearly as racy as recent revelations
about former Speaker Newt Gingrich's plans to divorce his wife amid
reports that he is having a romance with a young House Agriculture
Committee staffer who sings in the Catholic University National
Shrine Choir. But they come around to the same point.
</P>
<P>
   Read together, these stories make clear what was implied in
Gingrich's hasty exit from elective office last year. They put the
historian who deemed himself a world historical figure firmly in
the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, the New Republic story says, has accomplished a good
deal simply by hearing his members out and making them feel like
part of the team. You may remember that Gingrich had an entire
complicated schematic _ ``Listen, Learn and Lead'' _ based on this
very principle.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, by all accounts, Gingrich never paid the slightest
attention to a number of allies who warned him that running ads in
congressional campaigns attacking President Clinton over the Monica
Lewinsky scandal could disastrously backfire. Even after his
miscalculation slashed the GOP majority to a hair, after he had
given up the job he spent a career pursuing, Gingrich is said to
have held out the hope that the Cox report on Chinese spying would
precipitate that wave of moral repulsion he had counted on with
such unhearing confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Hastert story is evidence that it really doesn't require a
Napoleon to execute what in the final analysis is a fairly
conventional conservative agenda, and not some futuristic
revolution. Rather, it takes a leader who can practice what he
preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the divorce story.
</P>
<P>
   The line between public and private hypocrisy is a hard one to
draw. Gingrich does not deserve a free pass because he waited until
he was a private citizen to acknowledge the sins he committed when
he was a public official and the standard bearer for what he
presented as a moral cause.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, divorcing his wife for a younger woman does
not make him one bit more a hypocrite than Peter Jennings or George
Will, birds of the same feather who feasted with an even more
unseemly relish on the Lewinsky affair. In fact, while behind the
scenes he sought to exploit the White House sex scandal, Gingrich
publicly showed a measure of discretion _ understandably so, in
retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   But in attempting to topple a president for carrying on in much
the same manner he was, he showed a tin ear for the moral
inclinations of Americans, who are more prone to forgive the
forgiving, assume some fault in their leaders and harbor a deep
distrust for those who too often point fingers away from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Look up Lincoln, on the people and the various ways you can fool
'em. It's a lesson the historian never learned.

JUDGES' CONFERENCE ON DEATH PENALTY HAS DEFENSE LAWYERS IN AN
UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A conference for federal and state judges on the death
penalty, which begins Thursday at a luxury golf resort near here,
is drawing widespread criticism from defense lawyers for its
emphasis on methods to speed up state executions.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day gathering of Southern judges, organized by the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based here, is being
held at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort in Braselton, Ga., about
30 miles from Atlanta. Although its organizers say the purpose of
the conference is to promote fairness in capital cases, that
subject does not appear on the printed agenda, which was provided
to The New York Times by a critic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the principal subject of the conference appears to be
``improving the process'' of death penalty cases in the three
states of the 11th Circuit _ Georgia, Florida and Alabama _ and
removing some of the procedural barriers thrown up by defendants to
slow down their executions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the planners of the conference and a principal speaker is
Judge Edward E. Carnes of the 11th Circuit, whose nomination to the
federal appeals bench in 1992 by President George Bush caused a
raucous Senate fight because of his outspoken advocacy of the death
penalty and his work to reduce post-conviction appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes is scheduled to speak on ``the procedural, practical and
political problems that impede implementation of improvements'' to
the death penalty process. The conference includes several similar
sessions, including a detailed look at the process in Texas, which
has had 184 executions since 1982, the most of any state. One
45-minute session during the three days is devoted to comments from
defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Death-penalty appeals have become a defining issue for the 11
regional circuits of the federal Appeals Court, several of which
grew markedly more conservative after appointments during the
Reagan and Bush years. In particular, two Southern circuits on
either side of the 11th have become known for repeatedly refusing
to grant new hearings to defendants convicted of capital crimes.
Several defense lawyers said the conference appeared to be intended
to bring the 11th Circuit more in line with the rest of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen of the conference's missions and goals, it
does appear that Judge Carnes is trying to help judges find ways to
expedite the death penalty process,'' said Michael Mears, state
director of Georgia's death penalty defense office, who is
scheduled to speak during the session for defense lawyers. ``I'm
trying to keep an open mind here, but it's hard to see any other
way to interpret that kind of language. If it was about fairness,
you'd think there'd be a session on providing adequate counsel, but
that's not on the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen B. Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human
Rights in Atlanta, wrote a lengthy letter to Judge R. Lanier
Anderson, chief judge of the 11th Circuit, urging him to cancel the
conference because of a ``lack of balance.'' He charged that the
apparent purpose of the meeting was to turn the courts of the 11th
Circuit ``into the kind of death mills that the state and federal
courts in Texas have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, wrote back
that Bright had misconstrued the purposes of the symposium. In an
interview Wednesday, Anderson said the conference was intended to
reduce the risk of error in capital cases and improve fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's not our purpose to rush defendants to
execution,'' said Anderson, who is based in Macon, Ga. ``The courts
are interested in having cases decided with appropriate expedition,
but only after full and adequate litigation and discussion of every
issue. We certainly did not intend there to be any perception of
one-sidedness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he was not aware of criticism from Bright and
other lawyers that it was inappropriate to discuss executions at a
luxury golf resort. He said the site was chosen because it was
centrally located and attractive enough to get participants to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 93 judges and lawyers invited are required to pay
his or her own way. The brochure sent to the participants includes
a list of the resort's seven restaurants, and also notes the wine
tastings, saunas and four golf courses that are available. One golf
course costs $135 per round.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In most states, it takes years for a prisoner to be executed
after being convicted of a capital crime, due to an array of appeal
rights that include an appeal to the federal courts. Many elected
officials and prosecutors have argued that these delays have in
effect vitiated legitimate death-penalty statutes, and have
searched for ways to reduce grounds for endless appeals.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter of the death penalty, Attorney General Thurbert
Baker of Georgia, said the conference was a perfectly appropriate
forum to discuss ways of making the system more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``An efficient system is one that is beneficial to the victims
of these crimes, and also to the defendants and the courts that
have to process their cases,'' said Baker, who is scheduled to
speak at the conference. ``You want a system that moves these cases
as expeditiously as possible, but in a fair and just manner. It's
unfair to the defendant to wait forever to get an answer on a
post-conviction appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit has a far more moderate reputation on such
appeals than either the 4th Circuit, comprising the Carolinas,
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Delaware, or the 5th, which
includes Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Where appellate judges in those circuits are the most aggressive
in the nation in rejecting the appeals of death-row convicts, those
in the 11th Circuit are considered less ideologically rigid and
more independent, said Howard O. Hunter, dean of the Emory
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But some death-penalty lawyers said they believed the circuit
had become more conservative since Carnes was appointed. John
Blume, a Cornell University law professor who defends capital-case
prisoners in the South, said the circuit now rules less often in
favor of defendants, which he said was not surprising given Carnes'
outspokenness on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes, who did not return a phone call Wednesday, wrote
Alabama's rigorous death penalty statute and was in charge of
defending capital-case appeals for the state attorney general's
office, where he often clashed with lawyers who said the process
was unfair because blacks were frequently excluded from Alabama
jury panels. Although he won praise from some liberal voices for
supporting civil rights statutes, he also lobbied Congress to
restrict the right of state prisoners to appeal their convictions
to federal courts and most civil rights groups bitterly fought his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent federal appeals judge speaking at the
conference is Edith Hollan Jones of Texas, who is scheduled to
discuss the 5th Circuit's experience in dealing with death-penalty
appeals, which are rarely supported in her district. Jones has
become known for her anger at defense lawyers who try to delay
executions through a flurry of legal maneuvers, at one point
writing that such lawyers should be stricken from the bar and not
allowed to practice law for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken positions of Jones and Carnes have made them among
the most visible targets of the death-penalty bar. Ronald Tabak, an
attorney with Skadden Arps in New York who is co-chairman of the
American Bar Association's death-penalty committee, said Texas'
record of executing prisoners without adequate counsel made it one
of the worst places from which to learn a lesson in procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Hunter of Emory Law School said he doubted that the 12
judges of the appeals court would be so easily swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wide range of a judges, and a pretty balanced group,''
he said. ``The ones I know are unlikely to be railroaded in one
direction or another.''

LUCENT TO BUY ANOTHER BAY STATE SWITCHING FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In what is starting to feel like a weekly event,
Lucent Technologies, the world's biggest telecommunications
manufacturer, says it will take over another Massachusetts company,
this time Excel Switching Corp., for $1.3 billion in Lucent stock.
</P>
<P>
   Excel would be the sixth company this year based in
Massachusetts, or descended from a Bay State startup, to join the
Lucent stable, and the third in just the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would push total Lucent employment statewide to more
than 10,000, ranking it near Fidelity Investments, Raytheon, Star
Market and Stop &AMP; Shop as top private employers.
</P>
<P>
   And many industry observers doubt Lucent's Bay State shopping
spree is over yet, given the passel of cutting-edge telecom
startups, many of them lining Interstate 495, that could fill
niches in Lucent's product line and grab future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal apparently made Excel founder and chairman
Robert P. Madonna a near-billionaire, raising the value of the 27.2
million Excel shares he reported owning as of March to $974 million
if converted to Lucent stock at Wednesday's closing price. Almost
all of Excel's 460 employees, 370 of whom work on Cape Cod, are
shareholders and enjoyed Wednesday's 26 percent runup in Excel
shares as well.
</P>
<P>
   Based in an industrial park behind the Barnstable airport, just
downwind from the Cape Cod Potato Chip factory, Excel makes
telephone switching equipment that, broadly speaking, has
encouraged innovation in telecommunications the same way as the
move from mainframes to personal computers fostered a vibrant
software-writing industry in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Excel switches help drive such as things as networks for new
phone companies competing with Baby Bells, voice calling over the
Internet, office voice mail, fax forwarding to electronic mail, and
systems that will transfer an incoming office phone call to
someone's portable telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent switches generally come with all the software built in,
like an old-style mainframe computer. In contrast, 11-year-old
Excel sells switches that can be programmed and adapted by others
and ``scaled up'' as a business's needs grow. Excel has sold its
products in more than 70 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent projects the market for such ``open-access'' products
could reach $5 billion by 2003 and sees Excel as a strong way to
jump quickly into a market it now largely does not serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this industry can expand even quicker if we adopt
this open-architecture approach,'' said Dan Stanzione, Lucent's
executive vice president and chief operating officer, who said
Excel's products cover ``a new and emerging sweet spot in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lucent would not comment on what if any Massachusetts
companies it has in its sights, some of the companies cited by
industry analysts Wednesday as possible future Lucent takeover
candidates include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Broadband Access Systems of Marlborough, which has developed
and is running final pre-market tests on systems to carry voice
calls and high-speed Internet access over revamped cable television
systems such as MediaOne's in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   -- C-Port Corp. of North Andover, which makes highly
programmable processor chips used in a wide range of telecom
systems such as fast World Wide Web page downloaders.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sonus Networks Inc. of Westford, whose products help convert
voice telephone calls into a form that can move over the Internet,
at much lower cost than long-distance phone carriers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Taqua Systems of Centerville, which makes voice switches used
by competitive local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it expects to complete the Excel acquisition during
the last three months of this year. It will offer 558 of its own
shares for every 1,000 Excel shares outstanding, making the deal
worth about $1.3 billion based on Lucent's closing price of 64 3/16
in New York Stock Exchange trading. Excel leaped 7 1/16 to close at
34 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna played down his new fortune. ``From day one, our
mission, when we were five people in a garage, was the same as it
is today, to bring open programmability to a traditionally closed''
field of technology, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never a value thing from a money standpoint, it was,
`We need to accomplish this mission.' It's still just the
beginning,'' said Madonna, who will take an as-yet unspecified
senior post with Lucent. Excel is to remain in Hyannis.
</P>
<P>
   Excel's history is the classic high-tech success story, with the
twist that it all happened on Cape Cod rather than Kendall Square,
Route 128 or Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna founded Excel in 1988 after the company where he was
engineering director, Lantel, moved off the Cape to Marlborough.
Starting with a half-dozen employees in Sagamore Beach, Excel moved
to Hyannis in 1995 and went public in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It has since grown to fill four buildings and employ 460 people,
many enticed from better-known high tech hotbeds by the perk of
living on the Cape, and its net profits have been growing nearly 90
percent a year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, a corporate descendant of the old Bell Systems Western
Electric phone-making unit, has been on a $32 billion acquisition
spree since it was spun off from AT &AMP; T three years ago, including
more than $5 billion in deals in the last two weeks. Some analysts
question whether Lucent may begin choking on all the new businesses
it must assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   In part Lucent has been under pressure to keep up with San
Jose-based Cisco Systems, a computer networking firm that has done
over $1 billion of deals in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more of all kinds of telecommunications moves from
systems designed to carry voices _ the traditional phone network _
to systems designed to carry digital data, Cisco and Lucent are
seen as the leading combatants in an epic battle to control the
telecom-network market, with Lucent under special pressure to boost
its data communications presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent is becoming the East Coast Cisco,'' said Blaik Kirby, a
principal with consultants Renaissance Worldwide. While Lucent has
been offering rich prices, Kirby said the Excel deal and others
``make sense. They've been best-of-breed acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Wednesday, Lucent said it is extending
until next Tuesday its offer to buy stock in SpecTran, a Sturbridge
speciality cable maker it agreed to buy last month for $9 a share.
Lucent said 47.1 percent of SpecTran shares had been tendered as of
midnight Tuesday, so it is giving SpecTran owners _ some of whom
have sued because they call the price too low _ another week to
consider selling.

LUTHERANS SPLIT ON WHETHER TO FORM CLOSE TIE WITH EPISCOPALIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Minn., Iowa, N.J., N.Y.)   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DENVER _ As leaders of the nation's largest Lutheran
denomination gather to debate one of the most important ecumenical
proposals in decades, controversy over that proposal has produced
an unusually energetic display of the push and pull of politics
within a church.
</P>
<P>
   Lutherans who oppose the proposal have set up a hospitality
suite in a downtown hotel, with a map of the United States on one
wall, showing how it fared recently in nonbinding votes among
regional Lutheran bodies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But one floor up in the same hotel, the proposal's supporters
have their own ``reception center'' and are distributing a daily
newsletter urging delegates to vote in favor of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a sweeping agreement for close cooperation between
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Protestant
Episcopal Church in the United States of America, a proposal that
many here liken to a marriage. If it is passed Thursday by the
Lutherans' Churchwide Assembly, their top policy-making body, it
would bind the two denominations, with a combined membership of
nearly 8 million, in a pact to recognize each other's members and
sacraments, exchange clergy members where needed and join in
missionary and social service work.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, for ``full communion'' between the two churches,
was hammered out in discussions among Lutheran and Episcopal
theologians over three decades. But it has become a subject of
great dispute since the Assembly at its last meeting on Aug. 18,
1997, rejected a similar proposal for full communion with the
Episcopalians by a slim margins.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The measure fell six votes short of the required two-thirds
majority, out of 1,039 votes cast, even as the Assembly voted to
adopt a full communion agreement with three other Protestant
churches.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Now, for what will certainly be the last time this century,
Lutherans have opted to consider an agreement with Episcopalians
again, working from a somewhat revised document titled, ``Called to
Common Mission.'' (The assembly will also consider a full communion
plan with the nation's small Moravian Church, a measure that is not
controversial and is expected to pass.)
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Lutheran-Episcopalian proposal, like Lutheran
Bishops Stephen Bouman of New York and Roy Riley of New Jersey,
said it would allow the two denominations to pool scarce resources
in rural and inner-city areas, where collaboration, rather than
competition, would mean a stronger ministry and greater social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a defining moment for Lutherans, at least for
a generation,'' Bouman said, adding that the two denominations, in
the New York area, could better serve their immigrant members if
they worked together. Lutherans in New York, he said, worship in 16
different languages and will soon add a 17th, with the organization
of a Swahili-speaking congregation in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the proposal's approval would also provide an
important symbol of Christian unity. Jesus, he said, preached that
unity among believers helped spread the Gospel's teachings. But
when churches appear unable to cooperate, he said, ``I think that
sends an enormously negative message to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, like Professor Todd Nichol, a church historian at
Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minn., and the Rev. Roger Eigenfeld of
Mahtomedi, Minn., said the proposal would require Lutherans to go
against their traditional understanding of how the church
functions, by requiring that they accept Episcopalians' beliefs
about the office of bishop _ specifically, that bishops belong to
the ``historic episcopate,'' an unbroken line of religious
leadership stretching back to earliest days of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic issue here is, this imposes a condition for unity,''
said Nichol, ``which we do not think consistent with Scripture or
the Lutheran confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eigenfeld described the idea of the historic episcopate as ``a
top-down model.'' He added, ``The reason I'm opposed to it is, it's
an outmoded hierarchical system, which is not going to carry us
into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents have said full communion is not necessary for
churches and pastors to pursue ecumenical work on the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Evangelical Lutheran Church has bishops, they are
elected for six-year terms, rather than for life as in the
Episcopal Church, and return to being pastors after their terms
have ended. In addition, some at the assembly in Denver said, many
Lutherans in the upper Midwest, the faith's historic heartland,
retain a historic suspicion of bishops, a legacy of their
Scandinavian immigrant ancestors who came to America determined not
to allow bishops the sort of power they had in their native lands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Organizing against the full communion proposal gained steam last
February, when opponents of it gathered at Eigenfeld's church,
which has a congregation of 8,000. More than 200 people came from
14 states and produced a statement they called the Mahtomedi
Resolution, which rejected the proposal for full communion, while
still calling for Lutherans to work with ``our Episcopal
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   But leading supporters of full communion with Episcopalians were
determined not to be out-organized. ``When we got to Philadelphia
two years ago, we were really surprised by the organized
opposition,'' said Riley, referring to the last meeting site of the
Churchwide Assembly, where the full communion proposal failed. He
said he and four other prominent Lutherans mailed information to
the assembly's delegates in July supporting the proposal. ``Even
though we were in the strong majority, we had to be organized,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After hearings and discussion on the full communion proposal
Tuesday afternoon, Bishop Curtis Miller of the Western Iowa Synod
said he thought the vote Thursday would be ``impossible to
predict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the conversation can be handled in a respectful
and informative way, so people can discern the Spirit's leading,''
he said.

TREE-SITTERS LAUNCH PROTEST AGAINST LAND SWAP WITH TIMBER COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANDLE, Wash. _ A hundred and twenty feet above the forest
floor, Tim Ream shouts directions to Sarah Vekasi, who dangles in
the grip of a mountain-climbing harness alongside a mammoth Douglas
fir. She is fiddling with the rigging, trying to get around a
branch that is blocking her descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grab it (the branch) through the middle, and grab it through
the other side!'' he yells.
</P>
<P>
   Vekasi is using slip knots in tandem to work her way down the
ropes. She always keeps one knot tied tight so that if she loses
her grip, the other knot will catch and break her fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ream and Vekasi are part of a loosely-knit environmental group
opposed to a proposed trade of public land, much of it in the
Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwest Washington state, to
the Plum Creek Timber Co. Willing to risk it all for their cause,
they have set up two platforms high in the branches of an
old-growth forest on Watch Mountain, near the small logging town of
Randle in Lewis County. They vow to stay in those trees, defying
the company to cut them down.
</P>
<P>
   Tree-sitting protesters, something of a fixture in Northern
California, Oregon and even British Columbia, are rare in
Washington. These tree-sitters, calling themselves the Cascadia
Defense Network, don't like the government's plan to give 25 square
miles of heavily forested mountain land on the west slope of the
Cascades to the timber company in exchange for 75 square miles of
prime hiking land near Snoqualmie Pass. Much of that Snoqualmie
Pass land is stunningly beautiful, high alpine country that is
great for hiking and camping but not as valuable as timberland.
</P>
<P>
   The battle pits the tree-sitters against not only the federal
government and the timber company, but also against more
mainstream, largely Seattle-area environmentalists who have signed
off on the agreement. The proposal, expected to be approved by
Congress last month, is on hold while a last-minute glitch caused
by the discovery of endangered marbled murrelets on two parcels of
land is resolved. Supporters expect approval within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Ream, who is coaching Vekasi on her way down, has been sitting
in trees to try to stop logging of old-growth forests since he was
trained at an Earth First! camp in California in 1995. He's been in
trees that were bumped by bulldozers. He says he saw a Humboldt
County, Calif., forest taken down in just 17 days from his perch in
one of the trees there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to stay here for months,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to sit up there in those trees and be a spectacle
for you,'' Ream told about 160 Randle residents who showed up at
the protest meeting organized by trade opponents last week. ``We're
going to sit up there until there are chain saws buzzing all around
us and they take us to jail. And we're not going to make it easy
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   These twentysomething, mostly vegetarian tree-sitters, some
sporting dreadlocks and a grunge look, are making common cause with
the residents of Randle, population 2,000, many of whom are more
comfortable in suspenders and weathered Stetsons.
</P>
<P>
   Loggers for generations, many local residents have stood by as
the local mill closed and timber companies began shipping timber
overseas for processing. Like the protesters, they are not happy
with big timber companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of folks besides those sitting (in) the trees _
thank God for them _ who are local environmentalists who are
concerned and will be working on this,'' said Randle resident
Bonnie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Some townspeople let the tree-sitters come to their homes for an
occasional shower. Others are making trips up the mountain to leave
food. A few hours before Vesaki's descent, one dropped off a
vegetarian's-delight package that included homemade cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the locals are friendly to the protesters, though.
One pickup truck sports two bumper stickers. The first says:
``Earth First! We'll log the other planets later.'' The other:
``Hug a logger. You'll never go back to trees.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vekasi continues her descent, Rachel Goeke points to the four
trees supporting the 8-by-8-foot platform where Ream is standing
and calling out directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four trees. And they have names,'' Goeke says.
</P>
<P>
   Above, Ream shouts, ``Now, kind of pull the rope off your butt a
little. ...''
</P>
<P>
   On the forest floor below, Goeke points to a Douglas fir about
10 feet in diameter, the one Vekasi is descending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big one is called Meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   She motions toward the other three, all Western hemlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one the rope is hanging from is called Union. The one on
the far left corner is Sunrise. And the last one is
Confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Confrontation was so named, she explains, because on the day the
group was searching for a name, a surveyor from the timber company
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The tree-sitters and their supporters in the base camp emphasize
that they are non-violent.
</P>
<P>
   A code of conduct is posted near the Volkswagen van that marks
the base camp just off Forest Service Road 75:
</P>
<P>
   ``No monkeywrenching, tree-spiking or destruction of personal
property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect ALL life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No drugs/possession or use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No alcohol/drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Use consensus decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep camp clean and stay on trails whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintain non-violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Support local communities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are NO leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few in the group actually sit up in the trees at one
time. In addition to the 8-by-8 platform suspended between the four
trees _ the sitters call it ``Nuthatch'' _ another platform nearby
is built doughnut-like around a single tree. Called ``Homestead,''
it's considerably larger, perhaps 120 square feet compared to the
64 where Ream stands directing Vekasi.
</P>
<P>
   At the base camp, members of the group who are not tree-sitting
cook food on a gas stove under a tarp. They sleep in tents in the
woods that surround the encampment.
</P>
<P>
   Water, food and other supplies are hauled up by the tree-sitters
in buckets attached to ropes. Waste and what little garbage they
generate comes down the same way.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Ream is on the platform with a young man who
identifies himself initially as ``Stone Cascadian Obsidian.'' A
woman at the base camp identifies herself only as ``Moonstone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ream says members of the group sometimes use assumed names
because ``they want to avoid the kind of intimidation they might
experience from the police.'' Ream himself is suing a Humboldt
County deputy for rough treatment, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, adds Obsidian, ``some of us do have jobs.'' It turns
out his is as a bookkeeper in Olympia. He's 21. And, he eventually
says, his real name is Will Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Those with jobs carve out time to make the three-hour drive from
Seattle or the two-hour trek from Olympia to bring supplies and
moral support.
</P>
<P>
   The tree-sitters and their Randle supporters see their enemies
in this battle as an unholy alliance: wealthy, Seattle-area
environmentalists, the U.S. Forest Service and the Plum Creek
Timber Co., which owns 3.3 million acres of timber in six states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world are a bunch of rich boys in Seattle going to
get their mountain and their lake at the expense of yours?''
consulting forester Roy Keene, who is working with the
tree-sitters, told Randle residents at the protest meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The tree-sitters and their allies find themselves opposing
old-line Washington environmentalists, including Charlie Raines,
who has worked for years to secure government ownership of lands in
the Central Cascades east of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of high alpine country,'' concedes Raines,
whose beard is flecked with gray, ``but also there are forest,
roadless lands and rivers that have salmon in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The lands the government wants were granted in the 1800s to Plum
Creek's forerunner, the Burlington Northern Railroad, to spur
settlement. The railroad got every other square mile, and the
government kept every other square mile, creating a unwieldy
checkerboard pattern of land ownership. The idea was for the
railroad to sell or give the land to settlers, but Northern Pacific
ended up keeping much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Plum Creek is threatening to log those lands. That would
leave the natural landscape in tatters along the Interstate 90
corridor east of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Government biologists say heading off logging of that land is
crucial to p(Y contZ7ued Y &QL; istekV$K$ H+WKV.Hc$nV,I

SEATTLE MAN'S ODD BALL NOW PART OF NERF LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRICIA DURYEE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle resident Mike McGonigle never invented a thing
in his life until Halloween 1993, when the San Francisco 49ers were
creaming the Los Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of his frustration and boredom, he threw a foam
pumpkin decoration against the wall and it spiraled right back to
him. Within hours, he had sawed off the end of his purple and gray
Nerf ball, and his invention was born: a pass-back, spiraling
football.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, Hasbro _ the creators of Nerf _ adopted the ball
into its line of spongy play toys. Now the ball that McGonigle
invented on the fly is available for children ages 6 and up to play
endless hours of football by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With a nice spiral pass, the flat end of the Nerf football will
make even contact with the wall, and it will bounce a nice spiral
right back to passer. Throw a lousy pass, and it's unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't anyone think of it before?'' asked Webb Nelson,
McGonigle's partner, who as president of Play Visions of
Woodinville helped bring the idea to Hasbro. When thinking about
how McGonigle came up with the idea, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's best when life can be serendipitous.''
</P>
<P>
   As a day trader, buying and selling stocks as short-term
investments, McGonigle is well-acquainted with serendipity. In
1986, he got fired from a computer programming job because he
traded on company time. McGonigle now covets his freedom, and
enjoys watching his idea flourish from his apartment in downtown
Seattle, where he's most comfortable in shorts, a T-shirt and a
pair of flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Toys ``R'' Us at Seattle's Northgate Mall sells the
Nerf Turbo Blast-Back Footballs at $9.99 apiece. FAO Schwarz lets
them go for $16 each.
</P>
<P>
   McGonigle is optimistic about the odd-looking football's future,
partly because of its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of those high-tech toys with a microchip,'' he
said, noting that it came about at a time when Hasbro had pretty
much tried all variations of the football.
</P>
<P>
   There have been Nerf balls with fins, multicolored versions,
some with aerodynamic grooves and far-flying ones. But this one has
a different function, McGonigle says. It returns without a partner,
and stands without a tee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kihara, sales leader and supervisor for Bellevue's FAO
Schwarz, said the Blast-Back Football looks like the head of a
rocket or bullet because one of its ends is rounded off. ``It's
something different,'' he said. ``It solves some of the basic
problems of a regular football.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a bit heavier and more durable than the average Nerf,
making it more appropriate for outdoors than for indoors. The new
Nerf bears the official NFL logo. And McGonigle and Nelson said the
Nerf's commercials feature Brett Favre, quarterback for the Green
Bay Packers, along with other leading NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of them have seen the commercials, they have
been told the advertising campaign will begin this football season.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it's more than McGonigle expected.
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly depressing when he was awaiting his patent.
McGonigle wondered why it was taking so long. Then he discovered
his lawyer still had the file in his office, wasting more than a
year of McGonigle's time.
</P>
<P>
   But when he paired up with Nelson, the ball started rolling. As
a toy manufacturer and importer, Nelson was able to put out a
version in limited circulation. Nelson also had connections to
Hasbro, and in October 1998, they signed a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw it at the (New York) toy fair, I realized it
really happened,'' he said. Nelson and McGonigle got $25,000 for
the initial contract with Hasbro. About 100,000 of the balls have
sold to date and Hasbro expects to sell 2 million to 5 million this
year alone. McGonigle and his partner stand to make as much as $1.1
million each on a return of 22 cents for every Turbo Blast-Back
Nerf football sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will invent games with this,'' McGonigle said. ``I know
they will.''

JUDGES' CONFERENCE ON DEATH PENALTY HAS DEFENSE LAWYERS IN AN
UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., Miss., Texas, Ala., La., N.C., S.C., Va., W.Va.,
Md., Del.)  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A conference for federal and state judges on the death
penalty, which begins Thursday at a luxury golf resort near here,
is drawing widespread criticism from defense lawyers for its
emphasis on methods to speed up state executions.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day gathering of Southern judges, organized by the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based here, is being
held at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort in Braselton, Ga., about
30 miles from Atlanta. Although its organizers say the purpose of
the conference is to promote fairness in capital cases, that
subject does not appear on the printed agenda, which was provided
to The New York Times by a critic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the principal subject of the conference appears to be
``improving the process'' of death penalty cases in the three
states of the 11th Circuit _ Georgia, Florida and Alabama _ and
removing some of the procedural barriers thrown up by defendants to
slow down their executions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the planners of the conference and a principal speaker is
Judge Edward E. Carnes of the 11th Circuit, whose nomination to the
federal appeals bench in 1992 by President George Bush caused a
raucous Senate fight because of his outspoken advocacy of the death
penalty and his work to reduce post-conviction appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes is scheduled to speak on ``the procedural, practical and
political problems that impede implementation of improvements'' to
the death penalty process. The conference includes several similar
sessions, including a detailed look at the process in Texas, which
has had 184 executions since 1982, the most of any state. One
45-minute session during the three days is devoted to comments from
defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Death-penalty appeals have become a defining issue for the 11
regional circuits of the federal Appeals Court, several of which
grew markedly more conservative after appointments during the
Reagan and Bush years. In particular, two Southern circuits on
either side of the 11th have become known for repeatedly refusing
to grant new hearings to defendants convicted of capital crimes.
Several defense lawyers said the conference appeared to be intended
to bring the 11th Circuit more in line with the rest of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen of the conference's missions and goals, it
does appear that Judge Carnes is trying to help judges find ways to
expedite the death penalty process,'' said Michael Mears, state
director of Georgia's death penalty defense office, who is
scheduled to speak during the session for defense lawyers. ``I'm
trying to keep an open mind here, but it's hard to see any other
way to interpret that kind of language. If it was about fairness,
you'd think there'd be a session on providing adequate counsel, but
that's not on the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen B. Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human
Rights in Atlanta, wrote a lengthy letter to Judge R. Lanier
Anderson, chief judge of the 11th Circuit, urging him to cancel the
conference because of a ``lack of balance.'' He charged that the
apparent purpose of the meeting was to turn the courts of the 11th
Circuit ``into the kind of death mills that the state and federal
courts in Texas have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, wrote back
that Bright had misconstrued the purposes of the symposium. In an
interview Wednesday, Anderson said the conference was intended to
reduce the risk of error in capital cases and improve fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's not our purpose to rush defendants to
execution,'' said Anderson, who is based in Macon, Ga. ``The courts
are interested in having cases decided with appropriate expedition,
but only after full and adequate litigation and discussion of every
issue. We certainly did not intend there to be any perception of
one-sidedness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he was not aware of criticism from Bright and
other lawyers that it was inappropriate to discuss executions at a
luxury golf resort. He said the site was chosen because it was
centrally located and attractive enough to get participants to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 93 judges and lawyers invited are required to pay
his or her own way. The brochure sent to the participants includes
a list of the resort's seven restaurants, and also notes the wine
tastings, saunas and four golf courses that are available. One golf
course costs $135 per round.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In most states, it takes years for a prisoner to be executed
after being convicted of a capital crime, due to an array of appeal
rights that include an appeal to the federal courts. Many elected
officials and prosecutors have argued that these delays have in
effect vitiated legitimate death-penalty statutes, and have
searched for ways to reduce grounds for endless appeals.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter of the death penalty, Attorney General Thurbert
Baker of Georgia, said the conference was a perfectly appropriate
forum to discuss ways of making the system more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``An efficient system is one that is beneficial to the victims
of these crimes, and also to the defendants and the courts that
have to process their cases,'' said Baker, who is scheduled to
speak at the conference. ``You want a system that moves these cases
as expeditiously as possible, but in a fair and just manner. It's
unfair to the defendant to wait forever to get an answer on a
post-conviction appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit has a far more moderate reputation on such
appeals than either the 4th Circuit, comprising the Carolinas,
Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, or the 5th, which includes
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Where appellate judges in those circuits are the most aggressive
in the nation in rejecting the appeals of death-row convicts, those
in the 11th Circuit are considered less ideologically rigid and
more independent, said Howard O. Hunter, dean of the Emory
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But some death-penalty lawyers said they believed the circuit
had become more conservative since Carnes was appointed. John
Blume, a Cornell University law professor who defends capital-case
prisoners in the South, said the circuit now rules less often in
favor of defendants, which he said was not surprising given Carnes'
outspokenness on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes, who did not return a phone call Wednesday, wrote
Alabama's rigorous death penalty statute and was in charge of
defending capital-case appeals for the state attorney general's
office, where he often clashed with lawyers who said the process
was unfair because blacks were frequently excluded from Alabama
jury panels. Although he won praise from some liberal voices for
supporting civil rights statutes, he also lobbied Congress to
restrict the right of state prisoners to appeal their convictions
to federal courts and most civil rights groups bitterly fought his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent federal appeals judge speaking at the
conference is Edith Hollan Jones of Texas, who is scheduled to
discuss the 5th Circuit's experience in dealing with death-penalty
appeals, which are rarely supported in her district. Jones has
become known for her anger at defense lawyers who try to delay
executions through a flurry of legal maneuvers, at one point
writing that such lawyers should be stricken from the bar and not
allowed to practice law for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken positions of Jones and Carnes have made them among
the most visible targets of the death-penalty bar. Ronald Tabak, an
attorney with Skadden Arps in New York who is co-chairman of the
American Bar Association's death-penalty committee, said Texas'
record of executing prisoners without adequate counsel made it one
of the worst places from which to learn a lesson in procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Hunter of Emory Law School said he doubted that the 12
judges of the appeals court would be so easily swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wide range of a judges, and a pretty balanced group,''
he said. ``The ones I know are unlikely to be railroaded in one
direction or another.''

 &HT;    Former BellSouth chairman to lead UNC-Chapel Hill
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ A year from now, former BellSouth Vice
Chairman Bill McCoy hopes to retire, once and for all. Until then,
the 65-year-old man in dark pinstripes and gold cuff links is back
at his alma mater as interim chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy is steering UNC-Chapel Hill, North Carolina's flagship
university, through turbulent times until his permanent replacement
is hired next year.
</P>
<P>
   Students are returning to a historic campus still shaken by the
unexpected death of popular Chancellor Michael Hooker, 53, who died
in June of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy also is having to deal with deepening financial worries,
after the state Legislature refused this summer to approve a $3
billion construction package for North Carolina's 16 public
universities.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that UNC-Chapel Hill already was grappling with a
projected $11.6 million budget shortfall. An estimated $5 million
stemmed from an embarrassing oversight by finance officials. They
failed to realize that in the coming year, the university will be
responsible for 27 pay periods, not the usual 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget snafu and the failed bond issue were blows to
Carolina's credibility,'' chided a recent editorial in The Chapel
Hill Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The budget shortfall has since been reduced to $6.8 million, but
it required the elimination of 13 jobs. Though he had no role in
the payroll miscalculation, McCoy said it won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to focus on the university's planning and budgeting _
less visionary than some of Hooker's endeavors, but crucial at this
time, some believe.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, a 1969 UNC graduate, gained popularity as chancellor by
visiting each of North Carolina's 100 counties. After UNC defeated
rival Duke in a men's basketball game, Hooker allowed celebrating
students to hoist his body and pass him atop the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, by contrast, has a penchant for finance, not body
surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His experience in business will directly apply to what we need
to accomplish on the business side of the university,'' said Jane
Stine, a UNC systems programmer and chair of the Employee Forum,
which represents nonfaculty staff. ``I've been extremely impressed
with his quick grasp of the situation here.''
</P>
<P>
   The lean, graying interim chancellor leans over a glass-topped
table in South Building, a corner of the university home to Yackety
Yack yearbooks dating back to the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy is reserved and methodical in his style and in his
expectations for UNC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can keep some of the important things moving along,
maintaining the historic momentum of this school, I will be glad
about it,'' said the 1955 UNC graduate from Snow Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a Marine Corps helicopter pilot, he earned his
reputation as a financial whiz over 35 years in telecommunications,
mostly at BellSouth Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, McCoy played a critical role in the spinoff of
Atlanta-based BellSouth during the breakup of AT&AMP;T. He rose to
chief financial officer and vice chairman and, in 1986, became
president of BellSouth Enterprises, which grew to 17,000 employees
in nonregulated industries such as cellular phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not an effusive sort of guy, a backslapper,'' said Dick
Yarbrough, a retired BellSouth vice president. ``If he had any
emotional bent, it was toward the University of North Carolina. I
think he probably bleeds Tar Heel blue.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy impressed then-UNC President C.D. Spangler, a Charlotte,
N.C., billionaire who served on BellSouth's board of directors.
Another BellSouth director, Charlotte banker Cliff Cameron, served
on UNC's Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
   After McCoy retired from BellSouth, Spangler and Cameron
convinced him to join UNC's General Administration, responsible for
the 16 public universities, as vice president of finance.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from that post in January, hoping to relax with his
wife, Sara, play golf and visit with grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In April, after Hooker went on medical leave, McCoy began a
two-month stint as UNC-Chapel Hill's acting chancellor. Following
Hooker's death, he agreed to return on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think students are looking for a visionary, or for
Bill McCoy to lay out a 10-point plan for what he is going to do,''
said Nic Heinke, 21, the student body president. ``But they are
looking for strong leadership.

BELGIAN COMPANY SCOOPS UP HANNAFORD BROS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCARBOROUGH, Maine _ Continuing a wave of consolidation in the
supermarket industry, Hannaford Bros. Co. said Wednesday it has
agreed to be purchased by the Belgian parent of North
Carolina-based Food Lion Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Delhaize-Le Lion SA of Belgium plans to buy Scarborough-based
Hannaford for $3.6 billion, about $600 million more than what
investors had estimated Hannaford to be worth.
</P>
<P>
   The entire US supermarket industry is spooked by the aggressive
inroads made onto their turf by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which sold an
estimated $36 billion worth of food last year, according to the
Food Institute. The trade group pegs total 1998 sales at
supermarket chains at about $415 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket chains feel they need size to fight Wal-Mart, and
acquisitions, even pricey ones, are the fastest way to bulk up.
</P>
<P>
   When the sale is completed, Delhaize will be the sixth biggest
grocer in the United States. It will also mean that most big New
England grocery chains, including Stop &AMP; Shop, Shaw's, and Star
Markets, will be owned by European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hannaford, which also does business under the Shop 'n Save name,
operates six of its 152 stores in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston area, Hannaford also operates an on-line grocery
home delivery service called HomeRuns.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who use HomeRuns should see no changes as a result of
the acquisition, Hugh G. Farrington, Hannaford's chief executive
officer, said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Delhaize has an on-line delivery service in Europe, but Food
Lion does not, said Paul A. Fritzson, Hannaford's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Though such on-line delivery services have been rapidly
proliferating, none is believed to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, Hannaford has been looking to sell
pieces of HomeRuns to investors in an effort to help finance the
expansion of the service to other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Delhaize is ``definitely interested'' in HomeRuns; what has yet
to be determined is whether Delhaize wants to own 100 percent of
HomeRuns or whether it will pursue Hannaford's plan to seek other
investors for it, Fritzson said.
</P>
<P>
   As a publicly owned mid-sized chain with $3.3 billion in 1998
sales, Hannaford had to make a move to get bigger, Farrington said;
either it had to buy someone else or be bought itself.

   After Hannaford's largest stakeholder indicated this past spring
it was leaning toward cashing out its stock, Hannaford began
actively courting large suitors to see how much they were willing
to pay. If the price was right, Hannaford was prepared to sell. As
it turned out, the price was sky-high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the bids came in at 55 a share, we wouldn't be talking
to you today,'' Fritzson said. ``At 79 a share, we couldn't walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the present environment of ever larger giants, it was going
to become ``tougher and tougher and at some point impossible'' for
a mid-sized chain to deliver growth and value to shareholders, said
Farrington, explaining why Hannaford couldn't stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded into a corner of New England, Hannaford has chafed at
its geographical restraints. In the early 1990s, it bought chains
in North Carolina and Virginia as a way to fuel growth.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC reported Tuesday that Royal Ahold NV, the Dutch parent of
Stop &AMP; Shop Cos., was eager to buy Hannaford.
</P>
<P>
   Later it was reported that a bidding war had broken out, and
investors speculated that interested parties included some of the
largest US operators, including Albertson's and Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   Even after they merge, Food Lion and Hannaford will have
combined sales of only $13.5 billion, much less than the food sales
of such giants as Wal-Mart, Ahold, Kroger Co., and Albertson's.
</P>
<P>
   With the completion of the Hannaford sale, European companies
will control much of the New England grocery business.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ahold's Stop &AMP; Shop, J Sainsbury plc owns Shaw's
Supermarkets Inc. of East Bridgewater, Mass. and recently bought
Star Markets Co. of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Why are European food operators invading the United States, and
US supermarket chains mostly staying at home? (Wal-Mart is the one
exception. It recently bought a British grocery chain.)
</P>
<P>
   Europe is a mature market with little room for growth,
Farrington said, and a food investor can earn far better returns in
the United States than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Farrington said there will be no layoffs at Hannaford as a
result of the sale. He will continue to run Hannaford, and stores
in the chain will keep their names.
</P>
<P>
   With 1998 revenues of $10.2 billion and headquarters in
Salisbury, N.C., Food Lion operates 1,258 stores in states from
Pennsylvania to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect consolidation to stop anytime soon, said editor
Craig Faucher of the Griffin Report of Food Marketing.

   PALMAPAMPA, Peru _ The days when drug dealers flew freely in and
out of this little tropical town in the Apurimac Valley with thick
wads of cash ended four years ago, right after President Alberto K.
Fujimori ordered the armed forces to shoot down planes suspected of
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``air bridge'' was broken, the demand for coca leaf
plummeted, and the price dropped by more than 60 percent between
April 1995 and August 1995. Farmers began abandoning coca growing,
giving U.S. and Peruvian officials the chance to teach them how to
grow legitimate crops like premium coffee and cacao and build roads
to take their new produce to market.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of coca leaf has shot back up over the last year _
two-thirds of the way to its 1995 highs. The reason, officials say,
is that traffickers have found ways to reopen some air routes and
to replace others with river, road and sea channels, making coca
profitable once again.
</P>
<P>
   The change underscores the cyclical nature of a drug war in Peru
that is unavoidably tied to the appetite for cocaine in America and
Europe and to the impossibility of choking all the trafficking
routes that shift nimbly through South American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in nearby countries, whether they are gains or
setbacks for the drug trade, have opened the way for a resurgence
of trafficking in Peru, with smugglers testing the limits of the
resources that the United States and regional governments can
deploy in a vast shell game that spans the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Peru had seemingly demolished its reputation as
the world's biggest producer of coca leaf, the hillsides here are
again teeming with newly pruned coca fields and with workers _ as
young as 5 _ picking them within sight of the Peruvian police.
Local authorities now speak of Peruvian, Colombian and Brazilian
traffickers plying rivers and traveling jungle paths on mules to
avoid the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Peru, the drug control situation is deteriorating,'' Gen.
Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, told a House subcommittee on Aug. 6. ``Peruvian coca prices
have been rising since March 1998, making alternative development
and eradication more difficult. Some farmers are returning to
abandoned fields and the central growing areas are rejuvenating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' he said, ``rebounding cultivation in Peru would be
a setback to U.S. interests.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's remarks received little notice in the United States,
buried as they were within long testimony on the worsening drug and
security situation in Colombia and his urgings for more United
States aid there. But they got banner headlines in Peru and brought
a heated reaction from Fujimori, who criticized the United States
for not doing enough to control domestic consumption of illegal
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The brief dispute came as a rare exception to years of praise
from U.S. officials, who have trumpeted Peru as a success story for
driving most cocaine trafficking from its borders. But that slack
in the trafficking was quickly taken up by smugglers in other
countries. With the air bridge down, the Colombians began growing
more of the crop for themselves, and Colombia replaced Peru as the
premier producer of coca leaf.
</P>
<P>
   After Fujimori made his threat, the Peruvian air force shot down
about 25 planes it suspected of being used by traffickers and
forced down many more. At the same time, Peru began an aggressive
eradication effort, reducing the total coca acreage in the country
by 56 percent _ from 287,500 acres to 125,000 acres _ between 1995
and 1998, CIA satellite intelligence photography shows. Peru is
continuing its eradication pace, nearly reaching its goal of
destroying 20,000 more acres this year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Peruvian officials say the steep increase in coca
prices is a result of several developments. Drug use in Peru itself
is rising, offering a more lucrative local market. As Bolivia makes
headway in eradicating its coca fields, demand to replace Bolivian
leaves for local consumption and shipment to Europe is growing.
Meanwhile, the fighting between rebels and the government in
Colombia may be interrupting shipments from fields there.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, analysts say, the prices are going
up here because international traffickers have again found ways to
get their coca crop out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   New Peruvian organizations are shipping cocaine to Europe, where
street prices are often twice as high as in the United States,
law-enforcement officials say. There are reports of increased
trafficking of unrefined coca base and cocaine up the coastal
Pan-American Highway to Colombian-controlled laboratories in
Ecuador, eventual shipment to Colombia and finally to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations are reportedly moving drugs by road south
to Chile and then by container ship to Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gil, the executive secretary of Contradrogas, the main
civilian antidrug agency in Peru, said traffickers were also
resuming some flights. He said Peru was pressing the Clinton
administration to resume the Awacs and P-3 Orion surveillance
flights that helped the Peruvian air force intercept smuggling
planes. The flights were halted in May 1998 to increase aerial
spying over Colombia as more trafficking shifted there.
</P>
<P>
   After months of pleading by the U.S. Embassy in Lima, the
Clinton administration says it will resume P-3 flights over Peru
later in August.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're worried,'' Gil said. ``The basis of our
program is bringing the price of coca down so legitimate crops can
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian police officials say their guard was left down when El
Nino hit early last year, forcing the security forces to transfer
helicopters and planes used in antidrug operations to the flooded
Pacific coast for emergency aid duty. At the same time, U.S.
officials said, the Peruvian military sent some planes to the
border with Ecuador when tensions between the countries rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' said Capt. Vicente Rossi Malaga, commander of
the Peruvian National Police in the Apurimac Valley. ``We took
their plane routes, but now they use boats, mules and people
willing to carry the stuff 10 to 15 days in the jungle. We need
helicopters, boats and more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. and Peruvian officials said, the amount of cocaine
moving out of Peru into international markets is nowhere near the
levels reached in 1995. But several said that if they could not
drive the price down in the next year, trafficking would almost
certainly creep up to past levels. They noted that in some areas,
fields that had been abandoned are now in use again and peasants
flush with cash are increasing yields with herbicides and
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvians have stepped up their interdiction efforts _ which
lagged badly in 1998 _ with seizures this year already exceeding
last year's totals largely because of several large seizures in
ports in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States is increasing antidrug aid, from
$56.3 million in 1998 to $87 million in 1999. The aid includes more
U.S. training of Peruvian customs officials and navy personnel
patrolling suspected Amazon River trafficking routes.

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Here in Palmapampa, U.S. money went into lengthening and
improving an airstrip, once used by drug traffickers and now used
to ferry in supplies for civilian projects and law-enforcement
efforts. A police base with helicopter pads will be built by the
strip with dormitories for up to 60 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The base, which is supposed to be up and running by September,
will be used for police sweeps, drug intelligence operations and
airborne operations intended to shut down cocaine refining pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we drive the narcos out of this valley, we'll drive the
price down again,'' said a U.S. official. ``I'm still optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism is partly based on hundreds of peasants who have
sworn off coca growing over the last three years and found new
occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Gutierrez, 37, who transports cacao down a local river to
a U.S.-financed production project for about $200 a month, said he
gave up coca growing in 1995 when his earnings fell to only $3 a
day. ``Now I don't care what the price rises to,'' he said.
``Growing coca is too dangerous and not worth all the trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But Juan Mucha Condemayta, 24, has another story. When the price
of coca began to rise last year and the prices of legal commodities
went down, he began to grow coca bushes on a one-acre plot he rents
overlooking Palmapampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca is the only resource we have to make a living,'' he said.
``There just isn't enough work for all of us.''

 &HT;    Scientists clue in to social behavior through gene altering
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A snuggling pile of furry brown rodents, no larger
than a kiwi, has provided Emory University scientists with a clue
to why some people play well with others _ and some don't.
</P>
<P>
   The rodents are prairie voles, a species known for being
sociable and monogamous. By inserting one of their genes into
ordinary lab mice, Emory researchers have created a more sociable
breed of mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time a single gene has been linked to complex
social behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   No, the gene therapy isn't available for use on cranky
co-workers, neighbors or relatives. But scientists hope the
research, reported today in the journal Nature, will bring them
closer to understanding and better treating autism, a neurological
disorder that afflicts more than 500,000 people in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings up the possibility of altering behavior in animals
in a predictable way,'' said lead researcher Larry Young, an
associate professor of psychiatry at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Young and his research team bred the transgenic mice by
incorporating a prairie vole gene that causes the development of
brain-cell receptors that respond to a naturally occurring hormone,
vasopressin. Vasopressin affects social behavior such as
communication and aggression, and plays a role in the formation of
pair bonds, as between mates.
</P>
<P>
   Emory researchers noted the genetically altered mice developed
vasopressin receptors in the same parts of the brain as in prairie
voles. Also, after being given vasopressin, the transgenic mice
became more sociable than normal mice. Israel I. Lederhendler, a
neuroscientist at the National Institute of Mental Health, called
it ``a remarkable finding.'' NIMH funded the Emory study through

 &HT;    Scientists clue in to social behavior through gene altering
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A snuggling pile of furry brown rodents, no larger
than a kiwi, has provided Emory University scientists with a clue
to why some people play well with others _ and some don't.
</P>
<P>
   The rodents are prairie voles, a species known for being
sociable and monogamous. By inserting one of their genes into
ordinary lab mice, Emory researchers have created a more sociable
breed of mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time a single gene has been linked to complex
social behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   No, the gene therapy isn't available for use on cranky
co-workers, neighbors or relatives. But scientists hope the
research, reported today in the journal Nature, will bring them
closer to understanding and better treating autism, a neurological
disorder that afflicts more than 500,000 people in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings up the possibility of altering behavior in animals
in a predictable way,'' said lead researcher Larry Young, an
associate professor of psychiatry at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Young and his research team bred the transgenic mice by
incorporating a prairie vole gene that causes the development of
brain-cell receptors that respond to a naturally occurring hormone,
vasopressin. Vasopressin affects social behavior such as
communication and aggression, and plays a role in the formation of
pair bonds, as between mates.
</P>
<P>
   Emory researchers noted the genetically altered mice developed
vasopressin receptors in the same parts of the brain as in prairie
voles. Also, after being given vasopressin, the transgenic mice
became more sociable than normal mice. Israel I. Lederhendler, a
neuroscientist at the National Institute of Mental Health, called
it ``a remarkable finding.'' NIMH funded the Emory study through
grants. The Emory study may provide new clues to autism and other
psychiatric disorders all characterized by antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Autistic people often have problems communicating and may show
little interest in making friends. Autism gained public awareness
through the 1988 movie ``Rain Man,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as an
autistic savant who was severely withdrawn but a near-genius at
math.

STUDY SUGGESTS NEED FOR THYROID SCREENING AMONG PREGNANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children born to women who had even a mildly underactive thyroid
during pregnancy are nearly four times as likely to grow up with
significantly lower IQs, suggests a study that raises for the first
time the possibility that thousands of newborns are at risk each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on these findings, the authors of the report in the
current New England Journal of Medicine conclude that routine
screening of pregnant women for an underactive thyroid may be
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``With systematic screening, we could be able to protect the IQ
of. . .somewhere between 1 and 2 out of 100 kids,'' said Dr. James
E. Haddow, lead author of the study and medical director of the
Foundation for Blood Research, a nonprofit medical research and
education institute based in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Wood, president and medical director of the Thyroid
Foundation of America, a patient advocacy group in Boston, agreed
with the study's conclusion. ``What would you think if you were
pregnant? Might you want to jeopardize your kid's IQ?''
</P>
<P>
   But other physicians familiar with the study said it is too
early to say that a mother's mild but untreated thyroid deficiency
causes the apparent difference in IQ, or to call for widespread
testing along the lines of prenatal screening for Down syndrome and
other conditions. They also contended that the average IQ
difference, of seven points, is relatively slight and within the
normal range of variation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pooh-poohing it. I'm not dismissing it. But I am
trying to place it in perspective so there isn't panic in the
streets when this article hits the airwaves,'' said Dr. Michael F.
Greene, director of maternal fetal medicine at Massachusetts
General Hospital and chairman of the committee on obstetrical
practice for the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 100 years, it's been known that children can develop
mental retardation and other problems as a result of their mothers'
severe thyroid deficiency, or their own. Such deficiency can come
from a lack of dietary iodine, an autoimmune disorder that leads
the body to attack the thyroid gland, or other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, newborn screening to diagnose and treat
such severe deficiency within the first few weeks of life has
helped virtually eliminate so-called cretinism in the United States
_ retarded mental and physical development that usually led to a
lifetime of institutionalization. Also reducing the risk has been
the addition of iodine to salt and other measures. About 1 in 4,000
babies are born at risk of the extreme hypothyroidism according to
the thyroid foundation's Wood, who is an internist at MGH's thyroid
unit.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first study to so carefully document a link between
a mother's mild thyroid deficiency and the IQ of her child. Thyroid
problems, particularly the early stages of underactive thyroid _ or
hypothyroidism _ are among the most easily missed of medical
ailments. Millions of Americans, primarily women, have thyroid
disease, and many of them do not know it. Symptoms include fatigue
and sluggishness, and risk factors include having such other
autoimmune diseases as Type I diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released in response to the study, Dr. Duane
Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development, supported the idea of early detection and
treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnant women as part of prenatal
care, just as there is prenatal screening for other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the health of the mother can be a key factor in
her baby's health,'' said Alexander, whose institute helped fund
the study. ``This study suggests that hypothyroidism might be added
to the group of correctable maternal conditions that can influence
the long-term health of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Robert D.
Utiger, a New England Journal deputy editor, said that before
routine screening is introduced, steps to increase dietary iodine _
like making sure prenatal vitamins have iodine and increasing
iodine in salt and other foods _ should be taken first.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved the analysis of stored blood samples
collected from more than 25,200 pregnant women between 1987 and
1990, and the identification of women who had low thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) and their children, and those who had
normal levels. The study's co-authors came from the Foundation for
Blood Research, the New England Newborn Screening Program in
Jamaica Plain, Children's Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center and Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Once the children reached 7 to 9 years of age, they were given a
battery of 15 tests relating to intelligence, school performance
and other measures by the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the children born to the 47 women who were found to have had
low TSH during pregnancy without being diagnosed and treated, 19
percent of them had IQ scores of below 85 points. A score of below
85 usually indicates below-average intelligence and trouble in
school. The average IQ score for this group was 100.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 5 percent of the study's 124 children whose
mothers had normal TSH levels during pregnancy had IQ scores of
below 85 points, according to the study. The average IQ score for
this group was 107.
</P>
<P>
   In a heartening note, the study found that the 15 children born
to women who continued to have low TSH levels during pregnancy
despite being diagnosed and treated for the thyroid problem grew up
with nearly the same IQ scores as the children who were born to
healthy mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the study does not prove cause and effect, MGH's Greene
urged caution in interpreting the results.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the same autoimmune disorder that leads a
woman's body to start attacking the thyroid gland also leads to an
attack on the fetus, thus possibly affecting IQ, Greene said. In
fact, he added, women with hypothyroidism have a higher risk of
miscarriage in the first trimester, perhaps as a result of such an
autoimmune response.
</P>
<P>
   While Greene voiced caution, he also said if one of his patients
wanted to get tested for TSH, he would explain his reservations and
then order the test if she still wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   The TSH test costs about $40 to $50 commercially, but could be
done more cheaply if done as part of a massive screening program,
according to study author Haddow. In addition to receiving funding
for the research from the federal government, Haddow and his
colleagues were supported by the Thrasher Research Fund and Knoll
Pharmaceutical Company, a maker of a thyroid hormone replacement.

EXPLORING `PLACE' CAN BE TRICKY WHEN THE PLACE IS SOMEONE ELSE'S  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RUTH LOPEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The biennial exhibition of international
contemporary art that opened here last month was devoted to
exploring the meaning of ``place.'' But even before the opening
festivities were over, two installations had been shut down
precisely because of their locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for a Place'' was the title of the third biennial
sponsored by SITE Santa Fe, a nonprofit arts center in a city
that's a magnet for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of the biennial is the search for places charged
with meaning,'' said Rosa Martinez, the independent curator who put
the exhibition together, ``to explore their potential and their
energies, and to heighten the sensibility of spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she wanted the notion of place to extend beyond
the geographical to psychological and political space. ``What I am
drawn to is work created with a spectator and their participation
in mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the participation took an unexpected turn after two works of
art were set in places that could be considered nerve centers of
this tricultural region: a graveyard belonging to a largely
Hispanic Roman Catholic parish, and a lake on one of the nearby
Indian Pueblos.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous two biennials, which were largely contained
in SITE Santa Fe's gallery space, an 18,000-square-foot former beer
distribution warehouse, this year's exhibition included 10 other
venues, from a room at a motel to an old village dance hall to the
Los Alamos airport.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Grachos, the arts center's director, saw it as a good way
to involve the community. For Ms. Martinez it was also a political
act, a breaking away from what she called the nice, white museum
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial's planners received official permission to use all
of the sites. But they may have lost sight of the fact that in this
rapidly developing area, protecting your place can be tantamount to
survival. Some of the places chosen for the exhibition already
belonged, spiritually, to others, and were already imbued with
their own potent meanings.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was San Ildefonso Pueblo, 21 miles northwest of
Santa Fe, perhaps the most well-known of the northern New Mexico
pueblos because of the highly collectible black pottery made there.
On its land is the Black Mesa, a sacred spot, where the Pueblo
fought against the Spanish in 1694.
</P>
<P>
   According to the proposal she submitted, the Mexican artist
Yolanda Gutierrez intended her installation ``Nos Susurra el Rio y
Silva la Serpiente/The River Whispers to Us and the Snake
Whistles'' to be ``a new symbol of brotherhood between the North
American and Mesoamerican cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gutierrez built an 82-foot-long snake of styrofoam and
covered it with ears of yellow and blue corn, then floated it on a
lake at the pueblo. Two days later it was gone, removed after
religious elders objected to the piece. While the feathered serpent
Quetzalcoatl was a central deity of the Aztecs, snakes hold
different, and more negative, meanings for the Pueblo people.
</P>
<P>
   The problem may have been that the religious elders were
offended by the symbolism, or it may have been a power struggle
between them and the governing body of the tribe, which approved
the project without community involvement. More than likely it was
both.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gutierrez, who does not speak English, said she regretted
not giving a community presentation about her work. ``There wasn't
anyone available to help translate,'' she said, and on the day of
the installation there was no time to explain what she was doing
because a rainstorm was brewing and the focus was on getting the
piece in the lake quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The second work that stirred protective feelings was installed
at Our Lady of Guadelupe cemetery on the edge of downtown Santa Fe.
The Swedish artist Carl Michael von Hausswolff's installation ``Red
Night'' was a simple project consisting of about a half-dozen
spotlights covered with red filters and timed to bathe the
graveyard in red light from dusk to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Permission for the installation had been granted by the city,
the neighborhood association and the church's parish council. But a
parishioner with relatives buried in the cemetery attended the
opening ceremony, found the project offensive and asked the pastor
to have it removed.
</P>
<P>
   What Von Hausswolff had hoped to accomplish by lighting the
cemetery, he said, was to draw attention to a forgotten place. ``It
was almost like a garbage dump,'' he said of the somewhat neglected
burial ground, and because of his installation it had been cleaned
up. Then the attention had taken another form.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one does outdoor projects, one has to be prepared for
what might happen,'' said von Hausswolff, who stood outside the
long and narrow cemetery on the fourth, and last night it was
lighted. The parish allowed the installation to remain that long to
give him an opportunity to document it.
</P>
<P>
   During a panel discussion on the proliferation of biennials that
was part of the opening weekend, the first question from the
audience had to do with the two removed artworks. Was finding
something ``radical'' always the goal of a curator in selecting
work?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to bring in ideas that you support, ideas that you
find challenging,'' said Okwui Enwezor, the director of the
forthcoming Documenta XI in Kassel, Germany. He asked,
rhetorically, whether the illumination of the cemetery had been
radical. ``I think it is important to ask that question,'' Enwezor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harald Szeemann, the director of the Venice Biennale and a
member of the panel, offered a more blunt explanation to a reporter
afterward. ``This is what happens when you take art to the
peasantry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez, an independent curator from Barcelona, Spain, who
directed the recent Istanbul Biennial, said she had chosen artists
for ``Looking for a Place'' who would ``seek to incite emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal biennial is a profoundly political and spiritual
event,'' Ms. Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that no painters were invited _ painting had not
``renovated'' itself, she said _ and the exhibition, which
continues through December, is instead rich in photography as well
as installation and video art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez is eager to cross boundaries in her definition of
an artist. Among the participants exhibiting in the SITE Santa Fe
gallery is the group Greenpeace, which is showing several huge
photographs documenting its environmental actions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez said she had invited the activist group to
participate because it illustrated how to think about certain world
problems. The only difference between Greenpeace and the other
participants, she said, is that ``Greenpeace participants do not
call themselves artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Another illustration of Ms. Martinez's desire to make
environmental concerns part of her examination of the meaning of
place is ``Map,'' a 25-by-48-foot arrangement of clear marbles by
the Beirut-born artist Mona Hatoum; in the shape of the world, it
dominates the floor of the main hall. The loosely situated marbles
are easily disturbed by the vibrations set off by people walking
nearby _ a metaphor, Ms. Martinez said, for the fragility of the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian photographer Shirin Neshat's video ``Rapture,''
examining male and female space in the Islamic world, emerges as
one of the biennial's strongest works. Two black and white
projections face each other: on one side are Iranian women wearing
chadors, on the other are the men. It is impossible to watch both
at the same time, and the viewer is forced, with each turn of the
head, to remain in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine artist Sergio Vega contributes a diorama examining
the idea of paradise. It is a continuation of work that Vega, who
lives in New York, began with a show in March at Basilico Fine Arts
in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that one of the most successful of the
off-site installations _ a piece that takes the area head-on and
encourages spectators to explore its contextual landscape and
social setting _ comes from the one artist who lives in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Teters, a Spokane Indian who is on the faculty of the
Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, plays off the
monument in the center of the city's plaza and notoriously
dedicated to ``the heroes who died in various battles with savage
Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the American Indian Movement in the 1970s,
someone climbed over the fence surrounding the obelisk and chipped
out the word ``savage.'' Teter's obelisk of adobe bricks, which
sits in front of the New Mexico State Capitol Building, bears a
single word: ``Savage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez said she was satisfied with the results of the
biennial, even though two of the works had been taken down almost
as soon as the show opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot see this snake in the lake of San Ildefonso
Pueblo for six months, we will see it in the documentation,'' she
said. ``The miracle has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Installation work, of course, is by its very nature ephemeral,
never created to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been a little bit more ephemeral than expected,''
she said.

MILITIA ATROCITIES IN TIMOR CITED BY RIGHTS GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: T. Kumar is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two weeks before a vote on East Timor's
future, anti-independence militias connected to Indonesia's
military have killed, tortured and illegally detained activists,
Amnesty International charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government, which annexed East Timor 24 years
ago, denounced the report, calling it one-sided. ``We are doing the
best we can in maintaining security in East Timor,'' said Sofi
Suarma, an official at the Indonesian Embassy here. ``The situation
has improved recently.''
</P>
<P>
   But T. Kumar, the human rights group's advocacy director for
Asia and a former political prisoner in his native Sri Lanka, said
Indonesia has failed to protect the pro-independence movement while
allowing the militia nearly free reign. The vote is set for Aug.
30.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of violence, he said, continued Wednesday with
militiamen brandishing guns, spears and machetes, injuring several
independence supporters near the western border town of Maliana.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-independence factions ``continue to enjoy the support or
acquiescence of the Indonesian military and police,'' the Amnesty
report said. The violence has killed dozens of civilians and
displaced tens of thousands of people. Kumar said about 200
pro-independence activists have been arrested in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
surprisingly offered the 800,000 people of East Timor a vote to
gain full independence or remain part of Indonesia as an autonomous
region, violence has surged in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Habibie made a promise, the militia is basically
out of control in East Timor,'' Kumar said Wednesday at a news
conference. ``We hope by releasing the report now, it will increase
pressure on the Indonesian government to fulfill the promise it
gave.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor activists have captured international attention for
their long struggle for independence. Two leaders, Bishop Carlos
Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, received the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1996. The country, for generations a Portugese colony, appeared
on the verge of independence in the mid-1970s when Indonesia
brutally invaded and massacred tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most observers predict that a majority of East Timor
residents would vote for independence, the referendum could still
be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has delayed the vote twice already, and its
officials could do so again if the security situation worsens. The
UN headquarters was a target of anti-militia activists, and
analysts believe that UN observers could face further danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations could be caught in the middle,'' said
Jonathan S. Paris, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and
co-editor of ``The Politics of Post-Suharto Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   If UN observers are in danger, ``the question then would be
whether the US Marines would come in to help them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Paris, the increase in violence was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-independence forces _ portions of the military,
Japanese business interests and nationalist Indonesians who fear
other independence movements will try to break away from the nation
_ ``have such clear-cut losses with an independence vote. And those
people who stand to lose have so much control and power now,''
Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's future has also played a role in the run-up to
parliament's upcoming vote on Indonesia's presidency, which pits
Habibie against front-runner Megawati Sukarnoputri. Megawati has
said Habibie ``ignored the constitution'' by agreeing to the East
Timor vote, but she said her government would respect the outcome.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ More than 1,000 relief workers from 19
countries joined the frantic search Wednesday for victims of
Tuesday's devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raised an
outcry over shoddy construction practices and lax government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Although rescue workers continued to find people alive under the
rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll climbed steadily: By
Wednesday night, according to an official count, 3,879 bodies had
been recovered. More than 16,000 people were listed as seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that the death toll could
rise further. He said rescue teams had been unable to reach some
areas because roads are impassable and communications disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament met in special session, and members listened gravely
as the minister of Public Works and Housing, Koray Aydin, described
the extent of the calamity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing the greatest natural disaster in the history of
the Turkish Republic,'' Aydin said. ``For the first time, we have
had an earthquake that affected the area where 45 percent of the
Turkish population lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign help is especially vital because early rescue efforts by
the Turkish authorities have been plagued by inexperience, poor
organization and lack of supplies. In some stricken towns, newly
arrived foreigners found no organized rescue effort under way and
took charge themselves, directing battalions of eager volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   News commentators pilloried the government for what they said
were inexcusable lapses, both in preparing for an earthquake that
scientists said was sure to come and in dealing with it after it
struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rescue effort is a fiasco,'' one Istanbul newspaper
asserted. Another said, ``Rescue and relief is coming late or not
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts blamed unscrupulous contractors and ineffective
inspectors for having contributed to the scope of the catastrophe
by allowing the construction of flimsy buildings that could not
withstand a quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inevitable happened, despite years and years of repeated
warnings,'' said Ahmet Ercan, a professor of geophysics at Istanbul
Technical University. ``Officials refused to face facts. They never
insisted that contractors survey the risks and build
earthquake-resistant structures. Maybe after this bitter
experience, we will update our regulations along the lines of
Japan, the United States and Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the quake was near Izmit, about 55 miles east
of Istanbul. There, an astonishing number of the destroyed
buildings were new, built within the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Semiha Adiyaman, a plump and vigorous grandmother in her
sixties, lived in an apartment, one of five five-story buildings
perched together on a hilltop just outside of Izmit.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday she stood by possessions that workers had extracted
from the rubble: a pile of clothing, suitcases that did not close,
curtains, a kitchen chair.
</P>
<P>
   Then she clambered over concrete debris to the fringes of the
rock pile that was once her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you should look into,'' she said angrily,
grabbing hold of quarter-inch steel rods jutting out of the
concrete. ``This is too thin and it was done to save money.
Somebody needs to look into this and ask if the buildings were too
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other residents of Izmit posed similar questions,
complaining that contractors had scrimped on the amount of cement
used to bind the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In Darica, a suburb of Izmit, the central shopping area reopened
more or less normally Wednesday. The weekly street markets bustled,
selling everything from fruit to shoes. Yet on the hilltop where
Mrs. Adiyaman lived, perhaps a mile away, three out of five
identical apartment buildings had been flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal earthquakes are common in Turkey, occurring about once
every two years. But most strike the rugged and sparsely populated
eastern provinces. This one hit the country's densely populated
industrial heartland, the region southwest of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighborhoods in Istanbul itself were also damaged, but
Tuesday's quake was not the enormous one that some scientists say
is likely to strike this teeming metropolis sometime in the coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Historic monuments such as the Haghia Sophia, once the seat of
Byzantine power, and Topkapi Palace, from which Ottoman sultans
ruled, were unscathed by Tuesday's powerful quake.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary
magnitude of 7.8, but downgraded that to 7.4, one of the strongest
of the century anywhere in the world. Turkish seismologists put its
strength at 7.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely serious quake, really terrible,'' said a
foreign diplomat who toured the affected area by car and
helicopter. ``You see these huge heaps of rubble and you ask, `How
are they ever going to get anyone out of there?' It's a God-awful
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no new aftershocks on Wednesday, but many Turkish
families in the earthquake zone have nonetheless chosen to remain
in tents or other outdoor shelters for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   With so much effort being made to rescue those who are believed
still alive, there has been little time to assess long-term damage.
But television footage from many towns showed utter destruction
that will certainly cripple Turkey's effort to climb out of the
economic troubles into which it has fallen this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Teams of rescue workers arrived steadily at the Istanbul airport
on Wednesday. Officials carrying clipboards wandered through the
arrival lounge asking passengers, ``Are you rescue people?''
</P>
<P>
   Among emergency workers who arrived Wednesday were 70 from the
United States, most of them firefighters who rushed to Izmit, where
the country's largest oil refinery burned through the day as
emergency crews awaited specially equipped French and German planes
that were used to extinguish oil well fires after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every European country sent money, relief workers or
equipment, including Greece, which is Turkey's principal rival in
the eastern Mediterranean. The European Union contributed $2.1
million in emergency aid. Relief planes also arrived from
non-European countries including Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Pakistan
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The largest foreign contributor so far has been Israel, which
dispatched two firefighting planes, teams of dogs trained to track
buried humans, and 350 relief workers, some from specialized
military units that joined the search for survivors after U.S.
embassies in Africa were bombed last year. Israel has also pledged
to send a fully equipped field hospital within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and Israel have forged a strong strategic partnership
over the last few years, and Israel is evidently anxious to show
that it can be a good friend when Turkey is in need.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Turkish television stations broadcast nearly non-stop coverage
of relief efforts. The most poignant scenes showed victims being
brought out from the wreckage of collapsed buildings. Overwrought
spectators cheered and sobbed each time a survivor was found, and
simply sobbed when bodies, including many of small children, were
seen to be lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   Although Izmit and the nearby town of Adapazari were believed to
have been the hardest hit, another focus of the relief effort is
the port of Golcuk on the Sea of Marmara. The navy base there was
destroyed, and local officials said that 100 others may lie beneath
the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey sits atop some of the world's most unstable geology.
Scientists said Tuesday's earthquake was along the Anatolia Fault,
a 100-mile arc that winds beneath northwestern provinces near
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly no surprise,'' said Ahmet Mete Isikara,
director of an observatory in Istanbul and a leading specialist on
earthquake risk. ``There is no technique for predicting
earthquakes, so we couldn't say when it would happen. But we knew
it would, sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Anatolia fault zone is quite complex, but certainly the
possibility of an even bigger earthquake, even one in Istanbul, is
still there. Most probably we will get a lot of lessons from this
quake. We have to, otherwise we will suffer the same thing in the
future.''

TEEN DRUG USE IS DOWN, US SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Teen drug use dropped last year, but use among
young adults continued to increase, signaling worrisome trends for
the group, the government announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials, releasing the annual National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse, reported that the rate of drug use among the general
population has steadied.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drop among teens is encouraging, ``we have a long
way to go,'' said Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which interviewed 25,000 people ages 12 and up,
found that 9.9 percent of teens, ages 12-17, had used some sort of
drugs in 1998, down from 11.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among young adults, ages 18-25, the figure rose to 16.1 percent,
a rate that has been inching up since 1994, when usage was at 13.4
percent. In particular, cocaine usage rose to 2 percent last year
from 1.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Officials attributed the growing statistic to the fact that the
same group of people who used drugs as teenagers are using drugs
now as young adults.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimated that about 13.6 million people had used
drugs in 1998, a slight decrease from the 13.9 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the leveling of drug use in the general population
shows that the nation has ``turned the corner'' in the battle
against illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Teen drug use had shot up in the mid-1990s, but has leveled off
since then. Earlier reports of decline have been met with
cautiousness, but health officials said this year's survey results
gives them renewed confidence that a real decline is under way.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, the percentage of teens who had ever
tried drugs had also dropped, to 16.4 percent last year from 18.8
percent in 1997. The survey also showed a decline in the use of
marijuana _ by far the most popular drug _ to 8.3 percent from 9.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, teen drug use is almost twice as high as it
was early in the decade, when usage was at a low of 5.3 percent.
Marijuana use among youth was also at its lowest in 1992 at 3.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is finally getting through,'' Shalala said. ``But
we have a long way to go because more than a million young people
are dependent on drugs. ...That's a million too many.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, marijuana draws nearly twice as many
users as cocaine, LSD, heroin and other drugs combined. Some 11
million Americans smoked marijuana last year, similar to last
year's figures.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found tobacco use to be at its lowest recorded
rate _ about 27.7 percent of Americans admitted to smoking last
year, a slight drop from the 29.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate of teen smoking has remained steady at about 18
percent, and among young adults, the rate has increased to 41.6
percent in 1998 from 40.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, the rate of drug use has
increased among minority groups. The percentage of blacks using
drugs rose to 8.2 percent last year from 5.8 percent in 1993. Drug
use among Hispanics rose to 6.1 percent from 4.4 percent during
those years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase among some groups, health officials
remained optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our number one mission is to educate and enable our young
people to reject illegal drugs,'' Shalala said. ``That means
pushing ahead until we are not only around the corner, but we are
all the way home.''

EVEN THOUGH FADED AWAY, DYNASTY TALK HASN'T DIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Membership is in steady decline. ``The
Glory Days Gang'' is now more exclusive than ever. Time flies in
football. It's amazing how quickly heroes are reduced to relics.
</P>
<P>
   A mere three NFL seasons ago, the Dallas Cowboys were a mighty
dynasty. But today?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we once had, we probably took for granted,'' said
receiver Michael Irvin as training camp opened last month. ``It's
human nature that only after you lose something special do you
finally come to appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, Irvin added, ``Now we are trying to get it back. And
that's the hardest part.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the impossible part. The Cowboys of the '90s will not be
the Cowboys of '99. Raw numbers tell the story _ only 10 players
remain with three Super Bowl rings from the decade. Only 15 are on
the roster from the most recent Super Bowl victory, January of '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been gone just four years, but it's amazing how many guys
on this team that I don't know,'' said free-agent signee Mark
Stepnoski, an original member of the dynasty foundation group.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman is another key dynasty alum. He went on record early
in this training camp as saying he would be retired by now if he
didn't think the Cowboys could and would return to Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson has his three rings, and refuses to
discuss any other team goal other than winning the Super Bowl
again.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin agrees totally.
</P>
<P>
   Stepnoski watched his teammates from afar for four seasons _
``afar'' being wherever the Houston-Tennessee-Oilers-Titans
happened to be located, which was Houston, Memphis and then
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   His return to the Cowboys in the off-season was a football
natural. The Cowboys needed a veteran, quality center and, at age
32, Stepnoski fit the description. Plus, he had the old Valley
Ranch roots along with two Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of not winning, I know that,'' said Stepnoski, who
accepted the free-agent riches offered by Houston after the 1994
season.
</P>
<P>
   But in his Dallas return, was a thought also given to helping
revive the glory days of the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Stepnoski, shrugging. ``I don't know our
team well enough at the moment to have an opinion on Super Bowls or
anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did like was after a bad season (the 6-10 record in
'97), they came back and played well last year. They flipped the
record back to 10-6, and even with the disappointments in the last
part of the season, turning around a team in this league is harder
than most people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepnoski is optimistic about the Cowboys being a team on the
upswing under Chan Gailey's coaching guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added with a smile. ``I know if you're not talking
Super Bowl in Dallas, no one wants to hear about it. The good and
the bad is that everyone is spoiled. But that speaks to the history
of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into this training camp three weeks ago, there was reason
for optimism. Not necessarily Super Bowl optimism. But a strong
free-agent class, including Stepnoski, combined with high hopes for
the rookie draft class, cast a positive glow over the campus of
Midwestern State University.
</P>
<P>
   The Deion-Leon issue was even being shoved a bit to the
background.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gailey won't admit it, and neither did Aikman
Wednesday, camp progress has been minimal _ actually, there might
have been no progress thus far. The scene is murky, to say the
least.
</P>
<P>
   Three key components of the offense _ new receiver Rocket
Ismail, starting guard Everett McIver and tight end David LaFleur _
have contributed nothing. Because of injuries, none of the three
has taken an exhibition game snap, although LaFleur is expected to
play Saturday night in New England.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the expanded role in the offense of running back
Chris Warren is on hold again this week. He missed much of last
season with a severe groin muscle strain, and the ailment has
flared again.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has its Leon-Deion issue, but cornerback has also
become an injury hole, and ailing free-agent linebacker Quentin
Coryatt is waiting on his first snap in two years. There is,
however, a better balance of good news-bad news on defense, because
of the camp emergence of young linemen Peppi Zellner, Ebenezer
Ekuban, Nathan Davis and Brandon Noble, and rookie linebacker Dat
Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the upside, and Gailey points this out repeatedly, the
regular season opener is still 24 days away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not where we want to be, but we have time to change
that,'' Gailey said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Glory Days Gang,'' however, is as impatient as the common
fan. They still talk Super Bowl, even in the midst of a training
camp full of injury blahs.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits are difficult to change, no matter what reality might
suggest. nn

SMITH MAY DROP PLANS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>

 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who ditched the
Republican Party last month to join the US Taxpayers Party,
announced Wednesday he is leaving his new party and is considering
shelving his long-shot pursuit of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is in his second term, left the Republican Party on
July 13, saying the group had strayed from its core conservative
beliefs. He announced last week he would seek the presidential
nomination of the Taxpayers Party, but Wednesday, he told business
leaders at a political breakfast in Bedford, N.H., he had changed
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore allegiance to the Constitution, not to any political
party,'' Smith said, adding he will remain an Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his experience with the Republican Party and the
writings of George Washington had swayed him from partisan
politics. He did not elaborate on his split with the Taxpayers
Party, but he warmly endorsed the group and its hard-line
conservative platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an independent, and I'm enjoying it. Frankly, I feel
free,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told the group his presidential campaign hinged on his
wife's well-being and said he could drop out of the crowded race if
her health did not improve. His wife, Mary Jo, was admitted Tuesday
to the Catholic Medical Center with chest and arm pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a presidential campaign. At the moment, I haven't
made a decision,'' he said. ``Right now, I'm focused on my family
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator is expected to make a decision within the next
several weeks, according to a Smith spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers Party founder Howard Phillips said Smith had been
weighing his intentions for some time.
</P>
<P>
   According to Phillips, Smith was worried about the possibility
of Patrick J. Buchanan bolting the Republican Party to seek the
Reform Party nomination. ``He's worried that it might divert his
potential supporters to Buchanan's campaign,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips predicted the senator will drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless he is going to be a write-in candidate, the senator has
no choice but to drop out,'' Phillips said. ``As of this point,
there are few political parties that will embrace him.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Smith would have easily won the Taxpayers Party
nomination at the party's convention next month, and the senator
had promised to stay in the entire race once he accepted the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was considered to be an extremely long shot for the White
House, scoring in the low single digits in polls, even in his home
state of New Hampshire.

   Harvey Houtkin fervently believes that securities regulators are
out to get him. But he has no doubt that he will go down in history
as a man who made Wall Street a better place for the small
investor.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from his volatile relationship with regulators, Houtkin,
the self-proclaimed father of electronic stock trading, is right
that regulators are on his trail. But while he may well be
remembered for his role in changing the way Americans invest, it is
not at all clear that it has been for the good.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin (HOWT-kin) is chief executive of All-Tech Investment
Group, one of the nation's largest day-trading firms. And he says
that his company, which provides computerized stock market access
to individuals, enables anyone with a willingness to learn, and
$25,000 to open an account, to make a living trading stocks.
Houtkin, 50, says that All-Tech and companies like it are opening a
world of trading opportunities that had been closed to all but
professionals _ that they have democratized the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But especially since a day trader killed nine people in Atlanta
in July _ five of them at an All-Tech office _ Houtkin's operation
has come under intense regulatory scrutiny. And Tuesday, the family
of one shooting victim sued All-Tech, accusing it of negligence in
failing to supervise and recognize that Mark Barton, the man who
went on the killing spree, was a volatile person not suited to the
high-pressure business of stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin, who would not comment on the lawsuit, is now complying
with a subpoena from Georgia securities regulators relating to
Barton's trading patterns and account holdings. Regulators there
want to know if All-Tech encouraged its customers to go to friends
and family to raise money to trade with, making the traders subject
to regulation as investment advisers. Regulators will probably want
to question Houtkin himself.
</P>
<P>
   The trader has been in the hot seat before, many times. A close
look at his background shows a man driven by almost religious zeal
to storm the ramparts of an elitist Wall Street and the regulatory
machinery that he says protects it at the expense of the little
guy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   But Houtkin, a heavy-set, brown-haired man of medium height, is
no starry-eyed visionary; his history also reveals a canny mind,
ever ready to seize money-making opportunities, from bartering
penny stocks for goods and services to capitalizing on rules
changes that he himself helped bring about.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Ira Houtkin was born in Brooklyn and, until he was 23,
lived with his parents in a low-income housing project in the
Sheepshead Bay section. His father was a maker and fitter of
artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin attended public schools, including the Brooklyn
Technical High School, a school for gifted students, and then
enrolled at City College planning to study dentistry. But in 1967
he says he got an afternoon job as an assistant to a well-known
Wall Street speculator (whom he will not name). Fascinated by the
money he saw his boss making, Houtkin switched to business school.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After earning an M.B.A. from the City University of New York,
Houtkin went to Wall Street in 1973 to try his hand at trading. He
bounced from firm to firm. ``You don't earn where you learn on Wall
Street,'' he explained. ``You can't make a lot of money as a
trainee.'' His first job paid him $7,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a brutal bear market, Houtkin did well trading
shares of obscure and unknown companies, according to people who
worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spira, an investment banker at Chapman Spira &AMP; Carson,
worked with Houtkin in the 1970s. ``Harvey was a nice kid, very
bright,'' he said. ``He always had his own ideas. He was always
ahead of the pack. He always looks for the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spira recalled that during one period, Houtkin was buying stocks
that were very cheap, then bartering those shares for merchandise
from the companies. ``He bought stock in a film-developing
company,'' Spira said. ``He must have bought it for pennies. Then
he called them up and said, `I'll turn in X number of shares, and
in return you'll develop my film.' He had such a fertile mind.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the mid- to late 1970s, Houtkin worked briefly for Carl Icahn
and Asher Edelman, two men who later became famous as corporate
raiders. In 1979, he raised some money and started his own firm,
called Domestic Arbitrage Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, all went well, as the firm grew to six offices and
made markets in 500 NASDAQ stocks. But when the stock market
plunged in October 1987, the firm was left on the hook for the
losses of a customer who had traded with borrowed money. The losses
were so big that when Domestic Arbitrage faced the need to cover
them, it had to close its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin, most of whose assets were in the firm, said this was
when he realized how elitist Wall Street was. Though the regulators
eased the rules a bit and helped big firms avoid collapse after the
crash, he said, ``We were one of the firms allowed to flounder and
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   At a brokerage firm that his brother-in-law had set up after the
crash, Houtkin began trading NASDAQ Stocks, using a three-year-old
electronic trading system that was created by NASDAQ to insure that
customers could get their orders executed at the promised price.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, few used the system _ called the Small Order
Execution System, or SOES _ but Houtkin saw it as a way to profit
by using the split-second capacity of the system to buy stocks from
market makers who failed to update their quotes immediately as
stock prices changed.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin prospered. But he soon ran afoul of regulators, who had
designed it only for the benefit of individuals working through a
broker. Since Houtkin was benefiting as a professional, the
National Association of Securities Dealers barred him from using
the system for six months. Thus began a running feud with
regulators that continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found anything to close us down,'' Houtkin recalled.
``When the NASD wants to charge you with something, they can.
During that suspension was the incubation period for my total
contempt for these people.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   In 1990, state regulators in New Jersey denied an application by
his firm, then called Domestic Securities Inc., to register itself
for business there on the grounds that Houtkin was an undisclosed
principal of the firm and an unregistered broker in New Jersey.
Domestic Securities agreed not to reapply for three years and paid
$50,000 to reimburse the state for its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite his regulatory run-ins, Houtkin was making progress on
two fronts in the early 1990s. One was helping to bring the
misdeeds of big NASDAQ dealer firms, like their conspiracy to
inflate the costs of trading, to the attention of the Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Houtkin was building his firm _ which had been
now been renamed as All-Tech _ into an electronic trading house for
individual investors. He became an evangelist for electronic
trading, crisscrossing the country leading seminars on trading
techniques and writing two investing books. The first, ``The SOES
Bandits' Guide: Day Trading in the 21st Century,'' was
self-published, and a second was put out by McGraw-Hill.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors and regulators concluded their investigation of
NASDAQ in 1996, they found that major dealers had rigged prices for
years. One result was new rules for the way investors' orders to
buy and sell NASDAQ stocks were handled, a rule change that
encouraged entrepreneurs to set up electronic trading systems for
NASDAQ stocks. This change ushered in the day-trading phenomenon,
in which retirees, recent college graduates and others sit before
computer screens in brokerage offices buying and selling thousands
of shares, hoping to capitalize on the small price movements of
stocks during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin's firm was one of the first to capitalize on the change.
Now All-Tech has 25 offices around the country and about 3,000
day-trading customers. Just last week, Houtkin conducted seminars
in Portland, Ore., and Seattle for people interested in becoming
day traders. In Seattle, more than 100 people attended, said one
person who was there.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk about being an advocate for individual
investors, Houtkin makes a great deal of money. According to
financial statements filed with the SEC when All-Tech sought
unsuccessfully to become a public company, Houtkin had a salary of
$919,231 last year. His brother-in-law Mark Shefts, All-Tech's
president and the husband of Houtkin's sister, had a $943,363
salary. Each also got a $100,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The commissions that Houtkin charges his customers _ $25 a trade
_ are high compared with those at other large firms, which
typically charge $7 to $15 per 1,000-share trade.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin also makes money as owner of a private company that
conducts the day-trading courses that 85 percent of All-Tech's
customers take. These courses typically run for a month and cost
$5,000, but this fee can later be gradually applied toward
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe I'm wearing a white hat, that I'm doing
what's in the best interests of the general public,'' Houtkin said.
``Now, can I capitalize on that? Sure. If I could develop the cure
for cancer, shouldn't I have the right to make money on it?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that Houtkin may underplay the risks associated
with day trading, luring in people who cannot afford to lose the
money that regulators say they almost certainly will. Another
concern is that his and other day-trading firms allow loans among
customers, a practice that may encourage people to trade more often
than they should.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Massachusetts regulators brought a complaint against
All-Tech, saying that it had used deceptive marketing to promote
day trading and engaged in other violations of securities laws,
like commingling customer funds and forging customers' signatures.
Houtkin attributed the infractions to ``a rogue broker,'' but
All-Tech agreed to close its operation in Massachusetts and not
reopen shop there for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my people are outraged that certain regulators are
trying to put a bad face on day trading,'' Houtkin said. ``My
people choose to trade. They are adults. They are not doing
anything wrong. Why assume that trading actively is
irresponsible?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how many of his customers make money trading, Houtkin
demurs. Still, there is a breathless quality to the promotion of
day trading on his firm's Web site. To the question ``Do I have to
know anything about the stock market?'' the answer is: ``NO! As a
matter of fact, in many instances, the less you know means the less
baggage you have to discard when learning the new trading
techniques that are taught by All-Tech's affiliate, All-Tech
Training Group Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   And can money be lost day trading? The site's answer is this:
``If you are disciplined in following the techniques you will be
taught, losses can and should be kept to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey's a salesman, and a good one,'' said Marc Beauchamp,
spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators
Association in Washington. ``But a skeptical consumer would ask,
`If he's found the fountain of wealth, why is he sharing it with
tens of thousands of total strangers in hotel ballrooms across the
land?'''
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin says his business is booming and revenue will hit $30
million this year. The number is not verifiable, but in 1998, the
growth in All-Tech's business was slowing, according to its
financial statements. Commissions were up only 8 percent that year,
versus a 44 percent rise in 1997. And the average commission per
transaction had fallen from $24.32 to $23.52.
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling, the firm registered a $392,558 loss in its
own trading account, a source of profits at All-Tech in both 1996
and 1997. The loss may indicate just how hard it is even for a
professional to make money in day trading.
</P>
<P>
   But Houtkin remains day trading's most vocal cheerleader. ``I
think I'm making a contribution to the financial markets that's
worth more than making another million dollars,'' he said. ``The
day it becomes too difficult or it becomes enough, I'll leave
then.''

 &HT;    Francis Brunton isn't crazy
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A man who once offered Francis Brunton a job picking
peppers in Middle Georgia called the other day to ask what, if
anything, I had heard from the picturesque gentleman who used to
ride the streets of Atlanta on his bicycle, selling our newspaper.
At the time of his call I had no idea. Minnesota or Washington
state, I offered, some foreign place like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're as crazy as he is,'' the caller said thoughtfully. ``My
sister-in-law came from Tacoma and SHE is not the least bit
foreign. You admit Francis is crazy, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   I admit nothing, I said loftily. Francis is unusual, maybe a
touch eccentric, interesting, different. But crazy? What a loose
word to apply to a gentle, kind and friendly man! The world has
become so conformist there's hardly room for people who go their
way, behaving in an unconventional, unorthodox fashion. Once, not
too many years ago, somebody thought so little of Francis' behavior
in Minnesota or perhaps it was the way he was dressed (railroad
engineer's cap, jodphurs, baseball socks and shoulder-to-ankle
globes and shopping bags) they had him committed to some mental
institution. The people who ran the place must not have considered
Francis a lunatic because they let him call me and they listened
when I gave him a good recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them I'm not crazy,'' Francis implored. ``Tell them I
don't drink and I'm not dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   So I did and they listened and let him out. He subsequently
showed up at the Tacoma, Wash., library and was banned from the
stacks for taking along a hot plate and cooking among the books.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, the librarian liked him, recognized in him a true
book-lover and readmitted him to the sacred precincts of the
library as soon as he gave up the hot plate and the groceries. That
was almost the last thing I had heard from Francis until the middle
Georgia pepper-grower called.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hear from him do you want him to come back and work for
you again?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``NO!'' cried the grower. ``He didn't work when he was here. He
spent his time reading with a great big magnifying glass and
writing stuff nobody understood on the margins of books and papers
IN RED!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I asking?'' he laughed. ``I don't know. I just think
about the old fellow from time to time. He was nutty but I kind of
liked him. My wife and I were talking and I thought you might
know.''
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know that day I now know. I think. I had an
envelope in the morning mail with Francis' unmistakable red script
all over it. I opened it with interest and found a bulletin for the
Sunday morning, July 5 service at the Fond du Lac Community Church
in Duluth, Minn. The sermon topic that day was ``Peter's
Restoration.'' The choir sang ``When I Survey the Wondrous Cross''
and ``Blessed Assurance.'' There was no comment from Francis.
Disappointed, I put down the church program and picked up the
envelope.
</P>
<P>
   It was addressed to me and Betsy Meade, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.
(Miss Meade, formerly of our staff, is now in Egypt with her
husband, Donald Hastings Jr., and their two children.) In the
corner Francis directed us to please call somebody whose name and
telephone number I can't read. But for his old friends like the
pepper grower who still think of him and wonder, his address was
perfectly clear: ``I am at Gerald Eklunds Home 218 AC 626-1090,
13328 West End Street, Duluth, U.S.A., Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   He would be pleased to hear from old friends and admirers, I
know. A card or even a church program would be acceptable.

 &HT;    Celestine Sibley eulogies
 &HT;    By Bill Emerson and Jack Nelson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS: This eulogy was written by Bill Emerson, former Atlanta
bureau chief
</P>
<P>
   of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In this moment I speak for you and for Celestine's
friends everywhere. It is a great honor and a terrifying
responsibility. Friends were her wealth and friendship was her
genius and many hundreds of you are here now. I salute you. You
have given her your love and your prayers and these are things she
can actually take with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven Bound'' is my theme for this celebration. And, I know
that she would hoot at this. She would never admit that she had
ever thought about her life that way at all.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days ago she told me, ``Bill Emerson, get them to stop
this legend talk. You can tell them I'm not a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   It is modest and typical that Celestine would say that, but she
is a legend. There is going to have to be some celestial
intervention to edit out all of that legend talk. There is a
scarcity of legends in the journalism business today, and
Celestine's death is a serious loss.
</P>
<P>
   It is a piece of fortuity that Celestine's name is actually
Celestine. C-E-L-E-S-T-I-N-E is the mineral strontium sulfate. This
is the illuminating ingredient in fireworks, flares and tracer
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Poetically, these explosive threads are apparent in Celestine's
writing. And, incidentally, in her personality.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine was not a goody-two-shoes. You made a mistake if you
thought she was a passive, accepting sort of person. She had mirth
and instant wrath, but along with the fire came good taste and a
keen sense of justice. If you knew her or read her carefully you
discovered that she was mischievous, insatiably curious,
improvident and very bold. If you were seriously rude to Celestine
or one of her friends or family, she would tack your hide across
her next column.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine was a consummate craftsman and brilliantly able as a
newspaper journalist. She was an indecently fast writer; there was
no competition in the trade. As John Egerton said of her,
``Celestine could write a column while you were adjusting your
margins.''
</P>
<P>
   About vitally important matters, she took her time. When death
was at her door, Celestine would not be hurried and she was not
frightened. She planned a trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the doctor tries to stop me,'' she said, ``I'll push
him out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   A bulletin came in: Celestine is on her way to Florida. Her
nurse Carol driving, they were headed for Muv's house in Alford,
Fla. Celestine would sleep in Muv's bed and read a couple of books.
Sightings traced the voyagers to Celestine's grandfather's grave in
Holley and then back to Dog Island.
</P>
<P>
   Now Celestine is well into a more mysterious journey. She was a
star reporter, and I wish she could file us a few stories. It would
be a great scoop, even for Celestine.
</P>
<P>
   But Celestine didn't leave us empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   She left us more than 10,000 columns and 25 books. Her columns
created a vast confederacy of loyal readers and a horde of friends.
</P>
<P>
   She was the best columnist that the Atlanta newspapers ever had,
better than Bill Arp, Henry Grady, Ralph McGill, Lewis Grizzard or
any of the others. Of course her columns were about everything in
the world _ she did write idyllically of nature: buds opening,
fragrances wafting about, quitting-time light; but then she was
great on street people, love triangles and grisly murders. Murders
fascinated her.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine was one of the three or four most celebrated sob
sisters in the country. And she was reckoned by her peers to be a
superb trial reporter, one of the finest in the profession.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Sitton, who won a Pulitzer for his reporting and his
columns, says, ``I started out working for the INS in the Atlanta
office, and was covering the great Carpenter-Lockwood love triangle
trial. As I recall, Bob Carpenter, a Supreme Court judge, was
caught in a downtown hotel with Mrs. Lockwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lockwood chased the judge down Peachtree and cornered him in a
construction pit where Peacock Alley used to be. Lockwood shot the
judge several times. He didn't kill the judge, but it was quite a
trial. Sibley was covering for the Constitution,'' Claude said.
``Every morning I'd pick up the Constitution and be embarrassed.
Celestine had all the facts and her writing was poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Celestine and I have had our own near-misses and fateful
collisions. When you intersect with Celestine in a high-speed
situation, you're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine and I were covering the Lyndon Johnson whistle-stop
during the 1960 presidential campaign. I say ``covering it'' _ it
was a miracle that she was on the train at all. I had been aboard
since Culpepper, Va., and we had stopped in Atlanta briefly with
Lyndon making his usual corn pone speech from the caboose.
</P>
<P>
   We were pulling out, and I happened to be in a vestibule between
cars. I was looking down the track toward the station when I saw
this figure racing down the platform. It was Celestine, running
like a racehorse _ suitcase in one hand, portable typewriter in the
other. She and the train were in a dead heat. The only problem, she
was running down the wrong side of the train. The bottom halves of
the doors on her side of the train were all locked.
</P>
<P>
   I struggled with the catch. She was swinging her bag against the
door. I got the suitcase and the typewriter and then somehow I got
her over the top of the bottom door. We fell in a pile on the floor
of the vestibule with the grinding, clashing metal plates snapping
at our ears. Nobody hurt; a little disarray, maybe. Celestine was
just beginning another reportorial assignment. All of this made me
aware that Celestine was a very dangerous person to know.
</P>
<P>
   You understand: I can't imagine not having known her.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to let her go now, either. I have three heroes in
my sort of eclectic pantheon of heroes. There's Benjamin Franklin,
Emanuel Zacchini (the human cannonball who was fired 175 feel in
1940 for a world record) and Celestine Sibley. They will be
immensely congenial, with Zacchini to satisfy Celestine's vagrant
interests in exotics, and the great Franklin in his snuff-brown
suit, a man of many parts, for intellectual, scientific and social
conversation and profound appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   My memory of Celestine is inextinguishable. I have a terrible
time writing or speaking of her in the past tense. She will live on
in the affectionate regard of thousands of us, and we will remember
Celestine as long as we remember anything.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Celestine, and goodbye!!
</P>
<P>
   EDITORS: This eulogy was written by Jack Nelson, former Los
Angeles Times Washington bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine Sibley and I've been friends ever since I walked into
the Constitution newsroom 46 years ago. Even then she was the
Constitution's star reporter and on her way to becoming a living
legend. But she took time to make a young reporter from a small
town feel at home in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   I loved her and my kids adored her. We used to visit her at
Sweet Apple years ago. In those days, it was way back in the
country and a visit was always magical for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   I know of no other journalist who has personally touched so many
lives, both in her writing and in everyday living.
</P>
<P>
   For all the lovely columns about nature and human nature that
were her trademark, Celestine had a fierce sense of justice and
fairness. Some people thought of her as a sob sister. Gene
Patterson says, ``She was only a sob sister in the sense that I sob
at her going. Celestine wrote the real stuff. She not only cared
for the needful; she knew the genuine, and for these she fought.
She had a hard nose for the hurt. She was there when pain came and
she made it go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she was asked to name her favorite among the estimated
10,000 columns she had written. She chose one about members of the
Retreads _ men who've survived fighting in two or more wars _ and
how the Cyclorama rejected their request for reduced-rate tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that column, Celestine said, ``I rose up in a mighty
dudgeon and cited their war records and what they've done for their
country, and they're denied a piddlin' little ticket! So the mayor
said, `Give 'em tickets.' The commandant at Fort Meyers said, `Give
'em a luncheon, give 'em a parade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful,'' Celestine said. ``I went to the
parade and I was so moved, I cried like a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite column was the one years ago about a little girl and
her mother having breakfast in a crowded diner where everybody
looked grouchy and preoccupied. Celestine put you in that diner.
You smelled the bacon and eggs. You saw the customers' grim
expressions and how they weren't talking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and daughter sat down at the counter and the little
girl looked up and down. Then she looked at the cook and said,
``Doesn't anybody around here say the blessing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they do,'' said the cook in a loud voice, eyeing
everyone and bowing his head. Up and down the counter, customers
bowed their heads and joined in the blessing. Before long,
everybody was laughing and talking with each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was classic Celestine. As one of her readers wrote, she had
the innate ability to take things that most people would find
mundane and turn them into elaborate pieces of art ... almost like
taking cotton and spinning a gold dress.
</P>
<P>
   If Celestine had to leave us, I'm glad her final journey took
her to her beloved house on Dog Island in the Gulf of Mexico just
off Florida. That was the house that Jack built.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Strong was her second husband and theirs was a great love
story. I want to say a little about their relationship because
Celestine would have wanted me to. And her children would want me
to.
</P>
<P>
   Jack came into Celestine's life more than 30 years ago when she
was a widow with three children _ Mary, Susan and Jimmy. Jack
Strong was an Atlanta Constitution reporter in those days and had
read one of her columns ruminating about the transmission troubles
Jimmy was having with his car.
</P>
<P>
   Jack dropped by Sweet Apple and offered a helping hand. After he
fixed the car, Celestine invited him to dinner. As her daughter
Susan says, ``He never went home after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Celestine, Jack had a heart of gold. In fact, when he and I
were high school classmates in Biloxi, Miss., back in the 1940s,
and neither of us had much, Jack literally gave me the shirt off
his back. Actually, it was a sportcoat, my first one and I was
proud to wear it.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and Celestine were doing things for people throughout their
lives. Celestine once said she loved Jack after seeing him grab an
old lady's armload of groceries, help her get on a bus, and then
put the bus fare in the collection box. A lot of men might have
helped an old lady get on the bus, Celestine reckoned, but no one
else would have put the fare in the box, too, doing it all in one
sweet, smooth motion.
</P>
<P>
   One last note about Jack. A few years before he died in 1988, he
began building the vacation home on Dog Island. ``I'm gonna build
my baby a beach house on the island where nobody can bother her,''
he said. ``There's no bridge, and you have to get there by boat or
else fly.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jack died, the beach house didn't seem quite the same and
at one point, Celestine considered selling it. Her grandson John,
who had worked with Jack on building the house in the sweltering
Florida heat, balked at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sell the house,'' he said, pointing to dark spots on
the floor. ``That's Jack's sweat from building the house.'' John
knew what he was talking about _ he's the one who applied the
varnish over the sweat spots.
</P>
<P>
   I admired Celestine as a great journalist, a great friend and a
great human being. No one was better at standing by you in times of
trouble. When my son Steve ran afoul of the law a number of years
ago, Celestine didn't hesitate to come to court, to attest to his
character and beg the judge for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Steve died, she wrote a lovely column about him and
how he used to catch tadpoles in a creek near her Sweet Apple home.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody loved Celestine. As my old friend former Congressman
Jim Mackay said, Celestine ``has loved the people in all walks of
life in Georgia, and she has received that love back, and it's not
easy to be loved if you're a newspaper person.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll miss you Celestine. But you've left journalism and all of
us a great legacy of love.

 &HT;    Celestine Sibley homily
 &HT;    By the Rev. Patricia Templeton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS: The Rev. Patricia Templeton is associate rector of St.
Timothy's Episcopal Church, Signal Mountain, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Heavenly God, we thank you that by water and the Holy Spirit you
have bestowed upon this your servant the forgiveness of sin, and
have raised her to the new life of grace. Sustain her, O Lord, in
your Holy Spirit. Give her an inquiring and discerning heart, the
courage to will and to persevere, a spirit to know and to love you,
and the gift of joy and wonder in all your works. Amen.
</P>
<P>
   This prayer is not one that is normally heard at a funeral. It
is a baptismal prayer, one that sums up the characteristics that we
hope will distinguish the life of a baptized Christian _ a life
sustained by God and marked by forgiveness and grace, curiosity and
discernment, courage and perseverance, faith and love, and joy and
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot think of better words to describe the life of the
valiant woman we are here today to remember, to honor, and to
commend to the care of a loving God _ Celestine Sibley.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine was a woman of great faith, a woman whose life was
sustained by God. Hers was not an ostentatious, preachy, pious kind
of faith, but a lived one.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident in the well-worn Bible beside her favorite
reading chair, and the snippets of Scripture that frequently
appeared in her writings.
</P>
<P>
   And it was evident in her ability to see that all people are
created in God's image, her ability to respect the dignity of every
human being _ whether it be her homeless friends or the governor.
Celestine knew that the best way to show her love of God was to
love the people God has created.
</P>
<P>
   One of Celestine's favorite hymns was the one we sang at the
beginning of this service, ``Come, thou fount of every blessing.''
It strikes me as characteristic of her in its honest portrayal of a
life of faith _ that we are all prone to doubts and wanderings, but
even then we are sustained by the grace of a God who searches us
out and knows us.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I talked to Celestine, a few days before she died,
she said, ``I want you to know that I am going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   These were not the words of a woman clinging to a false hope
that some last-minute miracle was going to rid her of cancer.
Celestine was much too honest and smart for that.
</P>
<P>
   These were the words of a woman who knew, as St. Paul says, that
neither life, nor death, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor anything in
all creation can separate her from the love of God.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine's spirit was one that knew and loved God. Perhaps
because of that faith and love, she was blessed with the gifts
enumerated in the prayer for the newly baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly hers was an inquiring and discerning heart. From the
time she was a teenager she made her living by inquiring. She had
the wonderful ability to be truly interested in almost anything and
anyone. She could never understand how anyone could possibly be
bored when life was so interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine's inquiring heart was one of the things that made her
a great reporter. But what distinguished her was the combination of
her innate curiosity with the gift of discernment. She
instinctively knew what would make a good story, just as she could
instinctively discern the truth of a situation.
</P>
<P>
   But her gift of discernment really shone in her ability to see
the extraordinary in the ordinary events of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look sharp, you have to pay attention, to catch
small, quiet, often fleeting blessings and know them for what they
are,'' she wrote. Celestine, perhaps more than anyone I've known,
had the ability to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting under an apple tree, learning to ride a bicycle,
salvaging furniture from a dump, holding a baby, going to work each
day, talking with family and friends _ these ordinary moments
contain life's most extraordinary blessings, as she frequently
reminded us in her columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awareness of the nowness of happiness is not easy to come
by,'' she wrote. It was that awareness, that ability to discern, to
know happiness at the time it happened, that distinguished
Celestine.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that her life was a bed of roses. She was no
stranger to tragedy, illness, death and struggles to feed a family.
But through it all Celestine had the courage to will and to
persevere.
</P>
<P>
   Like the valiant woman in the book of Proverbs, Celestine rose
while it was still dark to begin her work. She did not eat the
bread of idleness.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call her perseverance stubbornness. She insisted on
driving until the doctor ordered her not to. She insisted on coming
to work long after others would have stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, she faced her death as she lived her life, with
courage and grace. Strength and dignity were indeed her clothing.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, among Celestine's greatest gifts was her joy and
wonder in all God's works.
</P>
<P>
   She delighted in the joys of nature _ the flowers in her garden,
walks in the woods, trips to the mountains and the beach.
</P>
<P>
   And most of all she found joy in the wonder of relationships _
with her children and grandchildren, with her beloved Muv and Jack.
And with her countless friends and readers. Celestine had the most
amazing capacity for friendship of anyone I've ever known.
</P>
<P>
   And so today, her children, grandchildren and friends rise up
and call her blessed, and say to her, ``Many women have done
excellently, but you surpass them all.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Celestine, may the angels lead you into paradise.
</P>
<P>
   May Muv and Jack and all the saints rise up to greet you and
bring you into the holy city Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   May the choirs of angels receive you.
</P>
<P>
   And may you rest in peace and joy eternally. Amen.

 &HT;    Goodbye, to a `lady of great gifts'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reluctant to release her but happy to celebrate her,
Atlanta on Wednesday said goodbye to Celestine Sibley.
</P>
<P>
   The people she touched during her many years as a newspaper
writer could never all fit under one roof, but several hundred of
them managed to cram into the memorial service at North Avenue
Presbyterian Church. It was there that The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reporter and columnist used to claim balcony
seats in the 1940s, so that she could get a clear view of the
stained-glass windows and explain their Bible stories to her
children.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely, dignified service, televised live on
WXIA-Channel 11, which Sibley undoubtedly would have called too big
a fuss. The crowd was a decidedly ``Celestine'' mix: media
personalities and just-folks sitting elbow to elbow, answering the
ministers in traditional call-and-response style. The only
adornment was an altarpiece of ordinary flowers _ bluebells,
daisies, black-eyed Susans _ so breezily jumbled together that the
writer herself might have scooped them from the north Fulton garden
her readers knew so well.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a reception after the service, many funny stories were
told to ward off tears, but that age-old strategy didn't always
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as though my roots have been chopped off, because I'm a
small-town girl like she was,'' said Kay Kephart, a Druid Hills
housewife and community volunteer, her voice cracking. ``Celestine
was my aunt, my neighbors, all my friends who used to sit around
talking on the front porch.''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring Sibley ``a lady of great gifts, honesty and heart,''
Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) invoked the more mischievous side of the
columnist. When Lewis was named a ``saint'' by Big Bethel AME
Church a few years ago, he joined Sibley _ the only white person
ever to receive that honor _ in the Big Bethel choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Celestine I wasn't much of a singer,'' Lewis recalled
with a smile, ``And she said, `Neither am I. Stand next to me, and
we'll both pretend.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the service's prelude, the achingly sad strains of Samuel
Barber's ``Adagio for Strings'' conveyed the sense of loss, the
silencing of the backyard bard who wrote of politicians and
vagabonds, philosophy and trivia, gardens and books, cabbages and
kings. Then, as if to nip grief in the bud, the audience rose and
boomed out an almost defiant rendition of ``Come, thou fount of
every blessing.'' The hymn was a favorite of Sibley, who died of
cancer Aug. 15 at age 85 and took a hand in planning the service
with family members in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Not by coincidence, probably, another of the selections was
Sibelius' ``Be Still, My Soul,'' which was played just a few months
ago at the memorial for actress Mary Nell Santacroce, another
Atlanta institution and an old friend of Sibley's.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps taking a cue from Sibley's 10,000 columns, eulogists
Bill Emerson, former Atlanta bureau chief for Newsweek, and Jack
Nelson, former Constitution reporter and retired Washington bureau
chief of The Los Angeles Times, managed to pack deep affection and
raucous humor into brief speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ```Heaven Bound' is the theme of this celebration, and she will
hoot at that,'' Emerson declared. ``Just 10 days ago she told me,
`Get them to stop this legend talk _ tell them I'm not a legend!'
Well, there's going to have to be some celestial intervention to
edit out all the legend talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson painted a woman far tougher and more determined than her
readers might have guessed. Once he heard a commotion outside his
departing train and looked out to see the long-legged Sibley,
``running like a maniac'' alongside, banging her typewriter on the
locked doors until Emerson managed to haul her aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celestine was not a goody two shoes,'' Emerson said. ``If you
were seriously rude to Celestine or one of her friends or family,
she would tack your hide across her next column. ... She wrote
about buds opening, fragrances wafting, love triangles, grisly
murders _ she loved murders.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sibley planned a farewell trip to her beach house on Dog
Island, Fla., she told Emerson, ```If that doctor tries to stop me
I'll push him out the window.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said of Sibley, ``No one was better at standing beside
you in time of trouble.'' He quoted former Georgia congressman Jim
Mackay as saying, ``She loved people in all walks of life in
Georgia, and she has received that love back _ and it's not easy to
be loved if you're a newspaper person.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the distinguished guests were former Gov. Samuel Ernest
Vandiver and his wife, Sybil.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's many and varied friends in attendance included Ruth and
Ruby Crawford, twins with whom she often lunched downtown in the
1940s, who came to the service in matching peach floral outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from a small town, we had so many things in common with
her,'' said Ruby. ``One thing we always knew _ on the first freeze
of the fall we would be out in our gown-tails at midnight bringing
in the potted plants. We took comfort in knowing that Celestine was
out in her gown-tail, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There was perfect rightness in the presence of the choir from
Big Bethel, whose aformentioned ``Heaven Bound'' morality play
Sibley attended nearly every year. The choir sang ``Steal Away,'' a
spiritual near to the columnist's heart. She once wrote that when
she tried to sing it with the choir, ``I couldn't get a word out _
I cried like a fool.'' The rendition at the service had the same
effect on many of her old friends. Singing with a hushed power,
like a wave that builds and builds but never breaks, the choir
concluded the song with the line, ``I ain't old got long to stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many testified that the words and memory of Sibley will stay
long indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll remember her,'' Emerson declared, ``as long as we
remember anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bethel's postlude was that old rouser, ``When the Saints Go
Marching In.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to pat her feet to that song,'' said choir member
Gregory Coleman. ``Ooooooh, she loved it.''

STARR PLANNING TO RESIGN AS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, ASSOCIATES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is quitting
as early as October to resume his legal practice after a five-year
investigation into President Clinton's personal and business
affairs that led to last summer's impeachment battle, Starr's
associates said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the associates, Starr has decided that he will
remain in office long enough to put his personal stamp on a final
report summarizing the findings of his inquiries _ a report looming
as a potential embarrassment to Hillary Rodham Clinton as she moves
closer to entering the race for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Starr has communicated his plans to the
three-member panel of federal appellate judges that presides over
independent counsel matters, asking that one of his top lieutenants
take over the closing phase of the long inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In an ostensibly unrelated ruling, the same three-judge panel
divided sharply on Wednesday, declaring there was no basis for it
to unilaterally terminate Starr's investigation. The ruling was
apparently unconnected to Starr's private assurances to the judges
that he would soon leave. The independent counsel law requires the
panel to decide every year whether to terminate an investigation.
The law has expired, but it still governs Starr's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the opinion exposed harsh differences in how the
judges view Starr's investigation. The two judges appointed by
Republican presidents, David J. Sentelle and Peter T. Fay, lauded
Starr, saying his investigation has been ``unusually productive,''
resulting in not only the impeachment of a president but 24
indictments and 16 convictions. They said that under the law they
were prohibited from delving into the independent counsel's
operation and thus they could not order it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's lone Democratic-appointed judge, Richard D. Cudahy,
said it was useless and wasteful for the investigation to go on.
Cudahy wrote that after President Clinton's acquittal by the
Senate, the investigation had reached ``a natural and logical point
for termination since is is not clear how additional measures
against the principal subject of the investigation could be
pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy also complained that he was rebuffed in his efforts to
have the court formally ask Starr how much is left to investigate.
He said that the court's only knowledge of how the investigation
was progressing or whether it was nearing its end came from
``informal contacts'' between Sentelle, the panel's chief, and
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a bookish legal scholar who seemed more at home with
abstract constitutional theories than the bare-knuckled world of
criminal prosecutions, would leave with his once-pristine
reputation for probity now tarnished after years of attacks by
Clinton's defenders _ even as Starr unearthed an Oval Office sex
scandal that led to Clinton's impeachment in the House and his
subsequent trial and acquittal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will also be remembered as the man largely responsible for
the demise of the independent counsel statute, enacted after
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has told associates he expects to return to his job as a
partner at the Washington office of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where he
specialized in the firm's appellate practice. But associates said
he has not reached a specific agreement with Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, and
representatives of the firm did not return phone calls Wednesday on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's communication to the three-judge panel that he was
planning to depart was first reported by ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Starr's office said that there had been substantial
progress in writing the final report. Starr is required to file a
report but has leeway in explaining his actions in regard to people
who were investigated but not indicted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Starr associates said, there was a vigorous
discussion as to how he would deal with questions involving Mrs.
Clinton, for whom Starr's office once drafted an indictment that
was never presented to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In June, one associate of Starr said the final report could be
``blistering'' in its description of Mrs. Clinton's behavior, even
though it would only be a recitation of events and unresolved
issues without any explicitly stated judgments. Starr associates
said that the report would inevitably convey a critical view
because it would raise unanswered questions about Mrs. Clinton's
behavior in some land transactions in Arkansas and her testimony
under oath about her actions as a lawyer in those deals.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Edward Page, Starr's spokesman, said that, ``our
final report was never meant to be blistering. We won't
characterize.''
</P>
<P>
   Page said that the final report will include just the facts and
the evidence and ``there won't be accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his aides also have discussed how the termination of
the independent counsel statute would affect his inquiry and
whether Starr could turn over all or part of the remaining
investigative matters to career prosecutors in the Justice
Department. Those discussions were exploratory and have not
resulted in any agreement, law enforcement officials said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has not said publicly what avenues of inquiry remain open.
But lawyers involved in the cases said recently that they center on
whether Mrs. Clinton was truthful in denying a role in firing of
employees at the White House travel office, and the conduct of
Nathan Landow, a Democratic fund-raiser from Maryland, in Starr's
investigation of accusations that Clinton had groped a White House
volunteer, Kathleen Willey, in the Oval Office.

 &HT;    Mississippi school bars Jewish star
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Officials at a Mississippi high school have forbidden
a Jewish student to wear a Star of David necklace because they say
it looks like a gang symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Ryan Green plan to file a lawsuit Friday in
federal court against school officials, charging that their son was
denied his constitutional right to religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who was given the necklace over the summer by a relative,
wore it to school on the first day of class last week, according to
officials. A teacher saw it and told him to tuck it into his shirt
or leave it at home.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents heard about the ban and protested, the Harrison
County school board held a hearing Monday night. The board voted
unanimously to uphold the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrison County sheriff's office said the six-point star,
known around the world as a symbol of the Jewish faith, also is a
symbol used by the Black Gangster Disciples along the Mississippi
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with religion,'' said Frank Baskett, a
spokesman for the sheriff's office. ``This is a safety issue. If
the black gangsters stopped using a six-point star and started
using a crucifix, I would be back in school tomorrow advising them
to ban crosses from school property.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harrison County schools prohibit students from wearing
anything that can be construed as a gang symbol. Baskett said if
school officials allow Green to wear his necklace, then all of the
gang members will ``become Jewish and claim religious sanctuary''
to wear them as well.
</P>
<P>
   David Ingebretsen, head of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Mississippi, said fear of gangs is no excuse for taking away
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools should be able to find a way to protect religious
expression and still have a safe environment,'' said Ingebretsen,
who is helping the Greens with their case. The Greens could not be
reached for comment.

SMITH MAY DROP PLANS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENCY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who ditched the
Republican Party last month to join the US Taxpayers Party,
announced Wednesday he is leaving his new party and is considering
shelving his long-shot pursuit of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is in his second term, left the Republican Party on
July 13, saying the group had strayed from its core conservative
beliefs. He announced last week he would seek the presidential
nomination of the Taxpayers Party, but Wednesday, he told business
leaders at a political breakfast in Bedford, N.H., he had changed
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore allegiance to the Constitution, not to any political
party,'' Smith said, adding he will remain an Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his experience with the Republican Party and the
writings of George Washington had swayed him from partisan
politics. He did not elaborate on his split with the Taxpayers
Party, but he warmly endorsed the group and its hard-line
conservative platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an independent, and I'm enjoying it. Frankly, I feel
free,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told the group his presidential campaign hinged on his
wife's well-being and said he could drop out of the crowded race if
her health did not improve. His wife, Mary Jo, was admitted Tuesday
to the Catholic Medical Center with chest and arm pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a presidential campaign. At the moment, I haven't
made a decision,'' he said. ``Right now, I'm focused on my family
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator is expected to make a decision within the next
several weeks, according to a Smith spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers Party founder Howard Phillips said Smith had been
weighing his intentions for some time.
</P>
<P>
   According to Phillips, Smith was worried about the possibility
of Patrick J. Buchanan bolting the Republican Party to seek the
Reform Party nomination. ``He's worried that it might divert his
potential supporters to Buchanan's campaign,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips predicted the senator will drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless he is going to be a write-in candidate, the senator has
no choice but to drop out,'' Phillips said. ``As of this point,
there are few political parties that will embrace him.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Smith would have easily won the Taxpayers Party
nomination at the party's convention next month, and the senator
had promised to stay in the entire race once he accepted the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was considered to be an extremely long shot for the White
House, scoring in the low single digits in polls, even in his home
state of New Hampshire.

DOW STUMBLES, DROPPING 1.3 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices slumped Wednesday as investors took
profits from the recent rally, the dollar weakened and
interest-rate jitters continued.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rose, causing the yield on the bellwether 30-year
Treasury to flirt with a level just under 6 percent, a key
threshold in market psychology.
</P>
<P>
   After approaching its mid-July peak on Tuesday, the Dow Jones
industrial average gave ground early Wednesday, steadied, then
stumbled again in the final 30 minutes to finish with a loss of
125.70 points, or 1.13 percent. IBM was a prominent late casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pullback in the dollar, certainly against the yen, has
weakened stocks,'' said Elaine H. Yager, a senior analyst at Herzog
Heine Geduld.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said some investors were cashing in profits ahead
of the expiration of options contracts on Friday and the Federal
Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday, which is widely expected to
result in a quarter-point rise in the overnight lending rate among
banks.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly strong earnings report by Dell Computer and a
recommendation of eight Internet stocks by Merrill Lynch's
influential analyst, Henry Blodget, helped keep the Nasdaq average
in positive territory most of the day before it, too, slipped and
ended down 13.49 points, or 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the bond market were buoyed by official purchases
and continued the previous day's strong rally, pushing the 30-year
issue during the day to just under 6 percent, a quarter percentage
point less than a week ago, before finishing right at 6 percent.
The rate on the 10-year bond, a benchmark for mortgages, eased a
bit further, to 5.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about a string of interest rate increases appear to be
subsiding on the comforting news this week that inflation remains
in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market continues to trade without a lot of
conviction,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief strategist at Legg
Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ``But seeing the long bond rally is
probably the best thing.'' Trading volume remained subdued.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.32 points, to
1,332.84, or 0.8 percent, midway between the other major indexes.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the biggest factor in the decline of blue-chip Dow
index, skidding 4|, to 123~, after changing hands as high as 129|.
</P>
<P>
   But 20 of the other 29 stocks in the index also fell, with
American Express losing 3, to 137\, Johnson &AMP; Johnson 2[, to 96
3/16, and Minnesota Mining 2], to 95 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget, the Merrill Lynch analyst, recommended eight Internet
stocks he saw as benefiting from this year's holiday shopping
season, perhaps tripling revenue from online sales and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the shares, which ``offer a sound way to play the
fundamental strength and renewed investor enthusiasm'' expected in
coming months, would surge 50 percent to 100 percent by yearend.
</P>
<P>
   All his picks rose. Amazon.com jumped 3~, to 113[, America
Online 1 11/16, to 99 3/16, and Yahoo 6 3/16, to 145 1/16. His
other picks were Etoys, Excite at Home, Lycos, Inktomi and
Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser factor in Wednesday's session was a report that
Fidelity Investments, the biggest mutual fund group, sold a net
$4.6 billion of technology stocks during the second quarter,
shrinking positions in America Online, as well as in Texas
Instruments, Oracle and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, which reported a bigger-than-expected earnings
gain after Tuesday's close, gained 3 7/16, to 44 9/16, adding about
as much to the S&AMP;P 500 performance as IBM subtracted. Only 112
index components rose, compared with 370 that fell.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc. dropped 1 13/16, to 17 3/16, after warning of lower
profits this year; Talbots, another retailer, climbed 1 15/16, to
32 9/16, on sharply higher quarterly earnings. Reader's Digest rose
1], to 33, after announcing tripled earnings that beat forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Hannaford Bros. soared 9 1/16, to 72}, on a deal to be acquired
by Food Lion, which slumped 2 11/32, to 8 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,799 issues fell compared with
1,195 that rose; 65 stocks made 52-week lows, while 51 reached new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Volume of 677 million was slightly below Tuesday's 690 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, stocks advanced about 0.5 percent in London but fell
that much in Frankfurt. Sao Paulo's Bovespa and Mexico City's Bolsa
skidded 2.37 percent and 2.12 percent, respectively, while Tokyo
showed little change.

 2 NONGRADUATES LEAVE $128 MILLION TO DePAUW  
 (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DePauw University said Wednesday that it had received $128
million in stocks, one of the largest gifts bestowed on an American
university, from the estate of two former students who never
graduated from DePauw.
</P>
<P>
   The donors, Philip Holton and Ruth Clark, met at DePauw in 1925
as members of the class of 1929, but left two years later. Holton
transferred to the University of Illinois because it had an
engineering program that DePauw lacked, and Miss Clark dropped out
to be with him.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1930 and, according to DePauw president
Robert Bottoms, always felt a strong connection to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Holton went on to become president and chief executive of Inland
Container Corp., a corrugated box company in Indianapolis, in 1963,
before becoming its vice chairman in 1970. He retired in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   It was around this time that Holton first began writing an
annual letter to the university, expressing a desire to create
scholarships for Midwestern students with a small trust that he
intended to leave to DePauw after he and his wife had died, Bottoms
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's only child, Jane, died in 1974 at the age of 38.
She had no children.
</P>
<P>
   DePauw, a liberal arts institution in Greencastle, in
west-central Indiana, has an enrollment of 2,334. Although the gift
ranks among the 10 largest to an American university, it is dwarfed
by the gift believed to lead that list: $300 million in stock from
the Ingram Charitable Fund to Vanderbilt University last year.
</P>
<P>
   When Bottoms became president of DePauw in 1986, he said Holton
estimated the value of the trust at about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   After Holton died in 1995, a month shy of his 88th birthday, the
trust reverted to his wife. When she died in 1997, at 90, the
university was told that the trust was worth about $18 million,
Bottoms said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, though, Bottoms said he was stunned to learn that
DePauw had been named as the beneficiary of half of the Holtons'
estate, much of it invested in Time-Warner stock that Holton had
first received when his company was bought by Time Inc. in 1978,
before being spun off in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Mrs. Holton's death, the full estate was valued
at $125 million, Bottoms said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the two years it has taken to transfer half of the estate
to DePauw, the value of Time-Warner stock has climbed, doubling the
estate's value.
</P>
<P>
   The university's share, Bottoms said, was ultimately $128
million _ enough to pay for 75 scholarships a year.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships are to be awarded on the basis of need, as well
as merit, to students from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin
and Ohio, as stipulated by Holton in long conversations with
Bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   While elated by the couple's generosity, Bottoms said it pained
him that ``you can't even say thanks.''

JURY AWARDS WOMEN DAMAGES IN SUIT AGAINST POSTAL SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston mail clerk has been awarded nearly $890,000
in damages, lost wages and interest, after a jury found the U.S.
Postal Service had retaliated against her for filing discrimination
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Another clerk involved in the same case was awarded $10,000 in
damages and $3,000 in back pay, plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the damages was $500,000 less than a jury had
awarded Diana Lyn Gamboa in February after finding she and fellow
clerk Linda D. Slusser were victims of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   In an amended judgment filed Tuesday, U.S. District Judge
Vanessa Gilmore said federal law sets a $300,000 cap on total
damages that can be awarded to parties in a single lawsuit filed
against a large employer.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa and Slusser were clerks at the North Houston Mail
Processing Center when they filed suit in 1994. They claimed that
they and hundreds of employees in the Postal Service's Houston
District were subjected to retaliation for filing complaints with
the service's equal employment opportunity office.
</P>
<P>
   The women said they were targeted for harassment because they
filed EEO complaints _ on their own and in behalf of other
employees _ about the poor working environment at the Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa, an official with the American Postal Workers Union,
filed dozens of complaints on behalf of union members and
represented 50 employees in labor disputes. Slusser also filed EEO
complaints for herself and for co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The women said the retaliation ranged from being denied bathroom
breaks to suspension without pay to termination.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa said Postal Service officials monitored her EEO
activities in a computer database shared by management, labor
relations and the union. She said she was harassed almost
continually.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, confidential information about medical treatment
she was undergoing was made available to unauthorized personnel at
the Postal Service, court documents indicate.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1992 Gamboa filed a complaint alleging that her job
was eliminated because of her EEO activity. Court documents state
that an administrative judge with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission held a hearing and recommended a finding of
discrimination based upon retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Six months before the lawsuit was filed, Slusser said she saw
supervisors harassing Gamboa. When Gamboa filed an EEO complaint
listing Slusser as a witness, the women were suspended for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa was fired June 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors found that the service had intentionally retaliated
against both women for filing the discrimination complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Gamboa $800,000 in damages, but Gilmore reduced
it to $300,000, the legal cap.
</P>
<P>
   She was also awarded $264,604 in lost wages, plus interest, from
the date she was fired until the date of the judgment, and another
$322,955 plus interest in pay that she would have earned had she
continued in her post until 2003, the year she turns 55.
</P>
<P>
   Slusser, who is still employed by the Postal Service, was
awarded $10,000 in damages and $3,000 in back pay, plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore also ordered the Postal Service to pay the women's
attorney's fees _ $374,734.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Scherstrom, spokesman for the Postal Service, declined
comment, saying the service is considering an appeal.

HOT SPOTS LOSE VACATION CROWDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., S.C., Fla., Ga., Colo., Nev., Ohio, Pa. Texas, Va.,
Alaska , Calif., N.J., Del., Wash., Mich.)   By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody talks about the weather, but this summer lots of
vacationers have been doing something about it _ namely, avoiding
or minimizing the effects of a heat wave that has had much of the
nation sweltering through one of the hottest summers in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures soaring to triple digits, crowds have been
bigger than ever at beaches, water parks, mountain resorts and
air-conditioned malls, while attendance has lagged at amusement
parks, golf courses and shops in the torrid zones. If not locked
into nonrefundable airline tickets or hotel reservations, many
American vacationers have been doing their best to escape the heat
and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned to take my vacation in the Southeast,'' said Steve
Loucks, a recent transplant to Minneapolis from Virginia. ``But
after I read about the heat and humidity back there I decided go to
a cool spot.'' On Sept. 3, Loucks will fly to Alaska for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Moluf of Naperville, Ill., a bartender, was looking for a
place where he and a dozen relatives could get together, but
because of the heat they did not even consider the East Coast.
Instead, they spent last week at Winter Park, a Colorado ski resort
whose Web site advertises ``Beat the Heat Getaways'' from dozens of
U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That promotion has done wonders, because we've had people come
from Florida, Georgia, Texas and all over, just to cool off,'' said
Joan Christensen, a Winter Park spokeswoman. But people fleeing the
sun have not only been staying at resorts, they have been dropping
in on friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year my husband and I didn't have any summer visitors,''
Ms. Christensen said, ``but this year we've had friends come visit
for a total of about 30 nights, mostly friends from states where
it's boiling hot.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yellowstone National Park, where the weather this summer has
been warm but not punishing, attendance rose 5.7 percent in June
over the same period last year and rose 0.4 percent last month. ``A
lot of the visitors are probably people who were escaping the heat
back East,'' said Marsha Karle, a park spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The twin attractions of gambling in an air-conditioned city are
paying off big for Las Vegas, Nev., which earmarked $5 million to
attract visitors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors rose 13.3 percent in June over the same
month last year, the biggest monthly increase in almost five years.
As a bonus, for those who ventured outside, the city set a record
for the most July days _ 14 _ in which the maximum temperature did
not hit at least 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But record temperatures in much of the nation this summer have
been highs, not lows.
</P>
<P>
   In Myrtle Beach, S.C., one of the many hot states, crowds this
summer have flocked to the beach and to stands selling drinks and
ice cream, but not to the Pavillion Amusement Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat has hurt,'' said Glenn West, director of marketing
for the Pavillion. ``When the heat index gets above 100, people
stay away. And we had 10 days in a row during July and August where
the heat index has been over 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat and humidity have played havoc with attendance at other
amusement parks, cutting into concession sales as children and
parents have returned to the air-conditioned comfort of home or
hotel rather than wilt outdoors. But attendance has held up at
water parks in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Big crowds have been reported at Soak City, part of the Cedar
Point amusement park and resort in Sandusky, Ohio; Schlitterbahn
Water Park Resort in New Braunfels, Texas.; Wildwater Kingdom in
Allentown, Pa., and Hurricane Harbor in Los Angeles, whose pool has
constant 2-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   Not so on the golf course. From the Carolinas to Michigan,
soaring temperatures have kept some of the most dedicated golfers
off the links in mid-afternoon and early evening despite efforts to
lure them with lower fees. ``In this part of the country it's
unusual to have temperatures in the 80s at night, but we had them
in July,'' said Brett Marshall, executive director of the Golf
Association of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Furnace Creek Golf Course in California's Death Valley
National Park, the hottest spot in North America, prohibits play
from noon to 4 p.m. As if to atone for the inconvenience, it offers
a $25 ``extreme golf six-pack'' consisting of green fees, cart,
clubs, balls, tees and a gallon jug of water.
</P>
<P>
   This month, though, Death Valley has had a number of days when
the daily high temperature has been below 110 degrees _ in other
words, almost balmy, compared with the 129 degrees recorded last
July (5 degress less than the record temperature set in 1913).
Those milder temperatures might account for the apparent increase
in American travelers to Death Valley this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so bad because it's not humid,'' said Maria Malone, a
teacher in Minneapolis who spent Monday night at Death Valley with
her husband, George, a teacher in St. Paul. Neither of them minded
the 115-degree temperature on a picnic that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to Death Valley,'' Malone said, ``because it's a
beautiful nature area and we like to hike and take photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, including beach resorts, the combined heat and
humidity probably made it feel like, or worse than, Death Valley.
For six weeks in a row through July, crowds at the beaches in Ocean
City, N.J., exceeded 100,000 each Saturday and each Sunday. Farther
down the coast, in Delaware, crowds have flocked to Rehoboth Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ice cream sales are down compared with last year,'' said
Ed Fornwalt, owner of the Royal Treat Breakfast and Ice Cream
Parlor in Rehoboth. ``When you get hot sun and burning sand, people
don't want to walk to buy ice cream or much else. They want the
beach or an air-conditioned mall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about three weeks when the tremendous heat cut down
on foot traffic and that affected business downtown, because people
were hugging the water line,'' said Carol Everhart, executive
director of the Rehoboth Beach Chamber of Commerce. ``But we've had
one perfect beach day after another.''
</P>
<P>
   People from Houston, San Antonio and other hot spots in Texas
have been flocking this summer to Corpus Christi, whose site on the
Gulf of Mexico has helped moderate summer temperatures that
frequently exceed 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In some places, however, it is the absence of heat that has
caused concern. At Mount Ranier National Park near Ashford, Wash. _
a park that draws about 2.4 million visitors a year, and which
early this month attracted Vice President Al Gore and Albert Gore
III, his 16-year-old son _ attendance is down from last year,
possibly way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had horrible weather in the Northwest this year, cool
and rainy instead of warm and dry,'' said Bob Dopiriak, the fee
coordinator at Mount Ranier. ``When you can see the mountain from
Seattle, it's a 14,000-foot billboard, and the visitors come,'' he
said. ``But when you can't see it through the clouds and rain, a
lot of them don't bother.''

   Armstrong has signed new endorsement deals, some going through
the year 2004, with a total value of $6 million since his victory
ride on the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is somewhat astounded by what's happening now,'' said
Armstrong's agent, Bill Stapleton, president of Capital Sports
Ventures in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are pretty staggering, and he's really
flattered.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his new endorsement deals, he has signed a
contract extension with his team, U.S. Postal, which will pay him
$2 million in 2000, or five times his base salary in 1999.
Combining salary and endorsements, Armstrong should make $5 million
just in 2000, or about $100,000 more than Emmitt Smith did playing
running back for the Dallas Cowboys last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has pledged to donate at least $250,000 to his Lance
Armstrong Foundation from his 2000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, people throughout the United States will be
able to see Armstrong in television commercials for Bridge
Information Systems, the largest provider of financial
</P>
<P>
   news and information in North America, American General
Insurance, and the U.S. Postal Service. In the week after his
victory, he was the subject of a ``Just Do It'' commercial by Nike
Inc., one of his apparel and equipment sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge Information Systems also has purchased a large video
screen in New York's Time Square to play its Armstrong commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance Armstrong's energy, intelligence, and ability to compete
successfully in every part of the world exemplify the qualities we
believe characterize Bridge and the Bridge family of companies,''
said Tom Wendel, Bridge chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Also after his win, Armstrong agreed to a $500,000 movie deal
from Bud Greenspan and his production company and a $400,000 book
contract from Penguin Putnam Inc. The book, which will detail
Armstrong's battle with cancer and triumphant win in France, is due
in stores next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton would not reveal specifics of contracts, but said that
companies are paying a minimum of $500,000 annually to have
exclusive rights to Armstrong and at least $250,000 to use the
cyclist's name or image in their commercial pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also has been a popular motivational speaker since he
was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer in October 1996.
Before the Tour de France, he made $30,000 per speech. Stapleton
said companies now are offering between $75,000 to $100,000 per
speech.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one corporate executive who has expressed
disappointment that he didn't jump sooner on the Armstrong
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have had him for $50,000 before the race,'' said
American Isuzu general manager Bob Reilly, whose company had a
corporate tie-in with the Tour de France. ``Now he's, what, $5
million?''

 &HT;    Not all's well in Primera
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Primera Division season starts Sunday, and
Barcelona and Real Madrid, the overpowering giants of the Spanish
game, face some intriguing challenges. The two clubs, who together
have won 14 of the last 15 league championships, know too well that
possessing vast riches and the ability to buy the best players in
the world won't necessarily result in satisfaction. Or happy camps.
</P>
<P>
   For Barcelona, which won by a comfortable 11 points over Real
Madrid a year ago, reversing a recent string of poor European play
is essential. For the most part, Barca has an intact group of
regulars that, arguably, forms the best team in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo, the subject of $50 million Manchester United transfer
rumors, probably will be the world player of the year for 1999. He
had 19 goals while Luis Enrique added 18, and Catalan hero ``Pep''
Guardiola returned from injury late in the season to inspire the
title drive. Forward Dani comes from Mallorca to give depth for the
Champions League.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch manager Louis van Gaal has eight countrymen on his roster,
including twins Ronald and Frank de Boer, striker Patrick Kluivert
and goalie Ruud Hesp. But unlike the beloved Johan Cruyff in the
'70s and '80s, van Gaal hasn't ingratiated himself to Barca fans,
who chronically carp about too many foreigners. Falling short of
expectations could make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid, European champions in 1998, fell apart last season,
mired in a coaching change and infighting that is far from being
resolved. Ex-Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka got his wish to play in
Spain _ for a $36.6 million transfer price, the second-highest on
record _ but fitting him in could be tricky for manager John
Toshack, the subject of firing speculation. The club spent $80
million over the summer, so demands are notoriously high.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concerns are on defense, where Michel Salgado (Celta
Vigo) and Julio Cesar (Valladolid) are the main additions. Up
front, Anelka must mesh with the electrifying Raul, who led Spain
with 25 goals, and Fernando Morientes, with 19.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia has a shot at its first league title since 1971 because
Claudio Lopez, second in the Primera with 21 goals, decided not to
transfer. He and Adrian Ilie form a powerful scoring duo, and the
club has improved the midfield by getting Oscar Garcia from Barca.
Former Mallorca boss Hector Cuper already has made a splash, as
Valencia upset Barca last week in the Spanish Super Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Cuper's old club, which had a best-ever third-place finish and
was runner-up in the European Cup Winners' Cup, will be hard
pressed to repeat because of heavy player losses. Celta Vigo was
fifth and could push the leaders with midfielder Alexander Mostovoi
and new strikers Benni McCarthy and Ivan Kaviedes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The darkhorses: Athletic Bilbao finished eighth despite its
Basque-only policy and wants to hold on tight to Ismael Urzaiz, who
had 16 goals.... Deportivo La Coruna faded down the stretch, while
Espanyol qualified for the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
   _ Looking to do better: If Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink continues
where he left off at Leeds, Atletico Madrid has hope to return to
the elite.... Denilson would like to forget last season at Real
Betis, which went through four coaches, but the prospects aren't
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just glad to be here: Real Zaragoza, Real Sociedad and
Valladolid can't challenge the elite. Promoted Malaga and Sevilla
would love to reach the safety of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relegation zone: Rayo Vallecano and U.S. goalkeeper Kasey
Keller will struggle mightily to stay up, as will fellow newcomer
Numancia. Alaves, Racing Santander and Oviedo might be endangered
again.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV talk: After one season on ESPN2, the Primera Division will
be available only on pay-per-view. The new ESPN Extra will show
live games starting Sept. 11, supplanting Monday replays on ESPN2,
which will show one last freebie on Aug. 30 at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Yugo-Croatia a scoreless draw
</P>
<P>
   The tension before the game was high in anticipation of the
first meeting, and it soared again after a light failure early in
the second half of Wednesday's Euro 2000 qualifying match between
Yugoslavia and Croatia in Belgrade. After 10-minute delay, the
rivals battled to a 0-0 draw. Several fans shouted anti-government
slogans in the darkness, including some calling for the resignation
of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. The game had been
postponed from March because of NATO bombing raids on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   England: Gullit to get axe?
</P>
<P>
   Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit vowed to persevere despite rumors
of his dismissal. The Magpies fell to 0-3-0 Sunday in a humiliating
4-2 loss at Southampton.... Arsenal's injury situation took another
hit Monday when midfielder Emmanuel Petit was lost for 2-6 weeks
with a knee injury.... Manchester United captain Roy Keane will
announce his future plans at the end of the season, when his
contract expires. He is locked in a salary dispute with club
management, which now might be precluded from putting him on the
transfer list ...Robbie Keane (no relation), a 19-year-old scoring
sensation at Wolves of the First Division, is on his way to
Coventry City for $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Top teams stumble
</P>
<P>
   An injury-time goal by Giovanne Elber earned defending champion
Bayern Munich a 2-2 draw with Hamburg in the Bundesliga opener
Saturday, while Bayer Leverkusen was held to a 0-0 draw with
Duisburg, as some of the German favorites started slowly. Borussia
Dortmund fell 1-0 to Kaiserslautern, as Olaf Marschall scored the
lone goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Puebla rises again
</P>
<P>
   After being relegated from the Mexican first division, Puebla
came up with a novel _ and controversial _ way of staying up. Club
officials went out and bought Union de Curtidores, the side which
had replaced it through promotion. On Saturday, the ``new'' Puebla
got a first-half goal from Jafet Soto to beat Celaya 1-0 in the
first weekend of the Torneo Invierno.

COMMENTARY: DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JUDGES-DEATH-PENALTY) 
(DW) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chateau Elan resort in Braselton, Ga., is a nice place. It
has seven restaurants, four golf courses, several tennis courts, an
equestrian center, a winery, a huge outdoor pool and a spa.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great place to kick back, wiggle one's toes and compare
notes on ways to speed up the process of sending human beings to
their death, which is a main topic of conversation at the resort
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hurry, hurry, hurry. Judges from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which covers Georgia, Florida and Alabama, are concerned
that it takes too long to get condemned criminals executed. But
these judges are not stupid. (Not all of them, anyway.) They know
that it's a lot more fun to talk about thwarting a careful review
of death penalty cases or denying adequate legal counsel to the
condemned or figuring out ways to execute the mentally ill if those
conversations can be interspersed with a round of golf, a
refreshing dip in the pool or a few stimulating sips from a mint
julep or a healthy shot of Kentucky bourbon.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the extreme comfort zone of Chateau Elan, they are
holding their State Capital Cases Symposium. They have invited as
their special guests some of the most rabid death penalty advocates
from that most rabid of death penalty states, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A session devoted specifically (and, you can bet, fondly) to the
death penalty experience in Texas is to be led by the infamous
Edith Hollan Jones, a judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Ms. Jones was once very high on the list of judges considered for
appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court by former President George
Bush. She is a death penalty champion who unabashedly favors
curtailment of post-conviction review. Once, during a last-ditch
oral argument on the eve of an execution, she famously complained
that the proceedings were keeping her from a birthday party for one
of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant scheduled for that session is Michael
McCormick, the presiding judge of the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals. In addition to being a death penalty zealot, McCormick has
long complained that the Supreme Court was wrong when it ruled in
1963 that states were required to provide lawyers for poor people
accused of felonies.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, this is a tough crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It would be tragic if Texas managed to export its warped sense
of justice and blind efficiency in capital cases to other states in
the South, and perhaps beyond. Stephen Bright, director of the
Southern Center for Human Rights, has tried for many years to bring
competent legal counsel to the accused in capital cases across the
country. He said the process in Texas ``has the integrity of a
professional wrestling match.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright noted that Texas is a place where a defendant can stand
``virtually defenseless'' before a system that permits executions
in cases where there is no real adversarial process to determine
guilt or innocence, where in some cases lawyers have actually slept
through the trials, and where there is no real post-conviction
review.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside the grotesquely inappropriate setting, the problem
with the gathering of judges and other criminal justice officials
at Braselton is not so much that there are zealots and extremists
among them, but that they are clearly setting the agenda. Their
goals are the wrong goals for a just and civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Baird, a former judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals
in Texas, said in an interview this week that the current emphasis
on speeding up the process undermined the whole point of a careful
review of capital cases, which is to insure that we don't kill an
innocent person or someone whose rights were violated in the
proceedings that resulted in a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The chief judge of the 11th Circuit, R. Lanier Anderson III,
denied that the desire for speedier executions was an overriding
concern of the symposium. He said he wanted all cases under his
jurisdiction decided fairly. He quickly added, ``But on the other
hand, we are interested in resolving cases with what I call
appropriate expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The term has a ring to it. Appropriate expedition. It sounds at
least as innocent as compassionate conservatism.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WHITE-RAP-MUSIC (Undated) _ Rap _ like most everything from the
blues to alternative rock before it _ has been officially embraced
by those who originally ostracized it, avariciously consumed by
those who it was invented in part to declare independence from. Of
course, rap has been integral to pop music and suburban youth
lifestyle since at least 1986, when the first rap album (by the
Beastie Boys) crossed over to number one on the Billboard charts.
But the difference is that back then, when white kids _ the Beastie
Boys, Rick Rubin and hard-rock bands like Faith No More and Anthrax
_ were getting into rap, it was a genre they were only just
discovering. Soon after, rappers began appearing who spoke almost
solely to white concerns, like Me Phi Me and Kid Rock, but they
didn't succeed because then because they were too early (and not
very good either). But today, rap is like the Beatles. It is a
birthright, something many white kids grow up listening to, a
standard by which they calibrate their lifetime notion of pop
music. By Neil Strauss. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT-BROOKS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ A look at film director,
Albert Brooks, whose latest movie ``The Muse'' will open Friday.
Previous films that he has written, directed and starred in are:
``Real Life,'' ``Modern Romance,'' ``Lost In America,'' ``Defending
Your Life,'' and ``Mother.'' By Margy Rochlin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   TASTE-OF-CHERRY-VIDEO (Undated) _ In the way of most films by
the great Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami, ``Taste of Cherry''
approaches large questions through a constrained and fascinating
tale. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FOUNTAIN-DANCE (Undated) _ The quirky story-ballet of Rostislav
Zakharov's ``Fountain of Bakhchisarai,'' which, though dating from
1934, had never been seen in New York until the Kirov Ballet
brought it to the Metropolitan Opera House this summer.
``Fountain'' arrived with a strange reputation. Based on a poem by
Pushkin, it dates from the time when Socialist Realism dominated
the arts in Soviet Russia. So it was easy to fear that it would toe
a dull party line. Instead, despite its occasionally trite score by
Boris Asafiev, it proved lively. By Jack Anderson. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LIVE-SAX-ACTS (New York) _ Two bare-chested men, wearing
tartanless kilts and effeminate jazz shoes, dance and play the
saxophone; the same pair, dressed in tuxedos, speak to each other
through bullhorns, slap each other's faces or grab each other's
crotches without flinching, all the while exchanging gentlemanly
chitchat; finally, as two guys in business attire, they wheel and
deal on the telephone. These are just some of the loaded images
that the choreographer-dancer Dan Dorfman and the
composer-performance artist Dan Froot have devised for their three
comic duets, ``Horn'' (1990), ``Bull'' (1994) and ``Job'' (1996),
respectively. The roughly 20-minute pieces have been performed
several times since their premieres as ironic accents in Dorfman's
and Froot's individual performance gigs. Now they will present them
as an evening unto themselves under the title ``Live Sax Acts'' at
Dance Theater Workshop. By William Harrris. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RABIN-RENARDY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Sony Classical's Masterworks
Heritage series was conceived to celebrate the past, but with a new
CD devoted to the violinists Michael Rabin and Ossy Renardy (MHK
60894), the label is also paying homage to two artists cut down in
their prime. Both players were already superior musicians when they
died, and in certain circles their demise still elicits palpable
regret. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SALZBURG-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ Salzburg is in good part a city of
shopkeepers, and streets are jammed with visitors spending money.
How much of a magnet the music festival is, and how much the small,
pretty and reasonably historic city surrounded by Alpine scenery,
is hard to judge. A lot of visitors, and they are 40 percent from
German-speaking places, don't look as if they can afford $400, or
even $100 tickets; residents often appear more prosperous than
their customers. Calls for a small-scale, small-budget, homegrown
festival have been heard, but businessmen are not protesting too
loudly about Gerard Mortier, who has ran the festival since 1991.
By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STILL-LIFE-ART (Amsterdam, Holland) _ A new show at the
Rijksmuseum here, ``Still Life: Paintings From the Netherlands,
1550-1729,'' with 70 carefully selected paintings, many on loan for
the occasion, claims to be the first exhibition to display all the
different types of still life from the golden age of Dutch and
Flemish painting. And it succeeds in demonstrating why they were so
popular in their day and why they are attracting new interest
today. The show runs in the Rijksmuseum's South Wing through Sept.
19 and will then be on display from Oct. 31 to Jan. 9 at the
Cleveland Museum of Art, which has a rich collection of still life
of all periods and is a co-organizer of this exhibition. By Alan
Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SITE-SANTA-FE-ART (Santa Fe., N.M.) _ The biennial exhibition of
international contemporary art that opened here last month was
devoted to exploring the meaning of ``place.'' But even before the
opening festivities were over, two installations had been shut down
precisely because of their locations. ``Looking for a Place'' was
the title of the third biennial sponsored by SITE Santa Fe, a
nonprofit arts center in a city that's a magnet for tourists. By
Ruth Lopez. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-BEHIND-THE-MUSIC (Undated) _ In the two years since it was
first broadcast, ``Behind the Music'' has become the music
industry's closet compulsion. Members of the media elite may not
blithely volunteer the information, but just start asking and
you'll be amazed at how many people admit to watching. ``Behind the
Music'' is ``Entertainment Tonight'' without the heavy cheese
factor, ``Biography'' minus the historical pretensions. It's a
simple, brilliant formula: a one-hour documentary about the ups and
downs of music careers, with subjects from Fleetwood Mac to David
Cassidy to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Madonna. By Karen Schoemer.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-STRANGE-JUSTICE (Undated) _ ``Strange Justice,'' a Showtime
drama (which has its premiere next Sunday night) is about the
controversial confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas. Directed by
Ernest Dickerson, who has previously been director of photography
on six Spike Lee films, ``Strange Justice'' stars Delroy Lindo as
Clarence Thomas and Regina Taylor as Anita Hill, the former
colleague who testified that he had sexually harassed her. By
Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL IN ENERGY DEPT. DENIES RACISM IN ESPIONAGE
INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top intelligence officer at the Energy Department strongly
denied on Wednesday that any racism was involved in his
department's yearslong investigation of a Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientist, Wen Ho Lee, for allegedly passing atomic
weapons secrets to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race was never a factor,'' the officer, Notra Trulock, said in
an interview. His department sent the names of about a dozen
suspects to the FBI, only three of which were Chinese-Americans and
the rest Caucasians, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard lots of talk about ethnic targeting,'' Trulock said,
referring to a counterintelligence technique that focuses on
particular ethnic groups because intelligence services often single
out people who may have cultural or political sympathies with
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we tried hard to be careful'' and to avoid any hint of
ethnic targeting, he said. ``That gets ugly real fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese-American suspects, he said, included Lee, his wife,
Sylvia, and a third unidentified individual. Lee eventually became
the primary suspect in the spying case, which was made public
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was born in Taiwan, worked at the Los Alamos nuclear
weapons laboratory in New Mexico for more than two decades before
he was fired in March for violations of security rules. He has
denied spying for China and has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock's denial of ethnic bias was prompted by the assertions
of the former head of counterintelligence at the Los Alamos
laboratory, who on Monday and Tuesday was quoted as saying that Lee
had been unfairly singled out because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a key factor,'' the former head of counterintelligence
at Los Alamos, Robert S. Vrooman, was quoted as saying in one of
the interviews. ``There were 83 people who went to China'' from the
New Mexican weapons lab in the 1980s, any one of whom might have
leaked secrets, Vrooman said.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing all the Energy Department's counterintelligence
operations, including those at Los Alamos, Trulock in 1995
spearheaded the investigation of alleged Chinese espionage at the
nation's nuclear weapons laboratories and last year was a secret
star witness before a select House committee that eventually made
the issue public. The committee, in its report, charged that China
had stolen information about America's most-advanced nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman's comments were apparently the first time an
investigator had publicly raised the issue of racial bias, though
some Chinese-American rights groups had previously done so.

`RUNAWAY GROOM' MARRIES, BUT QUESTIONS LINGER

<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Ct. _ A week after he removed his ``wanderguard''
security anklet and drove to New York City, the 74-year-old nursing
home fugitive who dubbed himself the ``Runaway Groom'' has, it
seems, made good his escape.
</P>
<P>
   It was last Tuesday when Harry Strouse left his Litchfield
nursing home and just kept going. Two days later, while state
police were searching for him and his attorney was pressing for his
return, he married 56-year-old Molly Bennett Aitken at City Hall in
New York, surfacing publicly only to vow to a reporter that he was
never coming back.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, Strouse and Aitken were enjoying their first week
of matrimony at a sprawling green farmhouse full of Hummel
figurines and cockatoos in Athol, Mass. Although he had been
instructed by his lawyer not to speak to the press, Strouse
playfully knocked on his head to indicate that he was of sound
mind. Meanwhile, staff at the Rose Haven Convalescent Home, who had
given him a bracelet to prevent him from wandering off in a
disoriented state, said they were not expecting to see Strouse
again. And romantics everywhere were cheering an old man's lunge
toward freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my hero,'' said Sergeant J. Paul Vance of the Connecticut
State Police, who called off their case after seeing the couple's
marriage certificate. ``I tell my wife, `Now don't be pushing me
now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But around Litchfield, where Strouse had lived for more than 30
years, two distinct possibilities hung in the air: Either Molly
Aitken had rescued Strouse from a nursing home he despised just as
his lawyer was stripping his decision-making power away from him;
or she had taken advantage of a disoriented and helpless old man
with a fortune his attorney described as ``a couple million
dollars'' and no heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Strouse on Tuesday fired the longtime attorney and friend who
had protested most vociferously against Aitken's role. Peter Litwin
had gone public with his misgivings about Strouse's sudden
marriage, arguing that his client had been diagnosed with dementia.
Litwin would not comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   But Litwin's arguments have convinced many in town that the
marriage is darkly manipulative. For one thing, Strouse is openly
gay and had shown little interest in women. And several of
Strouse's friends said it was clear his mind had been slipping
precipitously in recent months. Strouse had been placed in Rose
Haven at the end of May because he had been found wandering around
his neighborhood late at night in a disoriented state, said Rose
Haven staff.
</P>
<P>
   And when he turned up missing, Litwin's concern went beyond the
legal obligations of a responsible lawyer, said one friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circumstances like this make a real dividing line between your
protection under the law and your protection by the community you
live in,'' said Joseph Tyler, an antique dealer who rents his shop
from Litwin.
</P>
<P>
   A different story comes from Burstein, a New York attorney who
took on Strouse as a client this week after he fired Litwin. She
says Strouse and Aitken had recently rekindled an old friendship,
and that Strouse had called Aitken crying, threatening to kill
himself if she didn't help him get out of Rose Haven.
</P>
<P>
   After they had crossed the New York state border that day, ``he
said, `Molly, you know I wanted to marry you 23 years ago, and I
have nobody, I'm alone and vulnerable,' '' Burstein said. ``I'm not
sure he was as articulate as all that. I'm not saying this is
Burton and Taylor, but she does love him as a friend. She is a
bighearted, generous, flamboyant woman.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Strouse had been in a foggy mental state when he
checked into Rose Haven and he had granted Litwin considerable
decision-making power that he later regretted. A hearing scheduled
for Thursday could give Litwin the status of ``conservator'' for
his estate, meaning the attorney would have more power over all
Strouse's decisions, and Strouse ``was horribly anxious about it,''
Burstein said.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how bad Strouse's mental state was, but in
hair salons and pharmacies all over town last week they were
willing to speculate. The verdict at the Patco Handy Store was
romantic, whereas the assembled crowd at Shear Perfection leant to
the gold-digger theory. Everyone had an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that scares all old people is that they get into
these situations and they lose all control,'' said Hubert Van Asch
Van Wyck, who runs Black Swan Antiques on Bantam Road. ``People of
my generation, all of our parents are dying and going into nursing
homes, so it's a very timely story.''
</P>
<P>
   After Strouse's whereabouts were pinned down this week,
attention swung to his new bride, Molly Bennett Aitken, a mother of
six who has been living in New York. This is not the first time
that Aitken has found herself answering questions about strange
disappearances. She surfaced in the news about 10 years ago, when
she witnessed the dramatic airport abduction of seven Chinese
farmers she was hosting on her Athol farm. Aitken was at John F.
Kennedy airport greeting the delegation of 15, who she planned to
host on a 30-acre replica Chinese village on her Athol farm, when a
group of Asian men abducted seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, police officials in New York speculated the
abduction was either a kidnapping or part of a scheme to help them
defect.
</P>
<P>
   Burstein, who has known Aitken for four or five years, could not
comment on the 1990 abduction. She described Aitken as ``the kind
of person who believes she's saving the world,'' and said she fully
accepted Strouse as her third husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she expects to be married to (Strouse) for the rest of
her life,'' Burstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The unfolding of this story has left friends and neighbors
scratching their heads, trying to figure out what to make of
Strouse running off with a woman they had never heard of through
decades of friendship _ and without getting in touch with them.
Thomas McBride, 70, a friend for more than 30 years, said the last
time he saw Strouse, several months ago, Strouse was ``lost'' and
not himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he knows what happiness is now,'' said Thomas
McBride. ``He's in bad shape.'
</P>
<P>
   Many more simply wished Strouse well. As Bart Geissinger read a
newspaper account of his elderly friend's recent activities, a
smile spread across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like there's an angle,'' said Geissinger, a
jewelry store manager who fixed Strouse's watch chain for years.
``Maybe he's got something figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   And others, while expressing their concern about his welfare,
said the move did not seem uncharacteristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not terribly surprised that he might go off on an
adventure,'' said Peter Tillou, an art dealer and neighbor for 20
years. ``I laugh, because I know Harry, and Harry is full of
beans.''

   SCHOOLCHILDREN (Seattle) _ Preparing children for the school
year is a hefty task. After arming them with school supplies,
backpacks and lunches, parents are now also encouraged to protect
their children by talking to them about sexual awareness and
safety. Children have received personal safety information in
Washington's classrooms since the early 1980s. While this
information has helped students, research shows that parent
discussion and reinforcement of these ideas are more successful at
helping children protect themselves from sexual assault and
unwanted sexual advances.

YUGOSLAV-CROAT SOCCER GAME PRODUCES NO GOALS AND NO TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A long-awaited, once-postponed and
politically charged soccer match between Yugoslavia and Croatia
passed off peacefully and rather anticlimactically Wednesday night,
finishing 0-0, much like the summer's demonstrations against the
rule of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a taste for what might come at a major opposition
rally planned for Thursday night in Belgrade when a transformer at
the Red Star stadium failed a few minutes into the second half, and
the lights went out.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly chants aimed at Milosevic echoed around the stadium,
with many of the 60,000 people there yelling, ``Slobo leave!'' and
a popular, rhyming chant that goes in part, ``Slobo, you've sold
out Kosovo!''
</P>
<P>
   The game was televised nationally, but those chants were not
heard by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for the lights to come back on stretched on for 40
minutes, and officials gave some consideration to replaying the
whole game Thursday night. That led to immediate Balkan-style
speculation that the Milosevic government had intentionally blown
the power to make sure that the game would conflict with the
opposition rally.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the government's nervousness about Thursday,
however, state television news announced that police had arrested a
man from Cetinje with ``an explosive device fitted with a timer,''
apparently intended to be set off during the rally in front of the
Federal Parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   The police then warned, the announcer said, that others could be
planning such attacks, and they advised people to be careful,
especially regarding their children.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast seemed a patent effort to discourage people from
attending the opposition rally, the first in Belgrade since the
Kosovo war. But the opposition is divided, and its best orator, Vuk
Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, has decided not to
attend _ at least as of Wednesday _ as has the former army chief of
staff, Momcilo Perisic.
</P>
<P>
   Another well-known opposition figure, Vesna Pesic of the
Alliance for Change, who had also been expected to speak, instead
traveled to Montenegro _ for safety, she said. Prosecutors asked
police to investigate her on felony charges for seeming to urge the
violent overthrow of Milosevic by citing ``the Romanian example,''
an apparent reference to the 1989 uprising against the Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Ms. Pesic said the charge
was ludicrous, but she left ``because you never really know with
them,'' meaning the government. Asked if the much ballyhooed rally
would be important now after so many defections, she said: ``Only
if the police or the regime starts a battle or an incident. It's
now just one of the rallies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the southern city of Nis, Alliance leaders attracted
more than 20,000 people Wednesday to an anti-Milosevic rally. Zoran
Djindjic, the head of the Democracy Party, said Thursday's protest
in Belgrade would bring the end of Milosevic closer. ``Stage two of
Milosevic's replacement begins in Serbia tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Milosevic appeared to be moving to flummox the
opposition again and to call their bluff, with a spokesman
suggesting that new elections might be called soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Dasic, the spokesman for Milosevic's party, said: ``We
believe that there are more important things on the nation's agenda
than the elections, but if the opposition wants that, so be it. We
are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic favors new elections but the opposition generally has
been wary, worried that the government might manipulate the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition analysts and officials also say that they are not
ready for elections and not sure they could win one now against
Milosevic, especially in coalition with Vojislav Seselj, the
Serbian ultranationalist who heads the Serbian Radicals.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Seselj had said that the government was ready for
new elections and the opposition only has to agree to them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pesic of the Alliance for Change, which does not include
Draskovic, said her coalition probably would not boycott new
elections, as it did in 1997. But she suggested that the Alliance
would seek to turn the elections into ``a referendum on Milosevic''
by running a slate of nonpartisan experts.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll released Wednesday indicated that more than 70
percent of Serbs surveyed want a new government and an end to the
country's isolation. The poll of 1,000 people last week by the
independent Partner Marketing Research Agency suggested that
Milosevic and his allies could expect only 24 percent support if
elections were held now. The various opposition parties and
alliances would get around 40 percent, 18 percent would not vote
and 11 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But the margin of error was unclear, and private polling for the
opposition parties has produced pessimism among their staff about
new elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's soccer match, a qualifying round for the
European championship, the players, who are professionals, behaved
sportingly toward each other. The game was originally scheduled for
March 27, but was postponed because NATO had begun bombing on March
24.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was cheerfully venomous toward the Croatian team,
drowning out the Croatian national anthem and shouting, over and
over again, ``Kill the Ustashe,'' the Croatian fascists of World
War II. They seemed more fervent against the Croatians than against
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There were dire predictions of what might happen should the
Yugoslav side lose to the Croatians, whom they had not played since
1991 and the breakup of the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Radovanovic, an independent analyst here, said it would
have been ``dangerous for the regime to lose this game,'' because
it would serve as another example of ``how the country has gone to
hell and how this regime has destroyed everything, including the
soccer team.''

   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Its options nearly exhausted in a worsening
economic crisis, the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan has
grudgingly agreed to sell nearly half its share of the Tengiz
oilfield, among the world's most prized reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Kazakhs have quietly organized a London-based,
invitation-only auction for what amounts to 10 percent of the
field, according to industry and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates the stake as worth $1.2 billion to $1.6
billion, more than enough to fill an estimated $560 million budget
gap this year, an official indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need some quick cash,'' said Robert Ebel, director of
energy and national security at the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies. ``They have decided, `Let's
see what we can get for our equity share.'''
</P>
<P>
   The auction coincides with an uncertain time in the oil industry
_ greater confidence as crude oil prices have doubled to levels
above $20 a barrel, but also caution, with more attention paid to
company mergers and spending cuts than to acquisitions of new
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prospect of a sale of part of the Tengiz field has
stirred rumors for weeks as Kazakhstan's economic problems have
become more acute.
</P>
<P>
   As a demonstration of the sensitivity in and outside government
to the sale of even part of the field, Kazakhstan's most valuable
possession, the government has mailed 20 tender letters to major
petroleum companies and state-owned oil companies. But it has
intentionally not announced the sale publicly, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on 2,500 square miles along the scraggly northeastern
shore of the Caspian Sea, Tengiz holds 6 billion to 9 billion
barrels of proven recoverable reserves of high-quality oil, a
quantity that makes it one of the world's 10 largest fields.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it has new seismic data suggesting that
Tengiz and surrounding fields included in the stake hold much more
oil. Tengiz currently produces 215,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron Corp. owns the largest share in the field, a 45 percent
stake, with Kazakhstan and Mobil Corp. at 25 percent each, and
Lukoil of Russia at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stake being offered amounts to 40 percent of Kazakhstan's
holding, or 10 percent of the ownership of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite feelings of misgivings here, there seems to have been
little choice for the Kazakh authorities but to put part of Tengiz
on the sale block.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan, a remote and geographically huge former Soviet
republic abutting Russia and China, expects to be in severe
economic difficulty until at least 2002, when government analysts
predict that large amounts of tax revenue will start flowing from
Tengiz and perhaps other oilfields. In the meantime, some are
predicting a budget shortage next year alone of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The government has twice rewritten the current budget because of
insufficient revenue and is behind on pension payments, a
potentially explosive problem as the elderly are Kazakhstan's most
politically vocal group.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a $450-million loan program from the International
Monetary Fund expired, and the government found itself embarrassed
when the IMF announced that it had failed to reach agreement with
the Kazakh authorities on a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the IMF _ whose imprimatur is vital to attracting
foreign investors _ said Kazakhstan's budget deficits were too
high, among other problems in its economic revamping effort.
</P>
<P>
   The republic has for now rejected an aggressive privatization
program because, with the current investment atmosphere, it decided
it could not attract the kind of money that its enterprises
merited.

   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ More than 1,000 relief workers
from 19 countries join the frantic search for victims of Tuesday's
devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raise an outcry over
shoddy construction practices and lax government regulations.
Although rescue workers continue to find people alive under the
rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll climbs steadily:
According to an official count, 3,879 bodies have been recovered,
and more than 16,000 people are listed as seriously injured. By

   TURKEY-SCENE (Izmet, Turkey) _ People here spent their day
digging, sifting, grieving and increasingly despairing that those
who have not escaped from the rubble by now are probably dead. They
watched as bulldozers and front-end loaders tried to unearth
bedrooms, which is where most people were when the earthquake
struck. Then in the swirl of dust and smoke and sweltering heat,
residents picked through the rubble with hammers and chisels and
bare hands. As delicately as archaeologists, they teased out shreds
of clothing, old photos, scraps of furniture and, inevitably, the
bodies. By Edmund L. Andrews. (The story has moved in ``i'' news

nation's second largest life-insurer, says it has reached a
proposed settlement of class action lawsuits that charged that the
company used deceptive sales practices to cheat millions of
purchasers of life insurance policies and annuities. The company
placed the value of the settlement, intended to cover 7 million

   JAPAN-ARTS (Tokyo) _ Famous art is leaving Japan, and only a
handful of bankers and art dealers know for sure where it is going.
The paintings, including large numbers of van Goghs, Modiglianis,
Renoirs and Picassos that vanished into Japan more than a decade
ago, are being resold abroad as a result of the country's economic
collapse. ``There's a loss of face associated with this art,'' said
Chieko Hasegawa, owner of the Nichido Gallery in Ginza. ``The sale

BUSH AGAIN REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT DRUG USE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
and KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush steadfastly refused Wednesday to answer
questions about whether he ever used cocaine even as another
Republican governor and key Bush supporter _ as well as an
unrelenting drumbeat from Democrats and the national media _
demanded that he do so.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for a Louisiana campaign swing, Bush held an
Austin news conference to introduce the state's new education
commissioner. But Bush was peppered with renewed questions about
past drug use following a Dallas Morning News story and a New York
Times opinion column that reviewed the controversy over the Texas
governor's refusal to ``catalog my past.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush turned testy at the Texas capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happens,'' he said, interrupting a reporter's
question. ``Somebody floats a rumor and it causes you to ask a
question. And that's the game in American politics and I refuse to
play it. That is a game and you just fell for the trap and I refuse
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   No evidence of his purported use of cocaine or other illegal
drugs has surfaced. Bush has acknowledged drinking too much, until
he quit immediately after his 40th birthday. He is 53.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's refusal to answer any questions about alleged illicit
drug use has become fodder for political opponents. On Wednesday,
it became fodder for at least one supporter as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush should address issues about private conduct,''
Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma told reporters. ``In today's world,
every one of us who serves in public office needs to answer
questions about conduct that is arguably criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating, chairman of the Republican Governors Association and a
Bush supporter, stressed that he ``doesn't think there's anything
there'' in Bush's background. Keating added that whatever misdeeds
Bush may have committed ``were largely carousing in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have tremendous admiration for Bush, but I think
these kinds of questions are legitimate,'' Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters in Austin he does not know who started the
rumors of cocaine use and does not recall his campaign pinning the
blame on wealthy magazine publisher Steve Forbes, a competitor for
the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think they're being planted?'' he said. ``I know they're
being planted. And they're ridiculous and they're absurd and the
people of America are sick and tired of this kind of politics. And
I'm not participating.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his responses amount to a denial, Bush apparently
started to respond, saying, ``I'm ...''
</P>
<P>
   But he left his response hanging there and turned to another
topic.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Bush's campaign day was supposed to be a tour
of a Jefferson Parish, La., elementary school at which private
businesses have helped provide computers and paid for Internet
connections. Bush promotes that kind of private-public partnership
as a centerpiece of his Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said in Louisiana that he may not participate in the
state's nominating caucus unless the state party can guarantee a
fair process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the system is not open and the rules are fuzzy, and if it's
hard to find places where people can vote, I just think I'm going
to shy away,'' Bush said. ``If it's an open process where people
can participate, then I will participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would rely on the advice of his newly appointed
state chairman in Louisiana, GOP Gov. Mike Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who was traveling the state with Bush, said details for
the as-yet unscheduled Louisiana caucuses remain uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, states have thrown the traditional nominating
process into disarray, by jockeying primary schedules to give them
more influence in the process. Louisiana in particular has been
trying to position itself as among the first states to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, however, is facing larger problems at home than vagaries
in the caucus system. On Thursday, he is scheduled to testify
before the State Board of Ethics for failing to report on campaign
finance reports his 1995 purchase of former Klansman and
congressional candidate David Duke's list of political supporters.
Foster is expected to be fined.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier stop in the day, Bush and Foster faced protesters
highlighting the connection between Duke and the two governors.
Foster called the protesters ``another hate group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so bent on trying to develop hate between people,''
Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he did not know the facts but called Foster ``my kinda
guy,'' while he disparaged Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like David Duke's politics, I don't like where his
heart is, I don't like the bigotry and prejudice that he
represents,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his opinion on the issue before the ethics panel, Bush
said, ``I would tell you I respect him (Foster) a lot. I don't know
all of the facts, I don't know what the facts are, but I do know
that I trust Mike Foster. He's a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks while touring Jefferson Elementary School,
where children worked on computers amid cartoonish signs declaring
``I'm Drug Free.'' With that backdrop, Bush was asked once again
about the drug rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Giving no hint of his earlier irritation, Bush said he ``made
mistakes'' in his youth and learned from them, but would not offer
up an ``inventory'' of his transgressions. He said he wanted to
talk about what he believed in.
</P>
<P>
   What he believes in, according to Bush, is local control of
issues such as education. Asked about a recent decision by the
Kansas Board of Education to delete evolution from the curriculum,
Bush said it's not the role of the federal government to make those
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's up to the local people to figure out how fast you
expose children to different thoughts about how the world
started,'' Bush said. ``I have no problem with children learning
about evolution as well as understanding that there are some who
believe in creationism as well. I think it's important that
children be exposed to different thoughts.''

REFINERY BLAZE THREATENS TO COMPOUND QUAKE'S DEVASTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN GORVETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With international aid pouring into this
quake-ravaged country, foreign aircraft joined Turkey's battle
Wednesday to bring a blaze at its largest oil refinery under
control. The quake's death toll soared toward 4,000 as rescue teams
pulled body after body out of the rubble of crumbled apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 hours after one of the century's most powerful
temblors struck, 5,000 people were still trapped in the seaside
town of Golcuk alone, according to Anatolian news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, besieged and heckled by an angry
populace, insisted his government was doing all it could to unearth
trapped bodies and help the estimated 18,000 people injured by
Tuesday's pre-dawn quake, the nation's deadliest in six decades.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat, Ecevit said, came from the raging blaze in
the Tupras refinery near Izmit, the epicenter of the quake nearly
60 miles east of Istanbul. Six storage tanks were ablaze, despite
efforts by firefighters and chemical firefightng foam dropped from
Israeli and private US planes.
</P>
<P>
   Flames and black smoke rose 300 feet from the refinery.
Residents feared that depots less than 1,000 feet away could also
explode. The refinery lies along a major fault line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fire spreads ... it would be a new disaster for
Izmit,'' said Memduh Oguz, the governor of this industrial city of
75,000 people. The main concern: a fertilizer facility with 8,000
tons of dangerous ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run oil plant, built in 1961 under US supervision,
provides more than a third of Turkey's residential- and
industrial-grade fuel. Many of the factories and businesses in the
quake zone _ which account for nearly 35 percent of Turkey's gross
domestic product _ depend on the plant. The quake undoubtably will
set back government efforts to sell off the estimated $2.5 billion
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an oil slick pushed out nearly a half mile from the
refinery into the gulf, despite the spraying of dispersants by two
Turkish vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Help came from the United Nations, Israel and even historic
antagonists Greece and Cyprus. Wednesday night, the US Navy
dispatched three ships, carrying 2,100 Marines and 1,000 sailors,
to waters off Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Even disaster search-and-rescue veterans were stunned at the
scope of the destruction. ``This one's worse. Much, much worse,''
said Uri Bremer, whose Israeli team had worked to save lives after
a quake in Armenia and bombings in Kenya and in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   A Turkish government spokesman admitted that it was impossible
to estimate casualties because wrecked roads and highways make
access impossible to many villages.
</P>
<P>
   Angry residents waited in vain for help. Baris Boster of the
daily paper Cumhuriyet, said that in Yalova, a port some 40 miles
south of Istanbul, no one had come for 10 or 11 hours after the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, resident Hatice Oltuk also complained of no help.
``We just sat in the ruins crying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A mountaineering club used ropes and gear to try to pry away
building slabs in areas near Izmit. ``We have bulldozers, but no
cranes,'' said an exhausted volunteer, Mehmet Cagoglu, at another
site in Izmit. ``Without lifting gear, many trapped in the rubble
are unable to be reached and can even be crushed by the
bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some arriving international disaster specialists criticized the
lack of organization by the government _ and one group, from the
Austrian Red Cross, threatened to pull out in three days unless
they had direction from Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been given any locations in which to work or
priorities by the authorities,'' complained the Austrian team's
leader, Raphael Etsikovec.
</P>
<P>
   Blame for the extent of the casualties was also leveled at
building contractors and local authorities _ notoriously corrupt
and reluctant to regulate. The Hurriyet newspaper was even more
blunt, running a front-page banner headline that charged
``Murderers!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many buildings are built first and permission is granted
later,'' said Ferah Salman, of the Chamber of Turkish Engineers and
Architects. ``In the Istanbul Metropolitan area, 60 percent of the
buildings in planned development areas do not have any planning
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, her group has reported on four major earthquakes in
Turkey, but each time their recommendations have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, builders reacted angrily to accusations of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``After every earthquake they make do with blaming a few civil
engineers and contractors,'' said the head of the chamber of civil
engineers, Fikri Kaya. ``If you want to find the real guilty ones,
you have to look at successive housing ministers and the officials
at the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   The area is known for quakes, but this temblor, measured at 7.4
on the Richter scale, was the deadliest to hit Turkey since a 1939
quake. Experts and archival material conservatively put the toll
from that quake at 33,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, dwindling food supplies in some areas added to
the mood of desperation among the survivors. Crowds mobbed a convoy
of bread trucks that entered Izmit, and at sunset, refugees from
Izmit crowded around small fires, fearful of returning to any
structure while aftershocks continued.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, a Kurdish migrant to the region who lost two brothers when
his apartment building collapsed, stood in despair near one fire.
``We came here to work, to live,'' he said. ``But what have we
found?''

CARRY-ON BAG DANGER LEAVES FAA UNFAZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month a Harvard Medical School professor and his wife
boarded their Delta Air Lines flight at Logan International Airport
early and settled into their seats on the beginning of a trip _ via
New York _ to Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   But it almost never took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, I was sitting in the aisle, and I was reading the
newspaper and I never saw it happen,'' said the 66-year-old doctor
who spoke on condition his name not be printed. ``There was a guy,
trying to put a very heavy suitcase in the overhead bin, and he
lost control. It hit me square on the head, and knocked me out.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor came to within seconds, but he ``wasn't making any
sense,'' recalled his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants asked if there was a doctor on board. One
stepped out of First Class and came back to assist the man. They
were colleagues, and after a few minutes _ including lying down in
the aisle to boost his blood pressure _ the man who had been hit by
the suitcase was feeling better. Paramedics arrived and examined
the doctor in the jetway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure I was going to have a bad headache and stiff neck,
but I wasn't going to abort my trip to Stockholm,'' the doctor
recalled. Delta made him sign a medical release before he could
continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   A freak accident?
</P>
<P>
   It is not, according to the Association of Flight Attendants and
Russell D. Robison, executive director of Injury Prevention Works,
a Pennsylvania nonprofit committed to preventing airline cabin
injuries. They estimate that, nationwide, 4,000 to 4,500 passengers
each year are injured by falling carry-on bags that range from
suitcases to laptop computers, from ski boots to bowling balls.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 600 million passengers flying this year, the
chances of being hit are remote, but critics _ and some victims _
contend neither the airlines nor the Federal Aviation
Administration are doing enough to regulate carry-on bags.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the AFA, the flight attendants union, petitioned
the FAA to limit carry-on bags to one per person, limited in size
to its total dimension of width, length, and height not exceeding
45 linear inches, and weighing no more than 13 pounds. Unlike some
other proposals, the one-bag limit would include purses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to safety concerns, Cynthia Kain, a spokeswoman for
the AFA, said that as planes become more crowded, passengers
cramming carry-ons into overhead bins make boarding and leaving
airplanes more time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA did announce earlier this year a public awareness
program with the Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturing
Association regarding carry-on bags called ``Think Small, Think
Smart, Think Safe.'' By contrast, the FAA heavily promoted a
``turbulence happens'' campaign to reduce turbulence-related
injuries. On average, 58 passengers a year are injured because of
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has stated that policies on carry-on bags should be
written by the airlines; that it is a competitive issue in a
cut-throat industry. Indeed, Continental Airlines is reconfiguring
some of its planes to increase the overhead compartments to permit
more bags on flights.
</P>
<P>
   Anne DeCicco, president of LLGMA, said one consistent policy
would be helpful not only for passengers but also for manufacturers
and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are screaming for standardization because customers don't
know what to buy, and we don't know what to make, and retailers
don't know what to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Robison, who has made the issue something of a
crusade. He says policy must come from the government, because
airlines are unlikely to act alone. British Airways did install a
secondary restraint system in overhead bins on some airplanes in
1990 and saw a significant drop in injury claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines end up having more room in cargo holds for paid
freight and mail,'' said Robison, noting the industry made $12
billion in freight charges last year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 95 percent of the people injured each year are sitting
in an aisle seat, said Robison, and the majority of injuries occur
during the cruise portion of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Many airlines give warning at the end of a flight about being
careful opening the overhead bin because contents may have shifted
during the flight. Robison believes the warning should be more
forceful and given before takeoff, once the seat belt sign is
turned off, and on landing.
</P>
<P>
   At Logan, a month does not got by without a call to paramedics
to meet a plane because of someone injured by a bag falling on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie D. Reed, 51, was treated by emergency personnel upon
landing at Logan on June 3 _ one of three people checked out that
month by paramedics, none of whom was hospitalized _ after being
struck by a briefcase during the cruise portion of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, of Austin, Texas, was traveling with his wife and friends
for a trip to Paris, when someone went to get a blanket out of the
overhead bin and a briefcase hit him in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke the skin just above my left eye and by the time I got
to the restroom, I was bleeding down the side of my face,'' Reed
recalled. ``I had a black eye the whole time we were in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, paramedics went to airplanes at Logan for carry-on
injuries three more times, one of which involved the Massachusetts
doctor. There were at least three other times people were injured
slightly but required no medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Reed got a voucher from the airline for his shirt to be
dry-cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor is still waiting for word one from Delta. There was
no follow-up call, no letter of concern. But his colleague, the
doctor who responded to the flight attendant's call for assistance,
did hear from the airline. Last week he got a gift basket as a
token of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they sent him a basket of goodies, they could have at least
called to see how I was doing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   GALLIANO, La. _ Down the bayou you drive for miles and miles
along the narrow ribbon of water, past weathered trawlers and
houses on cinder block that connect one small town to the next.
Suddenly it appears, mirage-like _ a sprawling, stunning home
straight from the pages of Architectural Digest, fronted by a lake
and impeccably landscaped turf.
</P>
<P>
   You stomp on the brake pedal and climb out of your car to absorb
it all on the hot-as-gumbo summer day, and the humidity steams up
your glasses, adding to the hallucinatory effect.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the only strange sight around. A bit farther down the
road is the homeowner's workplace, a three-story, modern glass
edifice.
</P>
<P>
   A few more blocks, and you're at South Lafourche High, which
houses a 1998 state champion basketball trophy amid the football
prizes for which the area is known. It was wrested away from the
New Orleans parochial schools that wage pitched recruiting battles
over pre-teens and treat the titles as their birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this an illusion: Two college-bound residents of that
house _ one black, one white _ carry on like the brothers that they
are, genealogy be damned, signing an occasional autograph, sharing
the role of local hero like no other athlete since Bobby Hebert
came out of nearby Cut Off to quarterback the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Under a single expansive roof live two-thirds of Georgia Tech's
incoming freshman basketball class _ Clarence Moore and Ross
Chouest, brothers not by blood but certainly by sweat and tears.
When they left the marshlands of south Louisiana this week and
moved to the metropolis of Atlanta, a new chapter began in two
young lives, a chapter that cannot possibly match the one just
ended.
</P>
<P>
   (BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   Ross Chouest needed a tall teammate for his summer-league AAU
squad, someone who could score. Just out of seventh grade, he had a
roomful of trophies to show for individual and team achievements in
youth programs, along with a videotape of a TV interview he had
given. But the kid was tired of being The Man. A mutual friend put
him in touch with Clarence Moore, already beyond 6 feet tall and
outgrowing his nickname, Little Mo.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have come from more contrasting backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' father, Gary, is president of Galliano-based Edison
Chouest Offshore, the world's largest privately owned offshore
vessel service company founded by his father, who still puts in
part-time hours at 86. The family employs two full-time
housekeepers, and a cook was on constant duty until recently. The
property, more than 80 acres, includes a guest house, a tennis
court, a pond occupied by swans _ and a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   The Chouests _ pronounced Shwests _ fly private planes on
fishing vacations to the islands often enough that catching blue
marlin is routine. They own a houseboat. They just unloaded their
yacht. They are down-home, low-key, humbly grateful for their
materialistic bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence's father _ ``Big Mo,'' although he looks up to his
6-foot-5 son _ is legally blind and cannot work. His mother is
deceased. The Moores' home in Norco, within the shadows of New
Orleans, is modestly appointed but rich in atmosphere, thanks to
his cheery relatives. ``A comedy club'' is young Clarence's
description of his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Chouest funded many of his youngest son's summer-league
teams, which drew talent from around the state. When Clarence
joined, he and Ross hit it off, and they were among five players
from that roster to enroll in the eighth grade at Archbishop Hannan
in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   They were the building blocks for the Hannan Project, a
basketball blueprint under the school's new coach. Ross bunked at
the Chouests' New Orleans lakefront condominium with his mother,
Carolyn, while Clarence made the weary commute from Norco.
</P>
<P>
   Once basketball practice began, Clarence would stay overnight at
the condo. An AAU coach hired by Gary chauffeured the boys between
their temporary home and school.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn, a onetime teacher who had home-schooled Ross for years,
assisted Clarence with homework. The one-on-one attention
straightened out Clarence a year after he entered a maze of
in-school suspensions, mainly for cutting up in class.
</P>
<P>
   Then a band of students, two of them players, were caught
stealing firewood from a store, and the Hannan Project crumbled
before the paint was dry. The players were punished. The coach was
fired. Ross chose to withdraw and head back home. Clarence was
gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   But where? ``We had become the best of friends,'' Clarence said
about Ross, who added, ``You can't just take two people, put them
together and (automatically) have them mix. It just so happened me
and Mo got along.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clarence cried is a matter of debate _ he says no;
others say yes _ but it troubled him to see the arrangement
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In Norco, Clarence's mother, Avis, was praying for a better life
for her son. A college graduate who had coped for years with a
variety of ailments, she was concerned about his academic decline
and her helplessness. An idea was floated: Why can't Clarence head
down the bayou and stay in the big house?
</P>
<P>
   For the Chouests, it was a slam-dunk call. They were fond of
Clarence. They had the means to feed another mouth. One of Ross'
three brothers was leaving to get married. Carolyn, who once wanted
only daughters (she had one), stayed up many late nights washing
uniforms as players hung out. No big deal if one moved in.
</P>
<P>
   And Ross had found a kindred spirit in sneakers, someone who
could ripen into a basketball force once his coordination caught up
with his rapid growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clicked instantly,'' Clarence said. ``There was something
special between us on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was on board but Clarence Sr., who initially voted
against the plan. ``Leaving home, it was too early for him,'' he
says now. ``If he'd been 18, I would have thrown him a party. But
15?''
</P>
<P>
   Young Clarence understood: ``I don't think any man wants his son
to move away.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Mom double-teamed Dad. They convinced him that,
educationally and socially, it was the way to go. So, life imitated
art _ if you can call the old sitcom ``Diff'rent Strokes'' art _ as
the Chouests became Clarence's legal guardians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I spoke to her,'' Carolyn said about Avis, ``she
cried and said this was an answer to her prayers. I'm not sure if I
could have (let him go). It was a big sacrifice on her part,
knowing she didn't have much time to live.''
</P>
<P>
   From Kmart to Hilfiger
</P>
<P>
   From the time Avis Moore gave birth to her other child, Chris,
now 14, she had been on a precipitous decline. Pulmonary
thrombosis. Diabetes. Lupus. Rheumatoid arthritis. On the rare
occasions that she saw Clarence play, an oxygen tank was at one
side. At the other was Clarence Sr., who needed binoculars even in
tiny gyms to combat his failing eyesight, the possible consequence
of handling chemicals on his former job.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence took to his new digs so warmly that the Chouests
virtually had to push his car toward Norco 1 1/2 hours away to
visit his blood family. What was not to like? He swapped his Kmart
clothes for Hilfiger and Polo, his knock-off sneakers for Nikes.
They bought him a BMW and chipped in $50 a week spending money. He
could focus on jump shots and schoolbooks, and block out the
distractions back home.
</P>
<P>
   Any adjustments were trivial. Clarence found services at the
Chouests' church somnolent. ``I'm used to being pumped up,'' he
said, by roof-raising gospel songs. He missed one of his favorite
meals _ pigs' feet. He did not share the regional passion for
fishing and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cajun accents? ``They all talk funny here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, ``It was such a blessing,'' he said.
``Everybody gets an opportunity in life. This was mine. I took it
and ran.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clarence needed any reinforcement, it came the day he was
hanging with the old crowd in Norco when one of them shoplifted
some candy. The police picked up Clarence, then released him after
confirming his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 'hood, where many of Clarence's buddies were dealing
drugs and staying out all night, they poked fun at his new cultural
tastes, especially music. When he would pop in a Nirvana CD and
sing along, they would say, ``Man, are you turning white on us?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they were happy for him. ``Each one told me, `Don't mess it
up down there. Stick with it, bro.'''
</P>
<P>
   The reception from South Lafourche followers was mixed for both
players. Because neither had gravitated through the local school
system, they were seen by some as interlopers, basketball versions
of U.S. Senate candidate Hilary Clinton in New York state. One
teacher vowed never to attend another Tarpons game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a mindset here that we don't win state but
everybody who wants to play on the team can,'' Carolyn said. ``Some
parents thought their sons perhaps ranked higher ... than Mo and
Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarence won over any skeptics, partly with his dedication. He
has been known to train in the summer heat while wearing a vest
loaded with weights.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the bubbly personality. His philosophy: ``No reason
to be sad about anything. I'm happy 24-7.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that most of the locals worked for or with Ross'
father.
</P>
<P>
   And winning cures all, so the two were embraced as sophomores,
their second season, when the Tarpons reached the semifinals of 5A,
the state's largest classification. Ross, with the peripheral
vision of an Imax theater regular, was uncanny at sending special
deliveries to Clarence for easy baskets. But they also could flash.
Ross would drive in while sensing his sidekick on his trail _ just
in case, Clarence would ``woo-woo'' in falsetto _ and bounce the
ball off the glass. Clarence would swoop in, catch it in midflight
and jam.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the boys were treated as equals: same rules, same
clothes, same weekly allowance. When Clarence strayed _ and it was
never far _ he might be denied telephone privileges or friends
dropping by to watch movies and shoot pool. His mother had taught
him to set goals and reach for them. Veering off the straight and
narrow, he reminded himself, ``would jeopardize my future.''
</P>
<P>
   He did wind up in court once, temporarily losing his driver's
license because of a speeding ticket. The judge, a devotee of
Thibodeaux High, ended his stern lecture with a plea that Clarence
go easy on his team next season.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, also well-behaved, recalled a drinking-and-driving episode
in the BMW he received at age 15 _ since replaced by a Mercedes. It
drew the wrath of his normally reserved mother. ``It wasn't pretty
here for a while,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   At least the message got through to Clarence. ``You stay on her
good side, it's smooth sailing,'' he said. ``I know how she can be
from that one experience with Ross. I've never really given her any
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Generosity vs. jealousy
</P>
<P>
   By Clarence's junior year, his mother required oxygen around the
clock. The calls from home to report another hospitalization became
more ominous. Once, as he drove to Norco, ``a feeling came over me
that this was the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. Avis Moore died at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   She was buried hours before South Lafourche played rival
Slidell. The team attended the wake, then lost by 30 points while
Clarence was away mourning.
</P>
<P>
   He was in uniform the next day and, unburdened at last, had a
break-out game. ``I was in a zone,'' he said. The Tarpons, beaten
five times until then, never lost again, exacting revenge against
Slidell in the finals and bringing home the trophy. The parade tied
up traffic like one of the occasional hurricane warning
evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   By their senior season, the legend of the Chouest family was
spreading. How Ross had begun organized ball at age 4 and won his
first national award at 9. How Clarence, banned from youth league
all-star tournaments for four years because he exceeded the height
limit, had found heaven down the bayou while his parents went
through hell back home. How Gary had maximized their potential,
building in the back yard a gorgeous gym with a high-tech cushioned
floor, paying summer-league expenses for the kids, chartering buses
and picking up hotel room tabs for the parents, paying Clarence's
tuition at Hannan ...
</P>
<P>
   The rumors were inevitable: Daddy's deep pockets factored in the
Tarpons' success. A harsh newspaper article in the New Orleans
Times- Picayune _ headlined ``The Best Team Money Can Buy?'' _
addressed talk of mass transfers to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Gary was puzzled. He concedes that his generosity was motivated
somewhat to provide Ross with players and coaches who would help
him improve and attract notice. But he maintains that his dollars
were devoted entirely to the summer leagues so Ross' teams need not
seek corporate sponsorship and so the players could be exposed to
college recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky in life,'' Gary said. ``If you have an
opportunity to help somebody, you try to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only one other player switched to South Lafourche. As
for Clarence, the Chouests say he was an awkward greenhorn when
they took him in, not the blue-chip player of the year he became.
The state athletics association investigated all three transfers
and found nothing untoward.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the story was published, Carolyn told Gary she was
headed to the hairdresser's in New Orleans. Instead, she marched
into the newspaper, which printed her lengthy letter rebutting
parts of the article.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence and Ross wrote the hubbub off to jealous gossip. ``If I
was getting paid to come here,'' Clarence joked, ``I'd have a big
house on the lake and be driving a Land Cruiser.'' Ross long before
had sensed that some people saw him as pampered, eating from a
silver spoon. ``Comes with the territory,'' he said. His play
belies that stereotype. Tarpons coach Scott Bouzigard said no
player ever worked harder for him.
</P>
<P>
   South Lafourche staggered through an 11-loss season this year
but returned to the championship game. Bouzigard thought the
Tarpons could repeat only by shifting Ross from shooting guard to
point guard, so he could set up Clarence for baskets. ``The bond
they share is what makes them extra-special players,'' said
Bouzigard, who had his own special-delivery boy 22 years ago. The
pass he caught that clinched a state football title for the local
school came from Bobby Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, Clarence was angered by an overly aggressive
foul. He said, ``If Ross sees I'm (angry), he knows to get the ball
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. Clarence rang up 35 points. But the rest of
the Tarpons scored only 13 in a six-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   Tech comes calling
</P>
<P>
   On idle weekends, Clarence and Ross had checked out colleges,
sometimes together, sometimes apart. They braced for the likelihood
of splitting up. ``We were content,'' Clarence said, ``to go our
separate ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Clarence's suitors was Georgia Tech, which had been tipped
off by a recruiting analyst. For coach Bobby Cremins, it was love
at first sight. ``Once I saw Clarence play,'' Cremins said, ``I
decided to go all-out. I see somebody I like, I go after him
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   With Ross and Tech, it was more like a slowly budding romance.
If not for the Tarpons' extended playoff run, Cremins might not
have seen him enough to risk a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   With Dion Glover departing for the NBA, Cremins says, Clarence
could elbow into the lineup. The coach sees in him a dynamic
character who could raise the electricity on the low-voltage Tech
roster.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ross, Cremins says, ``Some people may say he's
questionable for the ACC. But he's a tough kid. He could be a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Housemates for four years, Ross and Clarence will remain so,
sharing an on-campus apartment with two new teammates. ``I think,''
Clarence said, ``we can put up with each other another four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, alone together in the big house, Ross' parents say becoming
Clarence's guardian became mutually beneficial. Without him, Ross
might never have landed at a top-shelf basketball school.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. ``We are isolated from blacks down here, which
is not good,'' Gary said. The Chouests' interaction with
African-Americans was limited until Ross became involved with
summer-league basketball. ``I saw (Clarence moving in) as a
possible positive influence. It was good for everybody concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with both boys at Tech, he and Carolyn are not forced to
choose between attending games in different cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both boys have accomplished more than I ever expected,'' Gary
said. ``So everything they do from now is lagniappe, as we say down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the bayou, where seeing is believing.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvey Houtkin fervently believes that securities regulators are
out to get him. But he has no doubt that he will go down in history
as a man who made Wall Street a better place for the small
investor.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from his volatile relationship with regulators, Houtkin,
the self-proclaimed father of electronic stock trading, is right
that regulators are on his trail. But while he may well be
remembered for his role in changing the way Americans invest, it is
not at all clear that it has been for the good.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin (HOWT-kin) is chief executive of All-Tech Investment
Group, one of the nation's largest day-trading firms. And he says
that his company, which provides computerized stock market access
to individuals, enables anyone with a willingness to learn, and
$25,000 to open an account, to make a living trading stocks.
Houtkin, 50, says that All-Tech and companies like it are opening a
world of trading opportunities that had been closed to all but
professionals _ that they have democratized the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But especially since a day trader killed nine people in Atlanta
in July _ five of them at an All-Tech office _ Houtkin's operation
has come under intense regulatory scrutiny. And Tuesday, the family
of one shooting victim sued All-Tech, accusing it of negligence in
failing to supervise and recognize that Mark Barton, the man who
went on the killing spree, was a volatile person not suited to the
high-pressure business of stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin, who would not comment on the lawsuit, is now complying
with a subpoena from Georgia securities regulators relating to
Barton's trading patterns and account holdings. Regulators there
want to know if All-Tech encouraged its customers to go to friends
and family to raise money to trade with, making the traders subject
to regulation as investment advisers. Regulators will probably want
to question Houtkin himself.
</P>
<P>
   The trader has been in the hot seat before, many times. A close
look at his background shows a man driven by almost religious zeal
to storm the ramparts of an elitist Wall Street and the regulatory
machinery that he says protects it at the expense of the little
guy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Houtkin, a heavy-set, brown-haired man of medium height, is
no starry-eyed visionary; his history also reveals a canny mind,
ever ready to seize money-making opportunities, from bartering
penny stocks for goods and services to capitalizing on rules
changes that he himself helped bring about.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Ira Houtkin was born in Brooklyn and, until he was 23,
lived with his parents in a low-income housing project in the
Sheepshead Bay section. His father was a maker and fitter of
artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin attended public schools, including the Brooklyn
Technical High School, a school for gifted students, and then
enrolled at City College planning to study dentistry. But in 1967
he says he got an afternoon job as an assistant to a well-known
Wall Street speculator (whom he will not name). Fascinated by the
money he saw his boss making, Houtkin switched to business school.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After earning an M.B.A. from the City University of New York,
Houtkin went to Wall Street in 1973 to try his hand at trading. He
bounced from firm to firm. ``You don't earn where you learn on Wall
Street,'' he explained. ``You can't make a lot of money as a
trainee.'' His first job paid him $7,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a brutal bear market, Houtkin did well trading
shares of obscure and unknown companies, according to people who
worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spira, an investment banker at Chapman Spira &AMP; Carson,
worked with Houtkin in the 1970s. ``Harvey was a nice kid, very
bright,'' he said. ``He always had his own ideas. He was always
ahead of the pack. He always looks for the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spira recalled that during one period, Houtkin was buying stocks
that were very cheap, then bartering those shares for merchandise
from the companies. ``He bought stock in a film-developing
company,'' Spira said. ``He must have bought it for pennies. Then
he called them up and said, `I'll turn in X number of shares, and
in return you'll develop my film.' He had such a fertile mind.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the mid- to late 1970s, Houtkin worked briefly for Carl Icahn
and Asher Edelman, two men who later became famous as corporate
raiders. In 1979, he raised some money and started his own firm,
called Domestic Arbitrage Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, all went well, as the firm grew to six offices and
made markets in 500 NASDAQ stocks. But when the stock market
plunged in October 1987, the firm was left on the hook for the
losses of a customer who had traded with borrowed money. The losses
were so big that when Domestic Arbitrage faced the need to cover
them, it had to close its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin, most of whose assets were in the firm, said this was
when he realized how elitist Wall Street was. Though the regulators
eased the rules a bit and helped big firms avoid collapse after the
crash, he said, ``We were one of the firms allowed to flounder and
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   At a brokerage firm that his brother-in-law had set up after the
crash, Houtkin began trading NASDAQ Stocks, using a three-year-old
electronic trading system that was created by NASDAQ to insure that
customers could get their orders executed at the promised price.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, few used the system _ called the Small Order
Execution System, or SOES _ but Houtkin saw it as a way to profit
by using the split-second capacity of the system to buy stocks from
market makers who failed to update their quotes immediately as
stock prices changed.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin prospered. But he soon ran afoul of regulators, who had
designed it only for the benefit of individuals working through a
broker. Since Houtkin was benefiting as a professional, the
National Association of Securities Dealers barred him from using
the system for six months. Thus began a running feud with
regulators that continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found anything to close us down,'' Houtkin recalled.
``When the NASD wants to charge you with something, they can.
During that suspension was the incubation period for my total
contempt for these people.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1990, state regulators in New Jersey denied an application by
his firm, then called Domestic Securities Inc., to register itself
for business there on the grounds that Houtkin was an undisclosed
principal of the firm and an unregistered broker in New Jersey.
Domestic Securities agreed not to reapply for three years and paid
$50,000 to reimburse the state for its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite his regulatory run-ins, Houtkin was making progress on
two fronts in the early 1990s. One was helping to bring the
misdeeds of big NASDAQ dealer firms, like their conspiracy to
inflate the costs of trading, to the attention of the Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Houtkin was building his firm _ which had been
now been renamed as All-Tech _ into an electronic trading house for
individual investors. He became an evangelist for electronic
trading, crisscrossing the country leading seminars on trading
techniques and writing two investing books. The first, ``The SOES
Bandits' Guide: Day Trading in the 21st Century,'' was
self-published, and a second, ``Secrets of the SOES Bandit,'' was
put out by McGraw-Hill.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors and regulators concluded their investigation of
NASDAQ in 1996, they found that major dealers had rigged prices for
years. One result was new rules for the way investors' orders to
buy and sell NASDAQ stocks were handled, a rule change that
encouraged entrepreneurs to set up electronic trading systems for
NASDAQ stocks. This change ushered in the day-trading phenomenon,
in which retirees, recent college graduates and others sit before
computer screens in brokerage offices buying and selling thousands
of shares, hoping to capitalize on the small price movements of
stocks during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin's firm was one of the first to capitalize on the change.
Now All-Tech has 25 offices around the country and about 3,000
day-trading customers. Just last week, Houtkin conducted seminars
in Portland, Ore., and Seattle for people interested in becoming
day traders. In Seattle, more than 100 people attended, said one
person who was there.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk about being an advocate for individual
investors, Houtkin makes a great deal of money. According to
financial statements filed with the SEC when All-Tech sought
unsuccessfully to become a public company, Houtkin had a salary of
$919,231 last year. His brother-in-law Mark Shefts, All-Tech's
president and the husband of Houtkin's sister, had a $943,363
salary. Each also got a $100,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The commissions that Houtkin charges his customers _ $25 a trade
_ are high compared with those at other large firms, which
typically charge $7 to $15 per 1,000-share trade.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin also makes money as owner of a private company that
conducts the day-trading courses that 85 percent of All-Tech's
customers take. These courses typically run for a month and cost
$5,000, but this fee can later be gradually applied toward
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe I'm wearing a white hat, that I'm doing
what's in the best interests of the general public,'' Houtkin said.
``Now, can I capitalize on that? Sure. If I could develop the cure
for cancer, shouldn't I have the right to make money on it?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that Houtkin may underplay the risks associated
with day trading, luring in people who cannot afford to lose the
money that regulators say they almost certainly will. Another
concern is that his and other day-trading firms allow loans among
customers, a practice that may encourage people to trade more often
than they should.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Massachusetts regulators brought a complaint against
All-Tech, saying that it had used deceptive marketing to promote
day trading and engaged in other violations of securities laws,
like commingling customer funds and forging customers' signatures.
Houtkin attributed the infractions to ``a rogue broker,'' but
All-Tech agreed to close its operation in Massachusetts and not
reopen shop there for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my people are outraged that certain regulators are
trying to put a bad face on day trading,'' Houtkin said. ``My
people choose to trade. They are adults. They are not doing
anything wrong. Why assume that trading actively is
irresponsible?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how many of his customers make money trading, Houtkin
demurs. Still, there is a breathless quality to the promotion of
day trading on his firm's Web site. To the question ``Do I have to
know anything about the stock market?'' the answer is: ``NO! As a
matter of fact, in many instances, the less you know means the less
baggage you have to discard when learning the new trading
techniques that are taught by All-Tech's affiliate, All-Tech
Training Group Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   And can money be lost day trading? The site's answer is this:
``If you are disciplined in following the techniques you will be
taught, losses can and should be kept to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey's a salesman, and a good one,'' said Marc Beauchamp,
spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators
Association in Washington. ``But a skeptical consumer would ask,
`If he's found the fountain of wealth, why is he sharing it with
tens of thousands of total strangers in hotel ballrooms across the
land?'''
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin says his business is booming and revenue will hit $30
million this year. The number is not verifiable, but in 1998, the
growth in All-Tech's business was slowing, according to its
financial statements. Commissions were up only 8 percent that year,
versus a 44 percent rise in 1997. And the average commission per
transaction had fallen from $24.32 to $23.52.
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling, the firm registered a $392,558 loss in its
own trading account, a source of profits at All-Tech in both 1996
and 1997. The loss may indicate just how hard it is even for a
professional to make money in day trading.
</P>
<P>
   But Houtkin remains day trading's most vocal cheerleader. ``I
think I'm making a contribution to the financial markets that's
worth more than making another million dollars,'' he said. ``The
day it becomes too difficult or it becomes enough, I'll leave
then.''

 &HT;    Obnoxious fans spoil the moment
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was all about entertainment and drama Sunday at
Medinah Country Club. Nothing else. It was about Tiger Woods and
Sergio Garcia, who with their ages combined aren't as old as Jay
Haas, lunging and parrying for the world to savor in the final
major championship of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it's the kind of stuff that will push golf more into
the mainstream. The sport now has two stars that can go by their
first names only _ and one of them is not David. The last time
something like this happened, the names were Arnie and Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly as it was that Chicago fans would heckle Tiger Woods, Mike
Weir and Colin Montgomerie during the final round of the PGA
Championship, the blame can be placed on football-mentality golf
followers who were over the Bud Light limit. Woods told reporters
after his post-victory news conference, ``It was nothing racial.''
</P>
<P>
   That Sergiomania could pass Tigermania on a particular day
really should not surprise anyone. This was the beginning, the
first time Europe's teen superstar went head to head with
America's. It wasn't anti-Woods. It became a celebration of
Garcia's newly spotlighted talent and his first contention in a
major.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how rude Chicago fans would have been had Duval been the
opponent. Ripped in the media all week for his Ryder Cup
compensation stance, Duval might have seen his Oakleys fog up under
the jeering.
</P>
<P>
   How powerful was Garcia's presence Sunday? It's not every day
that the U.S. Ryder Cup captain, at his team-selection news
conference, gets more excited about a European player than about
one of his own. Ben Crenshaw gushed over Garcia, calling him
``absolutely electrifying and captivating . . . magic . . .
charismatic . . . graceful.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the message Garcia sent to Woods on the 13th tee, it was
not a taunt. Call it a don't-forget-about-me gesture from Garcia as
he appeared to point back at Woods after his birdie putt. It was
pivotal, but playful, the same thing that happened on the practice
range hours earlier. After a mammoth drive, Garcia glanced at
Woods, hoping his friend had been looking.
</P>
<P>
   The real shame on Sunday was fan behavior. A barrage of
``you-da-man's'' at golf tournaments has become annoying but
harmless. But the Medinah crowd was uglier than that, and it
continues a problem that has to concern all of golf's governing
bodies five weeks before the Ryder Cup matches in Boston. After an
embarrassing ``War at the Shore'' in 1991 at Kiawah Island, S.C.,
nobody wants the local fans to be Boston Stranglers.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem here is alcohol. One result of the golf boom
has been the changing demeanor of the crowd, and overconsumption of
alcohol has caused some of the new fans to yell things they might
normally limit to living rooms or bars. While most remain
well-mannered and glare at those who act as if they're at Giants
Stadium, the problem is getting worse. Woods often refers to fans
that have had ``a few too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf needs to get a handle on the problem now.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: If Woods and Garcia happen to be paired
against each other at the Ryder Cup, the show will be a ratings
fantasy. And while fewer people in Boston will be rooting for El
Nino than were Sunday, it would be a real shame if words from
outside the ropes drew bigger headlines than the play inside them.

BUSH, IRRITATED BY QUESTION, WON'T DISCUSS DRUG RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Fresh from his victory in the Republican presidential
straw poll in Iowa, Gov. George W. Bush held what was supposed to
be a routine news conference in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday to
introduce his state education commissioner. He took a handful of
questions on state issues until a reporter began to ask him about
persistent rumors that he had once used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   And then Bush got agitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happens, somebody floats a rumor and it causes
you to ask a question,'' Bush said, interrupting the questioner in
a rising voice, a tape recording of the news conference and a
transcript provided by Bush's office showed. ``And that's the game
in American politics and I refuse to play it. That is a game and
you just fell for the trap and I refuse to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to answer if he thought such rumors were ``being
planted,'' Bush said: ``Do I think they are being planted? I know
they are being planted and they are ridiculous and they're absurd
and the people of America are sick and tired of this kind of
politics and I am not participating.''
</P>
<P>
   If the exchange was surprisingly heated, Bush's response was not
unexpected. Since he defeated incumbent Democrat Ann Richards in
the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election, Bush has walked a fine line
as to which personal questions he will answer and which he will
not. In particular, he has refused to say whether he has ever used
illegal drugs, often offering the same wry reply: ``When I was
young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the issue seems to have had little affect on Bush's
standing, even in a conservative, law-and-order state like Texas,
where he has pushed for tougher penalties against drug users.
</P>
<P>
   But as the early front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, Bush is finding that his stock response has not doused
the questions, unfounded or not, but has seemingly done the
opposite. Earlier this month, the Hearst Newspapers quoted Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, as challenging the news media
to check rumors of cocaine use by Bush, rumors thus far unsupported
by facts. Daschle, however, quickly denied issuing such a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the Christian conservative who finished fourth in
the Iowa straw poll on Saturday, criticized Bush's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be wrong for any possible Republican
presidential nominee to refuse to say clearly and distinctly that
they've not used drugs,'' Bauer has said. Earlier this month, The
New York Daily News asked 12 presidential hopefuls if they had ever
used cocaine and all of them said no, except Bush, who did not
reply to the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not going to go away,'' Rice University political
scientist Earl Black said. ``With the response he is coming up
with, the national media isn't buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, however, has the media or anyone else come up with anything
to substantiate the rumors. In May, The Wall Street Journal
dedicated an article to the proliferation of the rumors and the
absence of any proof.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a Bush campaign spokesman, Wednesday
characterized the issue as ``baseless allegations and ridiculous
rumors.'' But McClellan added: ``What he may or may not have done
in the past is not the question we should be asking. It is, `Has he
learned from his mistakes?' and the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his campaign staff have admitted that he made what they
have described as youthful mistakes. In several profiles, the
governor has admitted that he drank too much beer and bourbon until
swearing off alcohol on his 40th birthday. Although he has refused
to answer questions about drugs, Bush has said without equivocation
that he has remained faithful to his wife, Laura, throughout their
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important facts that people deserve to know about have to
do with how he has fulfilled his duties as father, husband,
governor and employer,'' McClellan said. ``These are the relevant
questions about how he will fulfill his responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But as governor, Bush has taken the lead on several anti-drug
efforts, consistent with his own law-and-order philosophy. In
November 1996, after receiving reports of increased drug use among
teen-agers, Bush said ``we must speak with one clear voice to warn
children and grown-ups of the dangers of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he signed a law that toughened penalties for people
arrested for selling or possessing less than one gram of cocaine.
Previously, state sentencing guidelines required that a judge give
mandatory probation in such cases, McClellan said. Under the change
signed by Bush, judges now are allowed to sentence such offenders
to time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush signed a law that increased the punishment for
anyone arrested for selling or possessing illegal drugs within
1,000 feet of a school or a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   In broad terms, Bush has been answering, or not answering,
allegations about illegal drug use in much the same way since he
was the Republican nominee for governor in 1994. That race pitted
Bush against Ms. Richards, herself a reformed alcoholic who also
had faced unsubstantiated allegations in the Democratic primary of
cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   Black, the political scientist, said that Ms. Richards
consistently dismissed the cocaine questions as irrelevant, a
precursor to the stance now taken by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the closest that Bush has come to answering the question
came in an interview published on May 3, 1994, in The Houston
Chronicle beneath the headline ``Drugs `irrelevant' to race, Bush
says.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had ever used illegal drugs, Bush replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. What's the relevance? How I
behaved as an irresponsible youth is irrelevant to this campaign.
It does not matter what I did, nor (what) Ann Richards did. What
matters is how I behave as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, Bush told Newsweek magazine that he had
declined to itemize his ``irresponsibility'' because he wanted to
set a proper example for teen-agers. ``The question is: Have you
learned from your behavior?'' Bush said in the interview. ``The
answer is yes. If I were you, I wouldn't tell your kids that you
smoked pot unless you want them to smoke pot. I don't want some kid
saying, `Well, Governor Bush tried it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush struck a similar chord a month earlier in a profile in The
New York Times Magazine. ``I'd be the first to admit that I did
irresponsible things when I was young and irresponsible,'' he said.
``I've assumed the mantle of being a governor and a father in a
responsible way, and the signal we ought to send to our children is
that in spite of what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have
learned some lessons. And the lesson ought to be, don't be using
drugs and alcohol. Learn the lessons from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, as the rumors have percolated into public
on Sunday morning talk shows, Bush has begun to frame his refusal
to answer as a stand against what he calls ``the politics of
personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the CNN political talk show ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP;
Shields,'' Bush said that such politics ``sends a signal to people
that politics is ugly, and therefore I don't want to participate.
And I understand that by not _ by refusing to play the Washington,
D.C., game of gossip _ people may draw certain conclusions about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bush added, ``it's time for some politician to stand up and
say enough is enough of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Black is not so certain. ``Maybe he gets some credit for drawing
a line about the private lives of politicians in their youth,'' he
said. ``But at the same time, if you're running for president of
the United States, you're going to get asked all kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   But McClellan, a Bush spokesman, repeated a variation of a line
that his boss often uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Americans want to know is will he uphold the dignity and
honor of the office,'' McClellan said. ``He will.''

 (ATTN: Eastern states)  
 FOOD LION TO ACQUIRE HANNAFORD, FORMING 6th-LARGEST SUPERMARKET(bl) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal that continues the rapid consolidation of the grocery
business, Food Lion Inc. said Wednesday that it would acquire
Hannaford Brothers Inc. for $3.3 billion, forming the sixth-largest
supermarket chain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition gives Food Lion, which is strong in the
Southeast, a presence in the Northeast and enables the chain to
gain ground on Kroger, Safeway, Royal Ahold and other large
competitors that have grown by snapping up rivals.
</P>
<P>
   With the Hannaford acquisition, Food Lion will have more than
1,400 stores throughout the eastern United States from Maine to
Florida, with revenue of about $13.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket operators have been consolidating chains in recent
years to fend off price clubs and discount stores like Wal-Mart
that are increasingly adding grocery aisles to their general
merchandise stores. By combining with other chains, grocers are
trying to cut costs through synergies, expand geographically to
spread marketing and advertising costs over a larger store base and
use their enhanced size to force better prices from manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the more midsized regional companies may have felt
like they could become disadvantaged by their size relative to
these giants,'' said Sally Wallick, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the transaction, Food Lion, which is controlled
by Delhaize Freres-Le Lion SA of Belgium, will pay $79 a share in
cash and stock for the 152-store Hannaford chain and will assume
$300 million in debt. The acquisition, in which Food Lion has
agreed to pay a 24 percent premium based on Hannaford's closing
price Wednesday, will dilute Food Lion's earnings by 20 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion said, however, that it expected to generate savings
from the acquisition of $40 million in the first year and about $75
million a year by the third year. The deal was approved by both
companies' boards and is subject to regulatory and Hannaford
shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion investors were not enthusiastic about the deal,
largely because of the premium and likely earnings dilution,
analysts said. The company's shares fell $2.53125 Wednesday, or 23
percent, to $8.46875. Hannaford Brothers shareholders, meanwhile,
saw their shares rise Wednesday by $9.0625, or 14 percent, to
$72.75
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion, which is based in Salisbury, N.C., has annual revenue
of $10.2 billion. It operates 1,258 stores in the Middle Atlantic
and Southeastern states from Pennsylvania to Florida under the
brand names Food Lion, Kash 'n' Karry and Save 'n' Pack. Hannaford,
which is based in Scarborough, Maine, has annual revenue of $3.3
billion. It operates 152 stores in New England, New York and the
Southeast under the brand names Hannaford and Shop n Save.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition of Hannaford into the Delhaize America family
of food retailers will provide an exceptional growth opportunity
for both organizations,'' said Food Lion president and chief
executive Bill McCanless. ``Together we are very complementary
companies, both operationally and geographically.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal, which will not significantly affect the
New York area, unites two chains with strong management. It also
combines Hannaford's expertise in perishable foods and overall
inventory management with Food Lion's marketing focus and
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   Hannaford president and chief executive Hugh Farrington called
Food Lion, ``an excellent strategic growth partner in an industry
which continues to consolidate.'' He will run Hannaford for Food
Lion.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some other recent acquisitions include Royal Ahold NV's purchase
of Pathmark Stores Inc. for $250 million and the assumption of $2.5
billion in debt, and Kroger Co.'s purchase of Fred Meyer Inc. for
$8 million in stock and the assumption of $4.8 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expected the flurry of merger activity to
continue as smaller, regional grocers seek deals that will increase
their size. For Food Lion, ``I think they felt that eventually they
would have a very concentrated industry,'' said Meredith Adler, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``And the Belgium parent wanted to be
a player.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PRESIDENTS SHOULD STAY HOME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, my goodness, they are at it again. People mooching for
money, people begging for support. I am referring to the
importunate politicians who flocked to Iowa last weekend in the
first hideous threat of yet another presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From the isolated corner of the world known as the press box, I
would not dare raise questions of foreign policy or taxes. However,
I would submit one modest question to all those who foist
themselves upon us as candidates:
</P>
<P>
   ``If elected, will you swear to never go near a sports event
during your entire term of office?''
</P>
<P>
   I ask this from a career of watching self-indulgent presidents
and vice presidents barge into Final Fours or Super Bowls, thereby
inconveniencing thousands of fans.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of empathy is a good litmus test for our national
leader. We want a president who feels our pain without causing more
of it. We want a president who will not inflict his entourage on
unsuspecting fans who never invited him in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The events organizers do not have the right to invite a
president to the big game. This is a democracy. Put it to a vote.
How many people want the president dropping in on their World
Series game? Now there is a landslide vote.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent horror show was the final of the Women's World
Cup on July 10, when thousands of fans missed the first half. (All
right, so nobody scored, but that's hardly the point in soccer, is
it?)
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms and soccer daughters who had paid hundreds of
dollars for tickets were stopped by police on the narrow roads to
the Rose Bowl. Reporters were blocked from the elevator bank by
Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   You learn very quickly not to argue with these blokes, who are
usually in a bad mood because the president is ignoring their
security and logistical advice. Who do they take it out on? You.
Maine Us.
</P>
<P>
   It would make more sense for the president to arrive early and
let traffic flow, but that's not how it works. At the Rose Bowl, we
heard Clinton was running late because he was playing golf, to
which we said, ``Oh, well, as long as it's job-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Do presidents know the misery they are inflicting? As they used
to say in Russia, ``If only the czar knew.'' If the czar wanted to
know, the czar would know.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents wreak havoc by coming to town, any town. A friend of
mine tells of missing the key opening number in ``Chicago'' because
the Clintons decided to take daughter Chelsea to a Broadway musical
for her birthday. Hundreds of New Yorkers and tourists stood out in
the rain while the show started without them. Tough, said the
Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a partisan issue, by the way. My toes still tingle
from near frostbite from an encounter with Vice President Bush in
1982 when the National Football League, in all its wisdom, held a
Super Bowl in the frozen tundra of Pontiac, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service had advocated an early arrival at the
Silverdome, but the vice president had a fund-raiser in Detroit, so
he barreled in near game time, forcing buses to disgorge fans and
reporters, who climbed up icy hillsides just to get off the
Interstate. Charming.
</P>
<P>
   These rude bipartisan disruptions could turn me into a one-issue
voter. I just want to hear that Bush, Gore, Dole, Bradley,
whomever, will show a little self-restraint and stay out of our
face for the entire term.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the latest George Bush used to run the Texas
baseball team, and Bill Bradley played for the Knicks, but if
either becomes president, he needs to acknowledge that his life has
changed. The next president should get a high-definition screen the
size of the Oval Office wall, and just stay home.
</P>
<P>
   I would be very happy if all candidates would lay off sports,
unless they can demonstrate a decade or three of legitimate
loyalty. Mayor Giuliani, whatever else one thinks of him, has
earned the right to wear a Yankee cap. He loves that team. He does
not have to try to be even-handed and say he likes the Mets, too.
Mets fans can respect a man who loves his team (even if it is the
haughty, arrogant, carpetbagger-property Yankees, as they might
fulminate in Flushing).
</P>
<P>
   As for other candidates, wearing the ball cap of somebody else's
team in somebody else's state could be the 2000 version of Michael
Dukakis' Snoopy helmet in the tank. Warning to all politicians: the
people can spot a phony a mile away. And on the day of a big game?
Preferably 100 miles away.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: STEALING BOSNIA'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   International donors should be angered to learn that politicians
from all three of Bosnia's main ethnic groups have stolen as much
$1 billion of the $5 billion in international aid given to the
country since 1995. The unemployed and impoverished people of
Bosnia should be furious. By diverting funds intended to rebuild
homes and roads and to create jobs, the Serbian, Croatian and
Muslim nationalist parties that pushed Bosnia into ethnic warfare
are blighting its hopes for an economically viable peace.
</P>
<P>
   As Chris Hedges reported in The Times this week, antifraud
investigators working for international relief officials in Bosnia
found that local mayors funneled relief money into their own
pockets and those of their relatives and political supporters. One
city, Tuzla, paid to have its newly rebuilt schools repainted four
times last year, at above market prices. Another, Sanski Most, used
municipal funds to build a race track and diverted farm relief
money to the mayor's brother to start a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption has thwarted efforts to revive Bosnia's shattered
economy. Demands for bribes have kept companies like McDonald's out
of Bosnia. Others that did invest have been driven out in
frustration. Volkswagen, which operates an assembly plant near
Sarajevo, is considering leaving over broken government promises.
Bosnian banks have given aid money to fraudulent businesses. Nearly
four years after the war, unemployment remains around 35 percent
and Bosnia is still dependent on foreign assistance. That outside
help will soon dry up unless corruption is brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   International relief officials must share blame for Bosnia's aid
debacle. Corruption could have been reduced if they had heeded
private groups with experience in the Balkans and Eastern Europe
and favored smaller projects that bypassed the state-run companies
and banks Bosnia inherited from Communist Yugoslavia. These
businesses were political fiefs and sources of patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, a shift to smaller projects would allow better
monitoring and foster a new entrepreneurial class. Similar lessons
need to be applied in Kosovo, where the Kosovo Liberation Army must
be prevented from seizing control of local businesses and municipal
governments. The West's effort to end ethnic slaughter in the
Balkans will fail if reconstruction programs there are defeated by
corruption.

EMBARRASSED MASSPORT CHIEF RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts Port Authority Director Peter Blute was
forced to resign Wednesday, after cruising Boston Harbor on a
taxpayer-funded yacht, drinking alcohol with political operatives
and scantily clad women, then lying to cover up the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A ``furious'' Governor Paul Cellucci demanded Blute step down,
after photographs were published in The Boston Herald of Blute
partying with the group, which included an unidentified young woman
who bared her breasts to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Blute said in his letter of resignation that he had made ``an
error in judegement,'' but denied he was fired. Massport's chief
legal counsel, Scott L. Kafker, was appointed interim director.
</P>
<P>
   The events come at a sensitive time for the administration,
which is trying to win approval for expansion of a runway at Logan
International Airport in the face of intense community opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift told reporters she and Cellucci
were ``outraged'' at Blute's ``incredibly poor judgment.'' She
praised Blute for his 2 1/2 years of service at Massport, but said
the incident was too serious for him to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilizing state resources for personal use is not
acceptable,'' said Swift, who had worked for Blute at Massport
before being tapped by Cellucci to run for lieutenant governor last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Blute, a former congressman, said Wednesday he had arranged for
Massport to hire the 40-foot cabin cruiser Nauticus, but expected
the agency would be reimbursed for the rental by the ``private
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the boat _ where beer and champagne flowed freely _ were
Alexander ``Sandy'' Tennant, a politically-wired GOP operative who
has represented private businesses before Massport; and David
McCool, a Massport lobbying consultant, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, on vacation in Florida, released a statement, saying
Blute had ``tarnished the reputation of Massport'' and had ``acted
inappropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of actions will not be tolerated in our
adminstration,'' Cellucci said. Blute was appointed Massport
director by former Governor William F. Weld after losing his
congressional seat in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said she and the governor will sever all ties with Tennant
and McCool.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant, a controversial figure known for his heavy socializing
and swaggering professional style, had served as Cellucci's
campaign finance chairman between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has helped raise money and used his contacts with
Cellucci to promote his lobbying business. Cellucci has tried to
officially distance himself from Tennant, but likes him personally.
In November, for example, when the New England Patriots announced
they plan to move to Connecticut, Cellucci was enjoying blues music
with Tennant in New Orleans' French quarter.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago Tennant inquired of MassPort's development
office about the board's process for selecting a developer for 25
acres of East Boston waterfront land. Tennant said he was asking on
behalf of Arthur Winn, owner of the Regal Bostonian Hotel. Winn
could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blute said he and Tennant -- with whom he has had a personal
relationship for 15 years -- had arranged for Massport to pay the
up-front rent for the Nautica for the four-hour cruise around the
harbor. Blute said he and Tennant had planned the cruise some
months ago and that he took a a vacation day from work.
</P>
<P>
   But there were conflicting accounts over how the arrangements
for the boat rental were made and who was to pay the cost.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, just after the cruise ended, Blute told the
Globe that Massport had not paid for the boat rental and that
Maureen Stemberg, a Charlestown woman he said is involved in cancer
charity work, was paying for the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Blute said Stemberg, the former wife of Staples mogul Thomas
Stemberg, was on the cruise -- and paying for it -- to discuss
cancer charity events. Tennant told the Globe the same story when
explaining why Stemberg -- who has cancer -- was paying for the
cruise. Massport allocates a small portion of its revenues to local
charities.
</P>
<P>
   But Stemberg knew nothing of the cruise until, sitting at a
restaurant on the waterfront in Charlestown Tuesday afternoon, she
was invited aboard for the boat's final leg to its slip at
Commercial Wharf, an associate of hers told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Stemberg and the associate, Bob Gersten, were eating at the
Tavern on the Water restaurant at the Charlestown dock when Tennant
came up to them. The Tennant party had taken a break from the
cruise at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gertsen said Stemberg did not initially want to
go aboard the boat, but when she was introduced to a woman in
Tennant's party who said she did fundraising for cancer, she
decided to go.
</P>
<P>
   That woman, sources said, later raised her shirt to defiantly
expose her breasts to a Herald photographer when the yacht docked
at Commerical Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something (cancer research and fund-raising) Maureen's
very passionate about,'' Gertsen said. ``Maureen was not on that
boat for more than 20 minutes and was a guest of Sandy Tennant.''
</P>
<P>
   Stemberg herself was not available for comment Wednesday. ``We
just thought it would be a little breeze on the ocean,'' said
Gertsen, adding: ``She is very afraid about all of this and fears
leaving the house right now due to reporters already attempting to
enter her building.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before Blute resigned, agency spokesman Jeremy Crockford
said Stemberg had reimbursed the authority $832 for the rent of the
yacht earlier that morning.
</P>
<P>
   But late Wednesday a Massport spokesman acknowledged that Blute
had written a check himself to pay back the authority for the
expense.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Blute, who serves at the pleasure of
the Cellucci-appointed Massport board, decided to resign because he
saw the ``handwriting on the wall'' following the publication of
the photos and the healdine that read: ``Booze Cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it is in the best interest of everyone that we
clear the air,'' Blute said in a brief interview with the Globe.
``I should have not have been on that boat. It was bad judgement.''
</P>
<P>
   Blute said he had sent an apology to all employees at Massport
for the embarrassment he had caused the agency. He said he did not
want to talk about the conflicting accounts of Stemberg's role and
the rental of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Though personally liked by Cellucci, Blute was occasionally at
odds with the governor's inner circle. Some questioned his loyalty
to Cellucci, because Blute had been friendly with Treasurer Joseph
Malone, Cellucci's rival in the Republican gubernatorial primary
last year. Blute's wife Robbie had been listed as a Malone
supporter on a fundraising invitation last year.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said that, with the Massport board's approval, the
administration wants Kafker to serve on an acting basis until the
governor and the board choose a permanent successor.
</P>
<P>
   Kafker has been chief legal counsel at Massport since 1993, and
was previously deputy legal counsel to former governor William F.
Weld. Sources said that Kafker is not a candidate for the job on a
permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to keep keep the place on track and that is what I
intend to do, going full speed ahead,'' Kafker said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job one is getting people focused on their work, moving past
today's event,'' said Kafker. ``We have a lot to do, modernizing
the airport, moving forward with the airfield improvement project
(which includes a controversial commuter runway proposal) getting
the seaport district under control, doing South Boston development
in a way that is sensitive to the community, and see that the
Worcester Airport transition is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blute's sudden removal under a cloud of scandal could
have a serious impact on Cellucci's push to expand the runway.
Blute was the public face and lead spokesman for the politically
explosive plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Ellen Welch, an anti-runway activist in East Boston, said
the shake-up at Massport will slow down the runway process. `` He
was the team leader and did all the outfront public relations
efforts both with the business community and community groups,''
Welch said.

 &HT;    Auburn's demise exaggerated?
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Auburn was two points away from winning an SEC
championship in 1997. But a visitor who reads the newspapers and
listens to talk shows over here these days could come to the
conclusion the school was about to give up football.
</P>
<P>
   All but a handful of preseason publications have picked the
Tigers to finish dead last in the SEC West under first-year coach
Tommy Tuberville. Not only will Auburn finish last, go the
predictions, but they will look ugly doing it with an offense that
couldn't make a first down against tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville, playing the low-expectations game, has done nothing
to discourage the prophets of doom. He is candid about Auburn's
shortcomings, which are many. Thus, the perception grows that this
will be a disastrous year on the Plain.
</P>
<P>
   But will it? Yes, there were some gaps in recruiting toward the
end of the Terry Bowden regime, but is Auburn so devoid of talent
that the Tigers will be a total nonfactor in the SEC in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the concerns about Auburn's offense are valid. Neither
quarterback _ Gabe Gross or Ben Leard _ completed 50 percent of
their passes last season. The top two rushers from a year ago _
Demontray Carter and Michael Burks _ have left the program. The
receiving corps is thin, despite the reinstatement of Clifton
Robinson after his recent legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't mean that Auburn's offense will come to a
standstill against SEC-caliber defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have as may athletes as a Florida State, but we've
got guys who can play at this level,'' said Gross, a sophomore. ``A
lot of people have been knocking our offense but we're going to
fool them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross is locked in a quarterback battle with Leard, a junior
from Hartwell, and true freshman Allen Tillman. While Leard has
provided some competition, Tillman has been slowed by a sore arm.
Gross is expected to be named the starter next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gross will be the first to admit that he doesn't have the
offensive skills of a Quincy Carter, but offensive coordinator Noel
Mazzone won't be asking him to make Carter-like plays to win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our situation, the first thing the quarterback will have to
do is not lose the game,'' said Mazzone, who came to Auburn from
Ole Miss with Tuberville. ``We've got to put him in the right
situations and keep mistakes to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure. Auburn will improve its running game,
which was ranked 103 out of 112 Division I teams last fall. The
Tigers will do it with a veteran offensive line (four of five
starters return) and a tailback by committee. Senior Rusty Williams
will be given a shot as will fullback Heath Evans, scatback
Markeith Cooper, and true freshman Michael Owens. There is even
talk of using Robinson, a former high school running back, in
special situations.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was reinstated to the team last Saturday after pleading
guility to contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Robinson,
21, was charged with having sex with a 15-year-old girl. He pleaded
to a lesser charge and was given a one year's suspended sentence
and 200 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Clifton back is huge,'' said Gross. ``We're glad that
he has his legal troubles behind him. We need him on this team
because he can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson caught 42 passes for 672 yards last season. He is the
only returning wide receiver who has caught a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is an offense with a lot of different pieces,''
said Mazzone. ``We've just got to figure out how they fit
together.''
</P>
<P>
   This Auburn offense, above all else, must end one of its nasty
habits of a year ago when it kept making mistakes and putting the
defense in difficult situations. If it can control the ball and
keep errors down, the defense is good enough to win some games.
</P>
<P>
   Eight starters return on defense, including a front four that
will be one of the nation's best. Defensive end Marcus Washington
(6-4, 235) has been unblockable. Tackle Jimmy Brumbaugh (6-1, 285),
the ultimate warrior, is back after sitting out most of last season
with knee problems. Leonardo Carson (6-3, 280) moves from end to
tackle, while Quinton Reese (6-5, 247) will handle the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a better defensive front in the country, I'd hate
to see it,'' said Gross. ``Going against those guys in practice is
really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever optimism that has been generated by Tuberville's
arrival has to be tempered by a daunting schedule. While the Tigers
did buy their way out of a game with Florida State, they must still
play the other five members of the Western Division plus Tennessee,
Florida, and Georgia from the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reality check, right there,'' said Tuberville. ``I
think we've got a chance but I'm trying to be realistic with
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the teams we play you can't beat with smoke and
mirrors.''

 &HT;    Tiger Woods: By the numbers
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   34: Number of consecutive cuts made, which leads the PGA Tour.
Chris Perry is next with 19.
</P>
<P>
   8: Number of consecutive times he has held or shared the 54-hole
lead in a tournament and gone on to win.
</P>
<P>
   12: Top-10 performances this year, out of 16 events, which also
leads the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   68.59: Scoring average in '99, which is, not surprisingly, also
No. 1, by .38 stroke over David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Steve Elkington for being concerned enough about caddie Joe
``Gypsy'' Grillo to withdraw from the PGA Championship. Grillo
experienced chest pains before the first round and was rushed to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To PGA of America CEO Jim Awtrey, for telling reporters in a
Tuesday news conference that the players did not desire any form of
compensation, then telling CBS-TV a few days later that a plan
should be established by the end of the year to distribute money
from Ryder Cup revenues to players' charities.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Two of next year's three rotating major championship venues are
dripping with tradition. The U.S. Open goes to Pebble Beach in
June. The British Open will be played at the Old Course, St.
Andrews, in July.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spirit of the millenium, Y-2-Valhalla?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the answer is an easy one. The PGA of America owns
Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville and will use it as much as
possible. Valhalla also will host the PGA in 2004 and the Ryder Cup
in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The players view the Jack Nicklaus-designed Valhalla as a
sub-par venue for a major championship, but money talks. Host clubs
usually receive between $5 million and $8 million, and that's a
nice check for the PGA not to have to write.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been rumors that the dynamic Whistling Straits
Golf Club in Kohler, Wis., site of the 1999 National Club Pro
Championship, could replace Valhalla in 2004, PGA officials say the
schedule is firm. The PGA comes to Atlanta's Athletic Club in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club also will have its share of
national attention. It hosts the Tour Championship in 2000 and the
U.S. Amateur in 2001, eight days after the conclusion of the PGA.

 &HT;    Ryder full of intrigue
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Five weeks before the Battle of Brookline, otherwise
known as the 1999 Ryder Cup, these are the questions that should be
answered eventually:
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the U.S. team members persuade anyone they care more
about repaying the Europeans than paying themselves?
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Americans lose, will anybody believe their priorities
were misplaced?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will U.S. players, including Davis Love III and Tom Lehman,
who were embarrassed by the actions of a few, make certain that
what overshadowed PGA Championship week doesn't resurface at the
Country Club?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Tiger Woods, with his second major secured and his
confidence at a career high, be the dominant force he logically
should have been two years ago at Valderrama?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will captains Ben Crenshaw and Mark James be able to pair
Woods and Sergio Garcia in singles even though the pairings are
done through a blind draw?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the American players take more seriously their pre-Ryder
Cup week preparations at Brookline than they did two years ago at
Valderrama?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Boston's fans, who are known for their boisterous
opinions, remember how nasty the situation got at Kiawah Island,
S.C., in 1991?
</P>
<P>
   If one positive about the Ryder Cup emerged from Medinah, it was
Ben Crenshaw's image. If anyone doubted whether ``Gentle Ben''
could be forceful enough when the situation demanded it, they need
doubt no longer. Two firm Crenshaw moves provided the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The first came with a bang, as Crenshaw, a day after the meeting
on compensation, said that things expressed there from some players
``burned the hell out of me.'' The second authoritative move came
Monday, when Crenshaw pushed aside a close friendship with Fred
Couples and selected Steve Pate, who while less experienced, had
played in tournaments while Fred played with his children.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team should be a huge favorite. But that's not new.
While the European team has strength _ Colin Montgomerie, Lee
Westwood, Darren Clarke, Jose Maria Olazabal, Garcia and probable
captain's pick Jesper Parnevik _ it is not a Murderer's Row. The
past two competitions have demonstrated the difference between
appearance and reality. Two years ago, the trio of Woods, Davis
Love and Justin Leonard stumbled to a cumulative 1-9-3 record. Love
was 0-4-0. Woods lost in singles match to Costantino Rocca.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the American team will be immense. The United
States used to own the competition, but it has lost two in a row.
And the pressure increased sharply last week because of the
compensation controversy. While the players are promoting a plan to
provide money to their own charities, outsiders surmise that they
are hiding a desire to pocket profits.
</P>
<P>
   The need for a leader on the American team is paramount. It
could be Lehman, captain's pick or not, who pledged weeks ago, ``I
would pay to play in the Ryder Cup team.'' It could be Woods, whose
game provides an intimidation factor sorely missed in Spain. It
could be Payne Stewart, a two-time U.S. Open champion, who is
playing a course with U.S. Open demands.
</P>
<P>
   In the competition, the Woods-Garcia situation will dominate the
news. And while Crenshaw, the ultimate traditionalist, is the last
person who would accept a Woods-Garcia Sunday singles match to be
planned _ each captain independently submits 12 names in order _
you can bet TV will try to make it happen.

DRUG TESTS RAISE SUSPICIONS IN TRACK AND FIELD

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ The world track and field championships will
begin here in the heat on Saturday, and the thousands who will
watch and perspire in person and the millions who will watch on
television in cooler climes will soon have answers to these
questions:
</P>
<P>
   Will Marion Jones become the first woman to win four gold medals
in the same world championships? Will Maurice Greene become the
first man to sweep the 100 and 200 meters? Will anyone find a way
to catch Hicham el-Guerrouj in the 1,500?
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of yet another round of positive drug
tests, there is another, naggingly familiar question begging for a
response: How clean a sport is track and field?
</P>
<P>
   The issue is hardly new, and 11 years after Ben Johnson tested
positive for a steroid after winning the 100 meters at the Summer
Olympics in Seoul, it has again become inextricably linked with a
major event.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on performance-enhancing drugs intensified Wednesday
when another of the sport's biggest stars, the Jamaican sprinter
Merlene Ottey, withdrew from the championships after being informed
that a drug test she was administered in July showed traces of the
banned steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   The development is the latest setback to track and field's
credibility as it combats the widespread suspicions of rampant drug
use. Earlier this month, the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, the sport's governing body, suspended U.S. 100-meter
champion Dennis Mitchell for two years for testing positive for
testosterone in the spring of 1998. It also confirmed that former
Olympic 100-meter champion Linford Christie had tested positive for
nandrolone: one day before it was announced that former Olympic
high jump champion Javier Sotomayor had tested positive for cocaine
at the Pan-American Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough month to be a track and field athlete,
especially a sprinter,'' said Ato Boldon, the world 200-meter
champion who has come to Seville but will not compete because of a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more drug questions in the past month than probably
my entire career combined,'' he added. ``It means a lot to me how
we are perceived, and I don't think our public perception has ever
been this bad. We are at an all-time low, maybe close to where we
were in Korea in 1988.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Seoul Olympics that year that Johnson's stunning
100-meters victory was overturned after he tested positive for a
steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kennedy, long the top American 5,000 meter runner, said:
``Before these positive tests, I would have said track and field
was coming on. I think even in the United States it is slowly
making progress, very slowly, and the European crowds have been
excellent this year at almost all the meets. And then the drug
thing kills us. Because when that comes out, that's all the
emphasis is on, and it takes away from some great stories, some
great athletic and personal stories that have nothing to do with
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, who is 39, has never won an Olympic gold medal, but has
won five bronzes and two silvers, and she has won more medals (14)
than anyone in the world championships. As she announced her
withdrawal, she pledged to do her utmost to prove her innocence.
``I owe it to my family, my country, my beloved sport and all my
fans around the world to prove that this is a terrible mistake,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF confirmed that Ottey's initial ``A'' sample from a meet
in Lucerne, Switzerland on July 5 had turned up positive for
Nandrolone. The backup ``B'' sample is due to be analyzed in the
next few days at the IOC-accredited laboratory in Lausanne,
Switzerland. If it is also positive, Ottey faces a possible
two-year ban that would effectively end her career and erase her
hopes of competing in her sixth Olympics next year in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Christie, who was born in Jamaica but represents Britain, is
also protesting his innocence, and what makes his positive test
particularly surprising is that he is now semi-retired and no
longer takes part in major international competition. He tested
positive at a minor indoor meet in Dortmund, Germany in February.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ljungqvist, an IAAF vice president and head of its medical
committee, emphasized that it was too early to label Ottey's test
``positive'' because the B sample had yet to be evaluated. He also
indicated that he did not view stars testing positive in bunches as
a predominantly negative development for the sport. He said: ``I
think this is a clear message to athletes around the world: `Look
here. We are really acting. We are taking initiatives and closing
any gap there may have been between those who try to cheat in
different ways and those who try to combat it.' The old saying is
that athletes have sophisticated methods to escape detections and
use substances that cannot be detected. But if that were true, we
would not get these prominent athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is a tendency to put us in a negative light
from the media when we show up with a number of positive cases, and
that gives an unfortunate and unfairly bad image: unfair for the
simple reason that we are conducting serious anti-doping
activities,'' he added. ``We have a steadily improving system. We
are by far the federation with the highest number of tests of all
kinds. The easy way out would be to do no tests and receive no bad
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In June, when Greene crossed the finish line in Athens after
running the 100 and a world-record time of 9.78 seconds showed on
the clock, Boldon's reaction spoke volumes about what it is like to
be fast in this justifiably leery era. He was delighted that the
time was not 9.79 seconds: the time that Ben Johnson had run in
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the parallels,'' said Boldon, who shared his
delight with Greene as they decelerated. ``I'm that aware, and sure
enough, they rounded the time up to 9.79, and as a result, Maurice
had to answer a lot of questions: unfounded I think. But with the
Ben Johnson issue, obviously people feel like, `Who's to say we're
not being tricked again?'''
</P>
<P>
   To address such skepticism, Boldon, Greene and Jones and others
support the institution of blood testing in their sport, which
currently relies on urine testing only.
</P>
<P>
   Top British distance runner Paula Radcliffe, who will run the
5,000 in Seville, wore a red ribbon on her vest during the European
Cup in June to show her support. ``I am not going to name names,
but it must be obvious to anybody in the sport that some of the
improvements people have made are suspicious,'' she told British
reporters then. ``Blood tests are our only defense against
cheats.''
</P>
<P>
   UK Athletics, the governing body in Britain, intends to support
a research project in which British athletes will voluntarily
undergo blood tests and have the results of those tests published
as next year's Summer Olympics approach. Cycling and nordic skiing
already have introduced blood tests in an attempt to combat the use
of EPO, the synthetic hormone that artificially increases endurance
by augmenting the red blood cell count. EPO is currently
undetectable, but both sports have established limits on red blood
cell counts. If an athlete exceeds the limit before a race, he is
not allowed to start for medical reasons but is not subject to a
lengthy suspension.

<P>
   Blood tests have yet to be proven more effective than urine
tests in detecting steroids, although Ljungqvist said preliminary
research indicates blood tests could prove useful in isolating
human growth hormone, another currently undetectable
performance-enhancing drug. EPO could certainly benefit marathoners
and other distance runners greatly. But Ljungqvist believes the
IAAF, which conducted blood testing trials at major meets in 1993
and 1994 and found no significant evidence of illicit behavior,
would encounter legal problems if it attempted to implement a
program similar to cycling or skiing. He prefers to wait for a
definitive, foolproof test for EPO: a test which he said ``could
come shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should it require a blood sample, we would certainly proceed
with that,'' he said. &QL;

TEXAS LAWMAKER RECALLS BUSH'S COMMENTS ABOUT HOMOSEXUALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state's only openly gay legislator said
Wednesday that Gov. George W. Bush, in a remarkable nose-to-nose
encounter last spring, told him that he should not take personally
Bush's remarks about homosexuals on the presidential campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, whose district includes the
governor's mansion, recalled Bush approaching his desk on the House
floor in one of only two visits Bush made to the House while it was
in session earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put his hands on my shoulders and he pulled me in where
almost our noses were touching. It's almost an uncomfortable level
where he gets really close and personal, nose to nose,'' Maxey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he says to me, `I value you as a person and I value you as
a human being and I want you to know, Glen, that what I say
publicly about gay people doesn't pertain to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the story was false.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey, who said he recalled the encounter so vividly because it
was ``amazing,'' said he retorted that when ``you say a gay
person's not fit to be a parent ... that's real personal.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, Maxey said, came April 19 on the House floor just
after he says Bush begrudgingly congratulated him for expanding a
children's health insurance program, or CHIP, far beyond a more
modest plan the governor's office had backed.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush greeted lawmakers with friendly slaps on the back, he
made a point of navigating his way to Maxey's desk, Maxey said.
</P>
<P>
   He says Bush remarked on the children's health insurance issue
that ``you crammed it down our throat'' before drawing in close to
Maxey's face and addressing the issue of Maxey's homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most amazing thing for me as a gay person to hear
him say that,'' Maxey told the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan, however, insists that the greeting was short and
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He congratulated him on CHIPS. That was the extent of the
conversation. I'm baffled that if (Maxey) was offended four months
ago, he's just now bringing it up, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dawnna Dukes, D-Austin, sits behind Maxey in the House
chamber and said she did overhear the governor's remark about
cramming the health plan down his throat, but said she didn't hear
what was said in the rest of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not usually side with gay activists on legislation
that concerns them, although he has tempered his views by stating
support for the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy and by
chastising state GOP officials in 1998 who made insulting remarks
about a group of gay Republicans who wanted to have a booth at the
state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes gay adoptions, saying in March: ``I believe
children ought to be adopted in families with a woman and a man who
are married.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also opposes including sexual orientation, along with race
and gender, as categories in a hate crimes bill that could be
targeted for stiffer penalties. Bush did not support hate-crimes
legislation that died this year in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey says he shared the encounter with Bush with nearby
minority legislators immediately afterward. Maxey said many of the
minority legislators found it disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Until this session, Bush's stand on gay issues appeared tame
enough, Maxey said, noting that Bush had said he didn't believe in
discrimination after the state Republican Party barred the gay Log
Cabin Republicans from setting up a booth at the state convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to treat every person with respect and dignity, and
although I don't agree with the Log Cabin Republicans' agenda, like
gay marriage, I don't condemn the name-calling,'' Bush said in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gays and lesbians protested last spring when Bush backed the
bill to ban homosexuals from adopting or acting as foster parents
for children under the state's protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's actions in the past year have been a hard thing for us
to swallow,'' said Dianne Hardy Garcia, executive director of the
state Gay and Lesbian Lobby. ``Many of us believed that George Bush
was a decent man and that he was above this kind of anti-gay
prejudice. From what we know personally he has gay friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we now know about George Bush is he'll do whatever it
takes to get elected. If the means hurting his gay friends or
allies, he'll do it. He stopped a hate crime bill, and we've had 30
gay men killed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy Garcia added that it ``scares me'' if Bush is following
the advice of advisers on gay issues for political gain in his
presidential bid rather than out of personal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do whatever it takes to get elected, I
think George Bush will step on gay people in a minute's notice
because that's what he's told he needs to do. I think that shows a
lack of morality, a lack of conscience. It really frightens me that
someone like that would be leading our country.''

FEARING DEFLATION, CHINA ORDERS A BAN ON NEW FACTORIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a drastic move aimed at reversing a steady fall in
prices, Chinese officials announced Wednesday that they would ban
construction of any new factories that make a broad range of
ordinary consumer items, from refrigerators and air conditioners to
candy, apple juice and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   The ban also covers the construction of luxury hotels, apartment
and office buildings, and department stores, which have also
suffered sharp falls in prices for many months as the market has
become glutted. In some Chinese cities, these buildings sit empty
or barely used.
</P>
<P>
   By withholding approval for any new production lines, while
allowing existing output to continue, officials apparently hope
they can shackle China's deflation, a self-perpetuating spiral of
falling prices and falling demand that has become a serious new
economic threat in Asia's biggest country, where growth has started
to falter.
</P>
<P>
   China's economic troubles are compounding just as modest
revivals are happening elsewhere in Asia, where a severe financial
crisis flared two years ago and sent shudders through markets
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of consumer goods in China have fallen for 22 months in a
row. While that is good news for Chinese consumers, fewer and fewer
of them are buying. Instead deflation is causing many factory
stockpiles to overflow, and forcing producers to suspend their
output, even though most are required to keep paying the same
number of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation also is prompting price wars among many producers, a
new phenomenon for Chinese officials that they find unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers have resorted to malicious competition by slashing
prices drastically for survival,'' was how the official New China
News Agency put it Wednesday as it announced the ban, which begins
Sept. 1. How long the ban would last was not announced, and it was
unclear if the ban was aimed at industries that produce goods for
domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
   It also was unclear how effectively the ban will be enforced.
Although it applies to producers of consumers goods all over the
country, such central directives are often quietly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists expressed concern that the ban includes hidden
dangers that could actually worsen the deflation problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington who specializes in China, said the ban could aggravate
the situation by forcing cutbacks in construction jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could mean less employment and more deflation,'' he said.
``With fewer people working, demand will go down.''
</P>
<P>
   In many industries, state regulators have imposed minimum prices
to try to prevent producers from undercutting each other with price
slashing. Meantime, financial authorities have authorized several
interest rate reductions to spur consumption by lowering the cost
of borrowing. But the success of that effort has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Weak demand for consumer goods has grown out of a serious
deterioration in consumer confidence. Many ordinary consumers fear
that the economy will continue to weaken, and that it may lead to
job losses and a reduction of welfare benefits, including pensions.
So instead of spending their money they are saving it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese economists have gently begun recommending that
Beijing consider a devaluation of China's currency, the yuan. That
would theoretically help stem deflation by raising the cost of
imports and would stimulate the economy by raising foreign demand
for China's exports, which have been falling. But a devaluation
could have destabilizing effects in China and elsewhere in Asia by
unnerving foreign investors and raising the cost to China of
repaying foreign loans. It appears that the authorities remain
unwilling to devalue the yuan for the time being, at least until
they see if falling exports and prices can be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yuan is unlikely to be devalued this year and early next
year,'' Joe Lo, senior economist at Citibank in Hong Kong, told
Reuters. ``A devaluation can be an option if exports continue
performing poorly and the economy is not improving after exhausting
other measures.''
</P>
<P>
   China's trade surplus in the first half of 1999 reached $8
billion, down from $22.5 billion a year earlier. Exports in the
first half fell 4.6 percent while imports surged 16.6 percent. At
the same time, foreign direct investment declined 9.2 percent to
$18.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Government economists have said that if Beijing does decide to
devalue its currency, it is likely to orchestrate a gradual process
in several steps, unlike the last time it devalued in 1994, by 33
percent, in one step.
</P>
<P>
   For China's leaders, long afraid of inflation and the potential
social disruption it could cause, deflation is a new phenomenon
that few took seriously until recently. But it has continued for
much longer than anyone expected, and now threatens to seriously
undercut government projections that economic growth will reach 7
percent this year, compared with 7.8 per cent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``China doesn't need a cheaper currency,'' wrote Gilbert Choy,
head of China research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Securities
(Asia), in a recent report. ``Chinese exports continue to gain
market share in their major overseas markets. More important, the
growth of exports is roughly in sync with the recovery of China's
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Choy argues that because a substantial percentage of China's
exports involve processing of imported materials, even a
substantial devaluation is unlikely to strengthen exports by much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real solution is to have the central bank, the People's
Bank of China, print money,'' Choy wrote. ``The best way to give
the economy a boost is to inject a massive dosage of wealth effect,
changing the psychology of consumers to expect a rise in permanent
income.''
</P>
<P>
   Other economists recommend that Beijing continue to expand its
issuing of treasury bonds to finance the setting up of a social
safety net, including a nationwide social security system and a
national medical insurance plan.

NANDROLONE, AN OLD STEROID THAT LINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Czech Republic, Britain, Jamaica, Sweden, Calif.)  (Eds: See also RUN-TRACK-DRUGS) (DW) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nandrolone, the banned steroid detected in the urine samples of
Linford Christie and Merlene Ottey, is hardly considered to be on
the cutting edge of performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nandrolone is an old, old anabolic steroid,'' said Dr. C.
Harmon Brown, an American member of the IAAF medical committee, in
a telephone interview from his office in Foster City, California.
``It's been around for a long time, and it comes in different forms
and most of them are kind of long-acting so they tend to hang in
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Brown and many members of the track and field
community are surprised that athletes would choose to take the risk
of using Nandrolone, traditionally an oil-based, slow-releasing
steroid, instead of water-based steroids which are considerably
more difficult to detect with urine tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the thing that people would be using if
anything would be short-acting testosterone because it would clear
the system quickly,'' Brown said. ``I just don't see any rationale
for this. If you are a world-class athlete, someone can knock on
your door anytime, so it's foolish to take any of these things,
especially something that stays in the system for any length of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have tested positive for nandrolone in the last
two years are Czech tennis player Petr Korda; British sprinter Doug
Walker, the 1998 European 200 champion, and Cuban high jumper Juana
Rosario Arrendel, who won the gold medal in the women's event at
the Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ljungqvist, the IAAF's medical committee chairman, said
that he preferred to wait ``quite a while to make a statistical
evaluation'' about nandrolone's prevalence but said that
preliminary laboratory data from his native country Sweden and
other countries indicate that it is being found in ``increasing
amounts'' in urine samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be several explanations,'' he said. ``One, which I
cannot yet endorse, is that certain nutritional supplements may
have appeared on the market that would contain these things. And
you know with nutritional supplements of various kinds, you can
never be sure what they contain. We have steadily issued warnings
to the athletes about their use because you never know. And you
must remember, we have a liability rule that says athletes are
responsible for what goes in their bodies.''

EDITORIAL: FINISH THE JOB, STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr is no doubt tired of the public stage. But he
would be making a mistake to resign as independent counsel this
fall, before the completion of a final report on his five-year-old
investigation of President Clinton and his activities. The
independent counsel's duty is not only to oversee the report but to
get it done quickly and be around to defend its conclusions. If the
report is critical of Hillary Rodham Clinton, any delay might be
perceived as intending to interfere with her undeclared Senate
candidacy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   An article in The Times on Thursday says Starr has told a panel
of appellate judges that he intends to appoint a deputy to tie up
the loose ends of his investigation. Previous reports have
suggested that this job could continue into next year. That seems
far too long for an investigation that must have little left to do
beyond writing a final report.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments since Clinton was impeached by the House and
then acquitted by the Senate, Starr has expressed regret that some
Americans feel he has waged a personal vendetta against the
president, and he promised not to ``trash'' anyone in the final
report. He needs to stay on the job to make sure the report is
evenhanded and completed expeditiously so as not to intrude on next
year's political races. An early departure would inevitably
separate him from the drafting of the report and the timing of its
completion.
</P>
<P>
   An unsettling new question about Starr's investigation was
introduced Wednesday by one of the three judges overseeing the
independent counsel. The judge, Richard Cudahy, a Democratic
appointee, complained that his fellow judge, David Sentelle, a
Republican appointee, had held ``informal'' contacts with Starr
about the progress of the investigation and had rebuffed efforts by
the court to determine how much is left for Starr to investigate.
If even the appellate judges in charge of monitoring Starr cannot
measure his progress, the public will have little confidence that
the investigation is being brought to a prompt conclusion.

 &HT;    Smoltz keeps his mind on opponent, not pain
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ John Smoltz chooses to focus on the Rockies today and
quit worrying about all that ails him.
</P>
<P>
   The strained groin that forced him out of his Dodger Stadium
start in the fifth inning Saturday is not going to keep him from
making his 21st start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't wait for it to hurt, even though you know it's
probably going to,'' Smoltz said Wednesday. ``Now it doesn't hurt.
It's out of my worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who has used a lower arm angle in his delivery in his
last two starts, finally had gotten to where his elbow felt more
comfortable. But that doesn't mean he's comfortable with the new
style of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time out, it's going to be something different,'' said
Smoltz, looking for his first victory since June 18. ``The only
thing it does (for sure) is alleviate the pain. Now, I have to
learn how to do everything else. It's not like I'm super
comfortable.... I don't know how long I'm going to pitch like this,
but I'm more at ease when I go down to warm up for a game. Now, the
challenge is getting outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-quarters arm angle would seem ideal for Coors Field,
because it should produce more groundouts. But Smoltz isn't so
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw (Greg) Maddux give up a bunch of ground-ball hits,''
Smoltz said, referring to Monday night's game, when Maddux allowed
12 hits in the Braves' 14-6 victory. ``This place is this place.
I'm not going to fight the conditions. I don't care how _ I just
want to get a win, help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz is 1-2 at Coors Field with a 7.20 ERA, having allowed 16
earned runs in 20 innings. Today's start is his first in Denver
this season. He beat the Rockies at Turner Field on June 1 when he
pitched six shutout innings. It was his initial start after his
first stint on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Not driving them in
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stranded 11 runners in Tuesday night's 3-2 loss to
the Rockies and went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position. On
Wednesday, they stranded nine and were 1-for-12 with someone in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The team is hitting .262 with runners in scoring position for
the season, 11th in the National League. With two outs and runners
in scoring position, that number falls to .234, 15th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '95, we hit .255 as a team, so it had to be less than that
with runners in scoring position, and that's the year we won the
World Series,'' said Chipper Jones, who is hitting .283 with
runners in scoring position. ``It's all about if you get hot at the
right time and play good ball in September. We know we can play
with anybody in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Javy Lopez really hurts, because he was hitting .296
with runners in scoring position. Only Brian Jordan's .324 is
better on the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big swing of the bat by a guy in the middle of the lineup
could have won us the ball game (Tuesday) night,'' Chipper Jones
said. ``It's going to happen. You can't dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms hurt again
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league third baseman Wes Helms, who recently returned from
right shoulder surgery, is out for the year after separating his
left shoulder in a collison at first base Friday. Helms was
examined Wednesday by Braves team orthopedist Dr. Joe Chandler. For
now, no surgery is planned.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Helms had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff
in his right shoulder. He was supposed to be out for the season but
returned to the Greenville Braves, where he was hitting .301 with
26 RBIs in 30 games. Helms will miss his chance at a September
call-up to Atlanta. He played in seven games for the Braves last
September in his first appearance in the major leagues, hitting
.308 (4-for-13) with his first major-league home run.

METROPOLITAN LIFE AGREES TO SETTLE LAWSUITS ACCUSING COMPANY OF
FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the nation's
second-largest life insurer, agreed on Wednesday to pay hundreds of
millions of dollars to settle lawsuits accusing the company of
cheating customers through deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, would
be the latest in a series of multimillion-dollar settlements by
life insurers accused of fraud. Metropolitan Life valued the
proposed settlement, which is intended to cover seven million
current and former policyholders who bought insurance between 1982
and 1997, at $1.7 billion. But it will cost the company less
because of the way it is calculating the settlement, and because
costs like lawyers' fees and administrative expenses, which could
easily exceed $100 million, will also come out of that sum.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement plan, affected policyholders
can apply for cash payments or added payouts at the time of their
deaths or simply accept bigger death benefits based on a formula
that reflects their ages and the sizes of their policies. The value
is based on what it would cost consumers to buy the additional
coverage the company is giving them, not what it is costing the
company to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Foley, a spokesman for Metropolitan Life, said the
settlement proposal was intended to cover three federal
class-action lawsuits, which were consolidated four years ago, and
dozens of related actions. All the suits contend the company used
deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching the proposed settlement with lawyers representing
policyholders, the company has denied any wrongdoing, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn I. Weiss, a plaintiffs' lawyer in New York involved in
the class-action suits, said that some consumers, depending on the
size of their policies, could receive ``hundreds of thousands of
dollars'' in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Connolly, an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts,
which has been investigating Metropolitan Life's sales practices,
said that she had not had a chance to closely study the proposed
settlement but that she expected to do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of consumers who have lost considerable
money over the years because they bought these policies,'' Ms.
Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, claimants would have two main
ways to seek benefits. They could submit claims to an independent
adjuster who could award them cash, an increase in the death
benefits of their life insurance policies or some combination.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did not seek such a claim could get an increase in
their death benefit. That increase would range from 3 percent to 16
percent of the value of that benefit, with the increase decreasing
with the age of the policyholder, said Foley, the company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement proposal comes as Metropolitan Life, which is a
mutual insurer owned by its policyholders, prepares to convert to a
publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how much of the settlement will go to policyholders is
not clear. Weiss said that his firm and others involved in the case
had spent more than $45 million on the litigation. Those firms will
also seek additional fees, which in a case against the Prudential
Insurance Company of America amounted to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that the company had already bought reinsurance to
cover the cost of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Life proposal is the latest in a recent round
of class-action settlements by life insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Prudential said it would pay past and current
policyholders at least $410 million and up to $2 billion to settle
class-action suits. Weiss, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said that his
firm had sued 44 life insurers in recent years, including
Prudential, the State Farm Insurance Cos. and the American General
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Those cases, like the ones against Metropolitan Life, involved
allegations of misleading sales practices including ``churning,''
the practice of persuading customers to exchange older policies for
newer ones by falsely contending that the new policies were cheaper
or provided more coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, according to the suits, customers were also told
that because interest rates and dividends were high, their policies
would pay for themselves after seven or eight years. These were
known as vanishing premium policies. When interest rates eventually
fell, out-of-pocket costs increased. Millions of life insurance
customers have complained to regulators that their insurance agents
did not fully explain to them how their policies would perform.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Metropolitan Life also paid a $25 million civil
penalty to settle a federal inquiry of sales practices in Florida,
where it was investigated for marketing life insurance between 1989
and 1993 as savings and retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life said that it expected to mail information
about the settlement proposal to affected customers beginning next
week. A hearing on the proposed settlement has been scheduled for
Dec. 2 in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, where the class-action
litigation is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement provides a fair resolution to issues that have
been the subject of protracted litigation and that have affected
much of our industry,'' Robert H. Benmosche, the company's
chairman, said in a statement.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: BANKRUPTCY AMONG THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   It was just over three years ago that Planet Hollywood was a
very hot stock. The company sold shares to the public at $18 a
share and saw them leap to $32 the very first day they traded.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Demi Moore were among the celebrity
shareholders who took part in the festivities when the stock began
trading.
</P>
<P>
   There were no festivities Wednesday when the New York Stock
Exchange suspended Planet Hollywood shares from trading and said
they would be delisted. That move came a day after the company said
it would file for bankruptcy under a plan that will render the
shares virtually worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Hollywood, which operates restaurants under that name as
well as under the title Official All-Star Cafe, seemed like a great
concept back in 1996. ``We are up against all restaurants,'' said
Robert Earl, the company's founder, not long after the successful
offering. ``What sets us apart is our merchandising, our stars and
our themes.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants soon earned a reputation for poor food at
excessive prices, however, and it turned out that the opportunity
to dine in the vicinity of such memorabilia as Sylvester Stallone's
robe from ``Rocky'' or Judy Garland's dress from ``The Wizard of
Oz'' was not enough to persuade diners to return. Sales peaked in
1997 and have been falling since.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy plan calls for the chain to continue operating
under the ownership of creditors and investors _ including Earl's
family _ who are putting in $30 million in cash. Perhaps Earl, who
will remain as chief executive, can turn things around. But whether
or not he does, the star-struck public investors who loved the
stock in 1996 now have lost everything they invested.

SURVIVORS SAY MANY COLLAPSED BUILDINGS WERE POORLY BUILT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (See also TURKEY-QUAKE, TURKEY-SCENE.)

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ According to a neighbor who jumped out of bed
when the floor beneath him began to shake and sway, the building
across the street collapsed in 27 seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   His son, out on the balcony, yelled back to his father, ``It is
the mosque, the mosque.'' But when Umut Umutoglu went out into the
predawn darkness Tuesday, he saw through a cloud of dust that the
newly built mosque was intact, while a five-story apartment
building next door had been reduced to a pile of tangled metal and
concrete rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Avcilar, a new neighborhood on the western edge of this giant
sprawling city, suffered more from Tuesday's devastating earthquake
than any other part of Istanbul, most of which was shaken but
largely left intact. Here, several dozen buildings were destroyed,
some collapsing face forward onto the sidewalks, others tilting
like sinking ships onto neighboring walls.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction in Avcilar seemed selective, leaving behind an
odd checkerboard pattern of buildings that remain standing, next to
houses that were utterly wrecked by the wrath of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   According to local residents, the selection was not so random.
The difference between the buildings that fell and those that
didn't lay, they said, in the quality of the construction, in the
corners cut by contractors who mix too much sand into cement and
use cheap iron in their rush to build housing for Istanbul's
exploding population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contractor was not a good person,'' said Omar Talu, 50, an
electrician who was surveying the debris that had once been home to
friends and neighbors. ``He especially cheated on cement.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 people who lived in the apartment block on Erdek Lane,
only six survived, Talu said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the residents of this neighborhood are immigrants from
the Turkish countryside who have flocked to the city in the last
decade, bringing its population to an estimated 12 million.
Apartment houses sprang up like mushrooms on the city's edges,
alongside flimsy makeshift shanties.
</P>
<P>
   Up the street from Umutoglu's house, Hassan Gunay, 50, also an
electrician, waited somberly for word of his cousin, the last
unaccounted-for member of a family of relatives who came to
Istanbul three years ago from Southeast Turkey. The family members
were killed Tuesday morning when their building came crashing down
around them. Only the cousin's body has not been found, Gunay said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gunay, the house where his relatives lived had been
built without a building permit. Three times, local officials had
ordered a halt to construction but in the end, the building, with
its eight apartments, went up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, local civil defense officials appeared at
the site, digging through the rubble with their bare hands and
pulling out survivors. By Wednesday the count was official: Of the
35 people who lived in the building, 12 were killed including the
contractor and members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably cheated on materials,'' said Erkut Oner, a civil
defense official who Wednesday was keeping crowds of onlookers away
from the site.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of another collapsed building, several dozen army
trucks were parked along a highway as hundreds of soldiers sifted
rubble by hand in hopes, one onlooker said, of finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Here, and all across Istanbul, families were settling down for
the night in local parks, parking lots and other available open
space, fearing aftershocks that could still bring down buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house is standing but it has cracks all through it,'' said
Beyhan Balci, a 47-year-old woman whose family was sharing a
makeshift tent with neighbors. ``We are waiting for the inspectors
to come and give us a report.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Istanbul was taking stock of the damage Wednesday, life
in this enormous city was returning back to normal. Tourists
flocked to the city's famous sites, none of which apparently
suffered in the quake.
</P>
<P>
   When the great Ottoman architect Sinan was building mosques in
Istanbul in the 16th century, he first built the foundations and
then let them settle for two years before completing construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the buildings in Istanbul had been built that way, then
none would have collapsed,'' said Erkan Tezkan, a geophysicist who
now works as a tour guide.

 &HT;    ``INTERACTIVE'' SHOPPING IS COMING, AND SO ARE PRIVACY CONCERNS
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In recent years, millions of Americans have begun
using the Internet to buy books, music and computer software. But
for snug blue jeans or comfortable hiking books, most consumers
still head to the store to find the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   Now as we move into the next century, retailers are trying to
blur the distinction between shopping on the Internet and
schlepping through the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week (EDS: August 17), Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. pushed far into
this new retail frontier when it opened an interactive flagship
store in San Francisco. The four-story complex has a digital nerve
center that uses more than 40 miles of cable and hundreds of
speakers to provide customers with a wired way to wrap themselves
in denim.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pulling on pants to see which fit best, customers can
step into a private booth where instruments scan their bodies in
three dimensions to determine sizes. That body-based information is
stored in the company's digital warehouse, along with the
customer's fingerprints and other personal data. For example, at
listening stations around the store, the computer system picks up
information about a particular customer's tastes by noting what CDs
he or she switches on.
</P>
<P>
   That trove of electronic data will be used to help create
personalized direct mail campaigns. The body data also will make it
easier for customers to skip the trip to the fitting room and
instead buy their next pair of jeans through the Levi web site.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other retailers are looking for ways to blend
traditional shopping with Internet cruising. Recreational Equipment
Inc., or REI, has been a leader in putting Internet kiosks in its
outdoor-goods stores. The kiosks allow shoppers to go to a web site
(www.rei.com) to obtain detailed information on each item the
company sells. Borders Books, Sears, Gap and others are also adding
in-store Internet connections, both to provide information and
extract it from shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say some of the biggest technological changes
may be coming at the grocery store. Early in the next century,
shoppers may find themselves being met at the grocery store door by
an electronic greeter that will check fingerprints to identify
customers. As customers move through the aisles, the voices of
electronic ``clerks'' will come out of speakers to remind them of
sale items, explain new products and suggest purchases. At the meat
counter, the electronic ``butcher'' will offer advice on preparing
meats and Internet kiosks will spit out recipes. By the time the
consumers get home, the store will have sent them coupons via
e-mail for new products.
</P>
<P>
   With good clerks now so hard to find, most consumers probably
will appreciate the service improvements that could come from the
integration of the Internet and other new technologies into retail
stores.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy experts say consumers may not be so thrilled when
they realize ``interactive'' shopping allows retailers to collect
detailed information about alcohol purchases, underwear preferences
and medication requirements. Those who worry about privacy recall
with fear how eager White House special prosecutor Kenneth Starr
was to examine computerized records of book purchases made by
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ari (CQ) Schwartz, a policy analyst with the Center for
Democracy and Technology, said his non-profit organization is
pushing for laws that would make it impossible for the government
to seize retail information without a warrant and to give consumers
more control over their personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the organization doesn't even attempt to keep
retailers from developing new ways to extract data from consumers,
a mission that would be hopeless in the 21st century. His solution
is to fight fire with fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need technological solutions to make sure personal
information is encrypted'' and that tough privacy laws are
enforced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's inevitable that the clothing retailers will
know exactly how big your thighs are. The battle will be over
whether they can post that information on a Web site for everyone
else see.

 &HT;    ``INTERACTIVE'' SHOPPING IS COMING, AND SO ARE PRIVACY CONCERNS
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 22

   WASHINGTON _ In recent years, millions of Americans have begun
using the Internet to buy books, music and computer software. But
for snug blue jeans or comfortable hiking books, most consumers
still head to the store to find the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   Now as we move into the next century, retailers are trying to
blur the distinction between shopping on the Internet and
schlepping through the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week (EDS: August 17), Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. pushed far into
this new retail frontier when it opened an interactive flagship
store in San Francisco. The four-story complex has a digital nerve
center that uses more than 40 miles of cable and hundreds of
speakers to provide customers with a wired way to wrap themselves
in denim.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pulling on pants to see which fit best, customers can
step into a private booth where instruments scan their bodies in
three dimensions to determine sizes. That body-based information is
stored in the company's digital warehouse, along with the
customer's fingerprints and other personal data. For example, at
listening stations around the store, the computer system picks up
information about a particular customer's tastes by noting what CDs
he or she switches on.
</P>
<P>
   That trove of electronic data will be used to help create
personalized direct mail campaigns. The body data also will make it
easier for customers to skip the trip to the fitting room and
instead buy their next pair of jeans through the Levi web site.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other retailers are looking for ways to blend
traditional shopping with Internet cruising. Recreational Equipment
Inc., or REI, has been a leader in putting Internet kiosks in its
outdoor-goods stores. The kiosks allow shoppers to go to a web site
(www.rei.com) to obtain detailed information on each item the
company sells. Borders Books, Sears, Gap and others are also adding
in-store Internet connections, both to provide information and
extract it from shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say some of the biggest technological changes
may be coming at the grocery store. Early in the next century,
shoppers may find themselves being met at the grocery store door by
an electronic greeter that will check fingerprints to identify
customers. As customers move through the aisles, the voices of
electronic ``clerks'' will come out of speakers to remind them of
sale items, explain new products and suggest purchases. At the meat
counter, the electronic ``butcher'' will offer advice on preparing
meats and Internet kiosks will spit out recipes. By the time the
consumers get home, the store will have sent them coupons via
e-mail for new products.
</P>
<P>
   With good clerks now so hard to find, most consumers probably
will appreciate the service improvements that could come from the
integration of the Internet and other new technologies into retail
stores.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy experts say consumers may not be so thrilled when
they realize ``interactive'' shopping allows retailers to collect
detailed information about alcohol purchases, underwear preferences
and medication requirements. Those who worry about privacy recall
with fear how eager White House special prosecutor Kenneth Starr
was to examine computerized records of book purchases made by
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ari (CQ) Schwartz, a policy analyst with the Center for
Democracy and Technology, said his non-profit organization is
pushing for laws that would make it impossible for the government
to seize retail information without a warrant and to give consumers
more control over their personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the organization doesn't even attempt to keep
retailers from developing new ways to extract data from consumers,
a mission that would be hopeless in the 21st century. His solution
is to fight fire with fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need technological solutions to make sure personal
information is encrypted'' and that tough privacy laws are
enforced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's inevitable that the clothing retailers will
know exactly how big your thighs are. The battle will be over
whether they can post that information on a Web site for everyone
else see.

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ His uniform drenched with perspiration, Kaleon
Green found a spot in the shade during a short break in Cal State
Northridge's football practice Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   His chest was heaving and he was holding his hands on his waist.
But Green wasn't complaining. For the first time in two years, he
has a chance to play in a college football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad to be back,'' said Green, a 6-foot-2, 235-pound
senior linebacker. ``I feel like I'm making progress. I'm making
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Green was a starter for the Matadors in 1997, but he broke his
leg jogging last summer and missed the '98 season. He participated
in spring practice but didn't make the team's depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Green is showing this week he's better than third-string.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaleon is a guy that can definitely help us,'' said Terrance
Johnson, CSUN's linebackers coach. ``He'll definitely play a lot
for us. He's a force.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN must first hope that Green's appeal to the NCAA for a rare
sixth year of eligibility is granted. After graduating from
Crenshaw High in 1992, Green found out he had cancer and he sat out
two years.
</P>
<P>
   He went to West Los Angeles College, where he competed in '94
and '96, then went to Missouri and left the Tigers' program after
competing in spring practice in '97. Green, 25, transferred to CSUN
and made 26 tackles that season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Impressive rookie: One of the bright spots on the offensive
line has been freshman tackle Nick Longshore, who was an
All-Foothill League lineman at Canyon High last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a really good camp,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``He's really been impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Longshore is playing well despite losing 20 pounds in the last
three months because of an illness Longshore said doctors haven't
diagnosed. In May, the 6-6 Longshore weighed 275 pounds. He's down
to 255.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quicker, faster and stronger before I got sick,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tarnished gold: Jeremy Golden's offseason was forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, a sophomore safety from Westlake High who led the
Matadors with 94 tackles last year, only made it through a couple
of practices this spring before going out with pain in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been practicing this week, but Golden couldn't even if
he was healthy. He's academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN coaches aren't sure what is wrong with Golden's knee,
and head athletic trainer Rhonda Lowry said she hasn't been updated
because Golden is getting medical treatment from his own doctor.
Golden hasn't had surgery performed, but Kearin is recommending he
get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy's got a year to (redshirt),'' Kearin said. ``He's just
got to take care of that knee.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ailing: Jaumal Bradley couldn't keep food down Tuesday night,
but he couldn't stay away from the field Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a senior fullback, showed up at 6:45 a.m. to run
sprints, even though he was sick the night before. He didn't
practice but went to the weight room for two hours.

 &HT;    Turkey earthquake devastates Atlanta family
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice and Julie Bryant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anesthesiologist Babur Kilic was supposed to board a
plane Saturday to join his wife, their five children and his
parents at their summer home in Turkey. Instead, Kilic left
Wednesday to make funeral arrangements for four of his children and
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Kilic's wife, Jan, and their daughter Natalie, 6, survived
Tuesday's earthquake. So did his mother, Turkan Kilic, although she
is in critical condition and on life-support in a Turkish hospital.
Jan Kilic is being treated at the American Hospital in Istanbul,
but family members in Marietta don't know her condition. Natalie is
reportedly unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to be strong,'' Cigdem Kilic, Babur Kilic's
sister-in-law, said Wednesday. ``He's very upset, but he's also
thankful that his wife is alive and one of his children is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The human toll from the quake had climbed late Wednesday to
3,839 dead and nearly 18,500 injured. But more than 10,000 people
are still missing, and the final death count could top 12,000, said
Yavuz Tarcan, the Turkish honorary consul in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot reach some regions yet,'' said Tarcan, a physician
who practices nuclear medicine in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tarcan said there are unconfirmed reports that three or four
other people with North Georgia connections also died in the
temblor. The honorary consul's office has been deluged with
telephone calls from worried relatives. Some of the calls, Tarcan
said, also have come from concerned Americans with children
traveling in Turkey or with friends who live in the hardest-hit
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Babur Kilic, known to his friends as ``Bobby,'' was accompanied
to Turkey by his two older brothers, Timur and Cengiz. The three
Kilic brothers are Marietta anesthesiologists who practice at
Wellstar-Kennestone Hospital. All three graduated from the
University of Alabama school of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Nizam Kilic, was a retired pediatrician who lived
in Marietta with his wife, Turkan, also a retired physician.
</P>
<P>
   The dead Kilic children were identified as Jeffrey Michael, 6;
Jennifer Kayla, 5; David Tansan, 2; and Katherine ``Katie''
Michelle, who was born Nov. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They attended Casa dei Bambini Montessori school in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Babur Kilic's two-story brick home in east Cobb, about 10
family members and friends gathered Wednesday evening around a
television set, tracking news developments. .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Jack Kemp, Jan Kilic's father.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp and his wife were traveling to the New England coast for a
seven-week vacation Tuesday when they heard of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we heard it wasn't their building,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, their relief gave way to shock as official word of
the children's death came by phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic, her children and her in-laws were on vacation in the
resort town of Yalova when the five-story building in which they
were staying collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan wanted to expose the kids to culture and their heritage,''
Kemp said. ``She's a strong girl. Her faith will see her through
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic owns a contracting firm and builds houses in Atlanta.
She is also active in her church, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in metro Atlanta, friends and loved ones of the Kilic
family expressed their disbelief that such tragedy could visit such
good people.
</P>
<P>
   Zeynep Karasu, who retired as a pediatrician three years ago,
has known the Kilic family for more than 25 years. She first got to
know Nizam Kilic through their work as pediatricians. Later, his
three sons became doctors, and she worked with them at
Wellstar-Kennestone Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with Babur yesterday,'' she said Wednesday afternoon.
``He didn't know anything. Of course, none of us knew anything. The
telephones were not working.''
</P>
<P>
   She found out Wednesday morning, shortly after Kilic got the
devastating news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard. Very hard,'' Karasu said, her voice breaking.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Timur Kilic, family members were trying to cope
with the sudden loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' said Cigdem Kilic, who has been married to
Timur for 12 years. ``It's terrible. And the way they died. It's
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Others tried to remember some of the Kilics in better times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very, very nice man,'' Mehmet Yildirim, president of
the Turkish American Cultural Association of Georgia, said of Nizam
Kilic. ``He would come to all of our functions. He would donate
money. He was just a gentleman.''

DOW STUMBLES, DROPPING 1.13 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Refiling to correct hedline to 1.13 percent. No other
change.)  
(th) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices slumped Wednesday as investors took
profits from the recent rally, the dollar weakened and
interest-rate jitters continued.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rose, causing the yield on the bellwether 30-year
Treasury to flirt with a level just under 6 percent, a key
threshold in market psychology.
</P>
<P>
   After approaching its mid-July peak on Tuesday, the Dow Jones
industrial average gave ground early Wednesday, steadied, then
stumbled again in the final 30 minutes to finish with a loss of
125.70 points, or 1.13 percent. IBM was a prominent late casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pullback in the dollar, certainly against the yen, has
weakened stocks,'' said Elaine H. Yager, a senior analyst at Herzog
Heine Geduld.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said some investors were cashing in profits ahead
of the expiration of options contracts on Friday and the Federal
Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday, which is widely expected to
result in a quarter-point rise in the overnight lending rate among
banks.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly strong earnings report by Dell Computer and a
recommendation of eight Internet stocks by Merrill Lynch's
influential analyst, Henry Blodget, helped keep the Nasdaq average
in positive territory most of the day before it, too, slipped and
ended down 13.49 points, or 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the bond market were buoyed by official purchases
and continued the previous day's strong rally, pushing the 30-year
issue during the day to just under 6 percent, a quarter percentage
point less than a week ago, before finishing right at 6 percent.
The rate on the 10-year bond, a benchmark for mortgages, eased a
bit further, to 5.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about a string of interest rate increases appear to be
subsiding on the comforting news this week that inflation remains
in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market continues to trade without a lot of
conviction,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief strategist at Legg
Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ``But seeing the long bond rally is
probably the best thing.'' Trading volume remained subdued.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.32 points, to
1,332.84, or 0.8 percent, midway between the other major indexes.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the biggest factor in the decline of blue-chip Dow
index, skidding 4|, to 123~, after changing hands as high as 129|.
</P>
<P>
   But 20 of the other 29 stocks in the index also fell, with
American Express losing 3, to 137\, Johnson &AMP; Johnson 2[, to 96
3/16, and Minnesota Mining 2], to 95 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget, the Merrill Lynch analyst, recommended eight Internet
stocks he saw as benefiting from this year's holiday shopping
season, perhaps tripling revenue from online sales and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the shares, which ``offer a sound way to play the
fundamental strength and renewed investor enthusiasm'' expected in
coming months, would surge 50 percent to 100 percent by yearend.
</P>
<P>
   All his picks rose. Amazon.com jumped 3~, to 113[, America
Online 1 11/16, to 99 3/16, and Yahoo 6 3/16, to 145 1/16. His
other picks were Etoys, Excite at Home, Lycos, Inktomi and
Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser factor in Wednesday's session was a report that
Fidelity Investments, the biggest mutual fund group, sold a net
$4.6 billion of technology stocks during the second quarter,
shrinking positions in America Online, as well as in Texas
Instruments, Oracle and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, which reported a bigger-than-expected earnings
gain after Tuesday's close, gained 3 7/16, to 44 9/16, adding about
as much to the S&AMP;P 500 performance as IBM subtracted. Only 112
index components rose, compared with 370 that fell.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc. dropped 1 13/16, to 17 3/16, after warning of lower
profits this year; Talbots, another retailer, climbed 1 15/16, to
32 9/16, on sharply higher quarterly earnings. Reader's Digest rose
1], to 33, after announcing tripled earnings that beat forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Hannaford Bros. soared 9 1/16, to 72}, on a deal to be acquired
by Food Lion, which slumped 2 11/32, to 8 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,799 issues fell compared with
1,195 that rose; 65 stocks made 52-week lows, while 51 reached new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Volume of 677 million was slightly below Tuesday's 690 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, stocks advanced about 0.5 percent in London but fell
that much in Frankfurt. Sao Paulo's Bovespa and Mexico City's Bolsa
skidded 2.37 percent and 2.12 percent, respectively, while Tokyo
showed little change.

STARR PLANNING TO RESIGN AS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, ASSOCIATES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th graf to delete extraneous start of graf; subs last graf
to delete   word `groped' and replace it with phrase `made a sexual
advance')  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is quitting
as early as October to resume his legal practice after a five-year
investigation into President Clinton's personal and business
affairs that led to last summer's impeachment battle, Starr's
associates said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the associates, Starr has decided that he will
remain in office long enough to put his personal stamp on a final
report summarizing the findings of his inquiries _ a report looming
as a potential embarrassment to Hillary Rodham Clinton as she moves
closer to entering the race for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Starr has communicated his plans to the
three-member panel of federal appellate judges that presides over
independent counsel matters, asking that one of his top lieutenants
take over the closing phase of the long inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The same three-judge panel divided sharply on Wednesday,
declaring there was no basis for it to unilaterally terminate
Starr's investigation. The ruling was apparently unconnected to
Starr's private assurances to the judges that he would soon leave.
The independent counsel law requires the panel to decide every year
whether to terminate an investigation. The law has expired, but it
still governs Starr's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the opinion exposed harsh differences in how the
judges view Starr's investigation. The two judges appointed by
Republican presidents, David J. Sentelle and Peter T. Fay, lauded
Starr, saying his investigation has been ``unusually productive,''
resulting in not only the impeachment of a president but 24
indictments and 16 convictions. They said that under the law they
were prohibited from delving into the independent counsel's
operation and thus they could not order it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's lone Democratic-appointed judge, Richard D. Cudahy,
said it was useless and wasteful for the investigation to go on.
Cudahy wrote that after President Clinton's acquittal by the
Senate, the investigation had reached ``a natural and logical point
for termination since is is not clear how additional measures
against the principal subject of the investigation could be
pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy also complained that he was rebuffed in his efforts to
have the court formally ask Starr how much is left to investigate.
He said that the court's only knowledge of how the investigation
was progressing or whether it was nearing its end came from
``informal contacts'' between Sentelle, the panel's chief, and
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a bookish legal scholar who seemed more at home with
abstract constitutional theories than the bare-knuckled world of
criminal prosecutions, would leave with his once-pristine
reputation for probity now tarnished after years of attacks by
Clinton's defenders _ even as Starr unearthed an Oval Office sex
scandal that led to Clinton's impeachment in the House and his
subsequent trial and acquittal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will also be remembered as the man largely responsible for
the demise of the independent counsel statute, enacted after
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has told associates he expects to return to his job as a
partner at the Washington office of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where he
specialized in the firm's appellate practice. But associates said
he has not reached a specific agreement with Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, and
representatives of the firm did not return phone calls Wednesday on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's communication to the three-judge panel that he was
planning to depart was first reported by ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Starr's office said that there had been substantial
progress in writing the final report. Starr is required to file a
report but has leeway in explaining his actions in regard to people
who were investigated but not indicted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Starr associates said, there was a vigorous
discussion as to how he would deal with questions involving Mrs.
Clinton, for whom Starr's office once drafted an indictment that
was never presented to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In June, one associate of Starr said the final report could be
``blistering'' in its description of Mrs. Clinton's behavior, even
though it would only be a recitation of events and unresolved
issues without any explicitly stated judgments. Starr associates
said that the report would inevitably convey a critical view
because it would raise unanswered questions about Mrs. Clinton's
behavior in some land transactions in Arkansas and her testimony
under oath about her actions as a lawyer in those deals.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Edward Page, Starr's spokesman, said that, ``our
final report was never meant to be blistering. We won't
characterize.''
</P>
<P>
   Page said that the final report will include just the facts and
the evidence and ``there won't be accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his aides also have discussed how the termination of
the independent counsel statute would affect his inquiry and
whether Starr could turn over all or part of the remaining
investigative matters to career prosecutors in the Justice
Department. Those discussions were exploratory and have not
resulted in any agreement, law enforcement officials said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has not said publicly what avenues of inquiry remain open.
But lawyers involved in the cases said recently that they center on
whether Mrs. Clinton was truthful in denying a role in firing of
employees at the White House travel office, and the conduct of
Nathan Landow, a Democratic fund-raiser from Maryland, in Starr's
investigation of accusations that Clinton had made a sexual advance
to a White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, in the Oval Office.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: MIXED MESSAGES IN THE CLASSROOM
 &HT;    For release, Sun. August 22.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Spurred on by President Clinton, television networks
are blanketing the airwaves with a new public service campaign that
urges parents to ``talk with your kids'' about such tough social
issues as school violence.
</P>
<P>
   The message: By establishing an open dialogue, parents and
children can forge a bond of trust that will ease potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by fears of fresh trouble as the new school year opens,
educators across the nation have spent millions to rip out lockers,
hire armed guards and install surveillance cameras and metal
detectors. Police swat teams stage drills on school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The message: While we'd like to trust you, we'd rather be safe
(at least from potential law suits) than sorry. Parental bonding
doesn't count in this equation.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some political leaders send young people mixed
messages, even if you discount usage of the Oval Office and Capitol
Hill as extracurricular sex parlors. Take, for example, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who, along with his father, the former president,
often talks about the need to restore dignity to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a TV interviewer in New Hampshire whether he'd
ever used ``drugs, marijuana (or) cocaine,'' Bush replied: ``I'm
not going to talk about what I did as a child. What I am going to
talk about _ and I am going to say this consistently _ (is that) it
is irrelevant what I did 20 to 30 years ago. What's relevant is
that I have learned from any mistakes I made. I do not want to send
signals to anybody that what Gov. Bush did 30 years ago is cool to
try.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But is Bush also willing to extend the same blanket
pardon to today's adolescents that he claims for his own
wild-and-woolly Yale fratboy years? Here's what his campaign
literature says on that score:
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to save a generation of young people, our
children must know they will face bad consequences for criminal
behavior. Sadly, too many youths are not getting that message. Our
juvenile justice system must say to our children: We love you, but
we are going to hold you accountable for your actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on the later theme, some high school administrators
are giving drug tests to all students who seek to join in
non-athletic extracurricular activities, which are sometimes tied
to regular course work. These tests also often cover such legal
drugs, at least among adults, as tobacco and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Flunk and you're out. Evidence of parental bonding also doesn't
apply.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is suing. Perhaps their
filing will note statistical data that shows trouble in classrooms
has dropped dramatically during this decade, even when you factor
in the April horrors at Colorado's Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   We know that kids do best when they get the same consistent
message, over long periods, from home, school and the media. But as
the academic year resumes, perception and reality seem out of
kilter on too many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The true danger may be that kids will dismiss what's being said
about them (or done to them) as so much hype and hypocrisy. Such
kids may choose to follow unchartered paths that lead to unknown
consequences.

 &HT;    Power failure at Atlanta airport causes hot hike for travelers
 &HT;    By Bill Montgomery and Patti Puckett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Caroline Cramer's trip through Hartsfield
International Airport on Wednesday felt sweaty enough to qualify as
a trip to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just kept getting warmer and warmer and warmer,'' she said
as she waited for her flight to Michigan after walking more than a
mile to reach her gate on Concourse D. ``I'm not going to do my
treadmill today.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexplained failure in an electrical cable sparked a series
of problems that eventually cut off power to the main terminal at
Hartsfield for 22 minutes, starting at 2:26 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The world's busiest airport sees few of its 200,000-plus daily
passengers at that hour, with no scheduled passenger flights and
its ``people mover'' train shut down. And, with emergency back-up
lights, the terminal never fully blacked out. But the after-effects
made navigating the airport grueling work for the morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   Power reductions forced airport officials to cut back on air
conditioning and not to run the trains until shortly before noon.
Full power was restored about 11:20 a.m., airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With travelers hoofing it between concourses, airport employees
and volunteers rolled out coolers of ice and bottled water. They
offered wheelchairs to older passengers. Some travelers raced
through the airport to meet flights. Businessmen loosened ties as
they rode the moving sidewalks, which never shut down. Even with a
moving sidewalk, it can take a walker in reasonably good shape
about six minutes to get from one concourse to the next, and some
travelers were covering several concourses. Passengers with
international flights faced a hike of up to 1.75 miles from the
main terminal to Concourse E.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines delayed some flights five to 10 minutes to give
hurrying passengers a break. ``We were lenient,'' said Delta
spokesman Bill Berry. ``Our usual focus is departing on time, but
we felt it was more responsible to the passengers to delay the
flights.''
</P>
<P>
   The power failure did not disrupt operations in the airport
control tower or runway lights and no flights were canceled or
seriously delayed, said Hartsfield Deputy General Manager Mario
Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said air conditioning was reduced, not cut off, but
passengers hurrying between concourses to catch planes couldn't
tell the difference. Barry Vermillion of High Point, N.C., awaited
a flight at Concourse D, which was sweltering at about 11 a.m. ``I
had plenty of time, so getting here wasn't really a problem,'' he
said. ``However, it is hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers arriving at distant concourses were surprised to learn
of the long walk to baggage claim and ground transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're telling me I have to walk a mile and a half,''
said an exhausted Blanche Calhoun of Detroit, who was on her way to
Augusta for a funeral and needed to get from Concourse D to the car
rental counters in the terminal. ``There's always something with
these airports. I can't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield customer service worker Vilma Villaverde said it made
for a rough morning. ``People were running and they would drop
their tickets,'' she said. ``Some people decided it was too far to
walk, so they asked for a wheelchair. You know, the senior people,
the fat people. The people pushing the wheelchairs got so hot.''
</P>
<P>
   She said about every wheelchair at the airport went into service
on the pedestrian mall Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The airport's nine trains do not operate between 12:30 and 5
a.m., and so were ``off line'' when the trouble began at 12:41
a.m., said Hartsfield spokesman Dwayne Clark. Six trains were back
in service by 11:45 a.m. All were in operation by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical problem began when one of the three main
electrical cables supplying Hartsfield failed.
</P>
<P>
   As workers searched for an answer, the failed cable overheated,
causing two other main cables to fail at 2:26 a.m., said Georgia
Power officials. At that time, two other 1.5-inch feeder cables,
which supply power to the airport trains, also failed.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatching up to 70 workers to the airport, Georgia Power
re-energized one of the two main cables, but asked airport
officials to reduce electrical strain on the cable by reducing air
conditioning and lighting in the main terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked the six restaurants and some of the concessions in
the terminal, which normally open at 8 a.m., not to open until the
damaged power cable was repaired,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power investigators could not determine Wednesday why
the first cable failed.

<P>
   Everybody talks about the weather, but this summer lots of
vacationers have been doing something about it _ namely, avoiding
or minimizing the effects of a heat wave that has had much of the
nation sweltering through one of the hottest summers in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures soaring to triple digits, crowds have been
bigger than ever at beaches, water parks, mountain resorts and
air-conditioned malls, while attendance has lagged at amusement
parks, golf courses and shops in the torrid zones. If not locked
into nonrefundable airline tickets or hotel reservations, many
American vacationers have been doing their best to escape the heat
and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned to take my vacation in the Southeast,'' said Steve
Loucks, a recent transplant to Minneapolis from Virginia. ``But
after I read about the heat and humidity back there I decided go to
a cool spot.'' On Sept. 3, Loucks will fly to Alaska for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Moluf of Naperville, Ill., a bartender, was looking for a
place where he and a dozen relatives could get together, but
because of the heat they did not even consider the East Coast.
Instead, they spent last week at Winter Park, a Colorado ski resort
whose Web site advertises ``Beat the Heat Getaways'' from dozens of
U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That promotion has done wonders, because we've had people come
from Florida, Georgia, Texas and all over, just to cool off,'' said
Joan Christensen, a Winter Park spokeswoman. But people fleeing the
sun have not only been staying at resorts, they have been dropping
in on friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year my husband and I didn't have any summer visitors,''
Ms. Christensen said, ``but this year we've had friends come visit
for a total of about 30 nights, mostly friends from states where
it's boiling hot.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yellowstone National Park, where the weather this summer has
been warm but not punishing, attendance rose 5.7 percent in June
over the same period last year and rose 0.4 percent last month. ``A
lot of the visitors are probably people who were escaping the heat
back East,'' said Marsha Karle, a park spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The twin attractions of gambling in an air-conditioned city are
paying off big for Las Vegas, which earmarked $5 million to attract
visitors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors rose 13.3 percent in June over the same
month last year, the biggest monthly increase in almost five years.
As a bonus, for those who ventured outside, the city set a record
for the most July days _ 14 _ in which the maximum temperature did
not hit at least 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But record temperatures in much of the nation this summer have
been highs, not lows.
</P>
<P>
   In Myrtle Beach, S.C., one of the many hot states, crowds this
summer have flocked to the beach and to stands selling drinks and
ice cream, but not to the Pavillion Amusement Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat has hurt,'' said Glenn West, director of marketing
for the Pavillion. ``When the heat index gets above 100, people
stay away. And we had 10 days in a row during July and August where
the heat index has been over 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat and humidity have played havoc with attendance at other
amusement parks, cutting into concession sales as children and
parents have returned to the air-conditioned comfort of home or
hotel rather than wilt outdoors. But attendance has held up at
water parks in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Big crowds have been reported at Soak City, part of the Cedar
Point amusement park and resort in Sandusky, Ohio; Schlitterbahn
Water Park Resort in New Braunfels, Texas.; Wildwater Kingdom in
Allentown, Pa., and Hurricane Harbor in Los Angeles, whose pool has
constant 2-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   Not so on the golf course. From the Carolinas to Michigan,
soaring temperatures have kept some of the most dedicated golfers
off the links in mid-afternoon and early evening despite efforts to
lure them with lower fees. ``In this part of the country it's
unusual to have temperatures in the 80s at night, but we had them
in July,'' said Brett Marshall, executive director of the Golf
Association of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Furnace Creek Golf Course in California's Death Valley
National Park, the hottest spot in North America, prohibits play
from noon to 4 p.m. As if to atone for the inconvenience, it offers
a $25 ``extreme golf six-pack'' consisting of green fees, cart,
clubs, balls, tees and a gallon jug of water.
</P>
<P>
   This month, though, Death Valley has had a number of days when
the daily high temperature has been below 110 degrees _ in other
words, almost balmy, compared with the 129 degrees recorded last
July (5 degress less than the record temperature set in 1913).
Those milder temperatures might account for the apparent increase
in American travelers to Death Valley this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so bad because it's not humid,'' said Maria Malone, a
teacher in Minneapolis who spent Monday night at Death Valley with
her husband, George, a teacher in St. Paul. Neither of them minded
the 115-degree temperature on a picnic that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to Death Valley,'' Malone said, ``because it's a
beautiful nature area and we like to hike and take photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, including beach resorts, the combined heat and
humidity probably made it feel like, or worse than, Death Valley.
For six weeks in a row through July, crowds at the beaches in Ocean
City, N.J., exceeded 100,000 each Saturday and each Sunday. Farther
down the coast, in Delaware, crowds have flocked to Rehoboth Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ice cream sales are down compared with last year,'' said
Ed Fornwalt, owner of the Royal Treat Breakfast and Ice Cream
Parlor in Rehoboth. ``When you get hot sun and burning sand, people
don't want to walk to buy ice cream or much else. They want the
beach or an air-conditioned mall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about three weeks when the tremendous heat cut down
on foot traffic and that affected business downtown, because people
were hugging the water line,'' said Carol Everhart, executive
director of the Rehoboth Beach Chamber of Commerce. ``But we've had
one perfect beach day after another.''
</P>
<P>
   People from Houston, San Antonio and other hot spots in Texas
have been flocking this summer to Corpus Christi, whose site on the
Gulf of Mexico has helped moderate summer temperatures that
frequently exceed 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In some places, however, it is the absence of heat that has
caused concern. At Mount Ranier National Park near Ashford, Wash. _
a park that draws about 2.4 million visitors a year, and which
early this month attracted Vice President Al Gore and Albert Gore
III, his 16-year-old son _ attendance is down from last year,
possibly way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had horrible weather in the Northwest this year, cool
and rainy instead of warm and dry,'' said Bob Dopiriak, the fee
coordinator at Mount Ranier. ``When you can see the mountain from
Seattle, it's a 14,000-foot billboard, and the visitors come,'' he
said. ``But when you can't see it through the clouds and rain, a
lot of them don't bother.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: GRADING MAY BE TOO EASY ON HEALTH PLANS' REPORT
CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Hawaii, Md., Colo., Ohio, N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing spurs students to improve mastery of history or math as
does the prospect of getting an F on a test. And the same principle
holds true, it seems, for health care plans, opening a huge
opportunity for businesses to get better health care for their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The National Committee for Quality Assurance, a nonprofit
organization, grades about 400 health maintenance organizations
covering about 75 percent of the 80 million patients enrolled in
these plans nationwide. The grades, generally based on
self-reported, independently audited data, cover each plan's
performance on dozens of preventive and treatment measures. The
committee recently released its third annual report card, and the
trends are revealing.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of patients given beta blockers to reduce the
risk of further problems after heart attacks rose to 80 in 1998
from 62 two years earlier, for example, and the portion of children
who received a vaccination for chicken pox before their second
birthday increased to 52 percent in 1998 from 40 percent just one
year earlier. In nearly all categories, overall scores rose sharply
or stayed about the same. Clearly, the students are learning to
perform to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the gap in the scores among plans remains huge. The Blue
Cross plan in Portland, Maine, treated almost 100 percent of its
heart attack patients with beta blockers. HIP of New York provided
them to only about 54 percent. The Kaiser plan of Honolulu provided
eye exams for almost 80 percent of its adult patients with
diabetes; the figure for NYL Care of Greenbelt, Md., was only about
7 percent. The Kaiser plan in Denver provided booster shots for
measles, mumps and rubella to about 50 percent of its patients by
age 13; the figure for the Cigna plan of Cleveland was less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities should ring alarms among plan members.
Performance matters. The National Committee estimates that more
than 4,000 lives could be saved annually if the low-performing
plans administered beta blockers as routinely as the high-
performing plans did. It estimates that 3,000 diabetics could be
spared blindness if all health plans provided eye exams as
routinely as the best plans do. And there would be almost 60,000
fewer cases of relapse into major depression if every plan managed
antidepressant drugs as well as the best plans did, the group
calculates.
</P>
<P>
   With the stark results of a national committee's research right
there on paper, why hasn't the market weeded out the bad
performers? There are at least two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, the report cards are woefully incomplete. They grade
treatment, not outcomes. Outcomes are what most patients care
about; knowing how many breast cancers were caught early and how
many women recovered successfully generally matters to them more
than how many women received mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans acknowledge that they can be held accountable for
prescribing the right medicines, but they argue that they should
not be held accountable for patients' unhealthy behavior, which
they do not control. Why should they be penalized, they ask in
effect, for asthma patients' refusal to give up their pet cats?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Lansky, president of the Foundation for
Accountability, a nonprofit organization that designs medical
report cards, disagrees with that line of reasoning, however.
``Until health plans are held accountable for outcomes,'' he said,
``they are unlikely to take the necessary steps to make sure
patients get healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that health plans balk at producing data on the
quality of medical treatment is that collection and analysis can be
hugely expensive _ $20,000 or more for each major health problem
that researchers want to study.
</P>
<P>
   The National Committee does not focus on outcomes in part
because it cannot venture beyond the data that health plans are
willing to submit voluntarily. That limitation creates a second
problem: few employers pay attention to medical report cards,
according to a recent survey by KPMG. In part, that is because
incomplete reports provide an unreliable guide to quality. In the
survey, over 70 percent of large companies said cost was a major
determinant of their choice of health plan, but less than 10
percent said data on the quality of medical care was very
important.
</P>
<P>
   Because employers pay little attention to data on medical
outcomes, Lansky said, health plans ``see no business advantage in
spending the money.'' So plans do not produce ample report cards
because employers do not use them; and employers do not use ample
report cards because the health plans do not produce them.
</P>
<P>
   There might be a circuitous way out of this. Some employers and
local governments have asked Lansky's group to go straight to
patients to seek information about the performance of their health
plans. Data provided by patients, however, present problems of
reliability. Also, Lansky points out that patients can turn to the
Internet to solicit reviews of a doctor's treatment of their
illness from independent physicians or, perhaps, patients with
similar medical problems. Congress could step in, demanding that
managed care and traditional fee-for-service plans provide data on
outcomes. Workers could demand more information from employers.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges grade students _ an unpleasant, time-consuming process
_ because the best ones insist on a concrete record of their
performance to show to potential employers or professional schools.
In health, the best plans could also be expected to demand grades,
providing the necessary data for employers to examine.
</P>
<P>
   But first, employers must demand rigorous data. So far, few
have. Health plans can be counted on to learn to the test. But as
long as the test remains simple, there will not be much to learn. &QL;

U.S. ANNUAL DRUG SURVEY SHOWS DECLINE IN USE BY YOUNG PEOPLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drug use by young people declined from 1997 to
1998, the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday as
it released the results of its annual survey of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said: ``While
it looks like we have turned the corner with today's report, we
must not rest. Too many young people are still using drugs, and we
must continue to build on our promising efforts to push the rate of
drug use down even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the findings, which were included in the 1998
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and were based on
interviews with 25,000 people, had shown that 9.9 percent of youths
aged 12 to 17 reported last year that they had used an illegal drug
during the 30 days before they were interviewed for the survey, a
sharp decrease from the 11.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The three prior years had all showed lower levels of teen-age
drug use, according to the survey. The figures were 8.2 percent for
1994, 10.9 percent for 1995 and 9.0 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Eric D. Wish, director of the Center for Substance Abuse
Research at the University of Maryland, challenged the importance
of the new figure. ``They are picking out one year, but it's been
pretty stable, between 9 and 11 percent,'' Wish said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the findings among young people were made more
dubious by the fact that ``minors are only interviewed after their
parents have given their consent and are typically in the
vicinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Stewart, a senior policy analyst at the Drug Policy
Foundation, which advocates a public health approach toward drug
use instead of criminal action, also said a single year's
statistics do not give a valid picture of drug use trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration says that we've turned the corner on youth
drug use and we say no, absolutely not,'' Stewart said. ``Drug use
will continue to be a problem. These trends in drug use fluctuate
over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the White House's Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said, ``The fact that the numbers are
best for the youngest, 12 to 17, group is a harbinger that use will
continue to fall as this group grows older.''
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana use was down among teen-agers, to 8.3 percent in 1998
from 9.4 percent in 1997, which the Department of Health and Human
Services acknowledged was not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   The department has reported that marijuana use among teen-agers
had run from a high of 14.2 percent in 1979 to a low of 3.4 percent
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the survey about drug and alcohol use included
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ An estimated 0.8 percent of Americans were current users of
cocaine in 1998, which was not statistically different from the 0.7
percent in 1997. The peak response was 3 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   _ There have been no statistically significant changes in the
use of alcohol since 1988, and in 1998, 52 percent reported current
use. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; _ The trend in smoking among those aged 18 to 25 is up. It was
34.6 percent in 1994, 40.6 percent in 1997 and 41.6 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Califano Jr., who was the domestic affairs adviser in
the Johnson administration and President Jimmy Carter's secretary
of health, education and welfare, the predecessor to Ms. Shalala's
department, called the findings and others a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some good news among kids, but there is also some bad
news, especially black kids and Hispanics _ we're clearly not
reaching them,'' said Califano, who is president of the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. ``I think
part of this is that we still tolerate drug bazaars in Harlem,
Southeast Washington and South Central Los Angeles. They would be
wiped out in five minutes if they popped up on the East Side, in
Georgetown or in Beverly Hills.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the statistics provided by the federal government
were reliable, Califano said: ``These numbers understate drug use,
alcohol and smoking, but statisticians will say that you get the
same level of dissembling every year. As a trend, it's probably
valid.''

RUSSIAN MOB MAY HAVE FUNNELED BILLIONS THROUGH N.Y. BANK 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER with TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billions of dollars have been channeled through the Bank of New
York in the last year in what is believed to be a major money
laundering operation by Russian organized crime, law enforcement
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   From October through March some $4.2 billion, in more than
10,000 transactions, passed through one account, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the account has remained open to help a continuing
investigation by the federal authorities, investigators estimate
that as much as $10 billion may have flowed through the bank in
that account and related ones since early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the transactions seem to add up to one of the
largest money laundering operations ever uncovered in the United
States, with vast sums of money moving in and out of the bank in a
day. But they are quick to point out that the inquiry is still in
its early stages and that they do not yet know the full scale of
the operation or where the money ended up.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Bank of New York said it had suspended two
employees whose names had surfaced in the investigation. Both are
officers in the bank's Eastern European division and are married to
Russian businessmen, one of whom is believed by investigators to
have controlled one of the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions of the two women, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky
of New York, and Lucy Edwards of London, followed an inquiry by The
New York Times. The employees have been suspended pending
completion of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bank of New York has been cooperating with the office of
the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in
a confidential investigation of the use of bank facilities to
transfer funds from Russia to other countries,'' the bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no allegations of wrongdoing by the bank,'' it said,
adding that no customer or bank funds had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   An American government official who follows money laundering and
Russian organized crime said, ``What we have here is the
penetration of a major U.S. organization by Russian organized
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   American and European officials have been concerned about the
possibility that organized crime syndicates from Russia and other
countries could infiltrate financial markets and institutions in
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators here and abroad have been examining cases where
front companies have tried to raise capital in North America for
organized crime activities in Russia through stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Russian financial system last year,
the flight of money out of the country has accelerated, and
investigators have been on the lookout for activities they suspect
are ``laundering'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is a legal catch phrase that refers to the
criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains and moving them
through a sequence of bank accounts so they ultimately look like
legitimate profits from legal businesses. The money is then
withdrawn and used for further criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts under scrutiny at the Bank of New York have been
linked by investigators to a man who Western law enforcement
officials say is a major figure in Russian organized crime, Semyon
Yukovich Mogilevich. Mogilevich is involved in a wide range of
activities from arms trafficking and extortion to prostitution,
American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies
say.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich, 53, is considered smart, ruthless and vastly
wealthy. A recent British intelligence report said he was worth
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and European intelligence agencies have been intensely
monitoring his activities for five years, an American official said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI report on Russian organized crime said that when the
Soviet Union withdrew its forces from East Germany, many Russian
generals sold their weapons to Mogilevich, who in turn sold them,
at much higher prices, to countries like Iraq, Iran and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   British authorities, investigating the financial activities of
Russian organized crime, alerted the FBI to the suspected money
laundering at the Bank of New York more than a year ago. The FBI
said Wednesday that it would have no comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   An initial round of federal subpoenas issued to the Bank of New
York produced 3,500 pages of transactions for one account in the
name of a company called Benex, said investigators. They would say
little about what information they have about Benex, its location
or its activities.
</P>
<P>
   British intelligence reported that some of the money from the
Benex account went to pay contract killers and some went to drug
barons, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after an American journalist, Robert Friedman, wrote
a long expose of his criminal career in the Village Voice,
Mogilevich put out a contract on the reporter's life, the Central
Intelligence Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said it had picked up the threat by monitoring
Mogilevich's phone. A European law enforcement official said
recently that the contract was for $100,000. Friedman went into
hiding for a while and has resumed writing.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to take many months before investigators sift
through the documents and penetrate the complex web of offshore
companies and holding companies to determine precisely where the
money came from and where it went.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York state
Banking Department declined to comment on whether they had begun
their own investigations of the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While sifting through boxes of documents that turned up in the
British investigation, investigators found references to Benex,
which was linked to an American company, YBM Magnex, which was a
front for Mogilevich, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   YBM, based in Philadelphia and once traded on the Canadian stock
exchange, was an operating company _ it made and sold industrial
magnets _ and a money laundering vehicle for Mogilevich, American
and British officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   In June YBM pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud in
federal District Court in Philadelphia, and the U.S. Attorney's
office there is still considering whether to indict Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   The YBM case was one reflection of the success of Russian
organized crime in infiltrating Western financial markets, American
and European officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``it's a drop in the bucket'' compared to what has happened
at the Bank of New York, said an American official.
</P>
<P>
   The account at the Bank of New York was opened by a
Russian-American last year, an investigator said. He declined to
give the person's name.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of transactions through the accounts has been
extraordinary, officials said, and often the money came in and went
out quickly. This should have made the bank suspicious, said an
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   But according to investigators, but the bank has filed only one
``suspicious activity report'' with the federal authorities and
that was after the authorities began investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the bank would not discuss the filing of any reports
with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If unusual activity occurs in an account, banks are required to
file ``suspicious activity reports,'' or SARs, into a system
monitored by the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network, as well as the country's five main banking regulators. The
reports are confidential and the Treasury's network declined to
comment Wednesday on whether it had received any such report from
the Bank of New York recently.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At one time, American authorities froze the Benex account, which
had $34 million in it, an investigator said. But they quickly
unfroze it, when they realized that it was just the tip of a very
large operation and it would aid the investigation to keep the
account active, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts had been handled by Ms. Kagalovsky, a senior vice
president of the bank in New York, according to government
officials in New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Russia, she emigrated to the United States in 1979, and
after earning a masters degree at Princeton joined a management
training program at the bank, according to articles in The American
Banker and Bankers Monthly in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, after the collapse of Communism, Ms.
Kagalovsky was put in charge of bringing in new business from
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, she married Konstantin Kagalovsky, who has been
an economic adviser to the Russian government and from 1992-1995,
was Russia's representative to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky, 44, declined to answer any questions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking at the role played by Lucy
Edwards, a vice president of the bank in London working on Eastern
European accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Ms. Edwards spoke at a two-day conference on
international financial services for Scandinavia, Eastern Europe
and Russian clients. She was the first speaker on the second day.
Her topic: ``Money Laundering: Latest Developments and
Regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards was also born in Russia and acquired American
citizenship by marriage, an American official said. After a
divorce, she married a Russian, Peter Berlin, and he subsequently
became an American citizen, the official added. Investigators
believe that Berlin had authority over the Benex account at the
bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin could not be located.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards' assistant in London, who gave her name only as
Rachel, said that Ms. Edwards was traveling. She added that it was
bank policy that no one on the staff could speak to reporters.
After being told more details of the money laundering
investigation, she referred questions to Ms. Kagalovsky.

BRAVES ARE VULNERABLE, METS NO LONGER THE JOKERS IN NL EAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Mets envisioned themselves as contenders heading
into the season. But in early June, they were reduced to comedians.
</P>
<P>
   There was low comedy: An eight-game losing streak culminated in
the firing of coaches Bob Apodaca, Randy Niemann and Tom Robson,
all close friends of manager Bobby Valentine's.
</P>
<P>
   There was physical comedy: A feud between Valentine and
disgruntled veteran Bobby Bonilla boiled over with a shouting match
in the dugout, with Bonilla inviting Valentine to step inside to
settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   There was slapstick comedy: After being ejected from a game
against the Toronto Blue Jays, Valentine returned to the dugout
with a fake mustache and dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone was laughing, they were doing so at, not with, the
team. The Mets bottomed out with a 27-28 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole week, everything that could go wrong did go
wrong,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza said. ``That was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a little more than two months later, it seems as if the
Mets might have the final chortle.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are involved with the mighty Atlanta Braves in one of
the best and most unlikely races in the major leagues. The two
teams entered Wednesday's games tied for the top spot in the
National League East with 73-48 records. The Braves fell a
half-game back after losing to Colorado, with the Mets scheduled to
play late Wednesday night in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely race because the Braves are the team of the
1990s, while the Mets are one of the doormats of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight in the '90s that were finished _ 1994 ended with a
players' strike _ the Braves have won seven division titles, four
pennants and one World Series. The Mets had losing records six
times this decade and haven't been in the playoffs since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The postseason is a big motivating force for this team,'' said
Valentine, who is trying to reach the playoffs for the first time
in 12 seasons as a manager, including eight in Texas. ``Guys
understand that a few years ago the Mets were a laughingstock.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago the Mets were a laughingstock, but after the
eight-game losing streak they while losing just 20]went 46-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got that out of our system,'' Piazza said. ``I think it was
inevitable we were going to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the June follies, the Mets were too talented not to.
</P>
<P>
   Their infield of first baseman John Olerud, second baseman
Edgardo Alfonzo, shortstop Rey Ordonez and third baseman Robin
Ventura is perhaps the best defensively in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Ageless leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson, Alfonzo, Olerud, Piazza
and Ventura, augmented by the emergence of young outfielders Roger
Cedeno and Benny Agbayani, give the team a solid offense.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation is solid, the bullpen deep.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Steve Phillips improved the team by sending two
prospects to the Oakland Athletics for starting pitcher Kenny
Rogers on July 23, then acquired relievers Billy Taylor and Chuck
McElroy, center fielder Darryl Hamilton and utility player Shawon
Dunston at the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for it,` Phillips said. ``Now's the time. You
don't know how many times the opportunity will present itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have failed to win their division only twice in the
1990s, when they were 65-97 in '90 and when they were 68-46 and
second to the Montreal Expos when the players went on strike in
'94. But the Mets sense an opportunity because the Braves _ no
longer appear invincible.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Andres Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and
121 runs batted in last season, has missed the season after a
diagnosis of cancer. All-Star catcher Javy Lopez is finished for
the year because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Their trio of Cy Young Award-winning pitchers _ Greg Maddux, Tom
Glavine and John Smoltz _ suddenly looks mortal. Maddux is 15-6
with a 3.66 earned-run average, but opponents are hitting over .290
against him. Glavine is 10-9 with a 4.17 ERA. Smoltz is 8-6 with a
3.60 ERA and has been on the disabled list twice because of an
elbow injury. He altered his delivery to alleviate the pain in his
most recent start and strained his groin.
</P>
<P>
   However, general manager John Schuerholz recognized his team's
weaknesses at the trading deadline, and acquired shortstop Jose
Hernandez to shore up the offense and Terry Mulholland to provide
depth to the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all we could do,'' Schuerholz said. ``We helped to fill
the void some.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, the Braves remain one of the best teams in
baseball. Their .603 winning percentage before losing to Colorado
Wednesday was tied with the Mets for the best in the NL, and behind
only the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt it will be the most satisfying year we've ever
had if we can overcome all this adversity to win it,'' third
baseman Chipper Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, winning it doesn't mean the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be rewarding to win the division, but the goal
here is to win the World Series,'' right fielder Brian Jordan said.
``We've just got to keep staying together as a team and keep
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Mets hanging around, winning the East no longer is
a sure thing. And that's no joke. nn

U.S. ANNUAL DRUG SURVEY SHOWS DECLINE IN USE BY YOUNG PEOPLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drug use by young people declined from 1997 to
1998, the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday as
it released the results of its annual survey of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said: ``While
it looks like we have turned the corner with today's report, we
must not rest. Too many young people are still using drugs, and we
must continue to build on our promising efforts to push the rate of
drug use down even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the findings, which were included in the 1998
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and were based on
interviews with 25,000 people, had shown that 9.9 percent of youths
aged 12 to 17 reported last year that they had used an illegal drug
during the 30 days before they were interviewed for the survey, a
sharp decrease from the 11.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The three prior years had all showed lower levels of teen-age
drug use, according to the survey. The figures were 8.2 percent for
1994, 10.9 percent for 1995 and 9.0 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Eric D. Wish, director of the Center for Substance Abuse
Research at the University of Maryland, challenged the importance
of the new figure. ``They are picking out one year, but it's been
pretty stable, between 9 and 11 percent,'' Wish said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the findings among young people were made more
dubious by the fact that ``minors are only interviewed after their
parents have given their consent and are typically in the
vicinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Stewart, a senior policy analyst at the Drug Policy
Foundation, which advocates a public health approach toward drug
use instead of criminal action, also said a single year's
statistics do not give a valid picture of drug use trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration says that we've turned the corner on youth
drug use and we say no, absolutely not,'' Stewart said. ``Drug use
will continue to be a problem. These trends in drug use fluctuate
over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the White House's Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said, ``The fact that the numbers are
best for the youngest, 12 to 17, group is a harbinger that use will
continue to fall as this group grows older.''
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana use was down among teen-agers, to 8.3 percent in 1998
from 9.4 percent in 1997, which the Department of Health and Human
Services acknowledged was not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   The department has reported that marijuana use among teen-agers
had run from a high of 14.2 percent in 1979 to a low of 3.4 percent
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the survey about drug and alcohol use included
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ An estimated 0.8 percent of Americans were current users of
cocaine in 1998, which was not statistically different from the 0.7
percent in 1997. The peak response was 3 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   _ There have been no statistically significant changes in the
use of alcohol since 1988, and in 1998, 52 percent reported current
use. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; _ The trend in smoking among those aged 18 to 25 is up. It was
34.6 percent in 1994, 40.6 percent in 1997 and 41.6 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Califano Jr., who was the domestic affairs adviser in
the Johnson administration and President Jimmy Carter's secretary
of health, education and welfare, the predecessor to Ms. Shalala's
department, called the findings and others a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some good news among kids, but there is also some bad
news, especially black kids and Hispanics _ we're clearly not
reaching them,'' said Califano, who is president of the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. ``I think
part of this is that we still tolerate drug bazaars in Harlem,
Southeast Washington and South Central Los Angeles. They would be
wiped out in five minutes if they popped up on the East Side, in
Georgetown or in Beverly Hills.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the statistics provided by the federal government
were reliable, Califano said: ``These numbers understate drug use,
alcohol and smoking, but statisticians will say that you get the
same level of dissembling every year. As a trend, it's probably
valid.''

STARR PLANNING TO RESIGN AS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, ASSOCIATES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to change `last summer's' to `impeachment battle in
Congress')  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is quitting
as early as October to resume his legal practice after a five-year
investigation into President Clinton's personal and business
affairs that led to the impeachment battle in Congress, Starr's
associates said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the associates, Starr has decided that he will
remain in office long enough to put his personal stamp on a final
report summarizing the findings of his inquiries _ a report looming
as a potential embarrassment to Hillary Rodham Clinton as she moves
closer to entering the race for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Starr has communicated his plans to the
three-member panel of federal appellate judges that presides over
independent counsel matters, asking that one of his top lieutenants
take over the closing phase of the long inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The same three-judge panel divided sharply on Wednesday,
declaring there was no basis for it to unilaterally terminate
Starr's investigation. The ruling was apparently unconnected to
Starr's private assurances to the judges that he would soon leave.
The independent counsel law requires the panel to decide every year
whether to terminate an investigation. The law has expired, but it
still governs Starr's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the opinion exposed harsh differences in how the
judges view Starr's investigation. The two judges appointed by
Republican presidents, David J. Sentelle and Peter T. Fay, lauded
Starr, saying his investigation has been ``unusually productive,''
resulting in not only the impeachment of a president but 24
indictments and 16 convictions. They said that under the law they
were prohibited from delving into the independent counsel's
operation and thus they could not order it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's lone Democratic-appointed judge, Richard D. Cudahy,
said it was useless and wasteful for the investigation to go on.
Cudahy wrote that after President Clinton's acquittal by the
Senate, the investigation had reached ``a natural and logical point
for termination since is is not clear how additional measures
against the principal subject of the investigation could be
pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy also complained that he was rebuffed in his efforts to
have the court formally ask Starr how much is left to investigate.
He said that the court's only knowledge of how the investigation
was progressing or whether it was nearing its end came from
``informal contacts'' between Sentelle, the panel's chief, and
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a bookish legal scholar who seemed more at home with
abstract constitutional theories than the bare-knuckled world of
criminal prosecutions, would leave with his once-pristine
reputation for probity now tarnished after years of attacks by
Clinton's defenders _ even as Starr unearthed an Oval Office sex
scandal that led to Clinton's impeachment in the House and his
subsequent trial and acquittal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will also be remembered as the man largely responsible for
the demise of the independent counsel statute, enacted after
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has told associates he expects to return to his job as a
partner at the Washington office of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where he
specialized in the firm's appellate practice. But associates said
he has not reached a specific agreement with Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, and
representatives of the firm did not return phone calls Wednesday on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's communication to the three-judge panel that he was
planning to depart was first reported by ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Starr's office said that there had been substantial
progress in writing the final report. Starr is required to file a
report but has leeway in explaining his actions in regard to people
who were investigated but not indicted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Starr associates said, there was a vigorous
discussion as to how he would deal with questions involving Mrs.
Clinton, for whom Starr's office once drafted an indictment that
was never presented to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In June, one associate of Starr said the final report could be
``blistering'' in its description of Mrs. Clinton's behavior, even
though it would only be a recitation of events and unresolved
issues without any explicitly stated judgments. Starr associates
said that the report would inevitably convey a critical view
because it would raise unanswered questions about Mrs. Clinton's
behavior in some land transactions in Arkansas and her testimony
under oath about her actions as a lawyer in those deals.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Edward Page, Starr's spokesman, said that, ``our
final report was never meant to be blistering. We won't
characterize.''
</P>
<P>
   Page said that the final report will include just the facts and
the evidence and ``there won't be accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his aides also have discussed how the termination of
the independent counsel statute would affect his inquiry and
whether Starr could turn over all or part of the remaining
investigative matters to career prosecutors in the Justice
Department. Those discussions were exploratory and have not
resulted in any agreement, law enforcement officials said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has not said publicly what avenues of inquiry remain open.
But lawyers involved in the cases said recently that they center on
whether Mrs. Clinton was truthful in denying a role in firing of
employees at the White House travel office, and the conduct of
Nathan Landow, a Democratic fund-raiser from Maryland, in Starr's
investigation of accusations that Clinton had made a sexual advance
to a White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, in the Oval Office.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WICHITA FALLS _ Unlike most NFL owners who are waiting for the
Sept. 15 deadline, Jerry Jones is not afraid to publicly support
Houston over Los Angeles in the race to win the 32nd franchise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Dallas Cowboys would have to share the Texas market
with Bob McNair's expansion team in Houston, Jones believes it is
in the best interests of the Lone Star State and the NFL to have
franchises in both cities.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Houston's chances of getting the expansion franchise
``outstanding,'' Jones would push for an annual regular-season game
between Dallas and Houston under a new scheduling format that is
being considered for the time when the NFL may realign into eight
divisions of four teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think Houston has really gotten out ahead of Los
Angeles as far as the likelihood of where this expansion will go,''
Jones said this week at the Cowboys' training camp at Midwestern
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is a Houston supporter because of the stadium financial
plan that includes almost $200 million in public money. And like
almost all of the owners, commissioner Paul Tagliabue and other NFL
executives, Jones would welcome McNair into one of the business
world's most exclusive fraternities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people in the league that, if given a choice
between having a Los Angeles franchise or a Houston franchise,
would rather have a Houston franchise from the standpoint of just
the marketplace alone,'' Jones said. ``Forget the fact that one's
got the stadium in place and the other doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Los Angeles and what has to be done privately
with the stadium (with no public money), it's a big ticket relative
to what's in place in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Oilers moved to Tennessee, they played the Cowboys
every three years under the current scheduling format. If Houston
gets the 32nd franchise, Jones wants to see the Cowboys playing
McNair's team every season.
</P>
<P>
   Although they would remain in different conferences and
divisions, Dallas and Houston could play in each regular season if
the league adopts a proposed scheduling format that would promote
natural rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the premises behind anything to do with realignment is
how do we create regional interest,'' Jones said. ``It shouldn't
disrupt the traditional rivalries that are already there, but we
can do this with the non-division part of your schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be ideal would be to schedule a game, like Dallas
vs. Houston, as well as natural rivals in other parts of the
country, where we can create some AFC-NFC rivalries. I wouldn't be
opposed to having home and away (games) in those particular
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that was always missing (when the Cowboys
played the Oilers) _ a real good, tight, predictable, rivalry on
the field between Dallas and Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he owns the Cowboys and knows how to generate revenue
better than any owner in the league, Jones is one of the league's
most influential power brokers. He serves on four of the NFL's most
prominent committees and is instrumental in the league's
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' belief that Houston deserves the expansion franchise and
his influence among the owners are two reasons McNair has sought
Jones' counsel since he became serious about owning a team that
would replace the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad Bob's taken the ball and run with it,'' Jones
said. ``I've seen his approach to how he wants to market the team,
and it's outstanding. It's like a Harvard study. I refer to it all
the time in terms of how he'd like to handle his sponsorships and
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of good ideas that are tailored to the
uniqueness of the Houston market. It's a great opportunity. I like
the demographics of Houston as far as where we're trying to go as a
league. For instance, our interests Hispanicly. Our interests as
far as our fan base is concerned minority-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has a league-mandated Sept. 15 deadline to produce a
sound stadium financing plan that must include at least $150
million in public money. So far, the owners have not been happy
with what LA has to offer. The league is looking at other potential
stadium sites like Carson and Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   A source in Los Angeles says LA will mount one more effort to
convince the owners that the New Coliseum at Exposition Park
deserves the team. That plan will center on Eli Broad, who is
partners with Ed Roski, offering to put up much of the money for
the $111 million primary parking garage the NFL is demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes it is in the NFL's best interests to allow
Raiders owner Al Davis to return to Los Angeles. Jones has been
working behind the scenes for months to help Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to potentially look at Los Angeles by looking at what
Oakland's situation is,'' Jones says. ``That's (his opinion) not
necessarily shared by a lot of people (in the league).
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to (help Davis), not so much for Al but for the league.
We don't need two teams up there (in the Bay Area), and I think the
answer to Los Angeles is that maybe it suits moving a team there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes the Sept. 15 deadline will pass without the
league making a decision on Houston or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see happening is nothing acceptable being done by the
middle of September,'' he said. ``I don't think we'll see an
immediate decision that's automatic (to go to Houston).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we'll see is a period of time _ more than is
probably needed _ where we say, `Hey, we tried to get the team in
Los Angeles. Let's try to get this thing done (with Houston)
sometime this year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners are pushing to find out just how much McNair can
afford on an expansion fee. Reports are that he can expect between
$500 million and $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to say, mainly because I wouldn't want to put
that on Bob one way or another,'' Jones said when asked what he
believes the expansion fee should be. ``But I'll tell you this to
consider, if Houston went back to the AFC Central, that whole group
of teams will be playing in new revenue-producing stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any reason in the world that we
shouldn't be able to come together (on an expansion fee with
McNair) because we all have the same interests. Everybody says,
`We've got to have a team in Houston. We've got to have a team in
Houston,' but it's lip service until we do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to remember is that we've still got a lot of work to
do.''

BUSH, IRRITATED BY QUESTION, WON'T DISCUSS DRUG RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS second-to-last graf in 1st take to change `reformed
alcoholic' to `recovering')  
(nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Fresh from his victory in the Republican presidential
straw poll in Iowa, Gov. George W. Bush held what was supposed to
be a routine news conference in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday to
introduce his state education commissioner. He took a handful of
questions on state issues until a reporter began to ask him about
persistent rumors that he had once used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   And then Bush got agitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happens, somebody floats a rumor and it causes
you to ask a question,'' Bush said, interrupting the questioner in
a rising voice, a tape recording of the news conference and a
transcript provided by Bush's office showed. ``And that's the game
in American politics, and I refuse to play it. That is a game, and
you just fell for the trap, and I refuse to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to answer if he thought such rumors were ``being
planted,'' Bush said: ``Do I think they are being planted? I know
they are being planted, and they are ridiculous and they're absurd
and the people of America are sick and tired of this kind of
politics and I am not participating.''
</P>
<P>
   If the exchange was surprisingly heated, Bush's response was not
unexpected. Since he defeated the incumbent Democrat, Ann Richards,
in the 1994 election for Texas governor, Bush has walked a fine
line as to which personal questions he will answer. In particular,
he has refused to say whether he has ever used illegal drugs, often
offering the same wry reply: ``When I was young and irresponsible,
I was young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the issue seems to have had little affect on Bush's
standing, even in a conservative, law-and-order state like Texas,
where he has pushed for tougher penalties against drug users.
</P>
<P>
   But as the early front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, Bush is finding that his stock response has not doused
the questions, unfounded or not, but has seemingly done the
opposite. Earlier this month, the Hearst Newspapers quoted Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, as challenging news
organizations to check rumors of cocaine use by Bush, rumors thus
far unsupported by facts. Daschle, however, quickly denied issuing
such a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the Christian conservative who finished fourth in
the Iowa straw poll on Saturday, criticized Bush's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be wrong for any possible Republican
presidential nominee to refuse to say clearly and distinctly that
they've not used drugs,'' Bauer has said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, The New York Daily News asked 12
presidential hopefuls if they had ever used cocaine and all said
no, except Bush, who did not reply to the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not going to go away,'' said Earl Black, a
political scientist at Rice University. ``With the response he is
coming up with, the national media isn't buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, however, has the media or anyone else come up with anything
to substantiate the rumors. In May, The Wall Street Journal
dedicated an article to the proliferation of the rumors and the
absence of any proof.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a Bush campaign spokesman, Wednesday
characterized the issue as ``baseless allegations and ridiculous
rumors.'' But McClellan added: ``What he may or may not have done
in the past is not the question we should be asking. It is, `Has he
learned from his mistakes?' and the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his campaign staff have admitted that he made what they
have described as youthful mistakes. In several profiles, the
governor has admitted that he drank too much beer and bourbon until
swearing off alcohol on his 40th birthday. Although he has refused
to answer questions about drugs, Bush has said without equivocation
that he has remained faithful to his wife, Laura, throughout their
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important facts that people deserve to know about have to
do with how he has fulfilled his duties as father, husband,
governor and employer,'' McClellan said. ``These are the relevant
questions about how he will fulfill his responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But as governor, Bush has taken the lead on several anti-drug
efforts, consistent with his own law-and-order philosophy. In
November 1996, after receiving reports of increased drug use among
teen-agers, Bush said, ``We must speak with one clear voice to warn
children and grown-ups of the dangers of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he signed into law a measure that toughened penalties
for people arrested for selling or possessing less than one gram of
cocaine. Previously, state sentencing guidelines required that a
judge give mandatory probation in such cases, McClellan said. The
new law allows judges to sentence such offenders to time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush signed into law a measure increasing the
punishment for anyone arrested for selling or possessing illegal
drugs within 1,000 feet of a school or a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   In broad terms, Bush has been answering, or not answering,
accusations about illegal drug use in much the same way since he
was the Republican nominee for governor in 1994. That race pitted
Bush against Ms. Richards, herself a recovering alcoholic who also
had faced unsubstantiated accusations of cocaine use in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Black, the political scientist, said that Ms. Richards
consistently dismissed the cocaine questions as irrelevant, a
precursor to the stance now taken by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the closest that Bush has come to answering the question
came in an interview published on May 3, 1994, in The Houston
Chronicle beneath the headline ``Drugs `irrelevant' to race, Bush
says.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had ever used illegal drugs, Bush replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. What's the relevance? How I
behaved as an irresponsible youth is irrelevant to this campaign.
It does not matter what I did, nor (what) Ann Richards did. What
matters is how I behave as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, Bush told Newsweek magazine that he had
declined to itemize his ``irresponsibility'' because he wanted to
set a proper example for teen-agers. ``The question is: Have you
learned from your behavior?'' Bush said in the interview. ``The
answer is yes. If I were you, I wouldn't tell your kids that you
smoked pot unless you want them to smoke pot. I don't want some kid
saying, `Well, Governor Bush tried it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush struck a similar chord a month earlier in a profile in The
New York Times Magazine. ``I'd be the first to admit that I did
irresponsible things when I was young and irresponsible,'' he said.
``I've assumed the mantle of being a governor and a father in a
responsible way, and the signal we ought to send to our children is
that in spite of what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have
learned some lessons. And the lesson ought to be, don't be using
drugs and alcohol. Learn the lessons from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, as the rumors have percolated into public
on Sunday morning talk shows, Bush has begun to frame his refusal
to answer as a stand against what he calls ``the politics of
personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the CNN political talk show ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP;
Shields,'' Bush said that such politics ``sends a signal to people
that politics is ugly, and therefore I don't want to participate.
And I understand that by not _ by refusing to play the Washington,
D.C., game of gossip _ people may draw certain conclusions about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bush added, ``it's time for some politician to stand up and
say enough is enough of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Black is not so certain. ``Maybe he gets some credit for drawing
a line about the private lives of politicians in their youth,'' he
said. ``But at the same time, if you're running for president of
the United States, you're going to get asked all kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   But McClellan, a Bush spokesman, repeated a variation of a line
that his boss often uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Americans want to know is will he uphold the dignity and
honor of the office,'' McClellan said. ``He will.''

MICROSOFT MOVES AGAINST AMERICAN ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In its latest tweak at America Online, Microsoft
Corp. announced Wednesday that it would release a computer protocol
to enable subscribers of competing instant-messaging services to
communicate with its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said the move was intended to pave the way
for communication among subscribers of the handful of major
companies offering instant messaging, a feature that allows
computer users to contact one another instantaneously and chat on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, users of instant-message services have been largely
relegated to sending messages to users within their own service. In
a pitched battle with America Online, which pioneered instant
messaging, Microsoft has sought to deliver messages from its own
subscribers to users of America Online's software without the
company's permission.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which says it has 43 million users of one form
or another on its instant-messaging software, has accused Microsoft
of hacking into its system to route messages to and from America
Online customers.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 times, America Online has changed its protocol _ the
specifications that allow two software programs to communicate _
and each time Microsoft programmers have found a way around the
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has amassed 1.5 million users of its
instant-messaging software in less than a month of service, is not
alone. Other instant-messaging competitors, including Tribal Voice,
which has five million instant-messaging members, have said they
also intend to link to users of America Online's software.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, the latest twist in the skirmish underscores a
larger issue: with 60 million to 100 million people estimated to
use instant messaging, there is growing momentum among the
competitors to create standards so their subscribers can
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a watershed,'' said Richard Dym, vice president for
marketing for Tribal Voice, based in Scotts Valley, Calif. ``In
order for this form of communication to take the next step, to
maybe even replace e-mail, we need openness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dym said the growing use of instant messaging had started
momentum in the last year to create a standard protocol so
competing services can exchange messages over the Internet. And he
said Microsoft was adding to that momentum by putting its
substantial resources and weight behind the standards quest.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, America Online said it, too, favored open
standards permitting communication among users of different
services. Tricia Primrose, an America Online spokeswoman, said the
company had been working for several weeks with the Internet
Engineering Task Force, which is overseeing the creation of
standards for a protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Dym called it ``a big-time irony'' that Microsoft was releasing
its instant-messaging protocol, since it has jealously guarded the
source code for its operating systems and software programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Bennett, vice president for marketing at MSN,
Microsoft's online division, said the comparison was unfair. He
said Microsoft's willingness to publish the protocol was consistent
with a policy to make its software widely ``interoperable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Engineering Task Force praised Microsoft. The move
will help ``in informing our development of robust, open protocols
for Internet-wide interoperability in this area,'' wrote Vijay
Saraswat and Dave Marvit, who are leading the standards committee.
</P>
<P>
   In another front in the instant-messaging battle, Microsoft
officials said Wednesday that they had identified and reprimanded
an employee who used a false identity to send a message
discrediting America Online to a computer security expert.
</P>
<P>
   The employee sent a message under the name Phil Bucking of
Bucking Consulting, but the security expert, Richard Smith, traced
the message back to Microsoft. Wednesday the company confirmed that
the message had come from an employee, who had stepped forward to
confess.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett declined to say what disciplinary action had been taken,
but defended the employee as having tried to do the ``right thing''
by publicizing what Microsoft contends is a security flaw in
America Online's system. ``This is a case of good intentions and
bad execution,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Microsoft dismissed an employee for
anonymously posting criticisms of IBM's competing operating system
on online bulletin boards. &QL;

NEWS CORP.'S EARNINGS FELL IN 4TH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ News Corp.'s earnings before an extraordinary item
fell 20 percent in its fourth fiscal quarter, as weak results from
its Fox television network offset strong gains in its Twentieth
Century Fox film division, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Australia-based media company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch,
reported after-tax earnings of $214 million, or 21 cents an
American depository receipt, for the three months ended June 30,
down from $266 million, or 27 cents, in the comparable quarter a
year ago. The results were 3 cents a share below the consensus
estimate of analysts surveyed by the First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Including a one-time cost of $224 million to convert its B-Sky-B
satellite broadcasting service in Britain to digital technology,
the News Corp. reported a net loss of $10 million, or 2 cents an
ADR, in contrast to a net profit a year earlier of $233 million, or
23 cents. Revenue for the quarter edged up to $3.27 billion from
$3.24 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The force was with the company's film division, with operating
income nearly quadrupling in the quarter to $22 million, partly
because of the new ``Star Wars'' movie, which opened in May and has
generated more than $400 million in domestic box office receipts. A
News Corp. spokesman said that strong video sales of ``Titanic''
and ``There's Something About Mary'' also contributed to the gains.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, the Fox Broadcasting Co., the television
network, did not attract as much advertising as it had expected in
the May ``sweeps'' period, lowering its profits. For the year as a
whole, the network had an operating loss because of higher
programming costs and losses incurred in broadcasting the World
Series and National Hockey League games.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox is now putting into effect a new agreement with its
affiliated stations that would allow the network to keep a greater
share of advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company recorded a big decline in income in its magazine
business because of the sale in March of its controlling stake in
TV Guide. Profits in newspapers also declined because of lower
circulation revenues at The Sun in London.
</P>
<P>
   The company also had sizable losses from such new activities as
the Fox News cable channel, satellite operations in Latin America
and various Internet ventures. But executives predict these will
pay off in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a great building year for News,'' David DeVoe,
the chief financial officer, said in a conference call with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year, net income fell nearly 41 percent to $678
million, or 67 cents an ADR, from $1.14 billion or $1.17. Revenue
rose to a record $13.59 billion from $12.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Fox Entertainment Group, which is 83 percent owned
by the News Corp., said its net income in the quarter ended June 30
jumped to $35 million, or 5 cents a share, from $3 million, or 1
cent a share, reported a year earlier. Revenue increased more than
12 percent to $1.97 billion from $1.75 billion. Fox Entertainment
encompasses the company's American television, film and sports
businesses.

U.S. PROBE OF PATAKI FUND RAISING UNCOVERS LINK TO PAROLE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY and KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scribbled note from a political fund-raiser for
Gov. George Pataki to a Pataki administration official carried a
terse directive: ``These are three names that need to be followed
up with.''
</P>
<P>
   What came next were details on three men in New York prisons _
violent felons whose relatives had made sizable donations to the
Pataki campaign in the belief, say prosecutors, that the money
would get the inmates paroled.
</P>
<P>
   The note was among a series of documents unearthed by the U.S.
attorney's office in Brooklyn in its investigation into the
campaign's fund raising, a trove that provides a rare view of
Pataki officials assisting a handful of major campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, as well as courtroom testimony, recount how the
campaign sent inquiries about the prisoners directly to the
governor's office, which passed them on to the Parole Board, which
is controlled by the governor's appointees. In fact, this week, a
parole official pleaded guilty to lying to federal officials in the
case and insisted in court that the governor's office expressed
strong concern about one of the prisoners, John Kim, who was
ultimately released on parole. The other two, John Jhang and
Boyoung Chung, were not paroled.
</P>
<P>
   While strenuously denying any wrongdoing, even some of the
governor's closest associates privately acknowledge that the
investigation has at times offered an unflattering portrait of the
Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry now seems to be expanding. The parole officer who
pleaded guilty in the investigation this week, Ronald Hotaling,
strongly suggested in court that Parole Board Chairman Brion
Travis, who was appointed by Pataki, told him of ``the interest of
the governor's office in the release'' of one of the felons.
</P>
<P>
   Several state officials have said that in recent months, the
administration has revamped the Parole Board and greatly reduced
Travis' role in running its day-to-day operations. Thomas Grant, a
spokesman for Travis, declined to comment on the current scope of
Travis' job.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also said to be focusing on a separate case
involving whether parole officials gave lenient treatment to Shlomo
Helbrans, a Hasidic rabbi imprisoned in a widely publicized
kidnapping case.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter recently entered into the court record, the
prosecutors say that a parole official ``took steps to facilitate
the release of'' Helbrans because the official felt ``improper
political pressure'' being brought on the rabbi's behalf. Helbrans
was convicted of kidnapping a teen-ager, Shai Fhima Reuven, in
1994, after Shai's mother entrusted him to the rabbi for bar
mitzvah instruction.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pataki aides dismissed the 20-month-old inquiry as a politically
motivated attempt to embarrass the governor. They said no one
received special favors, noting that of the three prisoners, only
the one with an exemplary prison record was paroled. They said that
Hotaling and Sean McSherry, a parole commissioner convicted of
perjury in the case earlier this month, were hired under Pataki's
predecessors. And both were indicted for lying when questioned in
the case, not for influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, the governor's press secretary, declined to
comment on specific documents or testimony. ``The prosecutors know
that those members of this administration involved in these cases
handled themselves appropriately and properly,'' McKeon said. ``At
some point, they are going to have to acknowledge that fact. In
fairness, it should be sooner, rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Helbrans case, prosecutors are examining whether the
parole board acted at the urging of an influential rabbi, Leon
Perlmutter, who has assisted the Pataki campaign in raising money
from Orthodox Jews. In one document, the prosecutors assert that a
parole staff employee was told by a superior that Perlmutter was
someone who could deliver votes and therefore should be listened to
on inmate releases. The employee, who was not identified, was later
contacted directly about several cases, including Helbrans,
according to the record.
</P>
<P>
   Both Helbrans and Perlmutter have denied any wrongdoing. In an
interview last year, Helbrans said, ``I didn't receive any kind of
special treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry by the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern
District of New York began in January 1998 after the parents of one
of the three inmates complained to the authorities that a volunteer
Republican fund-raiser, Yung Soo Yoo, had offered to help their son
win parole in exchange for campaign contributions but had not kept
his promise. Yoo is a prominent businessman among Koreans in the
New York region, and all three inmates were the sons of Korean
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   John Jhang's family gave at least $12,000 in 1994 and 1995 to
the campaign, while Boyoung Chung's family gave $9,500. Neither
inmate was released.
</P>
<P>
   John Kim's family and friends gave several thousands dollars,
prosecutors say. Kim was released after Korean immigrants in Queens
lobbied the Parole Board on his behalf. He was helped by his
family's close ties to Grace Koh, the governor's liaison to Asian
Americans, who also lobbied for his release.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials of the Pataki administration and campaign
later testified before the grand jury. Besides the guilty plea from
Hotaling, the prosecutors won McSherry's conviction on perjury
charges this month. Prosecutors have repeatedly contended that
McSherry caved to political pressure and spearheaded the release of
Kim undeservedly in 1996. McSherry had been known as one of the
most cautious commissioners in making release decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The documents portray a domino effect of inquiries that began
with Yoo, who sent the names of the prisoners to Patrick Donohue, a
Pataki fund-raiser. Donohue then sent the handwritten note to Jeff
Wiesenfeld, director of community affairs for the governor.
Wiesenfeld in turn contacted Travis, asking for information about
the three inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In Kim's case, the documents show that Wiesenfeld, who
supervised Ms. Koh in the community affairs office, tried to get
Kim into a work release program. ``John Kim appears to have made a
stunning turn from a life that was previously influenced and
dominated by gang interactions,'' Wiesenfeld wrote Travis on Dec.
7, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Travis responded a week later that Kim was not legally eligible
for work release because of his conviction for a violent felony.
But Travis wrote that Wiesenfeld's recommendation would be
considered when Kim was up for parole.
</P>
<P>
   The governor himself is not mentioned in the campaign and
administration records, and there is no evidence that he had any
involvement in the parole decisions. But according to court
testimony, he did cross paths with one of the contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Detective George Slater, an investigator, told the court that
Chung's mother, Incha Chung, recounted how she had met the governor
at a fund-raiser and whispered into his ear that she was ``waiting
for news.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Slater said, the governor responded that he did
not know what she was talking about and walked away.

SANTA BARBARA IS CALIFORNIA'S CYCLING CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ You don't have to travel miles to get to
uncrowded bike paths, cycling-friendly city streets and cool ocean
breezes . . . but it helps.
</P>
<P>
   About a 90-minute drive from the San Fernando Valley is the
awakening enclave of Santa Barbara. Not so sleepy anymore thanks to
a rejuvenated downtown area and a siege of trendy new shops and
restaurants, this seaside colony and tourist destination is also
one of the most cycling-savvy cities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive bike-lane system routes cyclists _ from commuters
to students to tourists _ along clearly marked lanes and specially
built paths, with careful attention paid to keeping riders on less
congested streets whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   There are no less than eight bicycle clubs in the region,
including the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition, which hosts an
annual bike-to-work day that attracts more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area has a little bit of everything. You can ride the open
road, up some pretty tough hills or just cruise the beach,'' said
Neal Mazzolini of Bicycle Bob's in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fertig, vice president of Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition,
a nonprofit group formed in 1991 to improve facilities and safety
for bicyclists in the county, is constantly amazed by the
propensity to create bike-path opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its unusual to have so much, and it's really well0used,
especially between the university (UC Santa Barbara) and the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 census survey revealed more than 4 percent of commuters
along the south coast of Santa Barbara County ride their bikes to
and from work, one of the country's highest rates, Fertig said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara is home to many historic attractions, such as the
Spanish Mission, built in 1786. In fact, you could spend a whole
day in the downtown corridor alone just visiting historic buildings
and beautiful parks.
</P>
<P>
   But the real cycling attraction is the Coast Route, which
traverses the length of the city while connecting Carpinteria on
the east to the community of Ellwood to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're between the ocean and mountains; it's a narrow coastal
strip and it's just beautiful everywhere you look,'' Fertig said.
</P>
<P>
   Well-designed signs lead riders through old-style neighborhoods
and the palatial estates of Hope Ranch on the way to the student
town of Isla Vista, home to UCSB. Ride at your own risk through the
latter locale lest you get caught up in a spontaneous block party.
</P>
<P>
   The route, like most of the city's system, is a well-laid-out
combination of streets and paths. Eventually the route essentially
turns into a bicycle freeway (although it is technically open to
pedestrians and in-line skaters) with 5{ miles of uninterrupted
bikeway that cruises up to Goleta Beach County Park, a perfect
place to take a break, catch a few rays and watch flocks of
pelicans drift by on updrafts.
</P>
<P>
   The path winds its way through the university campus on its way
up to Isla Vista. With the warm sun and cool breeze coming off the
ocean, it's amazing students get any work done. On any given
weekend there is some sort of sporting event taking place on the
facility's fields, from soccer to Frisbee-disc tossing to team
flyball _ a canine competition that is a world unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to experience this eclectic ride is to begin at the
Andree Clark Bird Refuge near the Santa Barbara Zoo. By car, take
the Ventura Freeway (101) north and exit at Cabrillo Boulevard.
Turn left under the freeway and the first right onto Los Patos Way
and park.
</P>
<P>
   From here the bike path takes off toward the beach and renowned
Shoreline Park. Every Sunday during the summer, there is an arts
and crafts fair, one of the longest running in the country. The
path gets as congested as any you'll ever experience at this
junction, so if you want to avoid the aforementioned in-line
skaters and joggers consider remaining on East Cabrillo Boulevard
and onto Shoreline Drive as it passes Santa Barbara Harbor. Here
the circuit jumps onto Meigs Road to the north and then Highway 225
to the west.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty hilly here, but the reward is a thrilling, twisting
decent into Hope Ranch. At about Mile 10, riders meet up with the
Crosstown Route at Modoc Road. Turn left and pedal another mile to
the bike path entrance on the left. From here on out, the riding is
wide open all the way up to Goleta Beach and UCSB.
</P>
<P>
   Total distance to the north side of the campus is around 17
miles. From there you can double back or take one of several
alternative routes through Goleta and back to Santa Barbara. But no
matter where your wheels take you, you'll keep coming back to Santa
Barbara.
</P>

AMERICAN AIRLINES AND PILOTS FAIL TO AGREE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines &UR;  &LR; and its pilots union failed to reach
agreement Wednesday over the carrier's planned integration of Reno
Air, setting the stage for further tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Following a last-ditch attempt by a private mediator to broker
an agreement between the two sides, the Allied Pilots Association,
which represents American's 9,500 pilots, said that the company had
rejected two key changes the union had made in a settlement
proposal that American had previously accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that management has squandered a real
opportunity to begin working toward their stated objective of
building a better working relationship with the pilots of American
Airlines,'' said Rich LaVoy, the union's president. ``We hope that
they will reconsider their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   American, which is the country's second-largest airline after
United Airlines &UR;  &LR; and is owned by the AMR Corp., said that it was
disappointed in the union's decision to reject the mediator's
proposal. The airline repeated its pledge to move forward with its
plans to integrate Reno, a small Western carrier that it acquired,
into its larger network on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The union's board of directors met Wednesday to consider how it
would respond to a unilateral move by the airline, but its options
are limited.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of pilots called in sick in February to protest the
Reno acquisition, forcing American to cancel nearly 6,700 flights
and inconveniencing hundreds of thousands of passengers. The pilots
returned to work only after a federal judge found them in contempt.
He subsequently fined the union and its two top officers $45.5
million, and the union pledged in court not to disrupt American's
operations further.
</P>
<P>
   Individual pilots could refuse to fly overtime or work to show
their displeasure with the company, but any concerted action is
likely to get the union into more trouble with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Another option that the union is contemplating would be to file
a lawsuit to block the Reno integration. Finally, the union could
file formal grievances against the company, according to its
contract, although such cases can take years to arbitrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be ugly,'' said one pilot. ``There is no doubt
about that. We've come to the conclusion that pilots' views and
concerns and career expectations and the contract itself do not
have any significance to this management team.''
</P>
<P>
   The union made its announcement after the stock market closed
Wednesday. But AMR shares fell $1.75 to close at $61.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   American bought Reno in December for $124 million, setting off
the conflict with the pilots. The union demanded that American give
immediate pay raises to Reno's 300 pilots and to 1,900 American
pilots who will be promoted as a result of the addition of Reno's
25 jets.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations beginning in March, American and
the union agreed to a series of retroactive pay raises for the Reno
pilots and also drafted a memorandum of understanding over how
future mergers would be handled.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides split over the union's insistence that
American admit that its purchase of Reno violated the so-called
scope clause in the pilot contract, which guarantees that the APA
contract covers all flying of large jets at the airline and its
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   A second sticking point concerned 472 pilots temporarily laid
off between 1993 and 1996. American offered to give them credit for
half the vacation time and pension benefits they lost. The union is
insisting that American make all the pilots whole for the lost
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is an emotional one for the union because Reno was
founded at the same time American withdrew from certain Western
routes and laid off the pilots. Reno quickly struck an alliance
with American and that deal was seen by the union as an underhanded
way for American to divert traffic to a lower-cost alternative.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now, unless American agrees to make up the difference, the Reno
pilots who will be joining American will have greater benefits than
the laid-off pilots whose jobs the union contends they took.
</P>
<P>
   American said that giving the furloughed pilots their full
benefits would cost $20 million. But the union replied that that
was the amount spread over the pilots' entire careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing to do for a group of loyal employees,''
LaVoy said, ``and it carries a very small price compared to some of
the other recent financial decisions management has made.''

 &HT;    Walker gives Braves a lesson
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Larry Walker showed the Braves a thing or two about how
to hit with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, stymied for two days at 1-for-19 with runners
waiting at second or third base, watched Walker slam a 1-2 slider
from John Rocker into the right-field seats in the ninth inning
Wednesday for a three-run home run and a 4-1 Rockies win. It was
the second home run of the game for Walker, who drove in all four
Colorado runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no fun,'' the left-handed hitting Walker said of facing
Rocker. ``I wanted to go around and hit on the right side like I
did with Randy Johnson in the (1997) All-Star Game. He throws so
hard and then he grunts and sounds so mean. Fortunately, he hung a
breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker chose a postgame workout over talking with the media
about the outing that broke a string of 15 2/3 scoreless innings
and brought him his first loss since June 29. It started poorly
with walks to Neifi Perez and Terry Shumpert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't walk two guys to get to their best hitter,'' Brian
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of the day for the Braves was that Walker, who is
playing with torn cartilage in his left knee, won't be playing
today in the final game of this series, which the Rockies now lead
2-1 after back-to-back wins.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two Walker homers in the first and ninth _ the first
of which ended a 50 at-bat homerless stretch _ was a pitching duel
fitting for any place but Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood allowed only two hits in eight innings and
retired the last 19 hitters he faced. He finished with seven
strikeouts and one walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as good a stuff as we've seen this season,'' Rockies
manager Jim Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood's only problem was Brian Bohanon was right there with
him, allowing eight hits but only one run and striking out seven
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves started the ninth against closer Dave Veres with a
walk and a stolen base by Andruw Jones, who represented the
go-ahead run in a 1-1 tie. But Veres struck out Jose Hernandez,
Eddie Perez and Gerald Williams to leave the Braves 1-for-12 with
runners in scoring position for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference in 2-0 and 0-2,'' Chipper Jones said of
the last two games. ``We wasted two good outings by our starting
pitchers. It's a shame.

<P>
   PIRU, Calif. _ Do you ever get the smell of gunpowder off you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully not,'' Mission Hills' Mike Dalton stated like the
true speed shooter he is.
</P>
<P>
   In the competitive niche of quick-draw action, the outcome of
accuracy vs. the clock is determined in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooter read. Standby,'' a tournament official bellows as a
contestant aims at the next round of the Steel Challenge Pistol
Tournament _ the World Speed Shooting Championships, staged Friday
through Sunday in Holser Canyon outside Piru.
</P>
<P>
   Then keep eyes peeled and ears tuned to the targets; those two
phrases take longer to utter than it takes the world's fastest
shooters to squeeze off five rounds after drawing a handgun from a
holster.
</P>
<P>
   After the timer chimes, it's soon over as five bullets clang
five metal targets. Blam, ping, blam, ping. Blam, ping, blam, ping,
blam, ping _ all in as little as 1.87 seconds _ last year's fastest
time on the easiest of seven stages in the Steel Challenge's course
of fire. The worst time of five rounds at each stage is thrown out
and the shooter with the lowest combined time is declared the
$3,000 winner. Not a bad payoff for a couple of minutes worth of
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to see people shoot at incredible speed with
incredible accuracy, stuff that should be in like Ripley's `Believe
It or Not,' this is the tournament to see. I'm amazed at what the
top shooters can do,'' said Ross ``Dr. Dot'' Deane of Valencia, who
placed in the top 30 of the more than 200 entrants during the 1998
Steel Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Deane's moniker came from modifying red-dot optics on pistol
scopes; his handgun of choice is a $2,500 highly-customized 9 mm
with the serial number ``Sex Machine.'' The Steel Challenge is his
favorite contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's right in my own backyard,'' said the
television sound-boom operator who works three days a week on the
sitcom ``Sports Night.'' ``Second, this is my nemesis; it's always
been very challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   He also enjoys the Steel Challenge because it is spectator
friendly, as it was so designed by co-organizers Dalton and Mike
Fichman of Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   Most speed-shooting tourneys use paper targets that make it
difficult for fans to determine scores, and slower-paced as judges
meticulously add up points. The Steel Challenge offers immediate
results _ the PING and wobble of the metal target, paint chipped
off by the bullet and a digital electronic clock that gauges times
of rounds to the nearest hundredth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is both audible and visible to all the spectators. Everyone
is aware when the shooter hits the targets or not,'' said Fichman,
vice president of a security company. ``It promotes the excitement
that we want.''
</P>
<P>
   It's shooter against the clock; nothing else matters. The worst
time at each stage is thrown out to encourage a quicker pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenaline is pumping. The time is their score, so they
know they have to push it right to the max,'' Fichman said. ``How
fast can you go until you fall off the level of control and start
missing and losing time?''
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely addictive. I shot 10 rounds from Dalton's
.45-caliber semi-automatic on the course's most basic station and
steadily reduced the time it took to nail five targets at distances
of 7 to 12 yards. Shooters must first hit four 18-inch-by-24-inch
rectangles and then an 8-inch circle that stops the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is called Smoke 'n' Hope: ``You smoke the first four
targets and you hope you hit the stop plate,'' said Dalton, a San
Fernando Police officer.
</P>
<P>
   I had only handled a pistol two previous times, but in the first
five rounds I hit 25 plates in 25 shots, whittling my time from
5.35 seconds per round to 3.54 seconds. I shot much worse the
second round but did manage a best time of 3.44 seconds. That's
3.44 seconds to hit five targets, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a time of 2.5 to 2.8 seconds, Fichman said, to
secure top honors in Smoke 'n' Hope in the stock-pistol division _
using guns with open sights, not scopes _ during the Steel
Challenge. My marksmanship was right there, prompting Dalton to
state, ``Get this man a tournament application.''
</P>
<P>
   The smiles on Dalton, Fichman and some of the tourney volunteers
on hand Tuesday were almost as wide as mine when I turned to track
my score. But they better watch out; I might just quit my day job
and head out on the speed-shooting circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton advises greenhorns to ``reach for the target, as if you
were trying to touch it with the muzzle if you could. Mentally,
that's what you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And once you hit that initial plate, it can propel you through
the next four, faster and faster as confidence builds. Like a skier
who nails the turn around the first mogul, it sets you up for the
rest of the line of bumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can equate it to any motor skill,'' Dalton sai. ``The
smoother you are, the better you are. You're watching ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, safety comes first in these events _ ear and eye
protection, chambers empty and triggers on safety when not on the
firing line. After that, it's pure excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the competitors love to shoot,'' said Jennifer Loar, 14,
of Thousand Oaks, entered in the junior category. ``I really think
it's a fun thing to do.'' &QL;

U.S. GROUP SEEKS MOTOR-SCOOTER MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, N.Y.)  (af) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Vespa, the perky little Italian motor scooter, was
immortalized by Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in the 1953
American film classic ``Roman Holiday.'' So there seems to be some
poetic justice in the news Wednesday that a group of U.S. investors
is close to a deal to spend about $650 million to acquire a
controlling interest in Piaggio Veicoli Europei SpA, the Italian
group that manufactures the Vespa.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of talks by officials of Piaggio and the Texas
Pacific Group, based in Fort Worth, came in response to a report in
Corriere della Sera, an Italian daily newspaper. The news ends a
period of speculation about the future of Piaggio, which invented
the sputtering two-wheelers after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For Italians, the surrender of the Vespa appeared to signal the
loss of yet another of the nation's industrial icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope they keep the same characteristics,'' said Stefano
Malatesta, 32, a Rome musician, who drove his first Vespa at 14 and
now owns his seventh, a white 125cc BX model.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzling over Piaggio's prospects began after the death in
December 1997 of Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, 33, the company's chief
executive, after an eight-month struggle with abdominal cancer.
Agnelli, an offspring of the family that controls the Italian auto
maker Fiat, was credited with the strategy that returned Piaggio to
profitability last year after several years of losses.
</P>
<P>
   The death in April of Agnelli's mother, Antonella Bechi Piaggio,
a major Piaggio stock owner, is said to have encouraged the search
for a strong new shareholder to insure direction and capital for
the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Abel G. Halpern, managing director of Texas Pacific Group
Europe, would say only that ``we are in serious discussions'' for
Texas Pacific to acquire a controlling share. A Piaggio executive
referred to ``advanced discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   An agreement would result in the second major recent investment
in the Italian two-wheeled-vehicle market for the group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Texas Pacific took over Ducati Motor Holding SpA, the
icon of Italian motorcycle making. Managers hired by Texas Pacific
overhauled Ducati's manufacturing plants, rebuilt the bike's image
and, on the model of Harley Davidson, or maybe Gucci, opened
exclusive Ducati stores, including one on 42nd Street in Manhattan.
Fresh models were rolled out by a new chief designer, Pierre
Terblanche.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Sotheby's Chicago showroom is expected to auction
a one-of-a-kind Ducati, the MH900e, designed by Terblanche, and
collectors are expected to bid at least $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Minoli, Ducati's chief executive, was quoted Wednesday
as saying that ``our company is not involved'' in the talks. But a
Piaggio executive noted that with a Piaggio deal, Texas Pacific's
portfolio would cover virtually the whole range of motorized
two-wheelers, from tiny 50cc Vespas to Ducati's monster bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Ducati experience must have influenced Piaggio
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Pacific is specialized in buying into a company when it
is underperforming its potential,'' said Michael Millman of Salomon
Smith Barney. ``They are sure to have a vision when they come to
Piaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Texas Pacific nor Piaggio would say how much money would
change hands if a deal is struck. But people close to the financing
said the price would be roughly $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a straw vote at a meeting of Piaggio's major shareholders
earlier this month, a majority agreed to the sale, which could be
formally concluded soon after Italians return from their August
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate management changes are expected at Piaggio, people
close to the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Piaggio, which is based in Pontedera, near Pisa, made aircraft
engines until 1946 when it came up with the Vespa _ Italian for
wasp, and so named because of the pinched shape of the vehicle's
body and its buzzing noise _ as an economical means of
transportation for Italians just emerging from wartime.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, a combination of aging products and tough
competition by Japanese leaders, including Honda, caused Piaggio to
suffer two years of losses. Piaggio's comeback began under Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he began a new generation of Vespa, with a bulbous
retro look evoking the original model, which was introduced 50
years earlier. As sales revived in Europe and beyond, Piaggio
reported a profit of $5.4 million in 1998, against losses of $28
million the previous year. Revenues rose 4 percent in 1998, to $1
billion.

BODY OF CHICAGO EXECUTIVE AND ONE MISSING DAUGHTER FOUND IN LAKE
MICHIGAN  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Coast Guard searchers found the body of a Chicago
business executive and his 7-year-old daughter floating in Lake
Michigan Wednesday, three days after they had left on an overnight
sailing trip. Also on the trip was a second young daughter, who is
still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the 39-year-old businessman, Harry C. Bull, chief
executive of Bradner Central Co., a Chicago wholesaler of paper
products, and his daughter Maddie were recovered Wednesday
afternoon off the coast of Lake Forest, a northern suburb. This was
about 12 miles from where the family's boat was found late Tuesday
south of Waukegan.
</P>
<P>
   Bull, Maddie and the other daughter, Lexi, 5, left Chicago on
Sunday night, on an overnight trip to Waukegan, 40 miles north,
while Bull's wife, Pam, and their infant son remained behind.
Relatives say that the family frequently took overnight trips on
the boat and that Bull was an experienced sailor.
</P>
<P>
   But when there was no contact from Bull on Monday, relatives
alerted the authorities, and a search began at dawn on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry had been sailing since he was a little child, and the
girls had been sailing with him since they were 2,'' said Ilyce
Tamkin, a family spokeswoman. ``They loved being on that boat. We
can't imagine what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Full results of autopsies that were performed Wednesday at the
office of the Lake County Medical Examiner will not be disclosed
until Thursday, but officials there said there was no sign of
trauma on the recovered bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McInnis, a chief warrant officer with the Coast Guard, said
the boat, a 26-foot Grampion named Semper Spero (Latin for Forever
Hope), showed no signs that it had encountered rough seas or bad
weather. Nor, McInnis said, was there any indication of mechanical
problems or other kind of distress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the boat was found with the swim ladder down and four
life jackets missing. This prompted the authorities to suspect that
Bull and his daughters had entered the water for a swim before
anything went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically when the girls would want to go swimming,'' Ms.
Tampkin said, ``Harry would take out a bunch of life jackets and
throw them out there so the girls would have something to grab on
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials suspended the search for Lexi at dusk Wednesday but
said they would resume at dawn on Thursday.

METROPOLITAN LIFE AGREES TO SETTLE LAWSUITS ACCUSING COMPANY OF
FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to add fact that settlement includes policyholders
of annuities; inserts new 19th and 20th grafs for explanation
concerning why annuity holders are included in settlement)  (sw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the nation's
second-largest life insurer, agreed on Wednesday to pay hundreds of
millions of dollars to settle lawsuits accusing the company of
cheating customers through deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, would
be the latest in a series of multimillion-dollar settlements by
life insurers accused of fraud. Metropolitan Life valued the
proposed settlement, which is intended to cover seven million
current and former policyholders who bought insurance and annuities
between 1982 and 1997, at $1.7 billion. But it will cost the
company less because of the way it is calculating the settlement,
and because costs like lawyers' fees and administrative expenses,
which could easily exceed $100 million, will also come out of that
sum.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement plan, affected policyholders
can apply for cash payments or added payouts at the time of their
deaths or simply accept bigger death benefits based on a formula
that reflects their ages and the sizes of their policies. The value
is based on what it would cost consumers to buy the additional
coverage the company is giving them, not what it is costing the
company to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Foley, a spokesman for Metropolitan Life, said the
settlement proposal was intended to cover three federal
class-action lawsuits, which were consolidated four years ago, and
dozens of related actions. All the suits contend the company used
deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching the proposed settlement with lawyers representing
policyholders, the company has denied any wrongdoing, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn I. Weiss, a plaintiffs' lawyer in New York involved in
the class-action suits, said that some consumers, depending on the
size of their policies, could receive ``hundreds of thousands of
dollars'' in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Connolly, an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts,
which has been investigating Metropolitan Life's sales practices,
said that she had not had a chance to closely study the proposed
settlement but that she expected to do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of consumers who have lost considerable
money over the years because they bought these policies,'' Ms.
Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, claimants would have two main
ways to seek benefits. They could submit claims to an independent
adjuster who could award them cash, an increase in the death
benefits of their life insurance policies or some combination.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did not seek such a claim could get an increase in
their death benefit. That increase would range from 3 percent to 16
percent of the value of that benefit, with the increase decreasing
with the age of the policyholder, said Foley, the company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement proposal comes as Metropolitan Life, which is a
mutual insurer owned by its policyholders, prepares to convert to a
publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how much of the settlement will go to policyholders is
not clear. Weiss said that his firm and others involved in the case
had spent more than $45 million on the litigation. Those firms will
also seek additional fees, which in a case against the Prudential
Insurance Company of America amounted to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that the company had already bought reinsurance to
cover the cost of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Life proposal is the latest in a recent round
of class-action settlements by life insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Prudential said it would pay past and current
policyholders at least $410 million and up to $2 billion to settle
class-action suits. Weiss, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said that his
firm had sued 44 life insurers in recent years, including
Prudential, the State Farm Insurance Cos. and the American General
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Those cases, like the ones against Metropolitan Life, involved
allegations of misleading sales practices including ``churning,''
the practice of persuading customers to exchange older policies for
newer ones by falsely contending that the new policies were cheaper
or provided more coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, according to the suits, customers were also told
that because interest rates and dividends were high, their policies
would pay for themselves after seven or eight years. These were
known as vanishing premium policies. When interest rates eventually
fell, out-of-pocket costs increased. Millions of life insurance
customers have complained to regulators that their insurance agents
did not fully explain to them how their policies would perform.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Metropolitan Life also paid a $25 million civil
penalty to settle a federal inquiry of sales practices in Florida,
where it was investigated for marketing life insurance between 1989
and 1993 as savings and retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the company had settled claims over annuities because
it thought that the insurance industry would see extensive
litigation over the investments. An annuity guarantees a fixed or
variable payment to a customer at some future time, usually
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suits contended that the company's sales
representatives persuaded consumers who already had tax-protected
retirement plans like 401(k) plans to buy annuities, which have
similar tax protections, as part of those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life said that it expected to mail information
about the settlement proposal to affected customers beginning next
week. A hearing on the proposed settlement has been scheduled for
Dec. 2 in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, where the class-action
litigation is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement provides a fair resolution to issues that have
been the subject of protracted litigation and that have affected
much of our industry,'' Robert H. Benmosche, the company's
chairman, said in a statement.

<P>
   Bank of New York, with assets of about $67 billion, is the 17th
largest bank in the country and one of the oldest. And it is not a
company typically found at the center of financial scandals. It is
a conservative, well-regarded institution that earns steady profits
from humdrum businesses like securities processing and trust
management.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also actively courts foreign companies to list their
stock for trading in the United States and has made a big effort in
the last few years to persuade Russian companies to do business
with them.
</P>
<P>
   The bank declined to comment Wednesday on the nature of the
Benex accounts it managed _ whether they were simply cash accounts,
which should have made such large transactions very suspect _ or
whether they might have also included currency trading, in which
case heavy activity in the accounts might not have been unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New York also declined to discuss what steps it takes to
monitor bank accounts it controls. There are no firm regulations
governing how banks should police suspicious activities and the
banking industry moved aggressively and successfully earlier this
year to avoid tighter money-laundering provisions sought by banking
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, banks are required to follow ``know your customer''
guidelines that mandate that bank officers should have more than
passing familiarity with people and companies opening accounts with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank needs to know the clients well enough to know what
kinds of activities are usual and what kinds are unusual,'' said
Nancy Bercovici, a senior vice president with the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, most large banks have installed
computer software that can alert bank officials to unusual
activities based on a customer's profile. Bank of New York declined
to say whether or not it has such a system in place.
</P>
<P>
   If unusual activity occurs in an account, banks file
```suspicious activity reports,''` or SAR's, into a system
monitored by the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network, as well as the country's five main banking regulators. The
reports are confidential and the Treasury's network declined to
comment Wednesday on whether or not it had received any such
reports recently from the Bank of New York.

 &HT;    Turkey earthquake devastates Atlanta family
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice and Julie Bryant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anesthesiologist Babur Kilic was supposed to board a
plane Saturday to join his wife, their five children and his
parents at their summer home in Turkey. Instead, Kilic left
Wednesday to make funeral arrangements for four of his children and
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Kilic's wife, Jan, and their daughter Natalie, 6, survived
Tuesday's earthquake. So did his mother, Turkan Kilic, although she
is in critical condition and on life-support in a Turkish hospital.
Jan Kilic is being treated at the American Hospital in Istanbul,
but family members in Marietta don't know her condition. Natalie is
reportedly unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to be strong,'' Cigdem Kilic, Babur Kilic's
sister-in-law, said Wednesday. ``He's very upset, but he's also
thankful that his wife is alive and one of his children is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The human toll from the quake had climbed late Wednesday to
3,839 dead and nearly 18,500 injured. But more than 10,000 people
are still missing, and the final death count could top 12,000, said
Yavuz Tarcan, the Turkish honorary consul in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot reach some regions yet,'' said Tarcan, a physician
who practices nuclear medicine at Grady and Emory hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Tarcan said there are unconfirmed reports that three or four
other people with North Georgia connections also died in the
temblor. The honorary consul's office has been deluged with
telephone calls from worried relatives. Some of the calls, Tarcan
said, also have come from concerned Americans with children
traveling in Turkey or with friends who live in the hardest-hit
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Babur Kilic, known to his friends as ``Bobby,'' was accompanied
to Turkey by his two older brothers, Timur and Cengiz. The three
Kilic brothers are Marietta anesthesiologists who practice at
Wellstar-Kennestone Hospital. All three graduated from the
University of Alabama school of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Nizam Kilic, was a retired pediatrician who lived
in Marietta with his wife, Turkan, also a retired physician.
</P>
<P>
   The dead Kilic children were identified as Jeffrey Michael, 6;
Jennifer Kayla, 5; David Tansan, 2; and Katherine ``Katie''
Michelle, who was born Nov. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They attended Casa dei Bambini Montessori school in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Babur Kilic's two-story brick home in east Cobb, about 10
family members and friends gathered Wednesday evening around a
television set, tracking news developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Jack Kemp, Jan Kilic's father.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp and his wife were traveling to the New England coast for a
seven-week vacation Tuesday when they heard of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we heard it wasn't their building,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, their relief gave way to shock as official word of
the children's death came by phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic, her children and her in-laws were on vacation in the
resort town of Yalova when the five-story building in which they
were staying collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan wanted to expose the kids to culture and their heritage,''
Kemp said, adding that his daughter is active in her church.
``She's a strong girl. Her faith will see her through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hurd, president of Georgia Anesthesiologists, the
23-doctor group to which the Kilic brothers belong, also cited Jan
Kilic's strong faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan is very religious,'' Hurd said. ``It's very difficult to
come to grips with things if you have no faith in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said Babur Kilic was supposed to cover for him Tuesday
night but begged off because he had not heard from his wife and was
growing increasingly concerned. Sometime overnight Tuesday, the
hospital called from Turkey to tell Kilic that his wife had been
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially heard that all the children were dead,'' Hurd
said. ``It was an answer to our prayers that Natalie survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurd and family attorney Bill Rogers described the Kilics as
extremely family-oriented and fun to be around. Both men cited the
annual Fourth of July party the Kilics hold at their house for
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Kilics also had business interests and formed a residential
development company about four years ago called KBJ Corp., Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based out of the Kilic home, most recently
developed Calvary Lake subdivision in Kennesaw.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who represents the company, said he spoke with Jan Kilic
only a few days before she left.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was going out of the country but I didn't even
ask her where. This just floors me,'' he said Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is, they both are, two of the nicest people I know,'' he
said. ``In this rush-rush world there is really nothing rush-rush
about Jan. She is so accommodating.''
</P>
<P>
   Other friends and loved ones expressed their disbelief Wednesday
that such tragedy could befall such good people.
</P>
<P>
   Zeynep Karasu, who retired as a pediatrician three years ago,
has known the Kilic family for more than 25 years. She first got to
know Nizam Kilic through their work as pediatricians. Later, his
three sons became doctors, and she worked with them at
Wellstar-Kennestone Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with Babur yesterday,'' she said Wednesday afternoon.
``He didn't know anything. Of course, none of us knew anything. The
telephones were not working.''
</P>
<P>
   She found out Wednesday morning, shortly after Kilic got the
devastating news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard. Very hard,'' Karasu said, her voice breaking.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Timur Kilic, family members were trying to cope
with the sudden loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' said Cigdem Kilic, who has been married to
Timur for 12 years. ``It's terrible. And the way they died. It's
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Others tried to remember some of the Kilics in better times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very, very nice man,'' Mehmet Yildirim, president of
the Turkish American Cultural Association of Georgia, said of Nizam
Kilic. ``He would come to all of our functions. He would donate
money. He was just a gentleman.''

CLINTONS' HOUSE WISHES: WATER, SECURITY AND GOOD PRICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA W. FODERARO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Hillary and Bill Clinton have not been too
picky about minor details, like closets and fireplaces, as they
have searched for a new house. But sources say their wish list
includes a few key things befitting a First Couple.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently want enough land to make the Secret Service
happy, ideally with separate quarters like a carriage house or barn
for agents. They like water: four of the five houses the Clintons
saw on Sunday had a pond, a brook or both, and three had swimming
pools. They wouldn't mind a great room for entertaining. They are
determined to keep the price under $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Less important are the location and architectural style of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The houses on their very public tour of Westchester County last
weekend were, geographically and esthetically, all over the map,
running the gamut from a jazzy Colonial built last year in Pound
Ridge, in the northern part of the county, to a 1925 stucco house
with leaded-glass windows in New Rochelle, to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are also now leaning toward buying rather than
renting, sources say. Even though the couple leaves Thursday for a
two-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard, their quest for a house
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Their lead broker, Kathy Sloane of Brown Harris Stevens in
Manhattan, is still looking at homes. If Mrs. Clinton runs for the
U.S.Senate from New York next year, as is widely expected, she must
establish a residence in the state by Election Day next year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Sloane refused to say precisely what the
Clintons wanted in a home. But others say that most of the roughly
75 properties Ms. Sloane has screened for the Clintons did not
offer enough security and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security issues are very high on the list,'' Ms. Sloane said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Wednesday that the Clintons would
have no further comment on their search until there is a ``ratified
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the special security considerations, the hunt for a
Clinton homestead has been more straightforward than the searches
Ms. Sloane is often asked to conduct for people relocating to the
New York area. ``I've found that many of the families I've worked
with have much more complicated personal requirements,'' Ms. Sloane
said.
</P>
<P>
   The houses the Clintons toured on Sunday are all different. The
lot sizes run from two acres to six acres-plus. The number of
bedrooms ranges from four to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the houses are all essentially traditional in style: Even
the new house has old-fashioned elements like a columned front
porch and dormer windows. Each, real estate agents say, has some
special feature, whether a drop-dead landscape or an unusual
historic detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like beautiful settings,'' one broker said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Rochelle house has seven bedrooms, a pond in front and a
pool in back. Its most beguiling feature may be its stained-glass
windows with images depicting the arts. This house, a
Tudor-Mediterranean hybrid, has the smallest tract, however, with
just two acres. It is not even technically for sale, but the owners
are willing to sell to the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   A house in Mamaroneck, on six and a half acres, resembles a
rambling Currier &AMP; Ives farmstead, with a cedar-shake gambrel roof,
dormers and a giant fieldstone chimney. Inside, the house needs a
lot of updating, but the grounds are spectacular, with a stream,
pond and pool.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Clintons lingered longest at a house in the
Edgemont section of Greenburgh. The town is short on cachet, but
this particular house has a Scarsdale postal address and its three
wooded acres are more in keeping with properties in neighboring
Scarsdale.
</P>
<P>
   This is the oldest house of the bunch, a 1901 white Colonial
with large rooms and a separate barn. It is also in a congested
part of the county, within hollering distance of Central Avenue,
whose dizzying number of chain stores serve all of southern
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   They also looked at a house in Purchase, a wealthy hamlet in the
town of Harrison. The property has four acres and a wide brook. Its
most eye-catching feature may be the dining room, whose walls are
lined, floor to ceiling, with French windows. But with an asking
price of $2.3 million the house might be too dear.
</P>
<P>
   The Pound Ridge house would place the Clintons the farthest from
Manhattan, but would offer a more countrified ambience and make
them neighbors of the actors Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. The
house, built in 1998, belongs to a builder, and its six and a half
acres include a river, pond and tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   The price is right, too: $1.7 million.

RULES SEEK NEW DISCLOSURES BY CHECK-CASHING SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to stem the flow of billions of dollars in
illegal drug profits out of the country, the Treasury Department
announced Wednesday that it would require all check-cashing
businesses and other money servicing firms to register with federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials acted after finding evidence that drug
smugglers and dealers were using some small storefront businesses
that cash checks, wire money overseas or exchange foreign currency
to launder money illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new requirements, the businesses must disclose their
locations, the owners' names and the amount of money transactions
that they handle each month. With that information, law enforcement
officials may be better able to track what businesses drug dealers
are using to wire money to overseas bank accounts or convert cash
to money orders that can easily be mailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give us, for the first time, a complete picture of the
money-servicing business,'' said Peter G. Djinis, executive
assistant director in the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's new requirement will affect an
estimated 160,000 money servicing businesses across the country,
including those as large as Western Union or as small as the corner
storefront. The registration is part of a series of steps officials
are planning to take to crack down on money laundering, in which
illegal profits from drugs or other activities are disguised to
make them look legitimate. Officials also plan to soon begin
requiring the money-servicing companies to look for and report any
suspected illegal use of their services to the federal government,
Djinis said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rochford, deputy general counsel at the National Check
Cashers Association in Hackensack, N.J., said the organization
supported the new requirements, but worried that some of them could
cause extra paperwork and added costs for the businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rochford said the money-laundering problem occurred at only a
very small fraction of check-cashing businesses. ``We do not deny
that there is a risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will be required to register with the federal
government beginning in December 2001 and will be subject to
criminal prosecution if they do not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have said that the problem is
especially acute in New York City and its suburbs, where billions
of dollars in illegal drug profits are estimated to flow through
each year. But the illegal money-laundering occurs in cities across
the country, Djinis said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1996, federal officials found that check cashers and other
money servicing businesses in the New York metropolitan area were
helping drug dealers funnel illegal drug profits to Colombia. To
try to help stop the crimes, Treasury officials began requiring the
businesses to temporarily report any transactions over $750 if the
money was going to a person or account in Colombia. Officials said
the requirement acted as a deterrent because the number of wire
transfers to Colombia appeared to drop considerably.
</P>
<P>
   The drug dealers use the small cash-checking businesses and
other storefront money servicing businesses to avoid banks, which
are required to report any suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Drug dealers have been known to set up check-cashing businesses,
using the money they have received from selling drugs on the street
to cash customers' payroll checks, which can be more easily
deposited into banks, Djinis said.
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses accept cash from drug dealers, and in return,
give them money orders or wire the funds overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 case, federal officials found that business was so
brisk at S &AMP; F Check Cashers, a small business in West New York,
N.J., that employees sometimes called armored cars to pick up the
cash, even though such a business should be getting cash from the
bank, rather than hauling it in.

CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER IN A CHEERY MOOD, COME WHAT MAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Look, I survived Bobby Kennedy,'' said Michael R.
Long, who is the chairman of New York's Conservative Party, the
owner of a seriously yuppified Brooklyn liquor store (the 1993
Chateau Margaux is $160 a bottle) and a man who can now make Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived John Lindsay. I survived Lyndon Johnson. Did the
world change? Did we go out of business? There's an overreaction
that the sky is falling and the world is coming to an end because
Hillary Clinton is running for office.''
</P>
<P>
   Looming Hillary apocalypse or no, Long is in a cheery mood these
days.
</P>
<P>
   He happily insists that he will not be pressured into making a
crucial Conservative Party endorsement of Giuliani in a likely
Senate race just because a lot of important and nervous Republicans
tell him to. He is also happy to say that he doesn't care if he is
blamed by the Republicans for helping to lose the seat, should
Giuliani be defeated by his White House menace. He has principles,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my whole life in the Conservative Party supporting
ideas that have consequences,'' said Long, who used to listen to
Ronald Reagan's 1964 ``Rendezvous with Destiny'' speech supporting
Barry Goldwater for president over and over on his record player.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that Long will get in line behind
Giuliani with minimal fuss. But he has two main conditions: That
the mayor make some compromise about his position on a form of
late-term abortion _ the mayor said Wednesday he was still opposed
to banning the procedure _ and that the mayor not be endorsed by
the Liberal Party, as he has been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start endorsing legislative candidates who have the
Liberal line, I would feel better about turning out the lights,
locking the door and going out of business,'' Long said. ``You
can't be committed to two philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Long is enjoying his moment in the August sun as a
minor party boss with a big-time supplicant. Not even 24 hours
after the more conservative Rep. Rick A. Lazio shelved plans for
the Republican Senate primary this month, Giuliani was on the phone
to Long, asking for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Can we talk?''' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't need to be said was that no Republican since Sen.
Jacob K. Javits in 1974 has won statewide office in New York
without the Conservative Party endorsement, which will be essential
upstate in a race as close as Rudy-Hillary is expected to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my way or the highway, OK?'' said Long.``I don't
believe that's Mike Long.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, 59, is a gregarious believer in the Conservative cause who
thinks that Reagan ``changed the whole face of the world,'' and who
was politically ignited by Goldwater at a 1964 speech the
Republican candidate for president made at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn and Richmond Hill
in Queens. His father was a foreman in the baggage department at
the old Pennsylvania Station. He graduated from Richmond Hill High
School, served in the Marines, got married, owned an ice-cream
store in East New York, served one term as the chairman of
Community School Board 19 in Brooklyn, spent two years on the City
Council and worked his way up in the Conservative Party. He has
nine children.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Long was paying four tuitions at Bishop Ford High
School in Brooklyn. It was 1983, and he had just come off the City
Council and opened the liquor store. ``And I really didn't have any
money,'' he said. ``And we were getting bills from Bishop Ford
saying, `This is it, we're throwing these kids out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Long paid a visit to the school. ``And the brother said, `You
know what?''' Long said. `` `You have nine children. I guess you
did what we asked you to do. Don't mind the dunning letters. I
don't know how long it's going to take you to pay us. Just don't
forget to pay us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Things are better these days. All of Long's children above
college age are employed; Long's daughter Eileen is Lt. Gov. Mary
Donohue's chief of staff. Long's wife, also Eileen, runs Rep. Vito
J. Fossella Jr.'s Brooklyn office. Business is OK at Long's Wine

   So now he is open for business with the mayor, who invited him
to dinner three months ago. ``We talked about nothing for a long
time,'' Long said. He is waiting for the mayor to make a move, and
says he has an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never done anything to me,'' said Long.

NEW OWNERS OF SAKS ACKNOWLEDGE ROUGH SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saks Inc. said Wednesday that it was not integrating
the disparate parts of its swiftly acquired retail empire as
smoothly as it had forecast at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the company acknowledged significant difficulty in
several crucial parts of the business, including the flagship Saks
Fifth Avenue stores, where analysts say a snooty merchandise mix
has been generating disappointing returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are generating year-over-year improvement in sales and
merchandise at Saks,'' said chairman and chief executive Brad
Martin, ``but I set very, very lofty expectations and it is clear I
am not going to achieve all those expectations in the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on these unanticipated shortfalls, the retailer, formerly
known as Proffitt's, with headquarters in Birmingham, Ala., said it
would meet earnings estimates of 18 cents a diluted share for the
second quarter but was lowering estimates for the year to $1.80 a
share from $2.16.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company said sales in stores open at least a
year would rise 4 percent in 1999, instead of the 6 percent it had
previously predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The news severely shook Wall Street's confidence in the company,
which had recently been a darling of analysts, who saw its stock as
a good value. First Call, which tracks analyst estimates, reported
that at least 7 of the 15 surveyed had downgraded the stock to a
hold from a buy _ a shift that First Call research director Charles
Hill characterized as ``highly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a statement Tuesday, just as the market was
closing, with the revised earnings estimates. The stock, down 27
percent since its close Monday, fell $1.8125 Wednesday, to
$17.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's, a fast-growing Southern retailer catering to the
middle market, bought Saks Holdings Inc. last September and quickly
adopted its tony name. On an acquisition campaign since 1994,
Proffitt's had been gobbling up an average of one major regional
chain a year. It now operates 352 stores under 11 different name
plates.
</P>
<P>
   But Saks was a different matter, larger and more upper crust
than the company's previous purchases. This led to gossip among New
York's fashion elite that the new Southern proprietors would
somehow not be chic enough to keep up with it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin acknowledged that the fashion mix at Saks was wrong. But
contrary to expectations, the problem appeared to be that the
stores had become too exclusive, cutting out high-margin crowd
pleasers like two-ply cashmere sweaters in favor of such
look-but-do-not-touch items as obscure haute couture evening gowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain very highest-end vendors that are not as
profitable as the new management would like,'' said Christine
Kilton-Augustine, a retail and apparel analyst with ING Barings.
``Now they are going through the vendor structure and looking to
extricate themselves from those kinds of deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin also acknowledged overestimating return in numerous other
areas. The rate of growth of its credit business was disappointing,
the company said. And Mercantile Stores, a chain it bought from
Dillard's Inc. last fall that specialized in bargain-priced
apparel, was producing only 80 percent of expected revenue.
</P>
<P>
   What angered Wall Street more than the performance of the
company was that management did not see the problems coming. The
revised annual earnings estimate was wide of the original by 30
cents to 45 cents a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What raises the concern was they missed the numbers by so
much,'' said Jeff Edelman, a retail analyst with Paine Webber, who
downgraded his recommendation on the stock Wednesday to hold from a
strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman predicted that the company would have to perform above
expectation in the future to ``rebuild confidence and
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin made clear that he thought the error was mostly in poorly
managing investor expectations rather than in poorly managing the
stores. ``The business will still generate double-digit growth,''
he said. ``It will be a solid year, albeit a disappointing one,
versus my expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Martin vowed the company would be more circumspect in the
future. ``We are returning to a much more conservative view of the
world,'' Martin said. ``We have a history of making numbers, not
missing numbers, and from this point on the numbers we sign up for
will incorporate risk involved in our business.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the new estimates finally provided a realistic
assessment of the company's abilities. ``It is a better buy now
that all the facts are on the table,'' said Craig Weichmann of
Morgan Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seemed to be that Proffitt's had the experience to
fix Mercantile Stores, but that it is unclear whether it could
manage the high-wire act between very high fashionability and the
profitability required to make the Saks Fifth Avenue stores meet
its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to spend less time on the road touting the stock and
more time executing the business,'' said Richard Church, a retail
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.

SMITH BOLTS _ AGAIN; UTAH SENATORS' FOOT-IN-MOUTH PROBLEM; GOP
STARS SNUBBING ALABAMA STRAW POLL
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.H., Utah, Iowa, Ala., Maine)  (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire was a Republican
candidate for president. Then, last month, still a presidential
candidate, he switched to the U.S. Taxpayers Party, saying the
Republicans were no longer conservative enough for him. And now?
</P>
<P>
   At one of those ``politics and eggs'' breakfasts Wednesday, this
one with business leaders in Bedford, N.H., he announced that he
was switching again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an independent,'' he said. ``And I'm enjoying it, frankly.
I feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not elaborate other than to say that he had been
reading some of George Washington's writings and that it had led
him to conclude that he did not want to participate in partisan
politics anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Did that mean that he was giving up his presidential quest,
considered quixotic by most political pros except for its
potential, in the event of a nip-and-tuck general election, to cost
the Republican nominee a few votes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a presidential campaign,'' he told the business
leaders. ``At the moment, I haven't made a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he disclosed that his wife, Mary Jo, was hospitalized on
Tuesday with chest and arm pains. For the short term, he said, her
health is his main concern.
</P>
<P>
   Later his campaign office said he would address the future of
his candidacy ``in the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hay and Goats, And Feet in Mouths
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was at his provocative, impolitic best, or worst,
Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, in a turn of phrase that was a
folksy ancestor to ``telling it like it is,'' would often say that
he was ``putting the hay down where the goats can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah's senators, Orrin Hatch and Robert Bennett, both
Republicans, do not come out of the George Wallace school of
politics, not by a long shot. But lately they have been putting
down a lot of hay _ the kind that has led to charges that they
 &UR; don't  &LR; get it.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a late starter in the 1999 presidential race, told the
annual state convention of Utah Republicans a few weeks ago that
among the many things the party had to be proud of was that ``we
don't have the gays and lesbians with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Accused of intolerance by leaders of gay and lesbian groups, the
senator maintained that while he believed that ``homosexuality is
contrary to the Bible,'' he nevertheless was ``tolerant of all
people.'' All he was trying to convey in his convention remarks, he
told The Salt Lake Tribune, was that ``gays and lesbians, by and
large, are very intelligent, highly educated, high-earning people
who support mainly Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the Hatch brouhaha slipping off the front page
than along came Bennett last week with an assertion in The
Standard-Examiner of Ogden, Utah, that Texas Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas had a lock on the Republican presidential nomination unless
he ``steps in front of a bus or some woman comes forward, let's say
some black woman, with an illegitimate child that he fathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the NAACP accused Bennett of ``racist attitudes'' and
said that ``he owes the community and the nation a public
apology.'' They received his ``regrets'' on Monday for ``having
made a comment that has been seen by some as insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   That very day, Hatch sprang back into the news, this time with a
pointed remark about Al Gore and Bill Bradley, two former Senate
colleagues who are now seeking the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both stiff, and they're both boring,'' Hatch declared
while campaigning in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But didn't they nonetheless deserve some of that famous
congressional comity from an old colleague?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to run anyone down,'' Hatch said, reaching for a
bale of rhetorical hay. ``But why not tell the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Stars in Alabama? Not the GOP Kind
</P>
<P>
   The way Republican leaders in Alabama figured it, if they
scheduled their own presidential straw poll two weeks after the one
held last weekend in Iowa, and then advertised it as the first and
only early test of Southern sentiment, they could grab a lot of
attention for Alabama and the Alabama Republican Party. But it
looks as if that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates still running after Iowa, only Alan Keyes
has committed to going to the Aug. 28 event in Birmingham. In fact,
the top Iowa finishers _ Bush, Steve Forbes, Elizabeth Dole and
Gary Bauer _ have all declined invitations, as has Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, the only candidate who did not participate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Straw polls are beauty contests with no official role in the
nominating process, of course, and candidates tend to be ambivalent
about them, participating when they see opportunity and skittering
away when they see risk. For example, Dole saw opportunity in Iowa
and crowed loudly about the importance of the poll there when she
finished an unexpectedly strong third. But when she saw little to
be gained by going to Birmingham, her spokeswoman, Chris Hawes,
said: ``Straw polls don't generate delegates. They aren't the most
efficient way to campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, Winton Blunt, says
that even if only Keyes agrees to show up, the party will go ahead
with the poll because it is a sure-fire way to energize the state
rank and file for Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody comes,'' Blunt said of any of the leading
candidates, ``it's icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had a warning for the timid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southern electorate is too important for any Republican
presidential candidate to snub,'' he said. ``If a campaign can risk
snubbing a significant portion of Republican votes, they are
swimming in the pool of presidential politics at their own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A footnote:
</P>
<P>
   After scheduling a fall straw poll of their own, only to have
most candidates reject invitations to participate, Republican
leaders in Maine, unlike those in Alabama, are having serious
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically couldn't get commitments from a lot of the top
candidates,'' said Ken Cole, the state's Republican national
committeeman. ``So I don't think it's going to happen.''

 &HT;    Schools summit targets violence
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Tears welled in the eyes of those who watched
the images and relived the tragedy of the Columbine High School
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Wounded teen-agers running from their school and into the arms
of horrified parents. Broken glass and blood-stained carpet in the
school library. Kids saying good-bye to their friends at memorial
services.
</P>
<P>
   The first Ohio Safe Schools Summit started Wednesday with what
it hopes to prevent in this state _ scenes of violence and death at
a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a video like that and see your worst nightmare as
a parent, educator or just as a human being,'' said Ben Kirby,
director of operations and school safety for the Dayton City
Schools, one of about 700 educators, law enforcement officials and
other people who attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have safety plans in all of our 47 buildings and have
coordinated our safety efforts with local authorities,'' Kirby
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day summit was created by Ohio Attorney General Betty
Montgomery and Gov. Bob Taft. It is a forum for educators and law
enforcement leaders to discuss how to keep the state's schools as
havens for learning, and to prevent Ohio from experiencing the
violent eruptions seen in Colorado, Arkansas, Kentucky and
elsewhere in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of the summit weren't new, but re-emphasized by Taft
and Montgomery. They challenged parents, teachers and adults to
involve themselves more in the lives of children, encouraged law
enforcement and schools to work more together and promised to make
school safety and academic achievement their top goals.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, which concludes today, comes at a time when juvenile
crime continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the crime rate in Ohio continues to decline. But
juvenile crime has risen steadily with a 20 percent increase in
juvenile arrests from 1987 to 1996, according to state officials.
During that same period, juvenile drug arrests have tripled.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 school year 436 kids were caught with a gun in an
Ohio school and more than 100 of those students were in elementary
schools, according to the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Taft has signed into law school safety legislation aimed at
curbing violence in schools. The law, already in effect for thisthe
upcoming school year, adds two prison terms for crimes such as
assault, burglary and breaking and entering when they are committed
in school ``safety zones.'' The zones include school grounds,
school buses and school activities. Also, The bill would also
empower authorities to expel students for up to a year for
knife-and-gun-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Cleveland, Taft and Lt. Gov. Maureen O'Connor
unveiled a legislative package that attacks juvenile crime and
allows judges to provide stiffer sentences for young offenders.

HASTERT MAKES CLEAR HE'S SUPPORTING NETHERCUTT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert on Wednesday threw his
bacKi5g behind embattled GOP Rep. George Nethercutt, under fire in
his Eastern Washington district for abandoning his 1994 pledge to
limit himself to three terms.
</P>
<P>
   Although greeted in Spokane by a costumed protester dubbed
``George the Weasel King,'' Hastert`Wldnesday raised money for
Nethercutt and indicated the House GOP leadership will use its
resources if Nethercutt has to fwnd off a Republican primary
challenger next year.
</P>
<P>
   $` ``I support him; I will support him in a primary. He is the
kind of person we need in the U.S. Congress,'' Hastert, a
seven-term Illinois congressman, said later during a Seattle
stopover.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt has garnered national publicity for backing off on
his pledge. Cartoonist Garry Trudeau lampooned him as the ``Weasel
King'' in a Doonesbury strip.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits was a pivotal issue in 1994 when Nethercutt, a
Spokane attorney, upset Democratic House Speaker Tom Foley. Foley
had served in Congress since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But Nethercutt announced in June that he will run again, saying,
``I made a mistake when I chose to set a limit on my service.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending more than $300,000 to back Nethercutt's challenge
in 1994, pro-term limits groups have launched an advertising
campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane radio talk show host Richard Clear, a major Nethercutt
booster in '94, has indicated he will run against the congressman
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Hastert and Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., defended
Nethercutt with the same argument used by Foley in his 1994
re-election campaign _ that Nethercutt has collected influence and
seniority in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked his way up on the House Appropriations
Committee,'' Hastert said. Dunn said Nethercutt has accumulated
``terrific clout for the state of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who has voted for some term limits proposals, said in
Spokane Wednesday that the issue is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to pass that the last four years. I don't
think the support is there in Congress now,'' he said. ``We had a
chance to do it. We brought it to a vote and I don't think we'll
see this again in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Northwest lawmakers elected in 1994 _ Reps. Jack Metcalf,
R-Wash., and Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho _ have announced they will
honor their three-term pledge and leave the House next year.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth has become critical of term limits, but said recently:
``I gave my word. It was part of the bargain between the voters and
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert on Wednesday termed Washington an important state in
next year's fight for control of the House. ``That's why I'm out
here today,'' he said. Hastert spoke Wednesday night at a
$1,000-a-person dinner with proceeds going to Dunn's political
action committee. Earlier in the day, he attended a $100-a-head
breakfast for Nethercutt.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf's and Nethercutt's spots are high on Democrats' target
list. And state Sen. Dan McDonald, a Bellevue
Republi_!R1 &LR; KM`eqpected to mount a challenge to freshman Democratic
Rep. Jay Inslee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a six-seat majority in the House of
Representatives. It would shrink to five if Democrats win a special
election in California to fill the seat of the late Rep. George
Brown, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert is on a seven-state tour touting the $798 billion tax
cut package passed by the Republican-run Congress just before it
adjourned for the August recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the American people want this tax bill. Our internal
polls show it,'' he said in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert lauded such provisions as elimination of the inheritance
tax, describing the GOP package as ``a fair tax plan for Americans,
especially those who get up every morning and go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will veto the bill.

Texas had a lock on the Republican presidential nomination unless
he ``steps in front of a bus or some woman comes forward, let's say
some black woman, with an illegitimate child that he fathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the NAACP accused Bennett of ``racist attitudes'' and
said that ``he owes the community and the nation a public
apology.'' They received his ``regrets'' on Monday for ``having
made a comment that has been seen by some as insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   That very day, Hatch sprang back into the news, this time with a
pointed remark about Al Gore and Bill Bradley, two former Senate
colleagues who are now seeking the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both stiff, and they're both boring,'' Hatch declared
while campaigning in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But didn't they nonetheless deserve some of that famous
congressional comity from an old colleague?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to run anyone down,'' Hatch said, reaching for a
bale of rhetorical hay. ``But why not tell the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Stars in Alabama? Not the GOP Kind
</P>
<P>
   The way Republican leaders in Alabama figured it, if they
scheduled their own presidential straw poll two weeks after the one
held last weekend in Iowa, and then advertised it as the first and
only early test of Southern sentiment, they could grab a lot of
attention for Alabama and the Alabama Republican Party. But it
looks as if that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates still running after Iowa, only Alan Keyes
has committed to going to the Aug. 28 event in Birmingham. In fact,
the top Iowa finishers _ Bush, Steve Forbes, Elizabeth Dole and
Gary Bauer _ have all declined invitations, as has Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, the only candidate who did not participate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Straw polls are beauty contests with no official role in the
nominating process, of course, and candidates tend to be ambivalent
about them, participating when they see opportunity and skittering
away when they see risk. For example, Dole saw opportunity in Iowa
and crowed loudly about the importance of the poll there when she
finished an unexpectedly strong third. But when she saw little to
be gained by going to Birmingham, her spokeswoman, Chris Hawes,
said: ``Straw polls don't generate delegates. They aren't the most
efficient way to campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, Winton Blount,
says that even if only Keyes agrees to show up, the party will go
ahead with the poll because it is a sure-fire way to energize the
state rank and file for Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody comes,'' Blount said of any of the leading
candidates, ``it's icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had a warning for the timid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southern electorate is too important for any Republican
presidential candidate to snub,'' he said. ``If a campaign can risk
snubbing a significant portion of Republican votes, they are
swimming in the pool of presidential politics at their own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A footnote:
</P>
<P>
   After scheduling a fall straw poll of their own, only to have
most candidates reject invitations to participate, Republican
leaders in Maine, unlike those in Alabama, are having serious
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically couldn't get commitments from a lot of the top
candidates,'' said Ken Cole, the state's Republican national
committeeman. ``So I don't think it's going to happen.''

 &HT;    Contempt order sought against Bush
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lawyers for a fired state executive on Wednesday
said Gov. George W. Bush should be held in contempt of court for
filing a false affidavit in a lawsuit involving the Texas Funeral
Service Commission. Attorneys for Eliza May, the former head of the
commission, asked a court to sanction Bush for filing what they
called a false statement while trying to kill a subpoena issued by
May as part of her lawsuit against the state and the world's
largest funeral service company.
</P>
<P>
   May is alleging that Bush played a role in pressuring her to
finish her investigation of Houston-based Service Corporation
International. SCI founder and chief executive, Robert Waltrip, is
a long-time Bush family supporter who contributed to former
President Bush's library in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt motion against Bush is based on an affidavit the
governor filed last month. In the sworn statement, Bush said, ``I
have had no conversations with SCI officials, agents, or
representatives concerning the investigation or any dispute arising
from it. I have no personal knowledge of relevant facts of the
investigation nor do I have any personal knowledge of relevant
facts concerning any dispute arising from this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   May's attorneys say the affidavit is false.
</P>
<P>
   They point to quotes in the Aug. 16 edition of Newsweek magazine
in which Johnnie B. Rogers, an attorney for SCI, said he and
Waltrip were in the governor's office in April 1998 to drop off a
copy of a letter demanding that the commission end its
investigation. While there, Rogers said Bush passed by and said to
Waltrip, ``Hey Bobby, are those people still messing with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then, according to Rogers, addressed the attorney, ``Hey,
Johnnie B. Are you taking care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has acknowledged the exchange, but said it was not
substantive and did not involve the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 20-second conversation,'' Bush said Wednesday, as
questions of his involvement in the case continued to follow him.
``I had no substantive conversation with the guy. I never sat down
and discussed it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember what I said, for starters,'' added Bush, who
became perturbed by reporters' questions over the matter. ``And
secondly, I poked my head in the office for no more than 20
seconds. And that's it. That's all that was discussed. This is a
frivolous lawsuit. It's frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the contempt motion
was ``Nothing more than a publicity stunt and an example of the
frivolous misuse of the civil justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest court filing likely means that the lawsuit will
remain on the national media radar, where such publications as
Newsweek and Salon magazines have raised questions about Bush's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Bush, who has said he has no personal knowledge
about the investigation, said they are reviewing the contempt
motion and are working on a formal response. It is not clear when a
judge will consider the issue. A hearing in the case is set for
Aug. 30 to deal with Bush's request to kill the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the head of the board that oversees the funeral
commission authorized the comptroller's office to assume
administrative control of the agency while a new executive director
is sought. But he limited the scope of the comptroller's authority,
making clear that the comptroller should not address the SCI
controversy or other matters that involve license revocations,
investigations or administrative penalties. Comptroller Carole
Keeton Rylander on Monday assigned Deputy Comptroller Mike Regan to
assume control of the funeral commission after Chairman Dick McNeil
told Bush's office that he had no one left at the commission who
could act as director. After May was fired in February, two other
men took over as acting directors, but both have left the
beleaguered agency.
</P>
<P>
   While director of the commission in 1998, May, a Democrat,
investigated SCI's embalming practices. The investigation ended in
proposed fines of $445,000.
</P>
<P>
   May said the company tried to get Bush's office to stop the
investigation and said two top Bush aides threatened to take over
the inquiry if she didn't quickly wrap it up. The fines are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   May sued the state and SCI in March, one month after being
fired. She said SCI illegally interfered with her job and accused
the state of firing her for speaking out about interference from
the Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
   In charging that Bush filed a false statement, May's attorneys
also point to a June 11 court document in which SCI attorneys,
responding to a question, said, ``Mr. Robert Waltrip spoke to
Governor George W. Bush regarding Mr. Waltrip's April 15, 1998,
letter to the Texas Funeral Service Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, the company amended its answer to say, ``The
governor exchanged pleasantries with Mr. Waltrip. The very brief
conversation among Governor Bush, Mr. Waltrip and Mr. Rogers was
not substantive; they did not discuss the content of Mr. Waltrip's
April 15, 1998, letter or SCI's complaints about the Texas Funeral
Service Commission's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Miller, a spokesman for SCI, said the amended answer only
clarified the first statement.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion, May's attorneys, Derek Howard and Charles
Herring Jr., said the original answer makes clear Bush had
knowledge of the investigation and spoke to Waltrip about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush could not have made that statement (to Waltrip
and Rogers) unless he had personal knowledge of at least certain
'relevant facts' concerning the 'dispute','' the attorneys wrote in
the contempt motion. ``Obviously he knew of the dispute, he knew
Waltrip's and SCI's general position in the dispute and he knew
that a meeting took place on April 15, 1998 at the governor's
office.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Nathaniel Kleitman, known as the father of contemporary
sleep research and one of the discoverers of rapid-eye-movement, or
REM sleep, died on Friday at the Rehabilitation Center of Beverly
Hills in Los Angeles. He was 104.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of REM came in 1953. Kleitman and his student Dr.
Eugene Aserinsky at the University of Chicago, recorded regular
periods of jerky eye movements during sleep. They also showed that
people who were awakened in this period, which the researchers
called REM sleep, recalled having dreams, while those awakened in
non-REM sleep did not.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Kleitman and another student, Dr. William Dement,
reported that certain kinds of eye movements were associated with
certain types of motion in dreams, and that the average person
dreamed a total of about two hours every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we'd found the dream,'' said Dr. Wilse
Webb, a professor emeritus in psychology from the University of
Florida and a historian of sleep disorders. ``More critically, it
showed that sleep was an active process instead of a passive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleitman was ``the first to take a deep, complete, absorbing
interest in sleep, the first to compile the knowledge of sleep into
a unified text, and with his students, the first to map out the
multiple discreet stages of sleep,'' said Dr. Allan Rechtschaffen,
professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kleitman's studies at Chicago dispelled the popular myth that
sleep was caused by a lack of blood to the brain, or the collection
of ``fatigue toxins.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, the University of Chicago Press published his
collection of sleep studies, ``Sleep and Wakefulness,'' (revised in
1963 and 1987), which ``was the Bible on which contemporary sleep
research is founded,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleitman's work eventually extended into studying sleep cycles.
In an effort to see if human subjects _ namely, himself and an
assistant, Bruce Richardson _ could adapt to a 28-hour day, they
lived in Mammoth Cave, Ky., for over a month in 1938. Since the
temperature in the cave was perpetually 54 degrees and there was no
natural light, there were no environmental cues to the time of day.
Though Kleitman said he could not sleep until 10 p.m. surface time,
Richardson adapted.
</P>
<P>
   In the cave, Kleitman measured body temperature and discovered
that there was a slight but regular fluctuation throughout the day,
and that peak efficiency occurred while body temperature was
highest. He applied this knowledge shortly after World War II,
recommending that soldiers and industrial workers stick to regular
shifts so that their bodies could adjust to a 24-hour cycle,
allowing them to stay more alert than if they continually switched
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   His research took Kleitman to other unusual places. In 1948 he
spent two weeks on a submarine, the Dogfish, studying the sleep
patterns of sailors who might spend days without seeing the sun. He
found that they worked more efficiently if there were fewer split
watches. He also once traveled to Tromso, in northern Norway, to
see if inhabitants of the Arctic Circle, where winter plunges the
sky into months of darkness while summer brings unending daylight,
slept on a different schedule. The answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Kleitman performed sleep deprivation experiments,
many on soldiers, to study the effects of lack of sleep. He once
stayed awake 180 hours, or a week plus half a day, and noted that
forcing someone to stay awake was an effective form of torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``One gets to the point where he would confess anything just to
be allowed to sleep,'' he told The Saturday Evening Post in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the myths that Kleitman helped dispel included the
notion that newborn babies need 20 to 22 hours of sleep a day (he
found that 15 hours was the norm); that an hour of sleep before
midnight is worth two or three hours later on; that dreams last
only a few seconds (they run from 10 to 30 minutes), and that
everyone ought to wake up bright and vigorous after a good night's
sleep (being groggy is normal).
</P>
<P>
   Dement, the former student who is now director of the Sleep
Disorders Center at Stanford University, said, ``The main thing
that Kleitman did was to create an identity for the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, many medical centers have sleep research laboratories,
and the subject is taught in an increasing number of medical
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Kleitman was born in Kishinev, Russia, in 1895. He
came to the United States in 1915 and earned his B.S. degree four
years later from what is now City College, in New York. In 1920 he
received his M.A. from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   After two years as an instructor in physiology and pharmacology
at the University of Georgia, he returned to graduate school and
earned his Ph.D. in physiology from Chicago in 1923. From then
until 1925, a National Research Council Fellowship allowed him to
study at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and the
University of Paris. In 1925 he became a faculty member in
physiology at Chicago, where he would spend the next 35 years,
until his retirement as a full professor in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, he participated in many symposiums on sleep,
dreaming and related topics, said his daughter Esther Kleitman. On
June 2, 1995, at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies
meeting in Nashville, he spoke about subjects like why infants wake
up to nurse. Attendees celebrated his 100th birthday, Dement
recalled, and, ``He was treated like a rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleitman's wife of 50 years, the former Paulena Schweizer, died
in 1977. Besides his daughter Esther, who lives in Los Angeles,
Kleitman is survived by his daughter Hortense Kleitman Snower of
Kansas City, Mo.

AD COLUMN: CUNARD LOOKS TO ITS PAST IN NEW $12.5 MILLION CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Carnival Corp. and a group of investors paid $500
million for the Cunard cruise ship line a little more than a year
ago, some cruise industry executives wondered why. After all, just
a few years earlier, when the Walt Disney Co. was looking to enter
the cruise business, a Disney executive told a British newspaper:
``We have no interest in Cunard or the QE2. It is seen in the
industry as something of a liability.''
</P>
<P>
   While lacking in diplomacy, that assessment was basically
correct. Even though Cunard's flagship, Queen Elizabeth 2, was the
most famous cruise ship afloat, both the ship and the company had
been adrift for several years. The low point occurred during a
trans-Atlantic voyage in December 1994, when the newly renovated
QE2's pipes exploded, toilets erupted and passengers were on the
verge of rioting. That embarrassment cost the ship bookings and
cost Cunard $13 million to settle the claims of angry passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnival executives were confident that in buying Cunard,
whose 158-year-old pedigree and name were unequaled among people
who wanted to travel in style and were willing to pay for it, they
were buying ``a brand equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months they merged Cunard with the company's other
upscale brand, Seabourn Cruise Line, and during the next five
months, through the end of the fiscal year that ended Nov. 30,
Cunard wound up with a modest profit of $35 million. While that was
not a bad first step, Carnival, which last year made more than $1
million of profit a day, has larger long-range ambitions for its
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Cunard plans to spend $12.5 million on a worldwide all-print
advertising campaign that will get under way by month's end and run
until December 2000. The campaign will appear in 14 newspapers in
the United States, from New York to California, including The New
York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The
Washington Post, USA Today and The Miami Herald; in nine upscale
magazines including The New York Times magazine, Travel &AMP; Leisure,
Conde Nast Traveler, Gourmet, and Forbes FYI and five travel trade
publications. The same campaign will also appear in Australia, Asia
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``Continuum Campaign,'' the Cunard ads do not seek to
be all things to all cruise line passengers, but to recapture the
elegance and mystique of ocean travel _ of the time, as one ad puts
it, ``when gentlemen on Queen Mary dressed for dinner, and
passengers wore T-shirts  &UR; under  &LR; their clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the motto ``Advancing Civilization Since 1840,'' and with
at least several ads headlined, ``Those who worship change simply
don't understand tradition,'' the ads speak to ``timeless
elegance'' and a ``gracious atmosphere,'' while turning up their
collective nose at ``a world of mass production and glitz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign's tone is reminiscent of a bygone era _ where
civility and manners were traits of ladies and gentlemen, and
Cunard was the only way to cross,'' said Dorn Martell, senior
creative vice president of Tinsley Advertising of Miami, which has
the account.
</P>
<P>
   The new ads blending Cunard's rich history and past advertising
appeals are based on extensive research. To achieve historical
authenticity, Tinsley researched the Cunard archives at the
University of Liverpool and in the Maritime Museum in Liverpool,
Cunard's original home port.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backgrounds of every ad contain the actual technical
drawings of ships like Aquitania, Oregon, Queen Mary and Royal
George,'' Martell said. ``The illustrations are gleaned from
sources like the original brochure for Lusitania and photos of
classic maritime architecture like the Palladian lounge from
Aquitania, all melded with contemporary images from the QE2.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Pimental, the chief executive of Cunard and Seabourn,
views this as the perfect time for ads in this style. ``While most
of the cruise industry is trying to differentiate itself from the
formality of classic cruising,'' he said, ``we feel there is a
niche for us where people still desire the graciousness and
elegance that has always been our tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the QE2, Cunard's fleet includes the
700-passenger Caronia, which is expected back in service in
November after being refurbished, and a new ship that is being
billed as the world's biggest ocean liner, planned for introduction
in about three years. The Caronia, formerly the Vistafjord, is a
single-stack liner and the third Cunard ship to bear the Caronia
name.
</P>
<P>
   The overall cruise market reached a record 5.4 million
passengers last year and is expected to continue growing as long as
the economy remains healthy. The luxury cruise segment, generally
thought to be about 15 percent of the market, is also expected to
grow, although competition from luxury resorts will be more intense
than ever. To counter that threat, Cunard is lowering its rates an
average of 20 percent next year, while hoping that its reputation,
tradition and new ad campaign will fill more berths as it sails
into the new millennium.

BOXERS EMBRACE BIG BEAR SOLITUDE

   BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. _ In the summer, there's hiking, fishing
and boating. Come winter, there's skiing.
</P>
<P>
   This area known for its outdoor sports, however, could soon
become boxing's mecca for training.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters from South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico and Poland _
even less exotic locales like Oxnard, New York and Detroit _ flock
to this mountain hideaway to prepare their bodies and minds for the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   They believe training in high altitude _ 7,200 feet _ improves
their endurance, although doctors debate the effects. The solitude,
they know, bolsters their psyche and allows them to concentrate on
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bear boom started nine years ago with just one )Jgamp _
Larry Goossen's Boxing Gym. Local fighters such as Gabriel and
Rafael Ruelas became its mainstays. Today, Big Bear Lake supports
four camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal for me as a manager is you have isolation, number
one,'' said Scott Woodworth, who has trained his fighters _ Roberto
Garcia, Orlin Norris, Felipe Campa, Israel Correa and Carlos
Madrigal _ here for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of things to do to get in trouble up
there. When you have guys come to Vegas early in their careers,
there are a lot of temptations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the altitude. With that kind of wind, the running and the
training, by the time you get back down to sea level you are going
to have more (stamina) in the (later) rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The area got a big boost from Oscar De La Hoya, who helped make
it fashionable to train here. Emanuel Steward has a gym here, Kronk
Gym West. Larry Goossen's Boxing Gym is now the Big Bear Boxing &AMP;
Fitness Gym.

SIR HUGH CASSON, 89, ARCHITECT; KED BRITAIN'S ROYAL ACADEMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WARREN HOGE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sir Hugh Casson, a British architect who served as
president of the Royal Academy of Arts, designed the interiors of
royal family residences and in later years taught Prince Charles
the techniques of watercolor painting, died on Sunday in London. He
was 89.
</P>
<P>
   A man with a winning personality and buoyant sense of humor, he
managed to become a favorite of the establishment while earning a
reputation during his tenure from 1976 to 1984 at the Royal Academy
for opening up the august institution to the British public. He
also gave it financial stability through his personal fund-raising
and the creation of corporate memberships and the Friends of the
Royal Academy, an association of supporters that today numbers
85,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   He was an early proponent of the blockbuster show, and he was
known to appear outside the academy's Burlington House building on
Piccadilly on weekends to count the people waiting in line to see
such exhibitions as a sellout show on Pompeii in 1977,
``Post-Impressionism'' in 1979, ``The Great Japan Exhibition'' in
1981 and ``The Genius of Venice'' in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He became a public figure in London in 1951 when he was named
the director of architecture of the Festival of Britain, the urban
fair that gave a boost to national morale after the war and
produced the first major postwar public buildings in the heavily
bombed city, the Royal Festival Hall and the cultural complex on
the south bank of the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing 40 architects and designers, he demonstrated a talent
for organizing and motivating colleagues while fostering a degree
of cooperative calm unusual for creative projects. ``I'm quite good
at getting a lot of people, particularly artists, working together,
`` he said, ``without quarreling, that is.''
</P>
<P>
   His achievement and his social skills brought him to the
attention of the royal family, and he was knighted in 1952. He
created the street decorations for the coronation of Queen
Elizabeth in 1953 and took on commissions to remodel and furnish
five rooms at Windsor Castle, decorate several more at Buckingham
Palace and design the interiors for the royal yacht Britannia.
``The overall idea was to create the idea of a country house at
sea,'' he said. ``I think we succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   He took up illustration and watercolor later in life and became
an informal artistic tutor to Prince Charles, often setting up his
own easel next to the prince's in the gardens at the heir to the
throne's Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire. In an introduction
the prince wrote for a collection of watercolors shown at Hampton
Court Palace last year, he said, ``I have been lucky enough to
obtain wonderfully useful hints from such accomplished artists as
Sir Hugh Casson who, on his own admission, sketches with pen and
watercolor in the same way that other people hum tunes.''
</P>
<P>
   The two shared a dedication to architectural conservatism, and
Casson's design for the Ismaili Center opposite the Victoria and
Albert Museum was among the few contemporary buildings that the
prince admired.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Maxwell Casson was born on May 23, 1910, in London, the son
of Randall Casson of the Indian civil service and the nephew of Sir
Lewis Casson, a theatrical producer who was the husband of the
actress Dame Sybil Thorndike. He went to Eastbourne College
boarding school and St. John's College, Cambridge, where he studied
architecture and won a fellowship for a postgraduate year at the
British school in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   In London he and a partner set up a private architecture and
interior design practice. During World War II he helped camouflage
Royal Air Force hangars and served in the Ministry of Town and
Country Planning. In 1948 he was named to the Festival of Britain
post.
</P>
<P>
   He was an avid conservationist, but he puzzled admirers by
remaining architectural adviser to Bath City Council while much of
the city's Georgian heritage was being destroyed and to Brighton
while that city was allowing its Regency buildings to fall to the
wrecking ball. Friends attributed the lapses to Casson's desire to
please, which made tough decisions unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   His partnership produced buildings at Cambridge and Birmingham
Universities, civic and bank structures elsewhere in England and
the Elephant House at London Zoo, the work of which he was most
proud. He was not an outstanding architect and did not claim to be,
once calling his buildings ``unmemorable.''
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the Royal College of Art for many years, assisted
by his wife, the former Margaret MacDonald Troup, a South African
architect and interior designer he married in 1938. She and three
daughters survive him.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke often in public and in broadcast conversations and
debates, and he wrote columns for newspapers and a well-received
book on Victorian architecture.
</P>
<P>
   An elfin figure compact enough to have served as a coxswain for
the rowing team at Cambridge, Casson was often seen around London,
a scarf thrown about his neck, perched on walls sketching one of
his familiar pen and wash impressions of the city's streets and
parks.As prime minister, Margaret Thatcher chose one he did of 10
Downing Street for her official Christmas card in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   A man constantly on the run, he served on scores of committees
and boards and professed to be unbothered by criticism that he
spread himself too thin. He once compared himself to ``a sort of
water beetle who skims very fast over the surface but doesn't go
very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who questioned his comfort with the establishment and
reverence for tradition, he had a characteristically propitiating
response. ``To have an avant-garde,'' he said, ``you have to have a
garde.''

EDWARD L. PALMER, WHO HELPED DEVELOPED `SESAME STREET,' DIES AT
66 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward L. Palmer, a media consultant who fused education with
entertainment, and helped in the early development of ``Sesame
Street,'' died on Aug. 1 at a hospice in Ithaca, N.Y.. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from prostate cancer, said his wife,
Vera B. Bauer-Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was among the first people hired in 1968 by Children's
Television Workshop, the parent company of ``Sesame Street.'' The
workshop was impressed by his research at the University of
Michigan into the responses of preschool children to television.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's findings indicated that children took delight in
watching other children and animals, that they liked music and
slapstick, wanted characters to be kind to one another and were
bored by talking adults.
</P>
<P>
   These insights contributed to the development of characters like
Big Bird and Grover when ``Sesame Street'' made its debut in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was, to a great degree, the one who figured out how to
build educational content into television for young children in a
way that's beneficial and entertaining,'' said Shalom Fisch, vice
president for program research at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer served as Children's Television Workshop's vice president
for research for 16 years and was senior research fellow for three
years afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He helped develop several adult programs and three other
well-known children's shows, including ``Electric Company,''
``3-2-1 Contact'' and ``Ghostwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the workshop in 1987, Palmer formed World Media
Partners, a company that helped develop educational and health-care
televisions program for use in developing countries. His clients
included Unicef, the Johns Hopkins University School of Public
Health and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Leon Palmer was born in John Day, Ore., on Jan. 20, 1933.
He earned a bachelor's degree in English at Western Oregon
University in Monmouth, and a doctorate in educational measurement
and research design at Michigan State University in East Lansing in
1964. Later, he taught communications and education at the Harvard
Graduate School of Education, the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and Florida State
University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Palmer is survived by three daughters,
Meredith Alberta of Ithaca, Linda Morrison of Fort Collins, Col.,
and Patti Bosomworth of Vancouver, Canada.

APOLLO THEATER IS SAID TO REJECT A RICHER BID AS TALKS CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Apollo Theater has rebuffed a multimillion-dollar
bid to finance and distribute the weekly program ``It's Showtime at
the Apollo'' and is expected to make a less lucrative deal with
Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president, and his
financial backers, officials and lawyers involved in the
negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BKS Entertainment, a television syndication company that
distributes and markets programs aimed at minority viewers, bid on
the ``Showtime'' contract on Aug. 6 after learning that Time Warner
was to take control of the board of the Apollo Theater Foundation.
The foundation is the nonprofit organization that runs the theater,
a state-owned Harlem landmark where the popular variety program is
taped. BKS said it was willing to retain Sutton's company, Inner
City Theater Group, as the producer of ``Showtime.''
</P>
<P>
   The program lies at the heart of a lawsuit filed by the state
attorney general's office in November that accused six directors of
the Apollo, including the chairman, Rep. Charles Rangel, a Harlem
Democrat, of failing to collect $4.4 million owed to the theater by
Inner City. Rangel and Sutton, who are political allies, have
denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in the only bid for ``Showtime,'' Sutton's
company offered $250,000 a year for a three-year contract to
produce the program _ a bid that he described Wednesday as only a
``minimum'' figure. The Apollo board rejected the offer at its July
meeting and asked Sutton to increase it. As of late Wednesday, the
terms were being negotiated, lawyers for Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer has said that the state's
lawsuit will not be settled unless Time Warner approves the terms
of the deal with Inner City and Sutton's longtime financial backer,
Western International Syndication.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Adler, a Time Warner spokesman, would not discuss the
negotiations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Without a letter from Time Warner, there is no chance that the
lawsuit will be resolved at a board meeting that was scheduled for
Thursday morning, said Scott Brown, a spokesman for Spitzer. Brown
said that although the language in the settlement agreement does
not specify it, it is understood that other conditions include
Rangel's stepping down as chairman and the addition by Time Warner
of 10 new members to the theater's nine-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has approved a settlement provision that exonerates the
defendants in the lawsuit. It says that he has determined that the
Apollo board ``acted in good faith in pursuit of the best interests
of the foundation'' and that Inner City and Sutton ``acted in good
faith in their dealings with the Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would require the Apollo to demonstrate within 30
days that it has received a total of $1 million _ the minimum
amount that Spitzer has concluded that the theater is owed _ from
various sources. Sutton has agreed to contribute $150,000 to the
total amount, which is described in the agreement as a contribution
to pay for future audits of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The parties were on the verge of signing the agreement last week
when BKS's offer became public. In the days since, Sutton and
lawyers for the Apollo have sought to plant doubts about BKS's
ability to back up its offer to guarantee the Apollo $5 million
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Sutton accused BKS of ``showboating'' by arriving
late in the game _ the taping of 12 episodes of the show is
scheduled to begin Aug. 26 _ and making a lavish bid. ``There's no
way on God's green earth that these people could pay a million
dollars a year and make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But BKS, a four-year-old company run by Robert I. Silberberg and
Leonard Koch, both veteran syndicators, already distributes a
weekly music program, ``Russell Simmons' One World Music,'' which
is produced by Black Pearl Entertainment in association with Warner
Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Western International Syndication, which is owned by
Interpublic, gets most of its business from ``It's Showtime at the
Apollo.'' The company also distributes a weekly children's program
called ``Field Trip.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE COMING BATTLE FOR SUCCESSION IN RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PHILIP TAUBMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newly forged alliance between two of Russia's most cunning
politicians, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow and Yevgeny Primakov, the
former prime minister, brings to mind the 1939 German-Soviet
nonaggression pact that briefly linked the two nations at the
beginning of the Second World War. The compact unveiled this week
offers temporary tactical advantages to both men, but like the
nonaggression pact that ended with the German invasion of the
Soviet Union in 1941, it seems destined to be broken when either
party decides it is no longer convenient.
</P>
<P>
   The show of unity, which came with the support of several of
Russia's powerful regional governors, is just one of the political
maneuvers now bubbling into view as Russia prepares for
parliamentary elections in December and presidential balloting next
summer. Another gambit was Boris Yeltsin's decision to dismiss yet
another prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, and to designate Vladimir
Putin not only as prime minister but as Yeltsin's favored candidate
for president.
</P>
<P>
   All the machinations may seem hard to follow from afar, and much
about Kremlin politics remains obscure. But compared with the
mystery that used to envelop Russian politics at the highest level,
today's shifting alliances are unabashedly and refreshingly
transparent. The next year promises to bring all manner of phony
deals and nasty betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   They may strain the fabric of Russian democracy, and the outcome
may not advance the cause of reform, but at least the Russian
people will see many of the stratagems unfold and will have the
final word in picking their leaders. That is, if Yeltsin does not
try to cancel one or both elections, a common fear. The prospect
seems unlikely, but not inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   It was not so long ago that the furious maneuvering in the
Kremlin was conducted out of public view. Even after the lethal
diktats of Stalin were memory, the Communist Party bosses preferred
to operate in strict secrecy. In his memoirs, Mikhail Gorbachev
recalls the backroom dealing that denied him the chance to succeed
Yuri Andropov in 1984, and the crucial endorsement of Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko that brought Gorbachev to power in 1985
after the death of Konstantin Chernenko.
</P>
<P>
   All was done by the Politburo and Central Committee without a
moment of open debate. The problem today is sifting through an
abundance of information in Russian newspapers, magazines,
television broadcasts and Web sites, much of it unreliable. Every
political act is closely analyzed, and every politician seems to
have a cadre of aides ready to spin out theories about what is
really going on. American politicians would feel right at home.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Yeltsin exits without a fight, the battle lines will be
drawn over whether his policies and government should be extended
through a potential heir like Putin, or tossed in the incinerator
of Russian history alongside Gorbachev's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Both Primakov and Luzhkov clearly entertain presidential
ambitions. After working for the mercurial Yeltsin, Primakov no
doubt relishes the prospect of being in charge himself. He commands
wide respect among Russians for steadying the country after last
summer's economic collapse, and appeals especially to the dwindling
but powerful bloc of older voters aligned with the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov runs Moscow like a duchy and seems impatient to do the
same with Russia. He is viewed as an effective if unscrupulous
executive who has made Moscow a sanctuary of relative prosperity in
a nation of economic adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, though unversed in electoral politics, has a chance to
impress voters by managing the government efficiently, if Yeltsin
allows him to remain in office. His close ties with internal
security agencies provide an opportunity to harass his opponents.
Primakov, with his own intelligence connections, may prove to be a
formidable rival in this contact sport.
</P>
<P>
   There are other potential candidates, including Gennady
Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader; Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
former prime minister; Alexander Lebed, the
general-turned-politician; and Grigory Yavlinsky, the one committed
reformer in the field.
</P>
<P>
   If Primakov and Luzhkov sustain their alliance, with one
accepting the role of junior partner, they will be hard to beat. If
the partnership dissolves, look for a 15-round heavyweight fight,
with punching below the belt.

PETTITTE SPARKLES, BUT ROYALS TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte was challenging Carlos Beltran and Tim
Spehr in critical situations Wednesday night, but he could have
envisioned that it was Manny Ramirez and Roberto Alomar or Ivan
Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. That is what Pettitte could have
imagined against the relatively anonymous Royals because those are
the types of conquests he is chasing.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte overcame obstacle after obstacle, but he could not
snare Derek Jeter's errant throw to first base on what should have
been an inning-ending double play in the eighth inning and that
buried the Yankees. The ball nicked off Pettitte's glove, dribbled
behind him into foul territory and enabled Rey Sanchez to scoot
home from second with the first run of a taut game.
</P>
<P>
   The first run was monumental as the Royals acted like the
Indians or the Rangers by quieting the Yankees, 3-0, at Yankee
Stadium. Dan Reichert, a 23-year old who entered the game with a
12.08 earned run average, shocked the Yankees by pitching seven
four-hit innings for his second major league victory.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees tumbled to 3-3 in their last six games against
the very ordinary Royals and Twins, the sort of sluggish streak
that annoys someone like George Steinbrenner, Pettitte's revival is
what Joe Torre pondered before going to sleep. Pettitte did not
give up an earned run in eight solid innings and has yielded two
earned runs over his last 31 innings for a 0.58 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about where I'm at right now,'' Pettitte said.
``I've just got to keep myself here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pettitte succumbed because of Jeter's second damaging
error in four games. With runners on first and second and one out
in the eighth, Mike Sweeney lashed a grounder to the right side.
Tino Martinez slid to his knees to snatch the ball and whipped to
Jeter for the first out. Pettitte was sprinting toward first and
would have been in time for the double play, but Jeter tossed the
ball at Pettitte instead of ahead of him and at the base. Pettitte
had to stop, then lunge back to his left and the ball deflected off
his glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got there as a quick as he could,'' Jeter said. ``It's a
situation where I threw it on the wrong side. It was a tough play.
Unfortunately, we didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals added two runs in the ninth, off Ramiro Mendoza and
Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Pettitte struggled so mightily this season is
because he lacked aggressiveness. Pettitte's pitches were crisp,
but he did not attack hitters with confidence. But Pettitte has
regained his passion and he throttled the Royals on no hits in
seven at bats with men in scoring position. He has chopped his ERA
from 5.65 to 4.52, which is lower than Roger Clemens (4.60) and
barely higher than Orlando Hernandez (4.34) and Hideki Irabu
(4.28). ``If you're looking for a bright spot, Andy's the only
bright spot,'' said Torre, after the Yankees were listless against
a young starter for the third straight night. ``We didn't play
well, for sure. Pettitte will stand out with the way he went about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's turnaround has complicated the future. Torre dreads
the decision he will have to make in six weeks because one of his
starters is going to be given a seat in the bullpen for the
post-season. Before Pettitte's recent streak, he was the leading
candidate to be left out in October. Now the skirmish is between
Pettitte and Irabu and the 27-year old left-hander who the Yankees
almost traded might have the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough call,'' Torre said.
</P>

   If the playoffs started before Wednesday night's games, the
Yankees would play Texas in the Division Series. That is not
comforting news to Pettitte, the Deer Park, Texas, native who is
5-3 with a 6.42 ERA against the Rangers. He is also 0-3 with a
16.05 ERA in three starts at the Ballpark in Arlington, where the
fourth starter would probably pitch. Irabu is 1-1 with a 4.22
against the Rangers, including two solid outings this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Indians seem to be running on a collision
course into the American League Championship Series. When Torre
studies those matchups, he will see that Pettitte is 3-5 with a
5.34 against the Indians, including a 10-7 loss in June, while
Irabu is 3-1 with a 4.81. Pettitte has opposed the Rangers and
Indians more frequently, but Irabu has the slightly better
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after Pettitte struggled for more than three months and
almost had his baseball address changed, he has been superb.
Pettitte's last four starts have been outstanding and have
convinced Torre that he can depend on Pettitte again, which could
nudge Irabu to the bullpen for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the area where you hope to see it again,''
explained Torre, about judging Pettitte. ``If you don't, you've
seen it enough.''

<P>
   Some residents of Pinetop-Lakeside, Show Low and other
communities in the White Mountains suspect there's something
suspicious going on in the high country of eastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, the area has filled up with strangers,
and a few people wonder if there's more to it than a good tourist
season.
</P>
<P>
   Something evil.
</P>
<P>
   Something tied to the millennium. The Y2K computer problem.
Global chaos. The instillation of a New World Order.
</P>
<P>
   However, like every other wildly apoc alyptic rumor, once a
professional jour nalist spends a few hours investigating the
situation, picking apart the gossip and the hearsay, interviewing
locals, scanning the Internet, he discovers it's actually A LOT
WORSE THAN THEY THINK!!!!
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez,'' said Show Low City Manager Patrick Sherman, ``are you
going to tell me the Russians are coming, the Russians are
coming?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   They're already there. &QL; 
FOREST CAVERNS DESCRIBED
</P>
<P>
   According to a number of concerned citizens telephoning Show
Low's Police Department _ and sending messages over the Internet _
about 1,000 Russian soldiers are hiding in the surrounding for est.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet posting says the White Mountains have been hollowed
into ``caverns large enough to house 15,000 elite governmental
politicians, military, rich desirables and modern-day illumi
nati.''
</P>
<P>
   Who'd be foolish enough to believe such outrageous assertions?
When were these caverns supposed to have been dug? And where? And
by whom? And, more importantly, where's my invitation?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't one definition of illuminati an ``Italian-American
journalist with an atti tude problem''?
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Show Low trace the prob lem to this past spring,
when a group of local fire departments printed a pamphlet outlining
an evacuation plan for local res idents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with forest fires,'' City Manager Sherman says.
``We had a fire danger problem. One fire ate up 4,000 acres. So,
the local departments put out a pamphlet to tell people what to do
in case of a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous callers to the Police De partment and Internet
conspiracy buffs see it differently. They figure a ``fire
evacuation'' is only a ruse to get people out of their houses so
weary Russian sol diers can once again enjoy the pleasures of
indoor plumbing. &QL; 
LOOSE SCREWS UNTIGHTENED
</P>
<P>
   Show Low Police Capt. John Jarrett, who's seen the rumors on the
Internet, says, ``It's all ridiculous, completely made up. But
people latch onto it and it grows into secret Russian troops and
poli ticians.''
</P>
<P>
   And space aliens.
</P>
<P>
   You had to figure they were involved somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area (the White Mountains) has been under intense
scrutiny for UFO-re lated reasons,'' one computer message reads.
Another notes flashing lights in the night sky, then poses the
question: ``Is White Mountain housing a new breed of U.S./ NWO (New
World Order) aircraft that is about to be unleashed?''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman believes TV and newspaper reports describing potential
Y2K disasters have untightened some already loose screws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who thrive on spreading rumors like
this and making other people paranoid,'' he says. `'The il logic
doesn't matter to them. I mean, are the Russian soldiers and all
these politi cians supposed to live side by side in the caves?''
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, is that such a bad idea?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it possible we're looking at this the wrong way _ as a
nuisance rather than an opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time we quit agonizing over how to prevent 15,000
politicians, mili tary officers, wealthy businessmen and others
from crawling into caves in the White Mountains, and instead asked
our selves:
</P>
<P>
   How do we keep them there? &QL;

THOSE ARE FIGHTIN' BUZZWORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reader stuck his tongue in cheek and responded to last week's
At Work column, which panned 16 irksome business buzzwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you from all of us who feel like we're stuck in a
Dilbert cartoon where policies are implemented to facilitate
cross-functional objectives and achieve meaningful synergies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to be deinstalled here at the cube farm,'' he wrote,
asking anonymity. ``Deinstallation would force me to network my
strong interpersonal, communication and multitasking organizational
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   (For the record, the target words last week were: paradigm,
synergy, incent or incentivize, benchmark, best practices, world
class, core competencies, functional silos, actionable, proactive,
branding, re-engineering, rightsizing, delayering, full-time
equivalents and grow, as in ``grow the company.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of readers agreed that the buzzwords had been rendered
meaningless by overuse and misuse. In fact, many consider them
fightin' words.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers sent versions of buzzword bingo-type cards to be
played at meetings and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had only been in the meeting for five minutes when I yelled,
``Bingo,'' read the testimony from one player who fought back.
</P>
<P>
   Many suggested other buzzword peeves. ``May I add to your hit
list strategic plan?'' wrote one reader. ``On the same level as
proactive, I find this expression odd and redundant. When is a plan
not strategic?''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, strategic alliance rankles. But the buzzword most
nominated for mercy killing was win-win. ``No solution is equally
good for all,'' said one person. ``Somebody always gets a bigger
piece of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Another respondent took aim at critical mass: ``Clearly, this
should be reserved for those who actually understand how to split
an atom.''
</P>
<P>
   One man pointed out how insidious buzzwords can be. I bemoaned
proactive and wrote about ``taking an active step'' instead. That
pushed me ``over the Great Wall of corporate gobbledegook,'' he
wrote. Why not simply ``take a step?''
</P>
<P>
   Workers also despise nouns turned into verbs: dialogue, partner,
decision and calendar. (Come on, are there really people who say,
``Calendar this''?)
</P>
<P>
   Others prefer ``use'' to utilize and absolutely abhor
prioritize.
</P>
<P>
   Readers said they're sick of hearing about stakeholders and
diversity. The latter is so overused it means nothing, several
said.
</P>
<P>
   They hate obfuscations, namely increasing efficiencies and
unexpected opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   They're weary of at the end of the day and at this point in time
_ but those are slightly better than the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   They are tired of being asked to think outside the box or
brainstorm, even if it would empower them or put them on the fast
track.
</P>
<P>
   And they're annoyed at hyphenated drivel such as value-added,
quality-driven, results-oriented, client-focused and
knowledge-based.
</P>
<P>
   There were more irritations but there's no more space, so with
Round 2, the buzzword diatribe must end.
