<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqis Injured in U.S., British Air Raids EDS - Updates with details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
injured Wednesday in the United States and British warplanes'
bombings in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the spokesman said that at 10:05 local time (0605 GMT), 24
formations of U.S. and British planes made 36 armed sorties from
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over Iraq's southern provinces of Basra,
Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah, Wasit, Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
The hostile jets bombed "civil and service installations" in the
Rumeitha region in Muthana Province and injured three people
including one child, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery opened fire and "hit one of the
aggressing planes," the spokesman said, adding that the plane
managed to escape, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British aircraft use bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
to patrol the southern no-fly zone imposed after the 1991 Gulf War
with the claimed aim of protecting the Shiite Muslims there.
</P>
<P>
A similar air exclusion zone was also imposed in northern Iraq
with the claimed aim of protecting the region's Kurdish population.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the zones, which are not authorized by
any specific United Nations resolution.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
president of the U.N. Security Council on Monday, Iraqi National
Assembly (parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hamadi said that a total of
311 civilians have been killed and another 927 wounded in the U.S.
and British air strikes since the 1998 air war against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Change Policy on Cyprus for Better Ties With Greece  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said Wednesday that ironing out the strained
Greek-Turkish relations would be unthinkable as long as Turkey
continues to occupy the northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily briefing, Papapetrou defined "ironing out
relations" between Greece and Turkey as "putting aside all
obstacles and smoothing out relations between the two countries, so
that no problems keep them apart."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this would not be possible as long as Turkey
continues to maintain its current policy on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Since last December three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity
talks have been held between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
And a fourth round is due to start on September 12 in New York,
aiming at paving the way for substantive negotiations which may
lead to a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said that the governments of Greece and Cyprus
maintain that it is unthinkable to totally iron out relations
between Greece and Turkey, as long as the Turkish occupation of the
island continues and Turkey blocks the way for a solution to the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus,
Papapetrou said he was not very optimistic about the outcome of the
talks, after Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash recently urged
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides to attend the talks as leaders of
two separate states.
</P>
<P>
He added that "Denktash will have the opportunity to clarify his
position on September 12, when the talks resume."
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou noted, however, that judging by Denktash's
statements, one can not be too optimistic about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
Denktash insists on international recognition of his breakaway
state in northern Cyprus and wants the Cyprus peace talks to be
conducted between two separate states, instead of the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Only Turkey has recognized the breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," which was unilaterally declared by Turkish
Cypriots in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Key Witness Testimony Further Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The testimony by
a key witness at the Lockerbie trial has now been further delayed
until probably late next month.
</P>
<P>
The testimony by Abdul Majid Giaka, a former Libyan secret
service agent who later defected before the Lockerbie bombing, had
to be postponed again when the Scottish court on Dutch soil was
told on Wednesday that the United States secret service CIA had
agreed to sort out more documents to facilitate court procedure.
</P>
<P>
The CIA agreed to sort out more cable communications dated from
August 1988 to July 1991. The search is expected to take two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Giaka had been scheduled to appear in court last week but the
defense team objected by arguing that they lacked key information
from the CIA for cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
The testimony was re-scheduled for this past Monday and was
again postponed. Giaka was then expected to take the stand later
this week yet his appearance now seemed in question.
</P>
<P>
Giaka's testimony and the CIA documents in the form of cable
communications between CIA agents in Malta and Washington are held
by the prosecution as key evidence against Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, who are accused of planting a bomb
that blew Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The mid-air explosion killed 259 people on board the New York-
bound airliner and the crashed debris killed 11 others on the
ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
The indictment against the two Libyan nationals states that the
duo posed as Libyan Arab Airlines employees working in Malta and
put a suitcase bomb onto a plane to Frankfurt, where the suitcase
bomb was transferred onto the Pan Am Boeing jumbo.
</P>
<P>
Last week when the court resumed after the summer recess the
prosecution introduced the CIA cable communications to the court
yet the defense team argued that sections and words of the cable
communications were blanked out.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said that the blanked-out sections and words
contained either sensitive or irrelevant information. The
explanation, however, was not accepted by the defense lawyers who
demanded to have more time to study the unedited cable
communications.

<HEADLINE> Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments Opens at U.N. Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Conference of
Presiding Officers of National Parliaments opened Wednesday
afternoon at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
A total of 156 Presiding Officers of National Parliaments
attended the Conference. No one from the U.S. Congress was
Attending.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Conference, organized by the Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU) in cooperation with the United Nations and held on the
eve of the Millennium Summit, are aimed to express support for
international cooperation and to enshrine a commitment at the
highest level by parliaments to working much more closely with the
U.N. system and other major international negotiating fora both
nationally and globally through their world organization, IPU.
</P>
<P>
The conference is part of the IPU's efforts to strengthen its
cooperation with the U.N., as envisaged in the Agreement of
Cooperation concluded between the two organizations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A declaration, entitled the "Parliamentary Vision for
International Cooperation at the Dawn of the Third Millennium" is
expected to be adopted by the end of the Conference.
</P>
<P>
The declaration highlights the main challenges facing the world
community and the United Nations in the 21st century, describes
changes in international relations and outlines the national,
regional and international parliamentary dimension of
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said that "we need the parliamentary vision of international
relations then ever before. In the age of globalization, the
ancient challenges of poverty and conflict can no longer be met
simply by governments working together. Whole societies are
affected by international relations, and are playing their part in
it."
</P>
<P>
"As heads of parliament, you occupy a special place. As
representatives of the people, you are the principal repository of
democratic legitimacy. Using your legislative powers and your
democratic mandate, you can serve as genuine 'tribunes of the
people' across traditional frontiers," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Good governance depends on the stability and security of
parliaments," Annan noted, "and you can also do much to advance
development, locally and globally by directing your nation's
resources in that direction."
</P>
<P>
"I believe you have a unique role to play in bringing global
institutions such as the United Nations closer to the peoples they
are meant to serve," the U.N. chief added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Mediating Role in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government on
Wednesday categorically denied press reports that Turkey had
undertaken a mediating role in the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a written statement that upon the
request of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Turkey had started
activities "to explain Arafat's sensitivity over the holy places in
Palestine to other countries."
</P>
<P>
"Such contacts and activities are aimed at contributing to the
solution to the Palestinian conflict (with Israelis)," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem outlined the Turkish official
position on the issue clearly in his statement made at Ankara's
Esenboga Airport on August 23, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has not undertaken a mediating role. It has no such
desire. Turkey defined its task as a modest contribution that will
facilitate a solution between the two sides which have expressed
full trust for Turkey," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has produced some thoughts which might facilitate the
efforts of both sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said that Haram As-Sharif, which
is one of the holiest sites of Islam religion, is important not
only for the Palestinians but also for Turkey and for all the
Muslim world. "This position was made known to the relevant sides
and to the whole world from the very beginning," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that both sides are pleased about our approach. And
both sides have thanked Turkey in the statements they made to their
public and they said that they expected Turkey to continue its
efforts."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process is a very delicate issue which
requires a lot of attention, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, "It is not correct to say that Turkey has put forward a
proposal to the Palestinian side which was rejected by them."
</P>
<P>
"While considering contributions, Turkey is of course using its
four-century-long experience with the Palestinians. However, the
history can offer only some hints and it is not possible to fit the
old models to today's conditions without changing them."

RIYADH -- The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources
on Tuesday imposed a temporary ban on the imports of Egyptian
potatoes which were allegedly polluted by the internationally-
banned DDT substance.
</P>
<P>
DDT, used as a pesticide, was banned worldwide due to its
cancer-causing dangers to human beings.

the initiation of a stock exchange by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Alawi Saleh al-Salami, who leads the committee
on the draft law, was quoted on Wednesday by the Arabic-language
daily al-Hayat as saying that his committee reviewed a draft bill
on the stock exchange and its executive statute.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Market Authority enjoys financial and administrative
independence, so it has full authority to impose whatever laws it
considers necessary to protect the rights of shareholders and
dealers.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The number of representative offices of foreign firms
operating in Egypt has risen to 617.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 47 Percent of Zimbabweans are Very Poor, Says Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NGOs put unemployment rate at between 50 and 60 percent --
the highest level since independence in 1980. More than 61
percent of the youth aged between 15 and 25 are unemployed,
Zimbabwe's national news agency Ziana reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Poor economic growth, the government's inconsistent policy on
land distribution, and the costly involvement in disputes of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have placed serious constraints
on an ailing economy, the NGOs said.
</P>
<P>
"Living standards are rapidly declining due to the spirally
high food costs. Foreign investors are shunning the country and
the national currency keeps falling," said NGOS in the report.
</P>

Zimbabwe has an inflation rate of 60 percent and the purchasing

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Kicks Off Conference on Racism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- President Thabo
Mbeki kicked off South Africa's first national conference on
racism on Wednesday by urging delegates to remember that the twin
challenges of white fears and black expectations need to be met.
</P>
<P>
Opening the four-day conference in Sandton, north of
Johannesburg, he said this approach was essential to engage the
challenges presented by racism.
</P>
<P>
He told the more than 1,500 delegates from South Africa and
abroad that efforts should be made to allay the insecurities of
South Africa's white population, and at the same time accelerate
change to benefit black people.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said black people had been the victims of racism rather
than the perpetrators and "accordingly, what we have to deal with
is white, anti-black racism while giving no quarter to any
tendency towards black, anti-white racism, whether actual or
potential".
</P>
<P>
He urged South Africans to "move gently with your
transformation process lest you worsen white fears about the
future. For their part, the black people watch and wait in
expectation that real change will come sooner rather than later".
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said postponing the discussion on racism would
exacerbate the danger of social instability implicit in the racial
divisions in South African society.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately for all of us, we have the advantage that the
overwhelming majority of our citizens, whether we are black or
white... we are South African and African," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the problems we face today, our government is
convinced that as a people we have the wisdom, ingenuity and
sensitivity to the human condition that will drive and enable us
to overcome the demon of racism," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
White people have a significant role to play and a
responsibility to overcome racial discrimination, Mbeki said.

LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings on Wednesday held talks with visiting Sultan of Brunei
Darussalam, Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, in the capital Accra to further
enhance the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>

The Ghana News Agency quoted Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho as
saying after the talks that relations between Ghana and Brunei
have blossomed over the past few years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Takes Tough Action Against Illegal Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government is trying to
tackle illegal work in Switzerland by imposing stricter penalties
on employers who hire illegal workers, including prison sentences
for repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday, the federal government said
illegal work was unacceptable for industrial, legal and ethical
reasons, and needed to be tackled.
</P>
<P>
It said the practice threatened the pay levels, employee
protection schemes and social welfare state, adding that the
people who respected the tax and welfare laws should not be made
to pay for those who cheat the system.
</P>
<P>
Among a series of measures unveiled by the government are the
efforts to deprive offending companies of public contracts for a
five-year period, and halt bad weather payments and provide
subsidies for seasonal workers.
</P>
<P>
The government added that employers who continue to offend
could face prison terms of up to one year as well as fines of one
million Swiss francs (about 575,000 U.S. dollars), warning that
they could also be penalized by having their social insurance
bills increased by as much as 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that illegal work will account for nearly nine
percent of Switzerland's gross national product this year, or 35
billion francs (about 20 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Index Of U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Dips In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a survey that with the decline of
0.1 percent in July, the same rate of decline as in May and June,
the leading index now stands at 105.8. During the six-month span
through July, the leading index decreased by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The small but consistent decreases in the past three-month
period certainly point to a second-half economic performance less
robust than in the first half of 2000," said Conference Board
Economist ken Goldstein. "It would be difficult to achieve another
5 percent plus rate of Gross Domestic Product growth with the
manufacturing, housing, consumer, labor and financial markets all
indicating a more modest pace of activity."
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said "with employment and income still rising, there
will be growth, but not at the pace set earlier in the year."
</P>
<P>
The index, which stood at 100 in 1996, its base year, is widely
watched as a barometer of overall economic trends in the next
three to six months.
</P>
<P>
The survey said five of the ten indicators that make up the
leading index rose in July. The positive contributors to the index
were the index of consumer expectations, average weekly
manufacturing hours, average weekly initial claims for
unemployment insurance, stock prices, and money supply.
</P>
<P>
The negative contributors to the leading index in the month
were manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials,
manufacturers' new orders for nondefense capital goods, and vendor
performance. Building permits and the interest rate spread both
declined marginally.

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks Early Release of Hostage Soldiers in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's commanding officer in
Sierra Leone said on Wednesday that he still hoped to win the
speedy release of the 11 British soldiers held hostage by rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of ongoing talks with representatives of
the leaders of the West Side group," Brigadier Gordon Hughes told
BBC radio in an interview broadcasted here in London.
</P>
<P>
He said the British troops, captured on last Friday by a group
known as the West Side Boys, were being well looked after and
talks were continuing to ensure their freedom.
</P>
<P>
"We are very focused, we are very determined... What we want to
get to is a quick and successful conclusion with the safe release
of all our soldiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
British negotiators, arrived Sierra Leone shortly after the
soldiers were captured, had a face-to-face meeting on Tuesday with
one of the British hostages, together with some of the West Side
Boys soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Previous negotiations are believed to have taken place by phone
or radio.
</P>
<P>
The 11 British soldiers, together with one Sierra Leonean
government troops, were captured in an area some 75 kilometers
east of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys are reported to be soldiers from the former
Sierra Leone army. They had initially demanded food, medicine and
the release from prison of one of their leaders, in return for
freeing the captives.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone had been a colony of Britain. About 400 British
troops are in Sierra Leone to train the government army. The
abducted soldiers are part of that mission.

NICOSIA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' southern coastal town of
Limassol and the Israeli port of Haifa are to be twinned next week,
with a view to enhance cooperation particularly in matters relating
to shipping.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency reported Wednesday that an official
ceremony will take place on September 9 at the town hall of
Limassol, to be attended by a Haifa delegation led by mayor Amram
Mitzna.
</P>

<P>
Limassol mayor Demetris Kontides said "the idea to twin with

<HEADLINE> Time Not Ripe for Renewing Israeli-Palestinian Talks: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak insisted Wednesday that time is still not ripe for renewing
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks following the failure of last
month's Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference to launch Israel's new school
year, Barak said that if the Palestinians show more flexibility and
openness, the negotiations could be jump-started. However, he
added, he had not seen the signal.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks had hit a standstill since the 15-day-long Camp
David talks between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.
S. President Bill Clinton, failed to reach an agreement due to
significant gaps over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami and attorney Gilad Sher, Israel's chief negotiators, will
continue low-level contacts with their Palestinian counterparts
Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan. Ben-Ami and Sher are also
scheduled to meet with U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross in
Tel Aviv on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a drive jointly launched by Clinton and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak had tried to persuade the two sides to
return to the negotiating table to solve their differences on all
core issues, especially the thorniest issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Wednesday flew to Egypt to meet with Mubarak, who had
held a 90-minute session with Clinton on Tuesday. Egypt is floating
proposals, one of which is to let the whole holy city to be an "
open city," while its western and eastern part could be Israel's
and the Palestinians' capital respectively, according to Israel
Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims the whole of Jerusalem as its "eternal and
undivided capital" and the Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem,
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the core problem of the dispute -- the status of the
Temple Mount, which is in the stone-walled Old City and hosts both
Israelis' and Palestinian's holiest religious sites, the United
States also reportedly raised new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Local Ha'aretz daily reported Wednesday a U.S. proposal suggests
that the Temple Mount be divided into four sections, each
containing a different mix of powers for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak refused to confirm this proposal at Wednesday's
news conference, saying that he did not read the newspaper and did
not know the suggestion. "I am not sure whether it has any basis,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Company Pours Money to Save Lebanese Supermarket Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The biggest chain of supermarkets
in Lebanon, the COOP, which was the target of controversy over
bankrupt reports, has decided to accept a Saudi rescue offer,
Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The offer, backed up by the Central Bank of Lebanon, was made by
the Saudi chain "Grand Stores" and includes several payments: one
immediately worth 9 million U.S. dollars and a further 9 million
dollars to be paid on signing the deal, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, the Saudi company is to provide yearly
payments of about 9 million dollars until the COOP's 75-million-
dollar debt is fully paid and the company is back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
The COOP's shareholders, who attended a general assembly meeting
on Monday, gave their approval to the offer provided the Central
Bank's approval is also secured.
</P>
<P>
Another shareholders meeting is to be held before a final
decision is made on the Saudi offer.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders are calling for the COOP's debts to be rescheduled.
They were quoted as saying that "the Lebanese company was able to
repay 7 million per year and, if everything goes according to
plan."
</P>
<P>
The COOP faces an immediate cash squeeze estimated at 75 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, Twenty Injured During General Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed and
twenty others were injured Wednesday during the opposition
sponsored dawn-to-dusk countrywide general strike which hit normal
life in the country.
</P>
<P>
Police said one person was gunned down in the capital during
the striking hours, but the killing had no link with the strike.
The main opposition the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),
however, claimed that the victim was an activist of the party,
linking the killing with the strike.
</P>
<P>
Police said at least twenty persons were wounded during clashes
between strikers and pro-government activists.
</P>
<P>
Normal life in the capital was paralyzed as transport service
went off the roads, but paddle rickshaws were as usual in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
The strike, the second in a week, disrupted banking sector and
shut schools and colleges and many offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its allies-- Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and
Islamic Oikya Jote (IOJ), called the strike to protest against the
price hike of petroleum products and gas.
</P>
<P>
The government recently raised the prices of petroleum products
by 13 per cent and gas tax by 15 per cent. The opposition claimed
that the government raised the prices to ruin the economy, saying
the price hike will have a far reaching negative impact on the
cost of power, fertilizer, industrial and agricultural products
and above all, the cost of living.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Retrieve Sub Crew Bodies in Late September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia will start to retrieve the
bodies of the crewmen of the nuclear submarine Kursk, which sank
in the Barents Sea during a military exercise on August 12, at the
end of September, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov announced
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Preparations would last for about four weeks. Several groups
comprising three deep-sea divers -- one Norwegian and two Russians-
- will be involved, Klebanov told the press following a meeting
with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Russian divers will most probably be chosen from the
Northern Fleet divers' team, one of them will remain outside and
the other will enter the sub. The Norwegian diver will remain in
the diving team to work with the submarine, Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation will "last as long as is needed to lift
all the bodies."
</P>
<P>
He also said that he had informed the president of the first
round of talks with Norwegian partners on ways to lift the
submarine, held in Murmansk on Tuesday. Consultations on this
issue will be continued at the Rubin Design Bureau in St.
Petersburg on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Work to lift the submarine is to begin in September 2001. If
we are properly prepared, it will be done quickly," said Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
He said Putin and he also discussed the national defense budget
for the year 2001. "The budget has remained unchanged so far and
amounts to 206 billion rubles (7.44 billion U.S. dollars). This
figure is sufficient. If it is increased, the federal budget
balance may be upset," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes U.S. Policy on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov criticized the United States' policy on Iraq during a
telephone conversation with U.S. State Secretary Madeleine
Albright on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The pressure being put on Iraq and the use of force by the U.S.
is worsening the humanitarian situation in the country, and is
complicating the search for a settlement on the basis of United
Nations Security Council resolutions," Ivanov said in a statement
after the phone, citing his talks with Albright.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov and Albright exchanged views on a number of key
international and regional problems, including the situation in
the Middle East and the Balkans, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides "confirmed the importance of Russia's and the United
States' efforts as co-sponsors to promote the Middle East peace
process," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed preparations for the upcoming
meeting between the Russian and U.S. presidents within the

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction in Belgium to Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Government officials,
organizations and other interest groups in Belgium have different
views over a plan to cut 130 billion Belgian francs (some 2.88
billion U.S. dollars) of taxes, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting earlier this week, Finance Minister
Didier Reynders proposed a plan to lower tax levels. Reynders said
he hopes that all Belgians would benefit from the deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, low-income earners will pay less taxes, and
differences in the tax scheme between married couples and those
cohabiting couples will be scrapped. So far, a married couple pays
higher taxes than a cohabiting couple in this country.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform measures are said to be introduced gradually
over several years. Reynders said other tax reform measures will
be introduced after new private income taxes are implemented.
</P>
<P>
However, socialist trade union ABVV has doubted whether the tax
reform is fair for all tax payers. It does not believe that the
tax-cut deal will be enough to narrow the gap between high-income
earners and low- and middle-income groups.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the union wonders if the government can really
afford the tax cuts. The cuts should not be at the expense of the
social security or pension reserves, the ABVV said.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Flemish Cities and Municipalities said the
tax reduction could form a financial noose for lower-level
administrations.
</P>
<P>
The association said that those municipal authorities in the
country's Flemish-speaking areas, as a consequence of the tax
reform, may have to levy higher taxes on a smaller sum to get the
same amount of money as the current level.
</P>
<P>
Following the last major tax reform in the early 1990s, the
Flemish municipal authorities also raised the percentage of
additional taxation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Flies to Colombia for Brief Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday flew to Colombia for a visit to show his support for
the fight against drug trafficking with an aid of 1.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He will just stay at the scenic Caribbean port city of
Cartagena, site of a major hemispheric drug summit 10 years ago
and far from the violence for security.
</P>
<P>
His visit has caused concern both in Colombia and its neighbors
as the Colombians are worried that the U.S. contribution to
Colombian President Andres Pastrana's 7.5-billion-dollar anti-drug
plan indicates U.S. deep involvement in Colombia's domestic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's neighbors fear that U.S. aid might cause the drug
war to escalate and spill over the borders. They also fear that,
as a result of the drug war, massive waves of refugees would flood
into their own territory and drug traffickers and producers, who
might seek shelter in neighboring countries, would take the drug
trade and shift drug crops plantations there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aid includes the dispatch of 60 helicopters and the
deployment of two U.S.-trained army battalions, aimed at
containing drug trafficking and destroying drug plantations in
southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Trying to soothe fear of growing U.S. intervention in Colombia,
Clinton said on Tuesday in a videotaped message that Washington
had no military objective in that country.
</P>
<P>
"Please do not misunderstand our purpose. We have no military
objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said on Tuesday that his country could not put a dent
in international drug trafficking until the U.S. and other
countries do much more to control their citizens' appetite for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Colombia can put a stop to drugs here at some point, but if
the demand continues, somebody else somewhere else in the world is
going to produce them," Pastrana said in an interview in Cartagena.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four people were injured,
some of them seriously, as a subway train overturned in downtown
Paris early Wednesday afternoon, police said.
</P>
<P>
The driver's wagon of the subway train running from northern
part of the city overturned when the train was approaching a
station at a speed of 35 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The train stopped just one meter from the head of another train
on the track of the opposition direction, which was at that time
on the platform, said officials of the Paris public transport
company RAPT.
</P>
<P>
RAPT said the accident was apparently caused by technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant arrived at the scene
of the accident and said he was relieved that a bad disaster had
been avoided.
</P>
<P>
Some 170 firemen and rescuers were mobilized to help the
passengers and rush the injured to nearby hospitals from the
subway station of Notre-Dame de Lorette.
</P>
<P>
Apart from two bombing attacks by Islamic terrorists in 1995
and 1996, this is the worst accident of the Paris subway in 31
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Ekrem Demirtas, chairman of the Izmir Chamber of Commerce in
western Turkey, met on Tuesday with members of a Russian trade
delegation who were in Turkey to attend the 69th International
Izmir Fair.
</P>
<P>
Demirtas said that Russia holds an important position in
Turkey's commercial relations, adding that the commercial ties
between Turkey and Russia were far away from the satisfactory
level.
</P>
<P>
He said that "there is a big potential to further improve
economic and commercial relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is Russia's second largest trading partner after Germany,
but the trade volume between the two countries was affected since
the global economic crisis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- A motorbike group brought on Tuesday the first symbolic batch
of oil to Turkey from Azeri Caspian Sea port Baku, in a bid to
support the Baku-Ceyhan project which will transport rich Caspian
oil to western markets via Turkey's Mediterranean Sea port Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
The group, which carried 159 litres of oil, will reach Ceyhan by
following the route of the pipeline. Eight of the motorcyclists are
from the U.S., six from Britain, five from Azerbaijan, three from
Georgia, and one from Turkey, Norway, Sweden and Germany each.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Mesut Yilmaz, Turkish deputy prime minister and state
minister, attended on Tuesday a hand-over ceremony of 780
prefabricated huts erected by the Japanese government in western
Duzce province, which was hit by last year's earthquake.

the economy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Tuesday that
Israelis and Palestinians do not trust each other, but both of them
fully trust Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak had come very close to an agreement, but the
talks came to a standstill because they do not trust each other.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides want to continue the dialogue, but Israelis and
Palestinians lack trust in their relations. They both trust Turkey,
so they have some expectations from Turkey and we will try to meet
those expectations," Ecevit said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Seize 104 Kilograms of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-narcotics police
seized 104 kilograms of heroin hidden in the storehouse of a
furniture shop in the Inegol district of western Bursa province on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Five suspects were arrested for involvement in the case and the
police are still searching for the other two, Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The drug, hidden in the storage room of Klas Furniture Store
located on the Ertugrulgazi Avenue in the city, was packed and
ready to be sent abroad, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The five arrested revealed that the imprisoned chief of their
gang is still running drug-trafficking activities through a cell
phone from the prison.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its unique geographical position. Nearly 70 percent
of illicit drugs produced in the rest of the world are smuggled to
European countries via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the police have arrested 3,219 suspects in 1,
458 anti-drug operations and seized 2,850 kilograms of heroin, 22.6
tons of hashish, 976 kilograms of base morphine, 56 kilograms of
opium, six kilograms of cocaine, 5.5 tons of acid anhydride, 618,
336 captogan pills and 14,964 synthetic drugs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,583 kilograms of heroin, 50 kilograms of cocaine,
15.5 kilograms of opium and 8.3 tons of acid anhydride were
confiscated in joint operations with the U.S., German, British,
Romanian, Belgian, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Greek anti-
narcotics units.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 6,121 suspects were captured in 2,587
separate operations while anti-drug forces impounded 2,249
kilograms of heroin, 5,458 kilograms of hashish, 288 kilograms of
base morphine, 13 kilograms of cocaine, 26.2 tons of acid anhydride
and 1,749,305 captogan pills.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Turkish chief police authority said that the anti-
narcotics police had launched a "determined and successful"
struggle against illicit drug trafficking via the country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Palestinian Sovereignty Over East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Wednesday reiterated the
full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions in order
that East Jerusalem be placed under Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The question of Jerusalem is "extremely important and sensitive"
in the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said after a meeting between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Any departure from the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions will lead to "serious consequences," Moussa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War. The
U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 adopted after the war rules
that East Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab territories and
must be returned.
</P>
<P>
Moussa denied reports that Egypt was concentrating on the
Islamic holy sites in the old walled city, regardless of the
Palestinian demands on the rest of East Jerusalem, saying that the
claims are "baseless."
</P>
<P>
Egypt shares the Palestinian position on East Jerusalem, which
wants this part of the holy city to be the capital of an
independent
Palestinian state, and there is no concession at all.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared all Jerusalem is its "eternal and
indivisible capital," a claim not recognized by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Jerusalem, Mubarak and Arafat have also discussed
further Israeli troop withdrawal from occupied Palestinian lands,
the return of Palestinian refugees and water, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
These issues are also "very crucial" in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations and should be resolved in a bid to achieve a just and
lasting peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Mubarak briefed Arafat on his meeting on Tuesday with U.
S. President Bill Clinton in Cairo and dealt with the Palestinian
leader possible steps taken by all concerned parties in the coming
stage, including Clinton's planned separate meetings with Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak September 6 on the sidelines
of the U.N. millennium summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Alexandria Tuesday night after visits to
countries including Spain, and participation of a meeting in
Morocco of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference. He left for Gaza after the talks with Mubarak.

course.
</P>
<P>

recruitment of the women after selection," she noted.
</P>

A national defense college has already been established for the
training of senior officers while the activities of "Armed Forces
War College" will start from 2001, the prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> African Olympic Athletes Support Fight Against Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- African Olympic athletes are
being encouraged to pledge their support for the global Roll Back
Malaria (RBM) movement in a campaign that highlights how best to
treat and prevent the disease.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Olympic team captains Restituta Joseph and Fokasi
Wilbroad Fullah are the first athletes to sign up to an Africa-
wide campaign to raise awareness about malaria, the World Health
Organization (WHO) said in a press release here Wednesday. Many of
the medal hopefuls including Restituta have been ill with malaria
in the past.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Tanzanian captains, almost the entire
Ugandan team has also agreed to sign up to RBM and lend their
voice to the initiative's messages.
</P>
<P>
The latest RBM ambassadors are currently in the final stages of
training for the Sydney Olympics which start on September 15. WHO
have approached all Olympic committees throughout Africa to have
them involved in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics present the opportunity for one of the year's
biggest global media audiences. National heroes and heroines are
created and the power of their opinions should not be
underestimated," said RBM project manager Awash Teklehaimanot.
</P>
<P>
"Encouraging words from famous athletes have the power to
convince hundreds of thousands of the benefits of mosquito nets
and prompt treatment for malaria illness.
</P>
<P>
"With its goal to halve the malaria burden in Africa by 2010,
Roll Back Malaria knows all about difficult challenges. We offer
our best wishes to the African athletes in their own personal
challenges in Sydney," he added.
</P>
<P>
The African athletes have signed up to give out the following
messages for RBM:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 500 million people a year become ill from malaria;
</P>
<P>
-- More than one million people, mainly children, die from
malaria;
</P>
<P>
-- Malaria prevents people from earning a living, going to
school, or taking part in other important activities;
</P>
<P>
-- Malaria mainly affects poor people but in areas where malaria
is endemic it is a disease that strikes all people regardless of
lifestyle;
</P>
<P>
-- Malaria can be prevented, for example, by using insecticide
treated mosquito nets in the home;
</P>
<P>
-- Malaria can be treated, early diagnosis and correct therapy
are vital;
</P>
<P>
-- The RBM movement will halve malaria deaths by the year 2010;
</P>
<P>
-- Individuals can join the RBM movement through the website or
by letter or fax to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
WHO expects more athletes from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana
and Senegal to sign up to the RBM campaign in the coming weeks.

for a good harvest. It became a historic site and was opened to
the public as a park in 1918.

<HEADLINE> China Conducts First Boeing Modification in Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Xiamen Taeco Airplane
Engineering Co., Ltd. cut a door on a Boeing 747-200 today to
modify it into a freight plane.
</P>
<P>
The move marks the end of a history saying that China was
unable to transform a large passenger plane into a cargo one.
</P>
<P>
A 7.26 meter high and 5.59 meter wide hole was opened on a
Boeing 747 plane. A cargo plane doorframe with various control
devices will then be installed there.
</P>
<P>
Glaine Russell, senior manager of the Wichita Modification
Center under Boeing Airplane Services, said this was the first
time that a door was cut on the Boeing Plane outside the United
States. The Xiamen Taeco Airplane Engineering Co., Ltd.(XTAE) is
capable of doing complicated door-cutting as the Boeing company in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bingjie, chairman of the XTAE, said his company began
preparations for transforming passenger planes into cargo ones
ever since the Boeing company became a shareholder in 1997. The
company dispatches many technicians abroad each year for technical
training.
</P>
<P>
The XTAE, a Sino-foreign joint venture set up in 1993, now
refits three Boeing planes annually. It has repaired over 200
planes for numerous overseas aviation companies since its
inception.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Security Forces Kill 16 PKK Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 16 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party have been killed by security
forces in operations in two days this week, reported the Anatolia
News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Security forces launched an anti-PKK operation in Hakkari
province, southeast Turkey, Wednesday morning, killing seven PKK
militants, according to an announcement issued by the Regional
Emergency Rule Governor's Office.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern province of Tunceli, three PKK rebels were killed
on Wednesday by the security forces, which staged a major operation
starting from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The operation came after seven PKK militants were killed Tuesday
when they were found in the region engaging in anti-government
activities.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, formed in the 1980s, unleashed armed attacks against
the government in an attempt to set up a separatist state in the
overwhelmingly Kurd-populated southeastern Turkey. More than 30,000
people were killed during conflicts between the government and the
PKK in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest and imprisonment of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan
early last year, PKK terrorist activities have appeared to fall at
a low ebb.

BERLIN, (Xinhua) -- A court in the east German city of Halle on

life to nine years for beating a Mozambican to death, Deutsche

</P>
<P>
A 24-year-old accused was sentenced to life imprisonment and
two 16-year-old youths were each given nine years for the murder

The prosecution says the attack was clearly racially motivated
because Adriano, who had lived in Germany for 12 years, was black.

<HEADLINE> Beijing: Human Rights Issue no Excuse against Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Olympic Bid
Committee said on Wednesday that they strived for the right to
host the 2008 Games is the very example of respecting human rights
in China.
</P>
<P>
"To bid for the Olympic Games is the aspiration of the 1.3
billion Chinese people. They have the right," Liu Jinming, Beijing
vice mayor and executive vice president of the bid committee, told
a news conference for the acceptance of the city as one of the
five candidates for the 2008 Games.
</P>
<P>
The other four are Istanbul, Osaka, Paris, and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"The human rights record should not be an excuse against
Beijing's bid for the Games," said liu. "It is palpable that China
has scored noteworthy accomplishments in protecting the human
rights. The differences between China and Western countries come
from the fact that we all have our own understanding of the human
righsts."
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the Olympic Games do not have any direct relation
to human rights and, If any, the link is that "both do not
differentiate between states, races or religious beliefs".
</P>
<P>
"As is stressed by both the Olympic Movement and human rights,
everybody has the right to participate in what they are concerned
about. Now the Chinese have an aspiration to hold the Games in
China and this is just their human right."
</P>
<P>
The bid committee has said that beijing's bid for the games is
not just the business of the government but also the ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope the bid could help beijing make progress in many
fields and make the beijinger get benifts from it," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, did not shy away from what China need to
improve in human rights protection.
</P>
<P>
"On the other side, China is a developing country and it is
certain that we still have some improvements to make. But many
reforms which are being carried out in all fields are all aimed to
give more rights to ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
"Many wise policitians have come to realize that the best way
to enhance the Chinese human rights protection is dialogue not
confronctation," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> China's University Opens Practice Base for Law Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's first "Clinical Legal
Education," a hands-on extended exercise for law students before
becoming full-fledged lawyers, was started today in Fudan
University in east China's Shanghai Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xigui, an associate professor with the law school at the
university said the new clinical program, with the support of the
Ford Foundation from the United States, will enable college
students to practice what they have learned in the classroom by
acting as lawyers at legal aid centers in the community.
</P>
<P>
The law school set up a legal aid center four years ago to test
the students' capacity in providing free legal services to senior
citizen and women, who may not be able to pay for legal advice
from a practicing attorney.
</P>
<P>
Liu said by combining experiences both at home and abroad in
this aspect, and with the aid of professors when necessary, the
program will help the young students realize an overall
development in the field of law.
</P>
<P>
Other six higher-educational institutions in the country, such
as Beijing University and Qinghua University, will open such a
program this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Universities in the United States started such a program on
their campuses as early as in the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Brings Health Challenges for Women: Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Globalization, while creating
new opportunities, also has posed threats to women's health, and
accordingly, governments and international community should try to
realize the potential of globalization for improving women's
health, a British health expert said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of globalization, more women are entering the labor
force and paid work can bring independent income and create a
sense of self-worth. But it also involves new threats to women's
health, said Lesley Doyal, Director of Center for Health and
Social Care, the School for Policy Studies, University of Bristol,
U.K.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international conference on the impact of
globalization on women's health, Doyal said, "women now make up a
growing percentage of the labor force in most of the regions,
especially in skilled and semi skilled jobs in the export oriented
industries."
</P>
<P>
But, worldwidely, "the most rapid growth in female labor has
been in the informal sector of the economy where conditions are
often most difficult and the benefits are often the most tenuous.
</P>
<P>
Women's survival problems are exacerbated by the fact the
average wages for women are still lower than those for men in all
63 countries for which data is available," Doyal said.
</P>
<P>
While they enter the labor force, most women are continuing to
do unpaid care work in the household. Paid work and unpaid home
labor exerts consistent pressure on women, undermining both their
physical and mental health, Doyal said.
</P>
<P>
Globalization has set in train huge movements of people, making
women, who traditionally are attached to one place, also in the
transit. Loss of support networks may occur when women become
migrants and are struggling to raise their families in unfamiliar
places, Doyal said.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Brings Health Challenges for Women: Expert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For working women, occupational hazards, stress and
environmental degradation constitute the major threats to their
health, said Doyal.
</P>
<P>
Physical dangers such as accidents and exposure to a range of
hazardous substances are a big health concern for women. On top of
this, women still face threats to health in the domestic arena,
such as the threat of indoor air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates from the World Bank suggest that gender
violence is responsible for about 5 percent of the total disease
burden for women aged 15-44 in the developing countries and 19
percent in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
A review currently undertaken by WHO has found that in
different countries from 10 percent to 50 percent of women
reported having been physically attacked by an intimate partner
with the average being between 25 percent and 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This reveals the existence on an enormous public health hazard
which, though clearly predated globalization but has nevertheless
been exacerbated by it," Doyal said.
</P>
<P>
Globalization also impacts on women's reproductive health.
Though productive health services have improved significantly in
some countries, half a million women still die every year as a
result of childbearing, with ten times as many suffering long term
damage, Doyal said.
</P>
<P>
"Recent studies have shown that these problems have frequently
been exacerbated by health sector reform. Women have been
especially disadvantaged by the new financing system which often
leaves them without access to even the most basic of care," Doyal
said.
</P>
<P>
The health expert believes that to realize the potential of
globalization for improving women's health, conscious and
collective effort in three settings, namely, the household, the
government and the international community, is needed to realign
social and economic policies to meet the needs of women more
effectively.

<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Japanese Foreign
Minister Yohei Kono said that Japan and China should further build
mutual trust and strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here today in a speech delivered at the
Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Kono said that the two countries realized the normalization of
diplomatic relations in 1972, and the two sides have made
unremitting efforts for the establishment of a stable and friendly
cooperative relationship since then.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral contacts are increasing on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Kono frankly pointed out that there are still some problems in
relations between Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
That is why the two countries must enhance mutual understanding
and trust, he said, adding that it is also a strong wish of the
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He went on to explain that mutual understanding can not be
promoted without expanding the exchanges and mutual trust can not

inflicted on "the people of many countries, particularly on those
of Asian nations" through Japan's wartime "colonial rule and
aggression."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister also noted that militarism will
never be allowed to rise again in Japan, since the Japanese people
themselves are the victims as well.
</P>
<P>
China's development is indispensable for the peace and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, Kono

<HEADLINE> 5 Lebanese Soldiers Injured by Landmine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese soldiers including
an officer were seriously injured Tuesday when a landmine exploded
in a village in south Lebanon in a mine sweeping operation, An
Nahar newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The mine was set off while army engineers were trying to clear a
minefield near a former pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army militia
outpost in the village of Kfra Roumman in Nabatieh province.
</P>
<P>
The blast caused one soldier to lose a hand and another to be
blind in one eye. They were taken to a Nabatieh hospital for
treatment, an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
They were the latest victims of the thousands of landmines that
had been planted by Israel during its 22-year occupation from 1978
till May 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
The injuries raise to 21 the number of people wounded in
landmine or shell explosions since Israeli withdrawal, An Nahar
said.
</P>
<P>
Seven people have been killed, including three children last
week when an Israeli artillery shell exploded in the south.
</P>
<P>
Israel has left behind about 130,000 anti-person and anti-tank
mines in south Lebanon. The mine-cleaning unit of United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon complained that the mine maps Israel
provided are inaccurate. So far, the unit has cleaned about 500
mines during its two-month operation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Asked to Preserve Racial Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Yang di-Pertuan
Agong (King) Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Wednesday urged all
Malaysian communities to preserve the existing unity among them.
</P>
<P>
Solid racial unity that prevailed for the past 43 years made
rapid national development possible without much hitches, the King
said in a message to mark the 43rd National Day which falls on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining racial co-existence and religious tolerance would
go a long way towards perpetuating a blissful life for the coming
generations as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all Malaysian communities to preserve the existing
unity among them. Should problems arise, resolve them at the
negotiating table and urgently," he said.
</P>
<P>
The supreme head of state said the key to preserving harmony in
the country is to appreciate and practice the theme and slogan for
this year's National Day celebration "Keranamu Malaysia" (because
of you, Malaysia).
</P>
<P>
He said "Keranamu Malaysia" served as an appropriate theme for
this year's National Day observance, befitting government's
efforts to instill patriotism and love for the motherland among
Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
The King called on the younger generation and future leaders
among them to appreciate the real meaning of independence and put
love for the country first.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South African President Vows to End Racism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Challenging racism is to address to two sides of the same coin,
namely "white fears and black expectations", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our collective intentions, racism continues to be
our common bedfellow," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding these racial differences, residents of the
country are all South African and all African, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any delay in addressing the issue of racism "
would sharply exacerbate the danger of the social instability
implicit in the racial divisions that continue to characterize our
society".
</P>
<P>
Black people had been the victims of racism rather than the
perpetrators and "accordingly, what we have to deal with is white,
anti-black racism while giving no quarter to any tendency towards
black, anti-white racism, whether actual or potential", he added.
</P>
<P>
A constitutional right to equality and non-discrimination was
important in the fight against racism, similarly the legal
possibility, and right to redress in cases of such discrimination
was also critical, he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic empowerment was part of realizing the constitutional
right to equality as the social and economic structure of society
had been biased in racial terms, the president said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is bound by not only the Constitution and
international laws to act against racism, but also laws such as
the Promotion of Equality Act, the Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act and the Employment Equity Act, he said.
</P>
<P>
Racism continues to haunt the world and great efforts should
be made to end the nightmare, he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

Mubarak said that Israel and the Palestinians can reach agreement
by the end of September and they pledged to push negotiations
beyond what Clinton called the "next big hump" to resolve such
sensitive issues as the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior officials at the Pentagon and the State Department
said the two agencies were sharply divided over whether and how to
move ahead with construction of a national missile defense shield.
The dispute is rooted in legal interpretations of when the United
States would have to give formal notice to Russia that it was
violating the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
-- Colombian President Andres Pastrana said his country could
not stem international drug trafficking until the United States

<HEADLINE> World Conference on Globalization, Women's Health Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
globalization and women's health is being held here to explore the
impact of globalization on women's health.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly organized by the Center for Environment,
Gender and Development, School of Public Health and the Gender
Research Center at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, is the
first international conference focusing on the impact of
globalization on women's health.
</P>
<P>
About 80 international scholars from the United Kingdom,
Australia, Canada, the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, India,
Singapore and the Philippines exchanged views on issues related to
women's health in the changing conditions brought about by
globalization.
</P>
<P>
As Asian countries liberalize their markets and privatize their
public sectors, they are undergoing macroeconomic restructuring so
as to integrate their national economies effectively into the
global economy. These changes present opportunities and threats to
women's health, well-being and quality of life, participants said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, international scholars presented papers
demonstrating how globalization is affecting women's environmental
health, occupational health, psychological health, sexual-
reproductive health and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
The conference organizers and participants have proposed an
international information system that will draw the attention of
multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral partners to these concerns.
</P>
<P>
The Gender Research Center of the Chinese University of Hong
Kong was inaugurated at the conference.

<HEADLINE> HK Government to Further Advance Women's Well-Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government will continue to do its best to
further advance women's well-being, an official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the two-day International
Conference on Globalization and Women's Health, Secretary for
Health and Welfare E. K. Yeoh noted that following economic,
social and technological developments in recent years, "people are
now living more in a global context."
</P>
<P>
Globalization, on the one hand, is beneficial as it allows
everyone greater access to economic opportunities, but on the
other hand, it may bring profound changes to work habits and
lifestyle, upset the status quo and create uncertainties, Yeoh
said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the issue of women's health, Yeoh said different
organizations have repeatedly pointed out that in many places,
women are less educated and of lower social status and form an
overall disadvantaged group.
</P>
<P>
But, in Hong Kong, "women enjoy essentially the same social
status as men," Yeoh said. Health care professionals have always
been gender neutral when managing and treating a disease or
clinical condition, Yeoh said.
</P>
<P>
The official, who lately assumed policy responsibility for
women's well-being, promised that the government will not be
complacent and will make further efforts to improve women's well-
being.
</P>
<P>
With the changing economic and social role of women in the
community, many women nowadays face new health risks. Women's
traditional life at home coupled with their functional life in
office will add up to a whole day of consistent pressure on them,
which will affect women's physical and mental well-being, Yeoh
said.
</P>
<P>
Many women nowadays are considered to be disadvantaged because
they have incorporated a male standard for achievement in the work
world with an old-fashioned female standard for perfection at home,
Yeoh said.
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of these dual standards has made women the slaves
of their own success and working women must learn how to handle
this dual role and the inherent stress, Yeoh said.

<P>
QINGDAO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A French oil tanker was detained
by the Qingdao Maritime Court today for seriously damaging three
marine loading arms at Qingdao Harbor.
</P>
<P>
The oil tanker containing 130,000 tons of crude oil anchored at
the No. 62 berth of Qingdao Harbor on August 19 to unload oil. At
6 p.m. of the following day, a cable at the stem suddenly loosened,
damaging three marine loading arms.
</P>
<P>
After rushed repair that took 90 hours, the three loading arms
were able to function, but not ideally the way they were designed
to. Marine experts estimated the economic losses at 17 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao Harbor Authority applied for the detaining of the
oil tanker if it failed to reach an agreement on compensation with
the later.

<HEADLINE> HK Visitor Arrivals Top 1 Million in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals in Hong Kong
in July this year broke the one- million mark for the fifth time
this year, according to the figures released Wednesday by the Hong
Kong Tourist Association.
</P>
<P>
Last month saw 1,095,923 arrivals, compared with 966,034 in
July 1999 and 88,441 in the same month of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The average room occupancy reached 82 percent, up from 76
percent for the same month last year, with high tariff A hotels
showing the most significant increase of 10 percentage points to
77 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fast growth, the association's Deputy
Executive Director Douglas Gautier said any lingering
misconceptions about Hong Kong being a costly destination are well
and truly being dispelled by timely and well-engineered consumer
promotions.
</P>
<P>
"Sector-driven packaging in our seven key markets are proving
to be just the kind of incentive prospective travelers need to
view Hong Kong as an exciting year-round destination," he added.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that arrivals from Japan and the
Republic of Korea rose by 17.4 percent and 19.5 percent,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> BOC Pre-Tax Profit Up 58.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China (BOC) Group
registered a pre-tax profit of 4.8 billion HK dollars (about 615
million U.S. dollars) in its commercial banking business in the
first half of this year, up 58.3 percent compared with the same
1999 period.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income rose by 560 million HK dollars (about 71.8
million U.S. dollars), representing a rise of 7.3 percent over the
same 1999 period, said Liu Jinbao, chief executive of the BOC Hong
Kong-Macao Regional Office, when he announced the group's 2000
Interim Results here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase to mainly improvement of both the
asset and liability management, and the fund management as well.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the buoyant stock market, the BOC group also got an
increase of 121 percent in brokerage income over the same period
of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, total deposits stood at 658.5 billion HK
dollars (about 84.4 billion U.S. dollars), a rise of 4.5 percent
over June 1999, up 2.9 percent compared with the 1999 year-end
figure.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances of the group totaled 355.5 billion HK
dollars (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars), basically the same as
those of the corresponding 1999 period, but a slight growth of 0.6
percent from the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The loan to deposit ratio was 54 percent at the end of June, a
reduction of 1.2 percentage points compared with the end of 1999,
Liu said, adding that this was due mainly to the group's higher
deposits growth rate than that of loans, in addition to the
constraints of the still sluggish credit market.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese enterprise debt problem was still being
addressed to, it continued to pose substantial effect on the group
's non-performing loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
As at the end of June, the non-performing loans stood at 54.2
billion HK dollars (about 6.9 billion U.S. dollars), a decrease of
3.3 billion HK dollars (about 423 million U.S. dollars) or 5.8
percent from the end of last year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A private Chinese company today
announced the creation of a cable box that enables users to buy
and sell stocks through the TV.
</P>
<P>
The MOWAY9901C cable box uses a patent computer chip design and
operational software developed by Chinese companies. The central
piece of the technology is an electronic trading system that
offers real time analysis and stock transactions.
</P>
<P>
The cable box, believed to be the first of its kind in China,
was developed by Uniwin Electrical Technology Co. Ltd in Shanghai
in east China.
</P>
<P>
At an inauguration ceremony for the product, held in Beijing
today, a senior company official said that Uniwin has strived to
provide practical and affordable solutions of on-line trading for
Chinese stock owners.
</P>
<P>
China now has some 50 million people buying and selling
securities at stock markets. However, only one percent of the
trading volume are conducted on line.
</P>
<P>
Weichi Jian, an official from the High-tech Department of the
Ministry of Science and Technology, said at the launching ceremony
that the new cable box has utilized Chinese patent technologies
and will promote the growth of a relevant software industry and
accelerate the development of an on-line stock brokerage network
in China.

BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said today that China is willing to develop mutually beneficial
and friendly relations with Papua New Guinea (PNG) on the basis of
the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks in a meeting with John Kaputin, foreign
minister of Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Noting the fact that PNG is one of the first countries in south
Pacific to establish diplomatic relations with China, Hu said that
bilateral relations have been developing vigorously since the two
countries forged diplomatic relations 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have had wide-ranging and fruitful
cooperation in the political, economic and cultural fields, he
said. China and Papua New Guinea are both developing countries and
located in the Asia-Pacific region, the vice-president said, they
have much shared interests in regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate and expand bilateral relations is in the long-
term and fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaputin, who is on his fourth China visit, said that the visit
has provided the two countries with an opportunity to promote
existing friendly relations, adding that the Papua New Guinean
government and people highly value their friendship with China,
and thank the Chinese government for its economic and
technological assistance.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his government will continue to pursue the
one-China policy, and support the Chinese government's stance on
the Taiwan issue, and promote relations with China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
expressed the hope here today that his upcoming official visit to
Japan would lift mutual cooperation between the two countries to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono during
their meeting that he wants to meet with people from both the
government and the public during his visit in order to help deepen
mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
It is not only in the fundamental interest of the Chinese and
Japanese peoples, but also conducive to the peace and development
in the region and the world for China and Japan, two close
neighbors, to develop friendly relations, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan in 1998,
both sides drafted a framework of friendly cooperation for peace
and development, which had laid the foundation for bilateral ties
in the 21st century. Also this May, President Jiang delivered an
important speech on Sino-Japanese relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the present friendly relations are hard won, therefore
the younger generation should get known about the history of Sino-
Japanese relations and deeply treasure such friendly ties so as
not to cause misunderstanding and "unfriendly voices", Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China has started with its new development strategy and Japan
is undergoing an economic recovery, Zhu said, pointing out the two
economies are strongly complementary and there are broad prospects
for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kono agreed with Zhu on bilateral ties, saying friendly
cooperation is now the main trend of bilateral relations. China
has broad development potential, and its development is of
critical importance to the prosperity of Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan highly stresses its relations with China. Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori and the Japanese people are looking forward
to Premier Zhu's visit to Japan, which, he believes will further
push forward bilateral ties.

BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 people gathered today
at the Great Hall of the People to mark the 100th anniversary of
the birth of Zhang Wentian, an outstanding proletarian
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who is also General Secretary of
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and
Chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended the meeting
convened by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Hu Jintao, also member of the Standing Committee

</P>
<P>
In his address to the gathering, Jiang said that Zhang was a
devoted Marxist and an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, who
made monumental contributions to the country and the people during
his long career of revolution and socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
With a deep understanding of the Marxist theory, Zhang had a
strong sense of party principles and sharp political vision, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The whole party should learn from Zhang the firm belief in the
causes of the party and people, the moral integrity and the
courage to uphold truth, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called on party members to learn from Zhang the
spirit of learning assiduously, the good tradition of seeking

people whole-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the party and nation are marching toward the
21st century, the memory of Zhang and other revolutionaries of the
older generation will help carry on and further promote their
revolutionary spirits, and push forward the great cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Jiang said.

July and they are Australia, China, the United Kingdom, the United
States, South Korea, Hong Kong and India.
</P>
<P>
The figure of tourist arrivals from South Korea topped the
growth list as it grew by 51.3 percent to 32,954 in arrival count
in July 2000 over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom and India markets, which have been
registering unprecedented monthly visitor arrivals since January
this year, rose by 10.3 percent to 34,660 and 17.3 percent to 28,
125 respectively.
</P>
<P>

historical high for the past four months.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, the only market which saw negative growth in July 2000,
fell by 2 percent in the month, the second consecutive month of
sliding, and the fall was due largely to a 38.3-percent plunge in
arrivals by sea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singapore's tourism receipts for the first half of
this year were estimated at 5.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 3.
2 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Australia to Avoid Endless Military Presence in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Wednesday that his country could not support an open-
ended commitment to keep troops in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Howard told ABC television that Australia would not walk away
from its responsibilities in East Timor, but the government could
not support an open-ended commitment to keeping troops on the
ground there.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet with Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid at a U.N. conference in New York next week.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be having a bilateral meeting as well as participating
in the Millennium Summit of the U.N.," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was keen to encourage Indonesia to crack down
further on militia activity in East Timor, which had been under
Indonesian administration before the East Timorese voted for
independence last year.
</P>
<P>
East Timorese nationalist leaders asked the United Nations to
keep a peacekeeping force on the West Timor border for years to
come to ensure their territory's security.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't like to keep them there indefinitely and I don't
think the Australian public would," the prime minister said. "But
we've always realized we have a particular responsibility in
relation to East Timor and we'll continue to play a leading role."

BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 14 funds released
their interim reports today, just one day before the deadline for
interim report release.
</P>
<P>
In total, plus the previous five funds that had released their
interim reports earlier, there were 19 funds that had released
their interim reports. Tomorrow most probably there will be
another ten or more funds to release their interim results,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities company.
</P>
<P>
Fund Yuyang had the highest net earnings for the first half of
this year, with net earnings per fund unit reaching 0.4492. Fund
Anxin, whose NAV growth rate was almost the same as that of Fund
Yuyang, had its net earnings of 0.384 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Because of releases of interim reports today, half of the funds
were suspended in the morning trading session, while Fund Taihe,
which released its interim report and rose yesterday, corrected,
and the trading was weak. However, after the 14 funds resumed in
the afternoon session, the trading became active. But as the
composite indexes on the two stock markets declined dramatically
after 2:30 p.m., the fund market was affected.
</P>
<P>
In general, today's fund market performed steadily. Among 30
funds, six rose and ten remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Sincerity, Flexibility Necessary for Making Code of Conduct in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao today called on relevant countries to show
political sincerity and flexibility in formulating the Code of
Conduct in South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
China hosted the second consultation on the Code in Dalian in
northeast China from August 24 to 25. Senior officials with
foreign ministries of China and the 10 member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as the
ASEAN Secretariat attended the consultation.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question raised by journalists, Zhu said that
the participants further exchanged views on the draft of the Code,
with their differences reduced and positions getting closer.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Code is a political document that
is aimed at promoting good-neighborly friendship and regional
stability, rather than a legal document for resolving disputes.
</P>
<P>
China put forward the draft of the Code last October and
actively hosted this consultation, which, he said, again
demonstrated China's good faith in and active attitude toward the
formulation of the Code.
</P>
<P>
China has also put forward a number of active and constructive
opinions concerning the text of the Code, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The existing difficulties don't lie on the Chinese side, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope relevant countries will show necessary political
sincerity and flexibility in line with the spirit of seeking
common ground and leaving differences aside so as to make active
contribution to the formulation of the Code," Zhu said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China will put its first oceanic
satellite into orbit next year after a series of weather and
resources satellites have been launched, said an official in the
State Oceanic Administration (SOA) here today.
</P>
<P>
"The serial oceanic satellites will become China's major civil
satellites together with the Fengyun and Ziyuan series," Sun
Zhihui, vice director of the administration, said during a working
conference of the SOA.
</P>
<P>
The administration will actively take part in China's space
plan and will push forward sea satellite projects to realize three
dimensional monitoring in the ocean, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The research and development of the oceanic satellite and the
establishment of ground stations are well under way, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mingjian from the science and technology department of the
SOA told Xinhua that China is planning to send one sea satellite
every two years in the coming decade to monitor marine environment
and disasters.
</P>
<P>
By observing optical features of the ocean's waters, the sea
satellite will be used to survey primary productivity of oceans,
offshore sands and red tides.
</P>
<P>
Development of marine high-tech was included in China's high-
tech plan about five years ago. Since then, rapid progress has
been made in the fields of marine monitoring, biotechnology, sea
bed detection and satellite remote sensing technologies.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Discuss Negotiations With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held talks on Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Alexandria on ways of pushing forward the peace negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the Egyptian Mediterranean port city
overnight, the country's Middle East News Agency reported. His
meeting with Mubarak came one day after U.S. President Bill Clinton
held brief talks with Mubarak at Cairo airport.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mubarak and Clinton, who made a hours-long
stopover in Cairo at the end of his three-day African tour, touched
upon means of unblocking the path for Mideast peace, which was
being locked in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was expected to brief Arafat on his talks with Clinton,
who said "time is short" for achieving peace. But Mubarak expressed
optimism that a peace agreement is possible by next month, saying
that he was "always hopeful."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's top political advisor, Osama al-Baz, told reporters on
Tuesday that the Egyptian leader explained to the U.S. president
what Cairo considered the Palestinians would and would not accept.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have set September 13 as the
deadline for a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in the last stage of his office, failed at a summit at
Camp David last month to bridge gaps between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak over the thorniest issues in the 52-year-
old dispute, including borders, the status of Jerusalem, the fate
of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that their sovereignty over Arab East
Jerusalem not be questioned because the sector was occupied by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War and thus comes under United Nations
resolution 242 demanding Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian stand was also backed Monday by the Jerusalem
Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference during a
meeting in Morocco, which said there should be no limitation on
Palestinian sovereignty over the area.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak on Tuesday updated over telephone Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz with the talks with Clinton and discussed
the Mideast peace process with him, Egyptian newspapers reported on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> French Fishermen Block Sea Ports to Protest Fuel Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- French fishermen have been
blocking several sea ports since this week in protest against the
rise of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The port of Marseilles is completely blocked on Wednesday, the
second day running, by fishermen with trawlers to prevent boats
and ships from entering the basins of the port.
</P>
<P>
Since Tuesday evening fishermen blocked with trawlers the port
of Saint-Malo bordering the English Channel, forcing international
ferries to and from Britain to cancel scheduled services from the
port on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Protesting fishermen have also sealed off the southwestern
Mediterranean ports of Sete, Port-Vendres and Port-la-Nouvelle.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen said they will continue protesting while waiting for
the result of a meeting between the national fishing committee and
the Minister of Fishing Jean Glavany, scheduled for Thursday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Socialist Party voiced its solidarity with the
fishermen in a communique on Wednesday, calling on the government
to take measures to meet the fishermen's demand for lower fuel
prices.

<HEADLINE> France to Continue Normalization Process with Libya: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Wednesday that France will continue the process of
normalizing relations with Libya, which has helped arrange the
release of three French hostages by the Philippine Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Figaro, Vedrine said that the
process of normalization of relations between Libya and the
European Union (EU) began one and a half years ago when the United
Nations suspended its sanctions against Libya after Tripoli agreed
to hand over the suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am
passenger plane over Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the EU has suspended its economic embargo against
Libya except that of arms, while Libya joined the EU-Africa summit
held in Cairo in April this year and was invited to an EU-
Mediterranean ministerial meeting held in Stuttgart in April 1999,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Africans, the Arabs, the Mediterraneans all wish that
Libya returns to the international scene because they think it
will help strengthen the new foreign policy of Libya," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France will invite Libyan leader Muammar
Ghaddafi to attend an EU-Mediterranean summit to be held in
Marseilles, if such a summit can be realized.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian officials toyed with prospects of a
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in New York, as U.S. President Bill Clinton
warned in Egypt on Tuesday that the time to reach an agreement "is
short."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman in the Israeli Prime Minister Office denied a report
quoting Palestinian Minister of Planning Nabil Shaath as saying in
Cairo that a meeting between Arafat and Barak is scheduled next
Wednesday. Later in the day, Shaath himself also denied the report.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said although no meeting has been scheduled, this
does not mean that a meeting will not take place.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A proposal to divide the Temple Mount area in the Old City of
Jerusalem into four sections, each containing a different mix of
powers for the two sides, has been discussed in the talks between
Israel and the Palestinians taking place under United States and
Egyptian mediation.
</P>
<P>
Control of the Temple Mount, the most sacred in Judaism and also
home to Islamic shrines, is at the heart of the dispute between
Israel and the Palestinians in the negotiations to formulate a
framework agreement, and it is the focus of the mediation efforts
of Cairo and Washington.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli source hinted on Tuesday that Israel will be ready to
entertain "creative" ideas about sovereignty on the Temple Mount if
they are accepted by the Palestinians as a basis for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- As the findings of the ongoing probe into Saturday night's
botched Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) operation near the West Bank
city of Nablus indicated the three soldiers killed may have been at
fault, their comrades Tuesday rallied around the Duvdevan unit
commander who might be dismissed as a result of the failed
operation.
</P>
<P>
Both former and current unit members criticized the demands to
disband the unit and oust its commander and other senior
commanders.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The last attempt by Aryeh Deri, former leader of Israel's
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, to postpone his imprisonment failed on
Tuesday when Supreme Court President Aharon Barak rejected his
appeal to put off the date of the start of his prison sentence from
September 3 until after the upcoming Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
Deri was sentenced to three years imprisonment and received a
fine of 250,000 shekels (about 62,500 U.S. dollars) or 10 months in
prison for taking bribes, fraud and breach of trust.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Court Appearance Remains Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A day ahead of former Indonesian
President Soeharto's trial on Thursday, August 31, it is still not
clear whether the defendant will personally appear before the
court as the former strong man is reportedly not in a good shape
to face questioning.
</P>
<P>
"We will wait until tomorrow, the day Soeharto is expected to
appear. We can not make any speculations on the attendance of
Soeharto. Just wait," Spokesman of the Attorney General Office (
AGO) Yushar Yahya said in a telephone interview with Xinhua
Wednesday afternoon, when asked about the possible absence of
Soeharto from the trial.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have been spreading that the 79-year-old man may be
absent as his health condition is not good.
</P>
<P>
An unconfirmed report even said that Soeharto's blood pressure
significantly rose from 130 to 160 when he was told of his planned
trial on August 31.
</P>
<P>
"His blood pressure now reaches 160 and it will be dangerous if
Soeharto is forced to speak (before the court)," a source, who
asked for anonymity, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said he was sure that the former president, who ran the
country for more than three decades with an iron hand, most likely
will not attend the court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto's lawyer Mohammad Assegaf said his client
will undergo a medical checkup to make sure he is okay to appear
before the court.
</P>
<P>
"The medical team will examine him first, and the result of the
examination can be known by tomorrow morning. We still don't know
on that matter, at the moment," Assegaf told Xinhua in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
He also said the health condition of his client actually is bad
right now.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Wednesday afternoon's Suara
Pembaruan daily quoted Chief of the South Jakarta District Police
Senior Superintendent Edward Aritonang as saying the police will
deploy at least 1,247 security personnel consisting of an elite
mobile brigade unit, detectives and intelligence agents to
safeguard the trial process.
</P>
<P>
And on the eve of the day's trial, as many as 200 police
personnel will be deployed to safeguard the court room which is
located at the Ministry of Agriculture building in South Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, China, Vietnam to Jointly Set Up Rice Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, China and Vietnam are
planning to jointly establish a rice fund to sell rice of the
three countries in the world market, the Thai News Agency (TNA)
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Department of Foreign Trade Krirkrai
Jirapaet was quoted as saying after returning from China that
China had shown its interest in joining Vietnam and Thailand in
setting up the planned rice fund, called Rice Pool, to sell rice
to the international market.
</P>
<P>
China was studying details of the initiative and would send a
delegation to Thailand in late September or early October to
discuss the issue with Vietnamese and Thai delegates, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Krirkrai, who will be the new permanent secretary for the
Commerce Ministry as of October 1, said that China's imports of
rice from Thailand in the first seven months of this year were
slightly lower than the same period of last year due to higher
prices and that most Thai rice exports to China in the January-to-
July period were jasmine or Hom Mali rice, which is a unique high-
quality Thai rice.
</P>
<P>
China also expressed its interest in the progress of Thailand's
move to set up a future market for agricultural products, aiming
to help address falling prices of Thai farm products in the world
market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Krirkrai visited China between August 21 and 23 to hold talks
with Chinese officials.

BEIJING -- Shanghai Municipality is seeking two or three big-
name diamond and jewelry investors to establish its diamond
exchange center.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, some Israeli companies have expressed an
interest," said Yan Nanhai, executive head of the Shanghai Diamond
Exchange Center's (SDEC) preparatory group, Shanghai Lujiazui
Development Group (SLDG).
</P>
<P>
According to Yan, the foreign-owned shares are expected to
exceed 25 percent. "But I don't think they will be more than 50
percent."
</P>
<P>
"Diamond dealers who import rough diamonds from foreign
countries and then export them after processing from SDEC will not

JAKARTA -- The Indonesian government predicted that the country
's net income from crude oil will jump to 32 trillion rupiah (
about 40 billion U.S. dollars) this year on sizzling world oil
prices.

The new estimate represents a 54 percent rise against earlier
forecast, said a statement issued Tuesday by the Coordinating
Ministry for Economy.
</P>
<P>
As Asia's only member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), Indonesia expected crude oil price to

BANGKOK-- Thailand's domestic car sales this year are
apparently unable to reach the earlier target of 280,000 units, as
consumer confidence hurt by the continuous gasoline prices hike,
the Automotive Industry Club of the Federation of Thai Industry
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The increase of gasoline prices by around 60% from early this
year is discouraging buyers who are now delaying their decision to
purchase cars," the organization said in a report, noting that car
sales for the entire year is expected to be some 20,000 units
below the original target.
</P>
<P>
It said the gasoline price hike's effect on vehicle sales was
obvious in July which saw domestic sales of 20,500 vehicles, down
from 23,000 vehicles in June.
</P>
<P>
It added that the gasoline price hike will still have a
negative impact on car sales in August as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Tight security will begin from
Friday at all Olympic venues with the date being declared "
Lockdown Day" by Australia's New South Wales state Police
Commissioner and Games security chief Peter Ryan Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"You will not be allowed in unless you have the appropriate
accreditation," Ryan told journalists in Sydney. "It doesn't
matter who you are.
</P>
<P>
"No vehicle will be allowed in that hasn't been signed for and
fully searched," he said. "Objects that people are carrying will
also be searched and examined."
</P>
<P>
Ryan said although the early decision to tightly secure access
to Olympic Park, Darling Harbour and other Games precincts had not
been taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
"All our efforts are aimed at ensuring a safe, enjoyable
Olympic experience for competitors, patrons and spectators," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Olympic-related sites would become something akin to
passing through customs at the airport, the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"This means (you) will walk through a magnetometer (or metal
detector) and have your bags checked," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ryan said more than 1,200 security personnel would be on hand
to search for suspicious objects, parcels in the wrong place and
anything that might resemble a bomb or booby trap over the next 48
hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Police would find it almost
impossible to protect the Olympic Games from a nutty individual
with a home-made bomb, Olympic official Graham Richardson said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said a mad individual would be a bigger threat to
Games security than a well-organized international terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
"The greater danger will always come from the nutter, the
individual nutter making a bomb in the basement or in the garage
who wants to place it somewhere as happened in Atlanta,"
Richardson told journalists.
</P>
<P>
"That would be the kind of thing that a police department would
find it almost impossible to prepare against," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We just have to hope and pray that the good sense of
Australians wins out and we don't have those sort of people," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Richardson played down a threat to Sydney's Lucas Heights
nuclear facility and said he doubted an international terrorist
organization would be able to penetrate the worldwide web of
security.
</P>
<P>
He said everything possible was being done to track potential
danger.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Textile Producer Reports Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east China,
one of the country's top three textile producers, reported 600
million yuan (about 72 million U.S. dollars) of profits generated
by its textile industry during the first half of the year, a year-
on-year increase of 165 percent.
</P>
<P>
Combined sales of all major textile enterprises in the province
amounted to 14.5 billion yuan (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the
January-June period, up 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the upward trend to a massive national
program to restructure the industry, which had suffered losses for
years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that by the end of last year, China
had cut down its textile production capacity by scraping 9.06
million outmoded spindles, ending the industry's five-year streak
of operating in the red with a net profit of 800 million yuan (96.
3 million U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has so far reduced its total number of textile
enterprises from 346 to 224, with its outdated spindles decreasing
by 810,000.
</P>
<P>
The province has also made efforts to develop dozens of new and
high-tech products. Investment to this end so far this year added
up to 2.3 billion yuan (277 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Tibet Expects Booming Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that 185,000
people from at home and abroad visited Tibet Autonomous Region in
the first half of the year, an increase of 57 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas visitors rose by 40 percent to reach 35,
000 in the six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism department predicted that Tibet will become one
of the top choices of worldwide travelers in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Sources from local tourism department attributed the increase
in visitors to the facts that Chinese people now have more
holidays, which enable them to visit places as far away as Tibet.
During this year's International Labor's Day holiday, Tibet
witnessed a sharp increase of visitors from across the country,
especially from Shanghai, Guangdong Province and other coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
Opening up of the region is cited as another factor which
attracts more and more overseas travelers. The Potala Palace once
received some 600 visitors daily.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa, Xigaze and Shannan, visitors have to live at the
homes of local residents because local hotels are booked out.
</P>
<P>
Logqog, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said that
Tibet plans to further open its tourism market and expand local
tourism zones.
</P>
<P>
Tibet boasts rich tourism resources which include 50 mountains
with an elevation of over 7,000 meters, seven peaks which are more
than 8,000 meters high, the Yarlung Zangbo River valley, the
longest in the world, colorful landforms and special wildlife
resources. The region also has typical traditional culture, the
Potala Palace and several hundred temples and monasteries.

<HEADLINE> More Sewage, Garbage Treatment Plants for Three Gorges Project Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality will build 10 sewage treatment plants and 11 garbage
treatment plants in its counties around the Three Gorges Reservoir
project area before 2003.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, these areas will be able to treat 380,000 tons
of waste water and 2,800 tons of garbage daily, said an official
with the Chongqing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Reservoir will also be able to generate
electricity by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges area is a major polluting source of the
Yangtze River. 1999 statistics show that a total of 1.33 billion
tons of waste water was discharged into the reservoir in Chongqing
and 520,000 tons of garbage was produced in the area each year.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee a quality environment for the Three Gorges
Reservoir, both the central and local governments have worked out
regulations on environmental protection in the area.
</P>
<P>
In another development, central China's Hubei Province also
plans to build sewage and garbage treatment plants in its
reservoir area.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries fluctuated
within a range less than 0.10 percent with the trade volume valued
at 1.65 billion yuan on Wednesday, a little more than Tuesday's 1.
45 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six current treasuries paced up while the other
three down today, according to Homeway, China's on-line financial
and securities company.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 tumbled further by 0.09 percent below its five-day
average price to 145.72 yuan, lifting the yield up 0.02 percentage
points to 3.82 percent. The bond now has the supports from the ten-
day and 20-day averages.
</P>
<P>
The new floating-rate 010004, whose coupon rate is 2.87 percent
this year, edged up 0.03 percent to 104.81 yuan, offsetting
yesterday's tame loss.
</P>
<P>
As to the two bonds listed in 1999, Bond 009905 closed the
session down 0.03 percent while 009908 finished up 0.04 percent.
The former registered the biggest turnover among all bonds at 634
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The T-bond trade recovered a bit from the previous slump as
domestic stock markets dropped out of the four-day boom today.
However, the yield gap between the quiet T-bond trade and the
bullish equity market makes investors very enthusiastic for stocks,
so capital is expected to return to the latter and buoy it up
after a few corrections that represent more room for future
profits.
</P>
<P>
China's repo market maintained the quiet outlook. Trade volume
of three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day repurchasing
transactions totaled 1.67 billion yuan, down 24 million yuan from
yesterday. However, most of the repurchasing interest rates
rallied slightly. The interest rate of the three-day repurchasing
agreement gained 0.74 percentage points to 3.80 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's foreign trade deficit increased by 107.5
percent to 11.7 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this
year, compared to last year's figure of 5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published by the State Institute of
Statistics on Tuesday, imports rose by 36 percent in the first six
months to 25 billion dollars and exports rose by 4.5 percent to 13.
4 billion.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the sharp increase of imports cannot entirely be
linked to strong domestic demand but is also fueled by the strong
dollar and high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey will continue with a total of 15 power
projects, 10 build-operate-transfer (BOT) and five build-own-
operate(BOO), in order to meet the nation's energy needs.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 15 projects which were guaranteed by the
Treasury during the term of past governments, the government's High
Planning Board will give approval as soon as possible on a total of
29 schemes including 17 wind-power projects, that will go onstream
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting on Tuesday attended by senior
officials from all ministries concerned mainly to resolve a recent
dispute over energy investments.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The annual trade volume between Turkey and Romania is
expected to increase from 700 million dollars to 1 billion,
officials predicts.
</P>
<P>
Izmir Chamber of Commerce Chairman Ekrem Demirtas made the
prediction when he was meeting with a Romanian trade delegation
that was in Izmir, southwest Turkey, for the city's international
trade fair.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are 6,000 Turkish companies doing business in
Romania with 200 million dollars in capital investment, and this
makes Turkey the sixth largest investor in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The free trade agreement which was signed between the two
countries will definitely make it possible for the two sides to
raise trade volume to 1 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman Aviation Services Company, which owns Oman
Air, said it has suffered a net loss of 1.8 million rials (4.7
million dollars) in the first six months of 2000 compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A company report said the firm made a net profit of 1.4 million
rials (3.66 million dollars) in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Despite a growth of 25 percent in the airline revenue, the
increase in world oil prices has almost doubled our fuel cost for
the period under comparison negating the gain in revenue," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It said its net assets fell to 20 million rials (52 million
dollars) between January to June this year from 23.2 million rials
(60.32 million dollars) in the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Its share capital of 10.5 million rials (27.3 million dollars)
remained unchanged, it said.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Income from higher oil prices is expected to cut
around 30 percent of Oman's forecast 2000 budget deficit of 349
million rials (906 million dollars), a senior official of National
Economy Ministry said .
</P>
<P>
"We expect to slash the budget deficit that we forecast for 2000
by 100 million rials by the end of the year due to higher oil
prices," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf country's oil revenues rose 68 percent to 757.4 million
rials (1.97 billion dollars) in the first six months of 2000
compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total income in this period, 980 million rials (2.548
billion dollars), is nearly 41 percent higher than that in the
similar period in 1999 which includes gas, tax, duty and capital
revenues, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Coordinates With US on Hostage Case: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
closely coordinating with the United States on the case involving
the kidnapping of American Jeffrey Schilling by the Abu Sayyaf
group, Manila said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said the abduction would be treated as a kidnap-for-ransom
case.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said a "full range of consultations" is now being
conducted between the Philippine and U.S. governments to determine
what steps should be taken to resolve the latest kidnapping
incident.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we will treat this as a kidnap-for-ransom
case.Since an American is involved, it is necessary for us to know
the view of the American government on this matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the government is confirming reports that
Schilling's fiancee is a cousin of Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Sabaya.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government is heartened over the U.S.
government's position that it will not give any ransom or
concession to Schilling's abductors.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine authorities confirmed Tuesday that the Abu
Sayyaf kidnapped an American national in the southern Philippines
on Monday,saying the Muslim rebels threatened to kill him unless
the United States accepts their demands.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group reportedly threatened to kill Schilling
unless Washington releases from U.S. jails three international
terrorists, namely the three Muslim militants imprisoned in
connection with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Zamora noted that Washington, which strictly implements its no-
negotiation policy toward terrorists, understands that giving in
to the demands of the Abu Sayyaf extremists now would only
embolden them to conduct more abductions later.
</P>
<P>
He cited reports reaching him that Schilling had been advised
not to go to Zamboanga, but the American proceeded to go there "
for personal reasons."
</P>
<P>
In a separate radio speech, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said that according to the American Embassy, Schilling is an Islam
convert and is not affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency
or any other agency of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
"He is a convert of Islam and came here looking for a wife. He
is not connected with the CIA," Mercado said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Parties Urged to Increase Women in Next Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's political parties
have been urged to increase the number of women lawmakers in the
new 11th parliament to eliminate political violence and unruly
behavior, party sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Women's Affairs Hema Ratnayake has written to the
leaders of registered parties requesting them to field at least 25
percent women candidates for the upcoming general elections due on
October 10.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the elections began on Monday and will conclude
by noon next Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the 10th parliament there are only 11 women members, out of
a total of 225.
</P>
<P>
In her letter to political party leaders, Ratnayake said
political violence and unruly behavior could be controlled when
the election campaign is conducted under the leadership of women.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is rife with political violence and terrorist attacks,
especially in public rallies and during election campaigns.
Already three people respectively from the ruling People's
Alliance and the main opposition United National Party and the
left-wing People's Liberation Front have been killed in pre-
nominations violence.
</P>
<P>
Ratnayake said Sri Lanka has set an example to the whole world
when Sirimavo Bandaranaike was elected as the first woman prime
minister in the world.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that President Chandrika Kumaratunga had
proved that women can unite and provide leadership to many
political parties when she has successfully ruled the country even
by having a simple majority in the 10th parliament for six years.

UNITED NATIONS -- Chinese religious leaders participating in
the Millennium World Peace Summit withdrew angrily a meeting at
the U.N. assembly hall Tuesday night, strongly condemning a so-
called representative of the Dalai Lama reading a letter of the
Dalai Lama to the religion summit.
</P>
<P>
Among the Chinese religious leaders leaving the assembly hall
included Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, a well-known
living Buddha of the Tibetan Buddhism. "It is unwise for the
Dalai Lama to dispatch a representative to read his letter to the
Millennium World Peace Summit, though he is clever not to attend
the summit," said Sheng Hui, a Buddhist master and deputy director
of the Chinese Association of Buddhism, after withdrawing the
meeting. (China-Religion-Dalai Lama)

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Comes Top for Per Capita Disposable Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 30 (Xinhua) --Shenzhen is at the top among
domestic Chinese cities in terms of per capita annual disposable
income.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by Shenzhen Statistics Information
Bureau shows that the per capita annual disposable income in
Shenzhen was 20,240 yuan (about 2,440 U.S. dollars) in 1999. This
is more than 26.6 times the figure in 1979, one year before
Shenzhen became a special economic zone (SEZ).
</P>
<P>
Along with the general improvement in life, 70 percent of the
families in Shenzhen own apartment flats or houses and other
private properties and 20 percent of the households have their own
cars.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the families in this southern Chinese city
have taken out insurance policies for retirement pension and
medical care. Thirty percent of the local households have also
taken out commercial life insurance policies, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen became a SEZ on August 26, 1980, together with three
other coastal cities of Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen. Hainan also
joined the ranks in April 1988.
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous changes have taken place in all the five SEZs,
especially in the first four ones. Shenzhen, in particular, has
become a city full of vitality and vigor.
</P>
<P>
While enjoying social and economic progress in Shenzhen, local
residents are confident that the goal set by the Shenzhen
government to lead the country in realizing the socialist
modernization by 2005 will be attained.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kodak (China) Co. announced
today that three new types of digital cameras (DCs) will be put on
the Chinese market soon.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the company's business management in
China disclosed that his company made the decision based on the
increasing demand for DCs in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The three new cameras include DC4800, which boasts high
resolving power and can produce clearer pictures. The camera has
more photometry functions and that of adjusting colors under
different weather conditions and at different temperatures.
</P>
<P>
The second type is DC5000, a kind of camera which is water-
proof, dust-proof and quake-proof. The camera can resist high
temperatures, winds and sand, coldness and dampness. The camera is
capable of producing photos which can survive temperatures ranging
from 32 degrees minus Celsius to 70 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The third type is DC3400 which can shoot three pictures within
1.7 seconds. The camera is called the "fast hand of the digital
camera family".
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 70,000 DCs were sold in China last
year, up 78 percent from the 40,000 DCs in 1998. Kodak products
accounted for 43 percent of China's DC market in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the International Digital Group (IDG)
show that 4.9 million DCs were sold worldwide last year. The
number is expected to exceed 8.5 million this year.

HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region will actively adopt information
technology and build an electronic government, a senior Hong Kong
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is an integral part of Hong Kong's Digital 21 Strategy

effectiveness and quality of public service delivery.
</P>
<P>
The second is to promote the wider adoption of e-commerce with
the government setting a leading example.
</P>
<P>
The third is, through the e-government program, to integrate

Al Ahram:

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Decides Not to Restrict Inter-communal Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has promised a group of Greek and Turkish businessmen that
his regime would no longer impose restrictions on contacts between
the two communities in Cyprus, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Brussels group, a bicommunal group of businessmen
comprising 10 Greek and nine Turkish Cypriots, met on Monday with
Denktash in northern Cyprus to discuss ways of rapprochement
between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also put forward the idea of cooperation between the
Cyprus Telecommunications Authority and the corresponding Turkish
Cypriot services.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Greek Cypriot delegation, Dinos Lordos, said
Tuesday that Denktash stressed his proposals and promises were not
aimed at promoting acknowledgment of his self-declared regime in
norther Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
republic in northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktash agreed that it would be possible for the two
communities to cooperate in telecommunications since they have done
so already in water distribution.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides will meet the group on
Thursday to discuss Denktash's proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels group first met in 1997 in the Belgian capital and
has held four meetings, trying to promote the idea of bicommunal
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels meetings were organized with the help of the
International Peace Research Institute in Oslo, Norway, with
sponsorship of the United States and Norwegian governments.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Cypriot regime's restrictions imposed on
bicommunal activities has long held the group back from putting
their ideas into effect. The Turkish Cypriot regime started
becoming more flexible last year.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government welcomed the Brussels group's
initiatives, government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said, but
said that it would look into the matter of a bicommunal
cooperation, "as long as it does not promote acknowledgment of the
Turkish Cypriot regime."

<HEADLINE> American Drug-Charge Billionaire Named in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An American billionaire who
had fought a long legal battle to keep his name suppressed after
facing drug charges was Wednesday revealed as Ohio insurance king
Peter Lewis by Television New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Lewis is chairman, president and chief executive officer of the
giant Progressive Corporation, an Ohio-based motor vehicle
insurance company, which employs 14,000 people and has annual
sales of 4.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lewis owns 15 percent of the company, giving him an estimated
wealth of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The American billionaire was caught trying to smuggle a
personal stash of cannabis into New Zealand in January. He
admitted importing 100 grams of cannabis plant and resin into the
country, but was granted name suppression and discharged without
conviction in a district court after paying a donation to a local
drug rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
However, the New Zealand Herald, the country's largest
newspaper based in Auckland, challenged the suppression order
vigorously and echoed the concerns of many who claimed the man had
been treated leniently because of his wealth.
</P>
<P>
An eight-month battle followed for maintaining or overturning
the name suppression order.
</P>
<P>
Lewis lost Tuesday when the New Zealand Court of Appeal upheld
an earlier high court ruling in favor of the New Zealand Herald.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias said the name
suppression order made by the district court was "plainly wrong."
</P>
<P>
"No grounds are available to the judge which can justify
departing from the important principle of open justice," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Shares at the Philippine Stock
Exchange managed to close higher Wednesday, after investors
continued to position in blue chip stocks after news of better-
than-expected economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, gained 9.91
points to close at 1,524.16.
</P>
<P>
The broader all-shares index closed 1.33 points higher at 681.
53.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the country's better-than expected gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 4.5 percent in the second quarter propped
up market activity.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the National Economic Development Authority said
the GDP growth, which is higher than market forecast of 3.5
percent, was bolstered by the strong performance of the
agricultural and services sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts have expressed doubts about the
sustainability of the country's economic growth due to the
unresolved Mindanao crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Mindanao crisis is expected to affect the agricultural
production, as Mindanao is a big agricultural producer in the
country. Affecting the agriculture sector would mean the crisis is
likely to hinder the sustainability of the economic growth," said
Luz Lorenzo,a local market researcher.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Foreign Debt Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's net foreign debt
soared sharply in the second quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures just released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS), the country's net foreign debt jumped by 10
billion Australian dollars (5.74 billion U.S. dollars) in the
second quarter this year to a new record 268 billion Australian
dollars (153.83 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the past one year, the country's foreign debt rose 36
billion Australian dollars (20.66 billion U.S. dollars) or 15.5
percent, ABS said.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that the debt is equal to 43.1 percent of
Australia's gross domestic product, up from 39 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some local economists believe that the high foreign debt is the
main reason behind the Australian dollar's fall since last
December.
</P>
<P>
Since the Howard government was elected in March 1996, the
country's net foreign debt has risen by 98 billion Australian
dollars (56.25 billion U.S. dollars) or nearly 60 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The integration activities being
under taken by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (
COMESA) will serve as a base to economically and politically
integrate Africa, Organization for African Unity (OAU) development
policy expert Femi Fajana has said.
</P>
<P>
Fajana, who is attending the on-going Investment Agencies'
chief executives' workshop in Lusaka, was quoted by Wednesday's
The Post newspaper as saying that the OAU would achieve its
economic and political integration if the regional blocs are
integrated.
</P>
<P>
"OAU's main objective is to come up with an economically
integrated Africa and (it) is happy with what COMESA is doing in
integrating the economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert, however, noted that individual member countries
need to do a lot of work on policies so that they can attract the
kind of development that Africa needs.
</P>
<P>
OAU is optimistic of the development and change in the region
because a mechanism of conflict resolutions have been established
with specific objectives of ensuring economic and political
stability, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kissing Can Transmit HIV: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Luke Montagnier, who discovered
the Human Immuno-defficiency Virus (HIV), has warned of a
possibility of getting the virus through kissing, the New Vision
daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Montagnier, who arrived here for a two-day scientific visit,
said on Tuesday that the deeper the kiss, the higher the risk of
catching HIV.
</P>
<P>
Saliva could carry HIV and injuries in the mouth facilitate the
transmission of the virus through saliva, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The risk of saliva transmission is very low but we cannot
eliminate it completely," he said. "One has to be cautious about
deep kissing even if saliva has some protective effects. But
sexual transmission is the most important."
</P>
<P>
Montagnier is in Uganda to work with scientists here to find
out "co-factors" that make HIV infection as well as progression of
AIDS faster in Africa than in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
"This would facilitate the search for a cure or effective
prevention," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said HIV alone is not enough to explain the high rate of
AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, noting that some of the co-factors
make it easier for people to acquire HIV infection while others
speed up the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 11 percent of the world
population, bears 70 percent of the AIDS burden.

MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek government troops Wednesday
killed eight armed terrorists in a special operation to free two
military servicemen held hostage by Islamic militants in central
mountains, the Interfax news agency reported.

A large amount of weapons and ammunition was also confiscated
and the surviving terrorists were sealed off. The fighting to

WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Two-time champion Patrick
Rafter was ousted by Spaniard Galo Blanco in the first round of
the U.S. Open tennis championships on Tuesday night when the two-
time champion was upset in 7-6(7-3),2-6, 6-3, 1-6, 7-6(7-5) in New

</P>
<P>
The 114th-ranked Blanco played took the fifth-set tie-break to
oust the fan favorite and recent Wimbledon runner-up in a battle
of three hours.
</P>
<P>
Blanco had won just two matches since May and had but one U.S.
Open match win in four previous forgettable trips to Flushing
Meadows. But he will likely never forget this trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
The ouster of the 20th-ranked Rafter, considered the most
dangerous unseeded player in the field, ended a day that saw
second-seeded French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten also sent
packing in the first round after a four-set loss to Australian
qualifier Wayne Arthurs.

JINAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- While attracting a growing number
of overseas investors, east China's Shandong Province, a major
economic powerhouse, has taken measures to encourage investment
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the provincial government say the province
encourages local enterprises in the machinery, chemicals, textiles
and building materials sectors to set up subsidiaries abroad.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, entrepreneurs from Shandong have
already established 109 business firms in some 70 countries, with
a total investment of 260 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has been promoting investment abroad since 1998 as part
of its effort to improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
Governments elsewhere have also taken steps to help local
businesses transfer their production lines to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang province in east China has just issued a series of
preferential policies on promoting investment overseas, including
easy loans and tax refunds for exported equipment and raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's leading industrial and commercial city, is
drafting new rules to promote investment in Africa, Latin America

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Tightens Security as General Elections draw  near  By Zhang Yadong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is tightening its
security as all parties are geared up for the nomination of
candidates to contest the upcoming general elections scheduled to
be held on October 10.
</P>
<P>
In recent days President Kumaratunga has ordered the police of
the island country on the Indian Ocean to be alert and take every
possible measure to prevent political violence ahead of the
Parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
In the crowded narrow streets of the capital city Colombo, more
check points enclosed with green sand bags are set up with heavily
armed soldiers on alert and inquiries into suspected vehicles also
increased. Some roads surrounding crucial government organizations
are closed as soon as night curtain falls.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the ruling People's Alliance (PA) DM
Jayaratne has said that President Kumaratunga would not attend
public rallies due to security reasons and Prime Minister
Ratnasiri Wickramanayake, who succeeded Kumaratunga's mother
Sirimavo Bandaranaike earlier this month, wound attend all rallies
on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
However, Jayaratne said that Kumaratunga herself would attend
district conferences of her Sri Lankan Freedom Party, the main
constituent of PA. The President has attended two meetings of her
party and would attend five more such meetings, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is rife in political violence and terrorist attacks,
especially in public rallies and during elections campaigns. The
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who has been involved in
a 17-year bloody fight for independence against government forces,
is blamed for almost all the violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
During the presidential election last December, Kumaratunga
narrowly escaped an attempt on her life at the cost of losing
vision in her right eye, when a suicide bomber struck after an
election rally in Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
The history of Sri Lanka is one filled with successive
political assassination and violence. Among the victims are
President Kumaratunga's father and husband who were murdered due
to political reasons and former President Premadasa, who was
killed in a May Day rally in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The most recent violent event took place in early June this
year when Minister of Industrial development C.V. Gunaratne was
killed in a suicide bombing carried out by suspected Tamil Tiger
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Political violence is a severe menace to a peaceful ballot. To
ensure a free and fair election and minimize vote rigging, the
Election Commissioner's Department of Sri Lanka will take a number
of special precautionary measures. The polling agents of all
parties at polling booths are allowed to travel with the ballot
box to the counting center and be present when the box is handed
over to the presiding officer there.
</P>
<P>
Although there is a rising appeal for a peaceful poll and some
precautionary measure are to be taken by concerned government
departments, observers here believe that violent attacks are
inevitable after nominations for candidates to enter the general
elections wind up.
</P>
<P>
In a public announcement, the U.S. State Department cautioned
its citizens in Sri Lanka on Tuesday to take extra safety measures
and to be on the alert for violence in the run-up to the October
elections.
</P>
<P>
It advised U.S. citizens based here to avoid political rallies
and government and military installations, which have been
targeted by LTTE although heavy army presence is deployed.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The youngest of the Chinese
Siamese twins, born on May 28, survived separation surgery on
Monday, but the eldest twin died about eight hours after the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the surviving twin is still in an unstable
condition and is receiving special care.
</P>
<P>
The twin infant girls were born in the city of Rui'an, in east
China's Zhejiang Province. The twins were born attached at the
abdomen, sharing a colon and with abnormal urogenital and
excretory systems.
</P>
<P>
They were admitted into Zhejiang Provincial Children's Hospital
in June.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the survival rate for Siamese twins is
less than 10 percent. To increase the likelihood of success of
surgery, doctors didn't perform the operation until the girls grew
to a weight of 7.2 kg.
</P>
<P>
The surgery, which started at 9:50, lasted approximately four
hours. Yet the elder girl died of blood circulation failure at
about 22:00 despite all emergency measures.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the main cause of death was that she could not
adapt to her new independent circulatory system.

GUANGZHOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of 233 migrants from
the reservoir area of the Three Gorges water control project, in
the middle reaches of Yangtze River, arrived in Boluo County,
South China's Guangdong Province, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The migrants, who were warmly welcomed by local residents and
officials Tuesday, came from Dachang Township of Wushan County,
Chongqing. They are the first of the 606 migrants Guangdong will
receive this year.
</P>
<P>
China will relocate 125,000 people living in the reservoir area
in the forthcoming nine years, 70,000 of whom will be sent to 11
regions in coastal provinces including Shanghai, Guangdong and
Shandong.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the plan of the central government,
Guangdong Province alone will receive 7,000 migrants from the
reservoir area of the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Siping, deputy secretary-general of Guangdong Provincial
Government, said at the welcoming ceremony that Guangdong is
obliged to offer a helping hand to the migrants and to help them
settle down quickly in their new homes.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, every migratory household is
allotted an apartment flat with living space exceeding 20 sq m per
capita, a stretch of land, as well as daily necessities such as
home appliances, furniture, cooking utensils, food grain for a
month, and seasonings.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Strengthen Cooperation in Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia are expected
to speed up their study on the feasibility of developing a gas
field in east Siberia and piping the gas to China and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries would start the feasibility study on piping
gas to China from the offshore gas field near Sakhalin Island, and
supplying south China with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from an
offshore oil field at an early date, according to the just-
concluded 9th International Seminar on Peace and Development in
Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
These are only a few cooperative programs between China and
Russia in the energy field. The two countries have reached
agreements on extending their cooperation to petroleum and natural
gas, including providing China with crude oil and product oil at
reciprocal prices, building a natural gas pipeline network in
China, establishing a unified power grid in China, and jointly
developing gas and oil fields in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Xia Shanyi, a researcher with the Institute of International
Studies, said that Sino-Russian cooperation in the energy field
has been strengthened since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China became a net gas importer in 1993. The gap between demand
and supply was enlarged annually. The gas consumption this year
was estimated at 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Russia owns 13 percent of the world's oil reserves and 45
percent of the world's natural gas reserves, which are located in
Siberia and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in oil and gas between the two countries is also
open to other foreign businesses. Companies from the United States,
Japan, and Republic of Korea planned to take part in the
cooperative program.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Visit Raises Controversies in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
scheduled to visit Colombia Wednesday with a promise of 1.3
billion U.S. dollars in aid; The Colombian response to his
generosity, however, is mixed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will visit Colombia in support of the Plan Colombia, a
strategy proposed by the Colombian government to fight drugs,
which requires a total investment of 7.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a major drug producer, Colombia has been plagued with drug-
related crimes, which have raised great concerns both at home and
abroad. Therefore, the Colombian government is seeking
international cooperation including U.S. financial aid to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
With the Plan Colombia as a concrete measure in his anti-drug
efforts, Colombian President Andres Pastrana contends that " Plan
Colombia is a peace plan" because 75 percent of the total 7.5
billion dollars is meant for social investments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. financial support to Plan Colombia, the only guaranteed
resources up to now, has stirred up controversy and opposition in
Colombia because 70 percent of it will go to the military.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's impending visit and the U.S. financial aid has
further generated an intense controversy over whether Plan
Colombia will provide an impetus to peace talks or -- after 40
years of political violence that has left over 35,000 dead in
Colombia in the last decade -- is it a program that will intensify
the war between the Colombian government and the rebel guerrilla
groups that maintain irregular armed forces with earnings from
cocaine
</P>
<P>
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest
guerrilla force in the country, has warned the plan may lead
directly to American military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Colombian rebels have also launched "armed strikes" in protest
to Clinton's forthcoming visit, with increasing violent
occurrences, including setting vehicles on fire.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as the day approaches, the violence-wracked South
American country has turned Cartagena, the destination of
Clinton's impending visit to Colombia, into a more attractive city.
</P>
<P>
Security has been intensified in Cartagena for Clinton's nine-
hour visit. About 10,000 servicemen from both the U.S. and
Colombia are stationed in the city to ensure order.
</P>
<P>
Coordinated work for security involves Colombia's Navy, as well
as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Administrative
Security (DAS) from the U.S. side.

<HEADLINE> Bishop Shocked at CNN Accusation of China's Occupation of Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fu, chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, who
heads the Chinese delegation of religious leaders to the United
Nations, made the remark in an interview broadcast live by CNN,
which also conducted a live interview with the Dalai Lama a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
A CNN news anchorman said in the interview Monday that China
has occupied Tibet for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Fu told CNN that Tibet has been included in the Chinese
territorial map since the 13th century, and has thus been an
inalienable part of the country.
</P>
<P>
"I wish such simple mistakes by CNN could be avoided," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Dalai Lama's recent remarks on the ongoing
Millennium World Peace Summit, Bishop Fu said that the Dalai Lama
is merely paying lip service by speaking nice words such as peace,
harmony, compromise and non-violence. "In fact, he has been
creating conflicts and stirring up confrontations and hatred," the
bishop said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng, Annan Agree on Enhanced U.N. Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, met here
Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan before a
parliamentary conference.
</P>
<P>
The two agreed that the role of the United Nations should be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese parliamentary leader, who arrived here Monday for
the Millennium Conference of Presiding Officers of Parliaments,
told the U.N. chief that the gathering shows a closer working
relationship between the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped the conference would provide world parliamentary
leaders with a platform for an extensive exchange of views on
various issues and a solid ground for cooperation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind in the 111-year IPU
history, will start Wednesday afternoon, a week ahead of a
Millennium Summit in the U.N. headquarters, with participation by
over 150 parliamentary leaders. An enhanced role of the United
Nations in the 21st century will be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"There will be consensus and diversified views, but we can
promote our common understanding among one another and expand our
cooperation while preserving our differences," said Li Peng, who
is also deputy chairman of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Annan said support from the IPU was indispensable for U.N.
success and hoped the relationship between the two organizations
will be further developed. China, a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council, should play a greater role in the U.N. and the
IPU as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng agreed that the authority and charter of the U.N. and
the Security Council should be maintained and no international or
regional organization should be allowed to bypass them to pursue
their own interests.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its support for the U.N. and Secretary-
General Annan in maintaining peace and promoting development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li also lashed out at the U.S. attempt to develop and deploy a
national missile defense system, saying it is not conducive to
international arms control and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
China is concerned about the U.S. plan, which will adversely
affect the international and regional strategic balance and
stability, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he totally understood and agreed with China on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Li briefed the U.N. chief on the new developments
across the Taiwan Straits. Annan assured the Chinese leader of the
U.N.'s support of the "One China" policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
predicted that the country's net income from crude oil will jump
to 32 trillion rupiah (about 40 billion U.S. dollars) this year on
sizzling world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The new estimate represents a 54 percent rise against earlier
forecast, said a statement issued Tuesday by the Coordinating
Ministry for Economy.
</P>
<P>
As Asia's only member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), Indonesia expected crude oil price to
average 28 U.S. dollars a barrel for this fiscal year, much higher
than the state budget assumption of 20 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The country's truncated 2000 budget runs from April to December.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, for the 2000 budget it was estimated that net oil
income will increase to 32 trillion rupiah from 20.8 trillion
rupiah (about 3 billion U.S. dollars) because the government will
receive windfall profits from oil prices," the Indonesian Observer
daily Wednesday quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The price of oil will still continue to rise because of the
winter, noted the statement.

</P>
<P>
It said the gasoline price hike's effect on vehicle sales was
obvious in July which saw domestic sales of 20,500 vehicles, down
from 23,000 vehicles in June.
</P>
<P>
It added that the gasoline price hike will still have a
negative impact on car sales in August as well.
</P>
<P>
Besides the gasoline factor, the prolonged fall in agricultural
prices, coupled with the political uncertainty ahead of a general
elections later this year, could also push car sales lower, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, due to a considerable growth of car sales in
the first half of this year, domestic car sales in the entire year
will still remain well above last year's 218,330 units.

Out of 661 encephalitis cases reported throughout the country
this year, 334 have already been discharged from hospitals and 245
are still undergoing treatment, said the Epidemiology and Disease
Control Division of the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The patients are in back-up treatment as the government can not
provide anti-encephalitis vaccine this year, said Mahendra Bista,
director of the division.
</P>
<P>
"The government is unable to buy the vaccine since it is too
expensive," said Bista.
</P>
<P>
Bista said the death toll is still rising and is likely to
reach 200 as the epidemic will spread fast after the monsoon ends
in September.
</P>
<P>
People are infected with encephalitis when bitten by a
particular type of gnat, which usually appear during the rainy
season and increase in numbers due to unhygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The disease claims the lives of hundreds of people in Nepal
every year due to lack of medicines or medical personnel to
provide adequate treatment in time. The death toll stood at 434
last year.

<HEADLINE> China Protests Against Dalai Lama Representative's Speech at Religion Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 29, (Xinhua) -- Chinese religious
leaders participating in the Millennium World Peace Summit
withdrew angrily a meeting at the U.N. assembly hall Tuesday night,
strongly condemning a so-called representative of the Dalai Lama
reading a letter of the Dalai Lama to the religion summit.
</P>
<P>
Among the Chinese religious leaders leaving the assembly hall
included Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, a well-known
living Buddha of the Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
"It is unwise for the Dalai Lama to dispatch a representative
to read his letter to the Millennium World Peace Summit, though he
is clever not to attend the summit," said Sheng Hui, a Buddhist
master and deputy director of the Chinese Association of Buddhism,
after withdrawing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"His action interferes the normal process of the summit and
does not harmonize the general atmosphere of the meeting," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama has made use of religious activities to split
China since he fled China in 1959, the year the Chinese government
ended slavery in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Rev. Ms Cao Shengjie, another member of the Chinese Religious
Leaders Delegation to the summit, said, "the Dalai Lama is a
separatist and turmoil-maker. His separatist activities deeply
hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. So he is not qualified
to attend the summit."

NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
and President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Council Najma
Heptulla criticized the United States here Tuesday for refusing to
grant a visa to a Cuban Parliamentary speaker to attend the inter-
parliamentary conference at the headquarters of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Heptulla said during a meeting with Li that the IPU held a
special meeting for the visa refusal issue. She said the U.S. has
deprived Cuba of the right to participate in the dialog among
speakers of parliaments, which is the aim of the upcoming
conference.
</P>
<P>
Li said speakers from every IPU member parliament have the
right to attend meetings of the IPU and hoped the issue could be
resolved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Li said China hopes to increase understanding and
friendship with leaders of other member parliaments during the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived on Monday and met with several leaders of member
parliaments on Tuesday, including those of the Republic of Korea
and Viet Nam. He also met with Kofi Annan and IPU Secretary-
General Anders Johnsson.

WASHINGTON, August 29 (XInhua) -- The Dallas Mavericks acquired
Detroit Piston starters Christian Laettner and Terry Mills on

nicely into Nellie's offence."

TIANJIN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Post offices in rural areas of
Tianjin, north China's largest port city, have recently launched a
new service, using a car to carry the bride to the groom's house
on the wedding day.

Chinese, especially people in rural areas, like to have a
luxurious wedding, and often exhaust large amounts of money and
resources. The new service will cost a couple approximately 900
yuan (about 108 U.S. dollars) for shooting videos and taking
photos on the special occasion.

<HEADLINE> China Expects to Produce 90 Films This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China will produce around 90
films this year, a little less than last year.
</P>
<P>
This information was disclosed by Liu Jianzhong, bureau chief
of the Film Administration under the State Administration of Radio,
Film and Television.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China's movie shooting is becoming more and more
vigorous as themes and styles vary from one film to another. More
scientific technology has been adopted in producing movies. Young
and middle-aged directors are also playing a key role in
developing China's film industry.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jin, a renowned Chinese film director, said that he was
very impressed by the striking characteristics featured in films
directed by fifth-generation directors.
</P>
<P>
Home-made movies have been challenged by foreign rivals since
Chinese audiences have complained that some of the films were shot
in a rough and slipshod way and that plots were not attractive
enough.
</P>
<P>
As China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)
approaches, Chinese film makers feel more pressure to follow in
the footsteps of film directors that have made films that won "
Bravo" from both home and overseas audiences over the past few
years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Ready to Defend National Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI) is
ready to defend the national territory from external forces
threats including from a possible attack of East Timor Falintil
Guerrilla army, a military wing of the East Timorese pro-
independence group, a TNI senior officer said.
</P>
<P>
"Both technically and tactically, the TNI will be always ready
to defend the Indonesia's territory from any kind of external
threats," Maj.Gen. Kiki Syahnakri,commander of the Regional
Udayana Military Command overseeing provinces of Bali, East Nusa
Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara, was quoted Wednesday by Suara
Karya daily as saying, referring to a statement made by Xanana
Gusmao, a former leader of the East Timorese Falintil Guerrilla
Army.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao earlier said that his side would strike back and destroy
what he said as "the TNI-backed militia forces" inside West Timor,
a territory in East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
He also accused that the militia has been launching a terror of
campaign against East Timoreses in particular those who voted in
favor of independence in the U.N.-Sponsored direct ballot in
August last year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that over the last two months, clashes between U.N.
peacekeepers and pro-Jakarta gangs infiltrating across the rugged
border from West Timor have become much more frequent.
</P>
<P>
The united Nations, which is administering East Timor during
its transition to full independence, has repeatedly complained
that militiamen are using West Timor camps as a base for border
incursions.
</P>
<P>
Syahnakri further warned that if Xanana's threats comes true it
could be categorized as a form of invasion.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Ask Russia, U.S. to Help Probe Strange Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting an area where hundreds of
people have fallen ill with an unidentified disease, Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma said Tuesday that his country will seek
help from Russia and the United States in investigating the cause
of the illness.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma spoke at a special commission meeting in Boleslavchyk,
one of the stricken villages in the Mykolaiv region and the site
of a former Soviet rocket base, to review measures to tackle the
disease.
</P>
<P>
He said he would ask Russian President Vladimir Putin about
possible fuel discharges from missile bases during Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry said that since July 4, as many as 410
residents, including 240 children, from four villages near
Mykolaiv, 517 kilometers south of the capital Kiev, have been
reported sick.
</P>
<P>
These patients have symptoms of acute poisoning, rashes on the
skin, listlessness, lack of appetite, hacking cough, coma and
declining eyesight.
</P>
<P>
Ministry experts speculate that the cause of the disease may
lie in water resources severely polluted by chemical waste from
Soviet rocket bases.
</P>
<P>
A Health Ministry commission found high concentrations of
substances usually produced by decomposing rocket fuel in the soil,
drinking water wells and underground water in the area, commission
head Roman Sova told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Kuchma said that it was too early to define the cause of
the outbreak as rocket fuel before a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Defense Ministry has denied that the Ukrainian Army
or the Soviet military were to blame, as all fuel storage
facilities in the area were decommissioned in the 1970s and it was
technically impossible to spill any rocket fuel.

BRASILIA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's aircraft manufacturer
Embraer exported 1.415 billion U.S. dollars worth of jets in the
first seven months of this year, an increase of 62.24 percent over
the same period last year, said the Ministry of Development,
Industry and Foreign Trade on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Embraer, Latin America's largest jet manufacturer, represented
4.54 percent of Brazil's total exports from January to July, much
higher than Vale do Rio Doce Company, which exported 940.26
million dollars during this period.
</P>
<P>
The main export markets of Embraer are the United States, which
accounts for 37.78 percent, and Cayman Islands 18.4 percent,
France 14.8 percent, United Kingdom 8.9 percent, Switzerland 5.4
percent, and Italy 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Embraer imported 750.4 million dollars in goods, which puts it
in second place in Brazil's total amount of imports from January
to July, behind Brazil's state oil company Petroleos de Brazil (
PETROBRAS), which imported 3.87 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The imports by Embraer, representing 2.52 percent of Brazil's

<HEADLINE> Gore Accepts Three Presidential Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore has agreed to three debates with his Republican
rival George W. Bush, his campaign manager William Daley said in a
letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the Commission's proposal offers the
best opportunity for the most Americans to see the candidates in
the most effective forum to debate their views," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also eager to work with the Commission and the Bush
campaign on the other issues of format and logistics that would be
needed to implement this proposal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission, comprising both Democrats and Republicans,
offered to have three presidential debates ahead of the November 7
election on October 3, 11 and 17, respectively in Boston, North
Carolina and Missouri. The 90-minute debates will be broadcast by
main TV networks.
</P>
<P>
Gore's rival, Texas Governor Bush, has proposed holding five
debates, three presidential and two vice presidential, but has not
yet agreed to the commission's rules.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would welcome prime-time sessions, but perhaps not
the ones endorsed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
He alone will "pick and choose" the venues, formats and ground
rules for debates, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
His spokeswoman said that the options include a debate over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Top Bush aides are expected to meet with potential sponsors
soon, including six television networks and the commission.
</P>
<P>
Bush is likely to present his debate schedule after those
sessions.

taxis during the Olympic Games will be forced to pay an extra 10
percent after the New South Wales government accepted demands by
drivers for a Games bonus.
</P>
<P>
The surcharge will be on top an existing 20 percent surcharge
for journeys between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
But taxi drivers did not get it all their way -- they were
looking for an extra 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We believed it was appropriate to strike a balance that would
give taxi drivers an incentive to come out and work during the
Olympics but not unfairly hit passengers," said NSW Transport
Minister Carl Scully.
</P>
<P>
"It will apply 24 hours a day because I don't believe that
drivers should be disadvantaged, no matter what time of day they
work."
</P>
<P>
The fare will apply from September 13 to October 4.

SHANGHAI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is stepping up
research of techniques in recycling waste water for manufacturing
use.
</P>
<P>
Within one year's time, it is expected that large quantities
of sewage and waste water produced by the city, estimated at 5.8
million cubic meters per day, together with abundant rainwater,
will become a major water source for washing vehicles, watering
plants, and irrigating farmland.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that with the new technique, the city's
pollution will be reduced and water resources will used more
efficiently.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Relocates Herdsmen for Desert Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yi'an can not remember
exactly when his family began living in the desert, but he knows
well that all the people on the oasis in the Tengger desert will
settle down elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Wang's family has lived in the desert for many generations in
the desert in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. But
soon he and other families will leave their desert homes to settle
down in irrigation areas in neighboring Inner Mongolia, north
China.
</P>
<P>
To protect rare oasis resources, curb the spreading of the
desert and restore more grassland and forest land, the Chinese
government has decided to relocate desert residents to other
places with better living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Wang's family lives in the Jagat Village, a small piece of
oasis in the Tenggar Desert. Wang has built eight adobe rooms on
the border of this small oasis, and makes a living grazing camels.
</P>
<P>
"There are about 8,000 people who live inside the desert and
nearby places," said Chang Peifu, deputy head of the Tongguzhuor
Township, adding that "they rely mainly on grazing in the rare
oasises and planting crops."
</P>
<P>
Their horses, sheep, cows and camels eat a lot of sand plants,
and planting crops consumes a large portion of underground water
resources. "Such a living has seriously damaged the ecological
environment of oasises in the desert," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
China has suffered a lot from the advancing desertification in
recent years. The desertification has been cited as one of the
major factors leading to 12 sand storms which hit northwest, north
and even east China this spring.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has decided to take firm steps to check
the moving of the yellow sand. A large scale desert-control
project, consisting of 11 sub-programs, is being carried out in
more than 400 counties in the west of northeast China, the north
China and 14 provinces and autonomous regions in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
China will inject 12 billion yuan in desert control this year.
Large-scale man-planting and aerial-planting of trees and grass is
being carried out in the desertified areas of the country.

However, the area of sand plants has been enlarged in the
desert thanks to the efforts of aerial-planting over the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
"The situation could be better, if all the desert residents
move away," said Chang. "It is also for the benefit of local
herdsmen and farmers."
</P>
<P>
Chang said, desert residents live in bad conditions, have
little access to cultural life and entertainment and also have
difficulty seeing doctors and sending their children to school.
</P>
<P>
"If a man is seriously ill, he might die before reaching the
doctor," Chang said. "I have a 17-year-old daughter who has never
gone to school because there is no school near my home."
</P>
<P>
Granny Pan Congying, who has lived in the desert for 63 years,
said that "It's time to leave this place." She recalled that when
she was young, there was dense forest of sand plants, but now, her
homeland has turned into a "sea of sand".
</P>
<P>
The younger generation of the desert families are even more
longing for life outside the desert, though they have also bought
TV sets, motorcycles and installed telephones. Now, no one wants
to marry into the desert.
</P>
<P>
The Wang's and other residents of the Tenggar Desert will
settle down in the Alax League in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, where they can irrigate farmland with water
diverted from the Yellow River. Some of them are working in the
service sector like running restaurants and transporting goods.
</P>
<P>
Though only less than 10 percent of the 890 people in
Tongguzhuor Township have moved to their new homes, yet the
remaining are expected to leave the desert within four years,

<HEADLINE> Army Buys Medical Equipment Thru Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) recently bought 160 million yuan worth of medical
equipment through inviting 29 domestic and international bidders.
</P>
<P>
It has been the largest government procurement ever done in
China's medical sector, according to army sources.
</P>
<P>
In April 1999, the health department of the PLA General
Logistics Department adopted a unified procurement of medical
tools within the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the army purchased 145 pieces of medical equipment,
valued at 120 million yuan, with savings of saving hitting 15.2
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
This May, the health department sponsored an international
medical equipment exhibition which was attended by hundreds of
local and overseas manufacturers. Over 60 army hospitals bought
166 pieces of equipment and saved 36 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of government procurement has helped curb illegal
activities in the purchasing of medical equipment for the army,
sources noted.

Promotion, and Citizen Participation Law, and Ecuador's possible
participation in the Plan Colombia anti-drug initiative.

He said the government also intends to increase the value added
tax from 12 to 18 per cent and exhorted the population to save the
local currency, the sucre, which may be phased out and replaced by

every year because of contraband clothing, and a similar number of
jobs is also lost to clothing piracy."

He said that firms related to textiles are now in a precarious
state that could cause the destruction of Peru's clothing industry.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics disclosed by SNI, in trade and service
sectors, over 200,000 positions are lost due to contraband coming
from across the borders with Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile.

<HEADLINE> New Rules to Settle Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's top arbitration body,
the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission,
is revising its rules so that it can deal with disputes among
Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
The new rules, which will be issued soon, will allow the
commission to deal with foreign-related cases, but also domestic
arbitration, according to Li Yong, deputy director of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission, established in 1954 to handle business disputes
between foreign companies and Chinese enterprises, revised its
rules in 1998, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
These allowed it to deal with disputes among enterprises which
used foreign investment and disputes between such firms and
Chinese individuals or companies.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the National People's Congress's legal
Affairs Committee Hu Kangsheng predicted a bigger role for
arbitration organizations after the China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He urged domestic arbitration bodies to look at how disputes
are worked out in the WTO and to suggest new arbitration methods
to the government and companies.
</P>
<P>
Now there are 150 arbitration institutions across China. They
dealt with 7,400 cases involving 17 billion yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Foreign Diamond Center to Shine in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Municipality is seeking
two or three big-name diamond and jewellery investors to establish
its diamond exchange center, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, some Israeli companies have expressed an
interest," said Yan Nanhai, executive head of the Shanghai Diamond
Exchange Center's (SDEC) preparatory group, Shanghai Lujiazui
Development Group (SLDG).
</P>
<P>
He said the preparatory group was also in negotiations with
companies from other countries. "But no one is chosen yet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yan, the foreign-owned shares are expected to
exceed 25 percent. "But I don't think they will be more than 50
percent."
</P>
<P>
"Diamond dealers who import rough diamonds from foreign
countries and then export them after processing from SDEC will not
be levied with a tariff, value-added tax, consumption tax or other
taxes usually involved in processing," said Li Shanfen, director
of Shanghai Customs.
</P>
<P>
But once the processed diamonds enter the domestic market,
dealers will be taxed, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers of domestic diamonds will receive tax-returns if they
export their diamonds through SDEC.
</P>
<P>
To support the center, the 40,000-square-meter Lujiazui Diamond
Processing Zone is under construction.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Sector Wants Money: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- In addition to venture capital,
multi-channel investment involving commercial and investment bank
loans, specific funds and listings on stock markets, are expected
to speed up the development of the high-tech industry in China.
</P>
<P>
The number of high-tech advances approved by provincial
governments and central departments reached 45,000 last year,
statistics show, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"However, only 12 percent of the total products have been put
into production and promoted on the market," Ba Shusong, an
official with the assets and liability management department of
the Bank of China, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fact to a shortage of funds and a limited
capital investment channel into the high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in spite of investment by the companies themselves
and the central government, capital raised from the market comes
to just 2.3 percent of total funds raised for high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
"So far, bank and individual loans, government financial aid
and listing are the major fund channels for high-tech enterprises,
which is obviously far below the capital needs of the sector," Ba
said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial insiders said money pooled for a high-tech
enterprise will increase with its development, while the risks
involved should decrease by the day, which implies that a high-
tech enterprise should attract investment from different channels
in keeping with its various development periods.

<HEADLINE> Moon Cakes Have Good Quality: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Results from an examination of
China's moon cake producers showed 105 out of 113 samples came up
to national quality standards and overall conditions in the
industry were good.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision, covers 78 moon cake producers in 14
provinces, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In the recent tests, most samples showed producers were clean
and that their ingredients, such as flour, sugar and eggs, were of
good quality.
</P>
<P>
More checks will be carried out and any moon cake producers not
meeting required standards will be punished, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Moon cakes are a traditional Chinese food eaten on the night of
the Mid-Autumn Festival which falls on the 15th day of the eighth
lunar month.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong style moon cake is still very popular in China,
the survey showed.

The bureau suggested that consumers buy moon cakes made by big
companies who produce cakes using new technology and were probably
more healthy.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Ministry of Health released a circular recently
ordering local health inspection teams to pay more attention to
the food markets leading up to the Mid-Autumn Festival and
National Day on October 1.

imprisonment after being found guilty of homicide.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was made by the Hainan Intermediate People's Court
recently.
</P>
<P>
According to court investigations, Thotsatorn-thongthak, 30,
was a professional crocodile trainer. He had been working with
Nantai Crocodile Lake World since November 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the late hours of February 23, while Thotsatorn-thongthak
was watching TV, Tewarit-kamtongdaeng, Thotsatorn-thongthak's
countryman, and also a trainer with the crocodile world, pulled
out the TV plug without Tewarit-kamtongdaeng's consent in order to
cook food in an electrical oven. The two then began to quarrel and
fights.
</P>
<P>
During the scuffle, Thotsatorn-thongthak snatched a knife and
threw it at Tewarit-kamtongdaeng. The knife cut into the right
groin artery of the latter, causing hemorrhagic shock. Tewarit-
kamtongdaeng later died in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Thotsatorn-thongthak was detained by the local police on the
same day when the tragedy took place, said local sources, adding
Thotsatorn-thongthak attended the trial with the help of a Thai
interpreter hired by the court.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Port City to Spend Heavily on Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo, a major port city in east
China's Zhejiang Province, will spend more than 20 billion yuan (
about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) on transportation over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The money will mainly be used for eight key projects, including
the upgrading of the local airport, digging of a canal, and the
construction of four expressways.
</P>
<P>
Li Kuiming, director of the Ningbo Transportation Commission,
said that both domestic and overseas investors are encouraged to
take part in the program.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, these projects are only part of the city's
endeavor to modernize its transportation sector and turn itself
into a transportation hub in the Yangtze River delta.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Discovers Superplastic Extensibility of Nanocrystalline Copper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have recently
made a major breakthrough in materials science by discovering the
superplastic extensibility of nanocrystalline copper at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ke, a scientist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),
said Monday the behavior of the metal demonstrates new
possibilities for scientific and technological advancements with
nanocrystalline materials.
</P>
<P>
A nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Nanometer science is
one of the frontiers in the world of science and it is widely
believed it will lead to a revolution in the manufacturing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Lu, 35, and his team at the Shenyang-based CAS Institute of
Metal Research synthesized a bulk nanocrystalline copper with high
purity and high density by electrodeposition.
</P>
<P>
"An extreme extensibility (elongation exceeds 5,000 percent)
without a strain hardening effect was observed when the
nanocrystalline copper specimen was rolled at room temperature,"
said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Traditional metal which usually strains or breaks when it is
processed at room temperature unless at very high temperature, and
scientists across the world are looking for a way to make metal
extensible without a strain.
</P>
<P>
In the February 25 issue of the American weekly magazine "
Science" published an essay written by Lu and his team on the
discovery.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Colombia's Cartagena Port Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday visited the Cartagena Port Society, an exporting private
enterprise, after arriving at the Rafael Nunez airport in the city.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his Colombian counterpart Andres Pastrana,
Clinton was briefed on the operations of the port enterprise and
toured its facilities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president later met 12 widows or mothers of the
military and police officers who were killed in the war against
drug trafficking, posed for a photograph with them, and reaffirmed
his support for the antidrug war in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton was accompanied by his daughter Chelsea,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and other officials during
his visit to the Cartagena Port Society.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit is designed to express solidarity with Pastrana
and his 7.5 billion-dollar anti-drug plan, to which the United
States is contributing 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts and Latin American sources said the U.S.
aid constitutes an intervention into Colombia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aid package includes the provision of 60 military
helicopters and personnel training for two special army battalions
that will protect Colombian police missions to destroy drug
plantations and laboratories in guerrilla-controlled areas in
southern Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Offensive Leaves 10 Dead in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An offensive launched by
guerrilla in Colombia on Wednesday, as a protest against the visit
to the country by U.S. President Bill Clinton, left at least 10
people dead and 17 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) said the
antidrug aid, offered by the United States to the Colombian
government, will worsen the internal armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesmen said that five civilians died during a FARC
attack against a police post and other official installations in
the village of Labateca, department of Norte de Santander,
bordering with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The 21 agents deployed in the Labateca police post repulsed the
attack from some 80 FARC rebels.
</P>
<P>
A policeman was killed during an attack of the FARC in
Santander de Quilichao, in Colombia's southern department of El
Cauca.
</P>
<P>
A girl died in the crossfire between soldiers and FARC rebels
in the La Uvita village, department of Boyaca, while three
civilians were killed during rebel actions in Narino, department
of Antioquia, in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The police said that other rebel attacks, some of them from the
National Liberation Army (ELN), occurred in the departments of
Valle, El Cauca, Narino, Arauca, Cundinamarca, Boyaca, Antioquia
and Magdalena.
</P>
<P>
The FARC are the biggest rebel group in Colombia, and the ELN
the second.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at Cartagena Wednesday, in the middle of
stringent security measures, for a nine-hour visit in which he
will meet with Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton retinue include the U.S. antidrug chief Barry
McCaffrey, Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, and legislators of the Democrat and Republican
parties.
</P>
<P>
The United States pledged 1.3 billion U.S. dollars as its
contribution to the Plan Colombia, which includes measures for
development and peace in the South American country.

<HEADLINE> Plan Colombia Implementation Worries Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government said
Wednesday that the so-called Plan Colombia has caused the concern
of the countries in the region because of the possibility that the
Colombian internal armed conflict and drug trafficking will
overflow the borders.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said in
statements quoted by the press Wednesday that the implementation
of the Plan Colombia anti-drug project "is a very serious fact."
</P>
<P>
The United States approved as part of that project assistance
worth 1.3 billion U.S. dollars for Colombia and the deployment of
500 U.S. soldiers and dozens of helicopters for the war against
drugs in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian guerrillas say that the so-called Plan Colombia
to combat drug trafficking will worsen the armed conflict in that
country.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian foreign minister said that the Plan Colombia
causes the concern of the  region and will be examined during the
summit of 12 South American presidents to be held Thursday in the
Brazilian capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is important that Colombian President Andres
Pastrana will explain during the meeting the range of the Plan
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said he is afraid that the intensification of the war
against the guerrillas and drug trafficking will displace the coca
cultivation to the neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Congo's Gesture to Allow U.N. Access Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
said Wednesday that it welcomed the statements by the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) to facilitate the access and
deployment of U.N. peacekeeping troops in that country.
</P>
<P>
The council said this in a presidential statement following a
briefing by General Abubakar of Algeria, who is a special envoy of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar visited the area last week and met with DRC President
Laurent Kabila. He stressed to him the importance of giving "real
and complete" freedom of movement to the U.N. Mission in DRC,
known as MONUC, and permitting the deployment of armed U.N. troops
to several locations in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the DRC government to participate in inter-Congolese
dialogue to stop all hostilities and maintain a cease-fire there.
</P>
<P>
The DRC then relaxed some restrictions on MONUC's freedom of
movement and showed willingness to allow some U.N. troops to be
deployed in the areas including Kisangani, said Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the concessions are "only part of a package
of measures" requested.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its strong support for continued
mediation by President Chiluba of Zambia and said it "looked
forward to continued consultations, including with all Lusaka
signatories, on the need to implement the Lusaka Agreement", the
presidential statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace process started in 1999 to end the two-year
civil war which has claimed 1.7 million lives.
</P>
<P>
The council decided in February to send 500 cease-fire
observers to the DRC and 5,500 troops to protect them, but the
plan had been put on hold as Kinshasa barred them from entering
the area under the government control.

<TEXT>
<P>
Of these hectares, some 33,200 hectares were crops, 28,000
hectares were forestland and the remaining was described as brush
and pastureland, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
at a press briefing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 100 forest fires were reported in various
parts of Greece, but Reppas said that all the fires were under
control.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fires to both the high temperatures and
arsons.
</P>
<P>
So far, 31 people have been arrested on suspicion of starting
fires around Greece.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least 14 people, including three pilots, have
lost their lives in the fires and two firefighting planes have
crashed in efforts to stamp out the fires.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that there is an increased risk of
extensive floods in the winter as a result of the summer fires
which ravaged many regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government Wednesday decided to implement a series of
measures in aid of citizens who suffered the consequences of the
forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The measures included immediate financial aid to those affected,
compensation to farmers for crops destroyed, the creation of
settlements for those whose homes were damaged or destroyed and
for the reforestation of the burnt areas.

"To enhance international cooperation, it is essential to
observe the principle of respecting each other and treating each
other as equals. All countries, irrespective of their sizes,
wealth and strength, are equal members of the international
community," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it is important to follow the principle of
mutual benefit and common development in trying to enhance
international cooperation in the economic field, the Chinese
leader said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that without progress in the developing countries,
the developed countries can hardly maintain a lasting prosperity,
Li called on the developed countries to reduce the debt burden of
the developing countries and provide them with market access,
technological transfer and capital so as to contribute to the
common prosperity of mankind. In addition, Li said that to enhance
international cooperation, it is essential to respect all peoples'
sacred right to independently choose their road of development.
</P>
<P>
Given that the human society is a diverse and colorful one and
that countries differ in the development level and social system,
he said, it is only proper for the people of any given country to
decide on their own road to development in the light of their own
national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it is also necessary to effectively safeguard the role
and authority of the United Nations and its Security Council in
order to enhance international cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No country or group of countries should be allowed to place
itself above the U.N. or do whatever it likes," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the "most fundamental thing to do" for enhancing
international cooperation is to establish a just and equitable new
international political and economic order of peace and stability,
he said.
</P>
<P>
About 150 parliamentary leaders from more than 140 countries
are attending the conference, which is scheduled to run through
Friday, the first of its kind in the 111-year history of the IPU.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Cut Personal Taxes Within 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Belgian officials said
Wednesday that the government is due to agree to a radical
personal tax-cut package that could see an overall tax bill
reduction of more than 130 billion Belgian francs (2.88 billion U.
S. dollars) within three years.
</P>
<P>
The new tax plan, proposed by Belgian Finance Minister Didier
Reynders, was presented to key cabinet members Tuesday and will be
put to the full cabinet Friday for approval.
</P>
<P>
Among the new tax measures announced is an increased tax
allowance for each member of a married couple, bringing the
threshold below which no tax is paid to 213,000 Belgian francs per
person every year. The measure will lift almost 2 million couples
out of the tax net.
</P>
<P>
The new plan provides that a whole section of employed people
earning between 150,000 Belgian francs and 500,000 Belgian francs
of taxable income will receive a tax credit worth 25,000 Belgian
francs.
</P>
<P>
And people on low incomes paying less than 25,000 Belgian
francs a year in tax will receive a rebate from the Treasury.
Overall, about 2.5 million taxpayers will benefit from this
measure.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed plan, changes to tax bands alone are
likely to cost the country over 130 billion Belgian francs. All
the proposed measures will come into force at the earliest in 2003,
covering income in the fiscal year 2002.
</P>
<P>
In a study published Wednesday about the proposed tax reform,
the finance minister said the growing integration of European
economies forces Belgium to pay attention to the changes in the
tax systems of its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Reynders said in the study that the increasing consistency
between the tax policies of other western European countries "
implies that out tax handicap is destined to grow if we don't take
ambitious measures in the current legislature."
</P>
<P>
Belgium's income taxes and special taxes together currently
represent 46 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), compared
to a European average of 41.5 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is one of Europe's most highly taxed nations. Its
residents pay about 450 billion Belgian francs (10 billion U.S.
dollars more to the government than their neighbors every year.
The proposed tax reforms, if agreed by the government on September
1, would cut that excess in half.

<HEADLINE> New Offshore Oil Well Drilled in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Angola's state-owned petroleum
company Sonangol and the French operator in the country's offshore
oil field Elf announced here on Thursday that they had drilled the
10th offshore oilwell in their operating zone Block 17.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued by the Society of Fuel of Angola
(Sonangol), the newly-sunk well, denominated as "Perpetual-1", was
drilled some 795 meters below the sea surface.
</P>
<P>
The well, located in the extreme eastern area of the Block 17,
whose operator is Elf, produces during the trial production some 8,
740 barrels of oil per day with a density of 20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
This discovery followed the successful exploration in the oil-
abundant Block 17, which has found nine oil wells.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second-largest oil-producing country in the
African continent, with a daily oil output of 750,000 barrels. The
Angolan government has divided the offshore oil fields into
several blocks and the foreign oil companies have to bid against
each other for the authority of exploring and operating in the
blocks.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Registers Record High Voter Turnout for General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar Electoral
Commission (ZEC) has registered record-high eligible voters for
the forthcoming general elections to be held on October 29 this
year, media here reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ZEC chairman Abdul Jumbe said in Zanzibar on Wednesday
night that a total of 446,727 eligible voters, or 98.2 percent of
the targeted 455,145 voters, had been recorded during the voter
registration exercise which ended ten days ago.
</P>
<P>
The big registration turnout has gone up by a large margin from
348,934 voters registered in the first multi-party elections held
in 1995, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But with its own government and
parliament, it is a semi-autonomous region in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It will go to polls simultaneously with the mainland in the
second multi-party elections this year, choosing its own president
as well as a new leader of the Union government.
</P>
<P>
The Isles' presidential race this year will involve the ruling
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) candidate Amani Karume and the
opposition Civic United Front (CUF) candidate Seif Hamad, who is
making his second attempt.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under the incumbent president Salmin Amour,
claimed a narrow victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but
the CUF questioned the result and has been seeking a revenge.

<HEADLINE> Racism to Continue: U.S. Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Racism will continually
reinvent itself and activists will have to generate creative ways
to address discrimination, the United States (U.S.) academic
professor Patricia Williams said at South Africa's first national
racism conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Drawing from the writings of U.S. civil rights leader Martin
Luther King, Williams, who teaches law at Columbia University in
New York and is invited to address the conference by the South
African Human Rights Commission, said civil rights is an "eternal
moral issue".
</P>
<P>
"Human rights work is never a finished product. We have so much
yet to accomplish. To many of us the world seems more fragmented
and prejudice will continue," she said.
</P>
<P>
Williams said she can not provide solutions to racism in South
Africa, but could offer her observations as a black U.S. rights
activist.
</P>
<P>
"I am here as a descendent of slaves sold for an undetermined
amount," she said, adding slaves were bought and sold, making them
commodities, but human life should never be reduced to a monetary
value.
</P>
<P>
Despite the struggle and gains for civil liberty, people of
color are still discriminated against in the U.S., Williams noted.
</P>
<P>
The professor further said the battle to uproot racism requires
the ongoing formation of imaginative coalitions.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Sugar Shortage to Last Another 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The current sugar shortage will
persist for the next six months due to sharp drops in sugarcane
output and domestic sugar production, the Kenyan government has
announced.
</P>
<P>
Consumers in Nairobi scrambled for the limited sugar supply at
supermarkets on Thursday as the price became a little bit cheaper,
Kenya's leading newspaper Daily Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average price of sugar shot up from 43 shillings (0.57 U.S.
dollar) per kilogram in early August to around 60 shillings (0.79
dollar) now, an increase of 40 percent, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, Agriculture Minister Chris Obure said that the
government had not considered lowering tariffs to allow massive
sugar imports, adding that the issue would be handled carefully to
protect the local industry.
</P>
<P>
"If the duty is reduced, the sugar industry, which is beginning
to show some signs of improvement, will collapse," Obure said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister admitted that the sugar factories in
Kenya can not meet the market demand as they are operating below
capacity due to the shortfall of cane.
</P>
<P>
The production of the two major sugar firms have dropped by
more than half because there is no cane to crush, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of sugarcane occurred early this year due to a
severe drought in the country.

UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Najma Heptulla, council
president of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the president
of the Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments,
Wednesday pledged to fulfill the ideals enshrined in the U.N.
Charters.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the conference, Najma
Heptulla said the ideals are to achieve international peace and
security, democracy and respect for human rights without
compromising the sovereign equality and without interfering in the
internal affairs of member states and allowing each country to
choose its own path of development.
</P>
<P>
The great challenges at the dawn of this millennium is to
bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, between those with
access to new technologies and wealth and those without it, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
At this critical juncture, the United Nations can also play a
pivotal role in resolving these issues, and it is the most
important inter-governmental organization and has an irreplaceable
role in international affairs, the president said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
ROME, August 30 (Xinhua) -- American Film star Clint Eastwood
opened the 57th Venice Film Festival Wednesday evening by
accepting a Golden Lion to honor his career achievement, but the
festival may finally mark a renaissance of cinema in the land that
gave him his first big break, the Italian movie folk hope.
</P>
<P>
All the initial attention was on Eastwood as he accepted Italy'
s premier movie award from another Hollywood icon, Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
"I've always been very proud of the fact I started my career
here, Eastwood said to the Italian news agency Ansa on arrival at
Venice's Lido island, where his latest hit "Space Cowboys" will
kick off proceedings.
</P>
<P>
In the film, Eastwood's character finally fulfills his dream of
floating in space and looks down at the Earth -- to see the heel
of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most eagerly awaited is Guido Chiesa's "Partigiano
Johnny," a Resistance story from the famous novel of the same name
by Beppe Fenoglio.
</P>
<P>
Starring acclaimed young actor Stefano Dionisi, the film sets
out to be a "war film" challenging Hollywood versions of conflict,
director Chiesa said.
</P>
<P>
Chiesa said he had tried to play down the political and
ideological side of the story -- though they still exist -- in
order to make a grim film about personal choices at a dramatic
time in Italy's history.
</P>
<P>
About 154 films will be shown during this festival. Competing
for the top prize, the Golden Lion, at the 57th Venice Film
Festival will be 20 films from Italy, France, the United States,
and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Support to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States supports the
Colombian government in its war against drug trafficking, in its
peace process and in the reactivation of its economy, said
President Bill Clinton Wednesday in Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reaffirmed that the "Plan Colombia" is made by
Colombians for the Colombians and that "what we do is to help the
Colombians in its implementation."
</P>
<P>
The Plan Colombia, he said, is aimed at strengthening the war
against drugs, which has brought catastrophe for the United States
and for Colombia alike, to destroy this scourge, uniting the
efforts of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is why the Plan Colombia is not a military strategy, but a
commitment for peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the interests of the United States in Colombia
in the economic and political fields and in the war against drug
trafficking and the process of peace, saying that his country will
always be on Colombia's side.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived Wednesday morning in Cartagena for a nine-hour
visit, with three themes in his agenda: the Plan Colombia,
bilateral free trade and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit is designed to express solidarity with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana and his 7.5 billion-dollar
anti-drug plan, to which the United States is contributing 1.3
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts and Latin American sources said the U.S.
aid constitutes an intervention in Colombia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aid package includes the provision of 60 military
helicopters and personnel training for two special army battalions
that will protect Colombian police missions to destroy drug
plantations and laboratories in guerrilla-controlled areas in
southern Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Turkish Goodwill to Help Solve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goodwill from Turkey was a necessary prerequisite for any
progress to be achieved in the protracted Cyprus problem, said
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Reppas reiterated that the Cyprus issue remained a top priority
for Greece, which signed a joint defense agreement with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece would exercise aggressive diplomacy
within the framework of the U.N. decisions in order for the Cyprus
problem to continue to attract international interest.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Greece considered as satisfactory a
standing proposal by the United Nations and other major powers for
the creation of a bicommunal, bizonal federation representing a
single international entity on the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Reppas noted that Athens was awaiting U.N. action over the
recent incursion of Turkish occupation forces into Cyprus's cease-
fire line at the Strovilia site.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that no meetings between the premiers of Greece
and Turkey had been arranged on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly in New York next month, but the foreign ministers of the
two countries would meet in New York to discuss the latest
developments in Greek-Turkish relations and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Urges Enhancing China-U.S. Mutual Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese minister Wednesday
called for enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation between
China and the United States to promote the stable development of
their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qizheng, minister of the State Council Information Office,
said that as the new century arrives, it is a "sober obligation"
for both countries to strengthen Sino-American relationship and "
no one has any right whatsoever to undermine, frustrate or thwart
it."
</P>
<P>
Zhao, in a speech at the U.S. National Press Club here, said
that the interests of China and America will be advanced only if
both countries strive for a win-win partnership.
</P>
<P>
"Neither shall benefit if either turns against the other," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao is currently in the United States to attend "2000
Experience Chinese Culture in the United States," a large-scale
cultural exchange event in New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, St.
Louis, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister said that cultural exchanges have played
an important role in promoting mutual understanding and friendship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Though differences exist in ideologies, strategic interests
and cultural interests, our two nations have established an
effective, constructive and wide-ranging partnership that
recognizes and furthers fundamental interests in many areas," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Having recalled the history of more than 200 years of exchange
between the Chinese and American peoples, Zhao Qizheng said that
despite its ups and downs, and some contentious and continuing
issues, the direction of Sino-American relationship is to be
increasingly interconnected, increasingly cooperative, and
increasingly friendly.
</P>
<P>
"There is no single reason why our two countries should not
come together and work together," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said the great majority of the Chinese people back
President Jiang Zemin's stance that China and the United States
should enhance mutual understanding, broaden common ground,
develop cooperation and build a future together.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that with efforts made by both
sides, the 21st century, as U.S. President Clinton has said, will
witness the blossoming of Sino-American cooperation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
James Sasser, former U.S. ambassador to China, told reporters
that Minister Zhao's speech is "very productive" and "powerful,"
indicating China's willingness to developing good relationship
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"He made a real contribution to the better understanding on the
part of the media and the American people generally of the history
of relations between the two countries," Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said he is "optimistic" about the long-term
development of U.S.-China relations, since there is a will on both
sides to fashion even more cordial ties based on mutual respect
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Kapp, president of the United States-China Business
Council, who also attended the meeting, described Minister Zhao's
remarks as "extremely exciting, encouraging and attractive."
</P>
<P>
He praised Zhao for putting out a "broad introduction" of China
's culture to the American public.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and American governments have to learn how to
communicate with each other, and Zhao has taken a very encouraging
step towards this end, he added.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A wave of profit-taking in
leading blue chip stocks dragged the Dow Jones industrial average
lower Wednesday even as shares of brokerage companies surged.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow index fell 112.09 at 11,103.01
points, extending its loss of 37.74 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite rose
21.64 at 4,103.81 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 7.25 at
1,502.59.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as investors sold stocks of some big
companies including IBM and General Electric to lock in profits.
These types of securities gained in the previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
Financial services stocks rose after Credit Suisse First Boston
said that it was acquiring Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. for
11.5 billion U.S. dollars. The gains did not stop the falling of
the Dow index.
</P>
<P>
A report on slowing U.S. economic activities did not help the
blue chip index neither. The Conference Board said in a survey
that the Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined
by 0.1 percent in July, indicating a moderation in the momentum of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
In the tech sector, Amazon.com led the Nasdaq's advance. The
Internet company rose sharply following bullish comments from a
Goldman Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 2.98 at 670.46. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 0.74 at 934.22 and the Russell 2000 index rose
2.70 at 532.33.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,427 up, 1,420 down and 516
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 813.26 million shares from 783.37
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Makes Strong Protest Against U.S. Over Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuba Wednesday made a
strong protest against the United States for denying the entry
visa to the president of its National Assembly and the rest of the
members of the delegation to attend the Conference of Presiding
Officers of National Parliaments.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the conference held at the Headquarters of
the United Nations in New York from August 30 to September 1, the
Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations expressed its
absolute disagreement with the excuses put forward by the United
States for denying the entry visa.
</P>
<P>
According to the mission, the United States used the unusual
excuse that the conference is "a private meeting which is not
covered by the Agreement regarding the Headquarters of the United
Nations" to deny the visa.
</P>
<P>
The mission expressed to the host country's authorities the
special importance placed by Cuba and all Member States on the
holding of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The mission recalled the United States the well-known
background for convening the conference which is organized jointly
by the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union in
accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The mission expressed the hope that the principles and purposes
that inspire the Conference of Presiding Officers of National
Parliaments and the Millennium Summit to be held from September 6
to 8 prevail and that the authorities of the host country observe
their international obligations, including those established by
the letter and spirit of the Agreement between the United Nations
and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is aimed to express support for
international cooperation and to enshrine a commitment at the
highest level by parliaments to work much more closely with the U.
N. system and other major international negotiating fora both
nationally and globally through their world organization, the
Inter-Parliamentary Union.
